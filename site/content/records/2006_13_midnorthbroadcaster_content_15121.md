The Mid North Knowledge Partnership was launched last week at the unicorn Brewery Cellars in Burra.  It comprises contributions from Flinders University, The University of SA, Yorke and Mid North Regional Development Australia (RDA) and the Goyder and Clare & Gilbert Valley Councils.  The aim is to promote opportunities for research, knowledge transfer, student placements, international student researcher and student exchange.  It was intended that Burra become a learning hub.  Working from Burra with wife Doris Carson, Uni SA and Heidi Hodge, Flinders University Professor Carson said establishing a learning hub in Burra would be a boost for the region.  Initial projects include â€˜Mid North Demographic Destinies: research examining the future populations of settlements across the regions.  In tourism research will examine the capacity of local businesses to adapt to changing market conditions.  There is an International Exchange Agreement with the University of Applied Sciences, Krems, Austria.  The Mid North Knowledge Library will be a physical and electronic collection of publications and reports about the region.  A Student Placement Database will match university courses for students and Mid North organisations prepared to host students.  Mid North Directions will be a series of seminars bringing leading academics and researchers to the region to present public seminars on a range of topics.
