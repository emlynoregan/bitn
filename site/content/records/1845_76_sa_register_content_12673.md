Burra Institute

The second AGM was held on Friday 30 September Mr Morris Marks took the chair and Secretary Rev. Ibbetson read the report.  The average attendance of boys for instruction was 15.  There were 153 members, comprising 20 life members, 5 ten-year members and 128 ordinary members and of these 43 have joined in the last year.  There are 470 books in the library and £70 has been sent to England to purchase more.  The average attendance in the reading room has been 93 per month.  The accounts show a balance in hand of £52-3-0, but as yet the Institute is not self-supporting.  Members’ subscriptions pay only the costs of lighting and heating.  Elected were: Trustees, Mr Elphick & Dr Maurau (replacing Rev. T. Wright and Rev. T. Hillman); and for the committee Messrs J.A. Bruce, Andrew Thomas, Captain Bryant, William Batchelor & William Dale, J. Lynne & J.R. Stephens as auditors and N. Oldham as Treasurer.  A Thomas was appointed Secretary with Mr Marks acting pro tem.  A claim for £7 travelling expenses to Burra was approved for the librarian.  A motion condemning the holding of a bazaar in the reading room as a violation of Institute Rules was put and lost.
