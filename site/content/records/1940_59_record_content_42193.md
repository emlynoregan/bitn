Obituary.  Mrs Mary Seigert died at her home on Saturday 2 July aged 79.  She was born at Burra 19 December 1869.  Her parents resided at Outalpa Station.  In 1877 her father, the late Charles McDonald purchased a farm known as Cartapo near Hallett and she lived there till her marriage to Daniel August Seigert in July 1894 and then lived in Hallett till her death.  Her husband died in May 1933.  She was keenly interested in the church and Red Cross until an accident 3 years ago prevented further active involvement.  She is survived by two sons and three daughters, all of Hallett.  There are six grandchildren.  [Born Mary MacDonald 26 December 1869 Kooringa.]
