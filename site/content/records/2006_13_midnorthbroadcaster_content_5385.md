The Closing of Country Hospitals

Can the report in the Northern Argus of 7 May 2008 possibly be true?  Are 25 country hospitals to be axed? If so, who is the faceless architect of this scheme?  A properly informed rethink of this plan is urgently needed before it is set in concrete.  The country hospital is a vital part of the fabric of a town.  They have been so through good years and bad.  In an outbreak of disease or an epidemic the local level is best at handling it.  The presence of a hospital does much to influence decisions to relocate to a country town.  The city hospital system is overloaded, so why increase pressure on it by bringing in country people who could be treated locally?  Why destroy a system that works?  The proposal would increase reliance on the very expensive helicopter retrieval service.  The Burra Hospital is on the list of proposed closures.  It serves a town with an enormous amount of heavy traffic passing through and accidents are not unusual.  There is an increase in wind farm activity and mining, with attendant possible accidents.  It lies west of a vast area of sparsely populated pastoral land where people are exposed to hazardous situations and have often been saved by the presence of a local hospital.  The Government wastes its money on dumb non-essential staff.  Essentials must come first and country hospitals are essential.  They and their allied services must be retained.
