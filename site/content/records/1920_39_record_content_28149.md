Hanson Methodist Hall

Last Saturday even the rain could not keep locals away from gathering for the opening ceremony of the new hall.  Families of long association represented included the Dixons, Rogers, Humphreys, Turners and Blunts.  The rain held off for the open-air ceremony, though a thick fog enveloped the country.  Rev. W.O. Harris was assisted by Rev. E. Lawson of Kooringa and Miss Avis Neill played the organ.  The building cost £1,002-0-4, though donated stone, sand and labour was worth an additional £300.  The outstanding debt is £264-18-5.  The Methodist Loan Fund lent £150 to be repaid in yearly instalments of £30.  Mr James H. Rogers, Treasurer of the Trust, declared the building open.  The building is of stone and the interior is 40ft x 25ft and it is furnished with strong comfortable chairs.  There is also a well-equipped kitchen 25ft x 10ft and the building is lit with electricity.  High tea at 5 p.m. of turkey, ham, beef, lamb and salads with a variety of sweets followed.
