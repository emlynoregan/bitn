Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This was the first annual report, though actually only for five months as it was a new appointment.

In general the sanitary conditions in town were satisfactory, due mainly to the activities of the Inspector.  The main problem in the period was an influenza outbreak in October and November of 1899.

In the six months to 31 December 1899 there were 22 deaths.  Of these 8 were in the hospital, 4 the result of accident and 10 elsewhere.

The town population is estimated at 1,700-1,800, there having been no census for some time.

Recommendations:

A new slaughterhouse with sales of meat restricted to inspected meat.

A new rubbish depot as material from the present one enters the creek and thence the town.  ‘Excrete which is deposited there should be better disposed of.’

The water service needs more supervision.  He was most concerned about the problem of dead end pipes.
