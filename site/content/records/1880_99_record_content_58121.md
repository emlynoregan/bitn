Obituary & Inquest.  Frederick Bagg, a farmer residing just over the boundary of the Hundred of Kooringa, shot himself at about 6 a.m. last Thursday 12 September.  [Died 12 September aged 48.]

Dr Brummitt was sent for and arrived to find him on a sofa in a dying state.  He had lived in the area for many years and two months ago decided to build a new 7-roomed house about ½ mile from his old residence.  A tender by Pearce, Launder & Co. was accepted for c. £400.  The money was in the bank and work was started.  About three weeks ago he suddenly became possessed of the idea he would need the money for other things and tried to stop the work.  The contractors said it was too far advanced to stop.  Although his subsequent behaviour was sometimes strange, no one supposed he was of a mind to harm himself.  Wednesday night passed as usual and on Thursday morning he rose at 6 a.m., dressed, went into the adjoining room and shot himself.

Dr Brummitt described the scene on his arrival and the nature of the wound.  He had been consulted once about two or three weeks earlier, but had gained the impression that the concern over the building costs was a passing annoyance rather than a serious difficulty.  He had no reason to think the deceased was likely to commit suicide.

Sidney Benham, police trooper, reported going out when advised by Walter Bagg that his father had shot himself.  He produced the gun and had informed the coroner of the death.

John Casey, employed by the deceased, said when he arrived on the scene the deceased was fully conscious and said he had shot himself ‘to put myself out of misery’.  Casey said he had never heard deceased express any thoughts of that sort before.  He had worked there about one month.
