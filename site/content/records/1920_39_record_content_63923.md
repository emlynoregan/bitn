Redruth Methodist Church

For some time there has been a tentative scheme to improve the buildings and enhance the appearance of the church property.  Some time ago the Trustees decided to have the old church wall and the old Sunday school room removed.  This has now been done.  The old building was sold and the wall removed by men of the church.  Considerable grading and filling has since been done and the ground now looks much better.  Thanks are extended to Mr R. Fairchild for giving so freely of his time and also to Mr J.G. Sara.
