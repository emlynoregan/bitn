Football.  29 out of 50 members attended the football dinner.

The Burra Football Club had a very successful dinner to round off the successful season.  The usual speeches etc. are reported.  The season saw 5 matches played, of which 2 were won, 2 were drawn in their favour* and 1 was lost.

[*At this stage points were not being counted so the drawn games in their favour means the two teams had the same number of goals, but Burra had scored more behinds.]
