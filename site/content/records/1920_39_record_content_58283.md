Motor Show at Burra

On Friday 11 October General Motors Holdens sponsored a grand parade of vehicles followed by parking in Market Square to display the firm’s up-to-date range of vehicles.  The value of vehicles shown was over £6,000.  The Mayor welcomed the visitors to the town.  The firm’s factory at Woodville covers 50 acres.  The vehicles included Buicks, Chevrolets, Vauxhalls, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs and trucks.  [Details in c. ⅔ columns.]
