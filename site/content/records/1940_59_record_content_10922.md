Burra Red Cross Executive Committee held its first AGM.  In the year there had been a Baby Competition, a Children’s Frolic and Dance and a visit from the Governor and Lady Barclay-Harvey.  Their quota of fund raising had been £350 and the three Burra units had raised £589-0-9.  The RSL Wives Group had been registered in January.  A request to secure a store for Red Cross goods resulted in Miss Scovell offering the use of a suitable building.  Officers elected: Chair, Mrs T.E. Ashton, Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Steele, Hawker and F. Sara; Treasurer, Mr S.C. Genders and Assistant Treasurer, Mrs S.C. Genders.
