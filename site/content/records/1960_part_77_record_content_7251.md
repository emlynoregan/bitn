The Mayor expressed his concern of the way that he and other Councillors in business have been penalised for doing ‘something for nothing’ in the Council.  He had been in business in Burra for 30 years and in Council for 15.  He expressed bitterness at the attitude of the people concerned, but whatever he did in Council would not affect him in the future as he was retiring from his Market Square business on 30 June.  He expressed concern at the lack of interest in Council elections.  On numerous occasions ratepayers had not even arranged to see that their ward was represented.  He expressed his thanks to the retiring Councillors.

[There were apparently many questions posed and answered, but not reported in the paper.]

Mr H.J.B. Jennison moved the vote of thanks to the Mayor, Mayoress and Councillors and said it was a thankless job.
