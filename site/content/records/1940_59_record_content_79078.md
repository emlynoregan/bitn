Lance Fiebig and the 1957 Round Australia Mobilgas Trial

Driving Car No. 102, a 1957 Holden, Lance Fiebig of Burra and Brian Holness of Gawler did very well.  They were the first Holden in the whole trial, second South Australian entry, third in vehicles over 2,000 cc and tenth in the trial overall.  The only damage throughout the trial was a small hole in the petrol tank and slight damage to the nearside duco.
