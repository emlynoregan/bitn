Burra Hospital AGM.  The State Government granted $120,000 for twelve long stay beds at the hospital one week before the end of the financial year.  Of course this money could not be spent and the beds had to be funded by cutting other services.

Chairman John Brak reported on the grading of the casualty department and the appointment of Mrs Lesley Philips as Executive Officer â€“ Director of Nursing and in sharing of resources with the Clare Hospital.

Harry Quinn, board member for 33 years and Chairman for 10, retired from his position.

Dick Secomb retired after five years on the board.

Average number of employees has decreased from 30.36 in 1991-92 to 21.8 in 1994-95.  The arrival of the new doctor, Dr Simpson, has been eagerly awaited.  He started next Monday.
