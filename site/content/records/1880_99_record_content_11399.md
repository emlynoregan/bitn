Burra Town Council, 10 December.

The Town Clerk’s salary was fixed at £115 and he was relieved of the outdoor work of collecting rates.  The Inspector’s salary was set at £100 and the scavenger at the previous wages.

The Hydraulic Department replied that the Waterworks could be done for the estimated costs.  New pumps and an engine were included.  It would not be advisable to lay on water from the present system without fixing meters to the Aberdeen troughs.

Cr Drew moved that the Government’s offer of 26 July 1883 be accepted, using the Council shaft and not providing for the Locomotive Department.  Cr Duff 2nd.

Cr Sampson amended it to stand over for a fortnight.  Cr Tiver was unprepared to vote.  Cr Sampson thought the promises to ratepayers had not been fulfilled.  Amendment carried.
