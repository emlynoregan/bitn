The Holidays.

The Primitive Methodist Sunday School picnic was held at Princess Royal under the beautiful gums near the woolshed.  Some indulged in crayfishing and others in rabbiting and many took advantage of the waterholes.

Bible Christian Endeavourers had a picnic on the eastern side of the creek.

Others went duck shooting at The Lagoon and in several cases some fine game was bagged.

Cricket.  Roach Bros Staff 146, Burra Corporation 7 for 113.  The Burra Band attended.

The concert in the evening drew a good attendance and they saw a good show.  During the interval a dust storm sprang up and filled the hall with dust, but rain fell and immediately cleared the air.
