Kooringa Election

On 6 March a crowd of between 200 and 300 gathered at the Burra Hotel.  Mr W.R. Mortlock was voted into the chair and he outlined the reason for the meeting; to discuss the merits of the two candidates for the coming election.

Dr Bull said that at last their town with a population of more than 4,000 and the second largest in the colony was at last to have a candidate for itself.

Dr Bull asked what merits had Mr Kingston, judging from his speech the previous Monday.  His address amounted to little more than an echo of Mr Lang’s principles except on the question of the ballot, and on that he has no opinion at all.  Or at least not the courage to declare an opinion.  But no Burra Director, whatever superior claims he might have to Mr Kingston, will be the best member to represent our interests.

The Burra Burra Mine is a great, and astounding, and a wealthy fact, but we have no intention of allowing the Burra Directors to interfere with our duties or our interests, or to monopolise the right to represent this place and our interests.  I maintain that the Burra Directors have never consulted any other interests than their own, and they have no claim on our gratitude.  What have they done for the town?  They have a property returning 800% per annum and have let their workmen live in underground holes.  In England any comparable company would always have provided suitable housing at a reasonable rent.  They have only now set about establishing a slaughterhouse.  Remember their action at the sale of land at Redruth where they sought to obstruct working men from acquiring a little bit of freehold.  Who was present there to act on their behalf, but Mr Kingston?  I move:

‘That it is the opinion of this meeting that Mt Kingston, from his conduct in connexion with the electors and working men of the Burra, is not entitled to their support.’

Mr Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel seconded the motion and said they should maintain their rights and fear no intimidation.  They needed one who would protect the rights of the poor man as well as the rich and he believed they had found such a man in William Lang.  The motion was carried.

Mr J. Wiltshire then proposed ‘That Mr William Lang Esq., from his extensive political knowledge and ability, and also from his liberal opinions, is entitled to the support of the electors of this District.’

Seconded by J.S. Barnett and carried.  Mr Pearce, tailor, of Kooringa also spoke at length in support of Mr Lang.
