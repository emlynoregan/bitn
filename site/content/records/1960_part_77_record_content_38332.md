Fire.  A fire in the Koomooloo Station homestead on Tuesday last caused damage estimated at $12,000.  It began at about 7.45 a.m. in the domestic section of a building attached by verandah to the main homestead and occupied by Mr & Mrs Michael Avery and family.  Mr Avery was working at the woolshed drafting sheep when smoke was noticed coming from the house.  Mrs Avery tried to enter the kitchen, but was driven back by the heat.  She ran around the outside to an end entrance where Miss Davies, the governess, was called from the room.  Mr Avery tried to hose down the fire, but the pressure was inadequate and a thousand gallons tank and pump was brought by truck from a nearby paddock.  The connecting verandah was torn down to save the rest of the house.  Only a small part of the attached building was saved.  The source is unclear, but probably one of two kerosene fridges or a combustion type water heater was the origin.  Temperatures on the day were well over 100Â°F.  Sgt Orford and Constable K. Terry of Burra are preparing a report for the coroner.
