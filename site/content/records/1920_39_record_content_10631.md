Cr Hammond wanted the Council to improve drainage in Commercial St to the corner of Chapel St.

The Mayor said even if this was done the notice preventing the garages from discharging water into the street would stand.

The Town Clerk said he understood that two of the garages could make arrangements to run water into the Bank of Australasiaâ€™s underground drain.  After further discussion the matter dropped.
