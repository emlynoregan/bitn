W.H. Hardy writes a letter on taxation, pointing out that indirect taxation falls disproportionately on the poor.  He argues against both property and income tax in favour of a land tax.  He says that 3d in the £ on unimproved value of land exempting the price first paid to the Crown would stop speculation and choke monopoly [as well as yielding the required revenue].
