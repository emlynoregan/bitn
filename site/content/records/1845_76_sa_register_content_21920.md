Rev. L.W. Stanton gave another of his popular entertainments assisted by Mrs Smith of Redruth, Misses Young, K. Stanton, Drew and Dawson.  The object was to raise funds for the aid of the librarian Mr Cross who has been seriously ill and has not yet recovered.

[The only people of this name to die in Burra were Francis Cross who died 9 January 1872 aged 61 and his wife Sarah who died 13 June 1876 aged 69.  Their BISA entry says Francis was a labourer and tailor, with no  mention of the librarianâ€™s job, but this could well have been something he turned to as his health failed.]
