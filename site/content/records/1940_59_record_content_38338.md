Burra Town Council, 2 August

Burra & District War Memorial Committee requested that Council raise the £400 loan as approved by ratepayers.  Carried.

Approval was granted for the same committee to hold a carnival in Market Square on 18 September and for the Square to be floodlit for the occasion.

The same committee asked for assurance that the Council’s £400 in bonds would be available when required.  A special Finance Committee meeting will consider this.
