‘Kooringa’ writes re the Kooringa election:

The overpowering influence of the mining proprietary, backed by Paxton, has returned Kingston as a representative.  The votes are two to one in favour of the Director.

‘Every description of influence and means have been used by the successful candidate to achieve his return; money has been lavished in profusion; power ahs been exercised where it was possible to bring it to bear; timidation has been held as a rod over the weak, and promises extraordinry. Lawn sleves mermydons in office, discarded servants, and oppressed workers, to ensure the return of the director.’

[But the writer asserts that the spirit of opposition has been established and will in time triumph.]

‘Early on the morn of this day, one of cheering brightness, the banners of Green and Blue were seen waving to the winds, which never before visited the spot.’

‘Children shouting, Bands playing, people gazing, all seemed to fancy a scene of amusement was at hand, and their expectations were met, for as early as nine Ocloc in the morning some fifty Ancient britons from the smelting works, two by two, proceeded from the paddock (the place of rendevous) to the place of polling, to record their votes for the Candedate the thought the most worthy of there support.’

One banner read ‘We fear not, We care not.’  Mildred and freedom is our wish and we defy the oppression of our employers.
