Burra Hospital Board meeting 2 June

The outside walls of the Isolation Ward are nearly up.  T.H. Woollacott is the contractor for Â£1,435.  Cr Woollacott who was appointed Town Council representative asked if it were allowed, as he was the contractor for the Isolation Ward.  The solicitor will advise.

The Maternity Wing is slowly gaining in popularity with about 16 cases this year.

Mr Warnes thought all ratepayers should have voting papers sent to them for the Board elections and not have to apply for them.
