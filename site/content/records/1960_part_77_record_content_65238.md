A New Golf Course is taking shape in the racecourse area.  The land was offered to the Burra Burra DC by the Burra Sports Syndicate and the Council has acquired the adjoining land known as Elders and the Quarry Paddocks to develop a sports and recreation ground.  The Golf Club enlisted the aid of Murray Crafter of Glenelg Golf Club to design a new gold course.  His plans were accepted in November 1972.  Work began in December on the north face of Quarry Hill.  Putting surfaces were laid in the new positions at a working bee on 25 February except for three still under preparation.  Thanks go to Lyell Quinn of Roche Bros. for grading Quarry Hill and carting material etc., to the DC for making earth-moving equipment available, to Bill Byles & Gino Santella for driving the machinery and to Ron Moreland for ensuring its availability when required.  Thanks also go to Ivan Hirschausen for the use of equipment and to Mike & Ray Wardle for time and equipment as well as to club members generally.
