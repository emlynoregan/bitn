Christmas Employment Drive.  A public meeting was held at the Council Chamber on Monday.  About 20 gentlemen were present including the present Councillors plus Messrs Kellaway and Lott.  The Government asked for returns showing the actual state of affairs concerning unemployment.  The information in Burra was that Drew & Crewes and Walkers would employ some extra girls in the lead up to Christmas, but no men.  Mr Rosman might be able to find work for one or two [at Thomas’s Mill].  Cr Jennison was unable to help this year.  Rev. D. Redding had a couple of pounds worth of work at the rectory.  Cr Bevan thought North Ward could do something with its credit balance of £66.  Promises of a little work were needed from many.

[While a number of small offers were made no very definite plan of action seems to have been resolved upon.]
