Kooringa News, 22 January

Obituaries.  Two men have been found dead, having succumbed to the extreme heat north of here.  One was found 15 miles beyond Parnaroo and was last seen alive on Monday week, when the driver of Dawson’s mail cart overtook the deceased and another man named Wall, on the road.  Wall asked for a ride as he was weary and had some distance to travel.  Deceased did not want a ride, as he was headed for Waite’s Station some six miles off the road.  When left he seemed all right, but has since been found dead near the same place.

The other body was found between Parnaroo and Stewarts, but there are no other details except that he was a young man who was in Kooringa about three weeks ago.

[Neither of these deaths seems to be registered judging from SA Deaths CD, but see the SA Register 31 January 1862 for more on one of them.]

I am informed that arrangements are being made to present a handsome testimonial to Corporal Rollison, who has lately been removed from here to Wellington.  I am sure many will join in because he has rendered active and efficient service as a trooper while here and has earned the respect and good will of all who have come to know him.
