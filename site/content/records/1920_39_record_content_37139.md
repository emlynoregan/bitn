Burra Mine

H.S. Cornelius, Inspector of Mines and Quarries reports on assay results of samples sent to Adelaide.

No. 1 from W. Sellars: Azurite 46.4%.

No. 2 from W. Bowen: Azurite and sandstone 23.9%.

No. 3 from G. Thomas: Malachite Cuprite 34.9%.

No. 4 of decomposed copper ore in bags 65.2%.

The results suggest that quarrying the banks would be profitable if sufficient tonnage is obtained.  It would not be safe to work the banks by undercutting.
