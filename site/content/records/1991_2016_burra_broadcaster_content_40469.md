At the end of the service the church symbols were carried out and Janet Price closed the door for the last time.

The church began in 1891.  Among the many who served the church in 124 years, mention was especially made of Sunday School Superintendent Ron Dewhirst and Mrs Heather Affolter, who was organist for 57 years – to be succeeded by Janet Price.  Meryl White was former President of the Ladies’ Guild and Molly Drew was a wonderful organiser and craft person.  Jan Trengove delivered the final sermon.
