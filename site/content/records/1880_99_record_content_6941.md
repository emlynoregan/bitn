Redruth Court, 6 May

William Barnes	selling bad fish	£2

Joseph Boundy & William Hughes were fine £5 each, of which £2 from each to go to the complainant.  They assaulted Mr Callaway, landlord of the Pig and Whistle Hotel, on 8 May.  They had arrived at 10.30 p.m. in the company of an Aboriginal for whom the landlord had refused to draw a drink, which led to a fight.
