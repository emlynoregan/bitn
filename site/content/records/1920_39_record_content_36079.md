Burra Town Council, 17 November

The Municipal Assoc. has advised that there is no need for Cr Woollacott to resign from Council in order to contest the Mayoralty even though his term does not expire for 12 months.  If Cr Woollacott is elected Mayor there will have to be an extraordinary election to fill the vacancy in North Ward.

It was decided not to get the Mayorâ€™s Report printed this year.

Cr Woollacott withdrew his resignation as it had not been accepted and had been tendered under the misapprehension that it was necessary before he could nominate for the Mayoralty.

The Chairman of the Fire Brigade board wrote saying that the annual Government grant had been reduced and asking for any suggestions for economy.

T.H. Woollacott was granted permission to build a stone house in Bridge St.

W. Voumard was appointed acting pound-keeper in the absence of the pound-keeper.
