A car and a water truck collided in dusty conditions on Friday about 12.30 p.m. just east of ‘The Gums’ Station on the Bower Road about half a mile from the Burra-Morgan Road.  The truck was owned by D. &. K. Launer and driven by Dennis Semmler.  The car was driven by Dudley Albert Launer.  There were three other passengers in the car and the four occupants were returning from Robertstown, having attended their uncle’s funeral there.  After the collision the driver of the truck went to ‘The Gums’ homestead and Dr G. Miller, Burra police and ambulance were summoned.  Three occupants of the car were killed instantly and John Lawrence Sachse (22) was found to be dead on arrival at Burra Hospital.  The other victims were:

Dudley Albert Launer (38) employed by the Robertstown Council and his brother

Kingsley Norman Launer (24) an earth moving contractor and their cousin

Clarence Norman Launer (40) a share farmer.

All sporting fixtures involving Robertstown Clubs were cancelled for Saturday and a triple funeral was held on Sunday in Robertstown.  Mr Sachse’s funeral was held on Monday in Adelaide.

As a result of the above Robertstown Football Club advised that all its teams would forfeit their matches to Auburn on Saturday.  On hearing the news the Auburn committee decided to forfeit to Robertstown.  Association delegates will now have to decide on the outcome.
