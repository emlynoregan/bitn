Terowie Water Supply will have some further upgrading.  This time there is a little indication of what was done.  The first steps had evidently been to clean the railway tanks at the town and to remove silt from the Gumbowie Reservoir.  Further work will now be done to fix the fence around the dam and clean up the reservoir area.  Maintenance will be carried out on the valves in the main and the tank overflow discharge point will be modified.  Rhe mains will be cleaned and repaired and some 2,000 feet of pipe will be replaced.
