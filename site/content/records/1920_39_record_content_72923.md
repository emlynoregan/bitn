‘His interest was keen and in his great love for the rising generation particularly the young lads and especially his choir boys, he was to them not only a spiritual adviser, but a ‘big brother’ with a great love for the little fellow, and many delightful picnics, so dear to the heart of boys, has he given them.  This applies mainly to his choir boys and on these occasions lessons learnt from the ‘big brother’ will not soon be forgotten.’
