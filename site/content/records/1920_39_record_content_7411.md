The Prime Minister’s Speech is reported in about 1 column.  As the Union Jack fell to reveal the names of the fallen Pte E.C. Hammond played the Last Post.  Relatives and friends then laid wreathes and floral tributes.  Mr Crewes said it was a red letter day for Burra and this was the last act in a drama that had taken a long time to reach conclusion.  Six years before £39-10-0 had been promised for a memorial.  Nothing more was practically done till Peace Day on 19 July 1919 when £1,900 was subscribed and work was proceeded with.  Another £1,000 was raised on 6 April 1921 when the foundation stone was laid.  Additional expenses were incurred when five rather than one plate were found to be necessary – at a cost of over £40 each, for a total of £232.  It had also been decided to have a roll of honour to contain the names of all the men who had gone to war from Burra & District, which would mean another £230 to £250.  The present position was that to complete the memorial and roll they had cash and promises of £270 and needed £500.  Subscriptions of nearly £200 were then received.

The Civic Reception for the Prime Minister, who had arrived on the Tuesday evening train, was held on Wednesday at noon.  It is reported in over 1½ columns.  The Prime Minister was given a memento designed and manufactured by F. Spencer, jeweller of Burra.  It was a paperweight with a polished jarrah base surmounted by a silver and gold pedestal capped by a piece of polished malachite.

The evening speech given by the Prime Minister at the Institute was not reported in the Burra Record, as it had been in all the daily papers, but the remarks of others at the event occupy a little over 1 column.
