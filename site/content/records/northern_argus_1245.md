Paxton Square

Phase three of the Paxton Square redevelopment is under way.  The re-creation of the old manse is all but completed and the restoration of the Bible Christian Chapel is proceeding.  The original manse was pulled down many years ago*, but with the restoration of both the Bridge Terrace and the Kingston Street Rows of cottages the Lewis Board of Management felt that the next step ought to be the reconstruction of the manse for use by the caretaker and his family, who currently live in two of the cottages in the Kingston Street row.  Once the cottage is completed they will move in, freeing the two cottages for holiday rental.  The Bible Christian Chapel next door is believed to be the oldest Bible Christian Chapel in Australia and restoration is being undertaken with great care.  The original wooden roofing will be left exposed from the interior and it will be used as the booking office for the cottages and an interpretive centre for the square.  A sum of $80,000 has been borrowed by the District Council to enable the development and this loan will be repaid by the Lewis Board of Management.  Work has been authorised by the State heritage Conservation Branch.
