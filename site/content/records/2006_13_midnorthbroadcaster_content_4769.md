Jailhouse Rock is due to be staged in the last weekend of February, but Burra Regional Tourism & Business Association President Sue Ryan said this could be the tenth and last such event if ticket sales do not improve.  A lot of money was lost last year from a decrease in ticket sales.  This year the event will be moved to the Town Hall.  [Organisational details follow.]
