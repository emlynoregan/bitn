Council Amalgamation.  Public meeting at Terowie last Wednesday.  128 people attended – many of whom had also attended the Hallett meeting.

Cr Mattey said the proposed option would make the whole [Hallett] Council area one ward, represented by two Councillors.  The western option offered Hallett Council area one representative.

Cr Hill gave an overview of the Council’s deliberations.

Cr Harvey said he had asked for a referendum on the western option.

The meeting was told the western option had not been open until the last few weeks.

Jamestown, Spalding and Rocky River Councils had already reached agreement and were due to lodge documents with the Reform Board early in November and that would finish the option currently available.

Councils could be admitted later, but conditions then applying were unknown.
