Burra Hospital Building Project

A public meeting was held at the Burra Town Hall last Wednesday with F.T. Marston in the chair, as Chairman of the Hospital Board.  He reported:

On 19 May 1950 as a consequence of a report by Dr McQueen and officers of the Central Board of Health, the Board decided to investigate the possibility of repairing, renewing, or reconstructing the Hospital.

Dean W. Berry, architect, was invited to discuss proposed alterations and additions on 29 June 1950.

A committee was formed at a public meeting on 1 August 1950 to raise funds for the proposed building, on the approval of the Chief Secretary.

The plans were received 1 September 1950 from Dean W. Berry and a joint meeting was arranged with the Fund-raising Committee.

On 15 September 1950 a meeting of the Board and the Fund-raising Committee discussed Plan A, estimated to cost £73,000 and Plan B, estimated to cost £78,000.  It was decided not to launch an appeal until the Government’s assurance of a £ for £ subsidy was obtained and it was decided to get further plans and estimates from Overall & Walkley.

A joint meeting on 23 November 1950 decided to recommend Plan B.

A deputation on 2 February 1951 was advised that the Government would give a £ for £ subsidy when the need for a new building had been established to the satisfaction of the Director General of Medical Services and the Chief Secretary.

On 2 March 1951 it was disclosed that the Government was unlikely to approve a grant by way of a subsidy in excess of £30,000.  It was suggested that the modifications to Plan B outlined by Dr Rollison be approved by the Board and if not approved, it was unlikely that approval would be given to any other plan.

After completion of the modified plan the Government would give consideration to the completion of Plan B.

The amended plan was estimated by Dean W. Berry to cost £56,000.

The Medical Officers said they were not in favour of Plan B as modified, as it provided inadequate hospitalisation and would defeat the ends of the original Plan B and be less convenient that the existing buildings.  Dr Heddle agreed to interview Dr Rollison with a view to having the modifications extended to provide adequate hospitalisation.

Dr Heddle reported on 29 March 1951 that he and Dr Rollison had agreed on an acceptable plan to be submitted to the Chief Secretary.

After considerable delay and further information the Chief Secretary advised that approval was not given for the modified plan as agreed between Drs Heddle and Rollison, but was given for the £56,000 version and that £10,000 would likely be placed on the 1951-52 estimates to allow for it to be commenced.

The Board then agreed to the amended plan as approved, with the provision that when completed the whole of Plan B would then be completed.
