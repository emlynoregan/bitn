Burra Town Council, 15 October.

The Mayor was absent due to the accident to his hands.

The Town Clerk showed that all wards except West Ward were in debt and suggested the Corporation would end the year with an overdraft of c. £40.

Cr Sampson said the overdraft was due to unemployment relief work and it was good durable work which would not have to be done next year.  He hoped no other work would be needed in 1894.

Cr Walsh said the £11 overdraft in North Ward was due to relief work which had been so beneficial to the unemployed during the year.

Deputation from the Sports Committee [Of the friendly Societies?] asking for assistance in building a cycle track at the oval.

Council will visit the oval and discuss the matter with the committee.

Cr West reported that part of Mr Roger’s kerbing near Forder’s Row in Redruth had fallen down.

The engineer’s report was read and received.

Cr Harris said: ‘We had better make arrangements for another engineer to look after the outside work; everything is going to rack and ruin.’

Cr Sampson: ‘Oh, let him have a spell.’

It was resolved to get a competent man from Adelaide to assess and inspect all the Waterworks machinery.

Sending a letter of sympathy to the Mayor regretting his accident was supported by all but Cr Harris.
