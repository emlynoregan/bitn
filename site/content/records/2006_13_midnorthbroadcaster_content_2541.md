Burra Girl Guides

Sharon O’Connor & Deb Spackman have called a meeting of girls and parents for 5 February to consult with the State Commissioner Margie Bellman to decide on the future of Guides in Burra.  With only a few guides attending, they feel the time has come for a decision.  It was disappointing to prepare an activity for eight and to have only three turn up.  Guides is designed to operate in three age groups – Gumnuts, Brownies and Guides, but Burra has to run as one group.  The end of Guides in Burra would also see the sale of the Hall and others who use the hall would have to seek other accommodation.  They had been lucky to keep going for so long, when larger centres like Clare had not, but it was now a make or break time.
