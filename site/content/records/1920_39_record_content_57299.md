Redruth Methodist Sunday School held its annual Teachers’ Conference and Sunday School Rally last weekend.  Rev. W.J. Bailey, Director of the Methodist Young People’s Department, was present with Miss I.E. Brown of the Adelaide Primary and Kindergarten Department.  On Sunday Mr Bailey took the Redruth morning service and in the afternoon there was a combined rally in the Burra Institute of scholars from Farrell’s Flat, Ironmine, Hanson, Redruth and Kooringa.  This was surprisingly well attended considering the sloppy state of the roads.  The hall was nearly full, with Rev. E.G. Neil presiding aided by Rev. G.C. Hutchinson and Rev. Bailey.  In the evening Rev. Bailey preached at Kooringa where he had been first stationed 20 years ago with Rev. J.H. Nield.
