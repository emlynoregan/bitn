Redruth Court, 2 February.

R.H. Bruce v. E.A. Nankivell in a claim for £39-5-0 being the balance owing on a contract for wages, conveyance, board and lodging etc. – amended to £38-10-0.

The plaintiff had been employed by Philip Nankivell who died and he had been asked to continue to work by Miss E.A. Nankivell.  He was eventually non-suited on a technicality that he should have sued Miss Nankivell personally and not as executrix of the estate.  The SM thought that in justice the defendant should have allowed the claim to continue on its merits, but had to agree that technically she could object as she had.

Robert Fairchild v. I.J. Warnes.  Mr Bright for the plaintiff.

A case for £30 for the use and occupation of land, or in the alternative £30 damages for trespass.

This arose out of a contract for sheep agistment on the plaintiff’s land in the Hundred of Ayers.

Plaintiff:

Am owner of sections 473 & 474 in Hundred of Ayers, comprising one paddock of 180 acres.  Defendant asked the plaintiff in August 1915 what he wanted for the feed in it.  Plaintiff said 3d per head of sheep per week.  Defendant said it was too cumbersome to count sheep and offered £50 for the feed until the end of September.  Plaintiff agreed for sheep to arrive in two weeks and stay for the last two weeks of August and the whole of September.  Near the end of September Warnes agreed to remove the sheep and pay by cheque at the end of the term. A cheque for £50 was received on 8 October at a farewell to a soldier at Leighton Hall.  There was no means of getting a receipt at the time, but the sheep remained in the paddock.  Plaintiff wanted to put his own sheep in on 19 November.  Defendant said he had the use of the paddock till the end of March.  Plaintiff believed the sheep were there till 4 January.  He estimated the feed at 50 tons of self-sown hay. A low estimate of the value would be 3d per head.  The plaintiff had based his claim on 1d a head.
