First Industrial Strike in SA was held nearly 100 years ago at the Burra Mines.

[Reprint of an article by Eric Gunton in the Adelaide Advertiser.]

News of the strike reached Adelaide on 15 September 1848, along with a request that 20 policemen be sent to the mine because 300 miners had taken possession of the mine and were refusing to move even one ton of ore.

The trouble started with the decision of the SA Mining Association to dismiss the superintendent of the Mine, Mr Thomas Burr, after he had refused to resign.  The Directors went personally to the Mines to relieve him of his duties and when they arrived, Burr left for Adelaide.

The system of assay was that three samples were taken from each miner’s ore when it was cleaned and dressed.  The first was taken by the miner, the second by the superintendent and the third was sent to the directors in Adelaide.  The assay at Burra was agreed to by both parties, but the Adelaide tests were frequently at variance with the Burra tests and consequently the miners felt that they were frequently underpaid.  The directors though the miners were trying to get high rates for lower grade ores.  The directors refused to see the miners’ deputation and told them the mine might be shut down.  This alarmed the miners, since there was much ore on hand, which had to be assayed before payment could be calculated.  This resulted in their seizure of the mine by 300 miners.  Only 8 tried to work and they were paraded through the street and exposed to ridicule.

When news of the strike reached Adelaide shares in the Mining Association fell from £220 to £120 for a £5 share.  
Police Commissioner Dashwood and Inspector Tolmer instituted a conference between the disputing parties and it was resolved that the results of the assays at the mine and in Adelaide would be averaged when they exceeded 30%.  Everything was settled, though on the way home Mr Chambers, who was driving, lost control of the horses and the carriage turned over.  Later in the year Thomas Burra took the directors to court and obtained £1,500 in damages for wrongful dismissal.
