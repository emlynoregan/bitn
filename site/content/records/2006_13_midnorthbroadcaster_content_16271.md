The 2013 Monster Mine Spectacular was held on Saturday last.  It is reported as the biggest party of the year.  There was a capacity crowd.  The dance floor was filled to the music of ‘The Fabulous Five’ and ‘Fever’ who played favourites from the 60s, 70s and 80s with great energy.  The meal was outsourced to Reni Boston of Burra Fresh and there was plenty of favourable feed back.  President Chris Harris said the event was a wonderful success.  The bands marvelled at the outdoor setting and said they would love to come back again.  Craig and the SuperSound gang did a great job with the sound and the lighting and the committee were delighted with the sponsorship from local business.  The committee would welcome some younger people to their ranks.
