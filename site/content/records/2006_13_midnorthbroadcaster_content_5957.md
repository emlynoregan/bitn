Letter.  Jennifer M.T. Carter of Burra writes complimenting the paper on the previous week’s article in which it was said that the fate of Burra’s assets were being decided by ‘a majority on the Regional Council of Goyder who have no sympathy for and no understanding of, the aspirations of our historic town’. 

She calls for more public consultation and more public input.
