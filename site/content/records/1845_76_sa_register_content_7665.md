SA Goldfields.  Further reports appear of Mr Pollock purchasing some native gold and of some Germans submitting some considerable-sized specimens to Mr Giles for inspection.  Mr Levi has produced two pieces of gold from a panful of earth in the Torrens and a section there has been leased to some men for further prosecution of the search.
