BCS.  Government initiatives will slash money from the school’s budget.  The introduction of a Workcover levy will cost the school thousands.  The Government will now also claim the interest earned on the school’s savings (though exact details of that move are as yet unclear).  A section that could be affected is the updating of ITC packages.  Clarification will have to await the release of the state budget.
