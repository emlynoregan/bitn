Coles & Goodchild, Auctioneers, has changed its name on Mr Coles’ withdrawal.  He joined the firm in January 1877 and now, 3½ years later, retires.  The firm will continue as Goodchild, Austin & Co.  Five years ago Burra had one monthly sale and that was small.  Now it has two a month and both are ‘generally very heavy’.  [That issue Liston, Shakes & Co. offered 8,600 sheep, 238 cattle and 72 horses]  On 7 July Goodchild, Austin & Co. will offer 6,000 sheep, 150 cattle and 30 horses.
