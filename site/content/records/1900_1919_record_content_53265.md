After almost a month’s litigation the case of the land dispute between R.J.M. McBride of Burra and his daughter Mrs Caroline Sandland for possession of Flagstaff was settled on Saturday morning.

He judged the original agreement of 22 August 1895 valid and the defendant had the right to purchase the land after the plaintiff’s death for £4,167, the cost price.  In the meantime she was entitled to retain possession on paying the rent of £208-7-0.  The plaintiff to pay costs.

[But note: XXXX, 24, 19 June 1918, page 2.  Robert James McBride has just won his case against his daughter, Mrs Caroline Sandland, on appeal to the Full High Court in Melbourne.  This overturns the order of Mr Justice Buchanan in the SA Supreme Court previously given in favour of the daughter.]
