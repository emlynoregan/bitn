Frank T. Sara takes issue with the particular criticism of Mr Pearse’s of the storekeepers who did not attend and of the term ‘wowser’.  The stores closed on race day at 12 noon and he and other storekeepers have other interests – he does not recall seeing Mr Pearse at the sporting events he (Mr Sara) is interested in.
