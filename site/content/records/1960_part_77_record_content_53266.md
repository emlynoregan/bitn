Burra Burra DC, 31 August

Crs Kellock & Finch moved that the new Housing Trust area street be called Lewis Street.

Crs Jennison & T. Quinn moved that Mr Stirling arrange a meeting with the SAR concerning road closing.  Carried.

The CWA offer of a stove for the kitchen was accepted with thanks.

It was resolved that as the Convent is closing* the Education Department be informed that the Primary School could expect an increase in students and the priority for the new High School should receive attention.

Note the transfer from M.F. Pritchard to the Housing Trust of SA of lots 5, to 14, Pt lot 10 of Section 1 Hd Kooringa and lots 1 to 4, 15, 16, 17 & 22 laid out in Burra (Kooringa) and also from D.C. Campbell of lot 37 Section 1 to the Housing Trust of SA.

[* Rather strangely not only is this the first intimation of this move, but in fact the closure of the convent and school after almost a century at the present site is not otherwise reported.]
