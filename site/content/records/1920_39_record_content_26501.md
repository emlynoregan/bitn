[According to Ian Auhl’s Centenary History of the School this list should be rather different, probably due to overlapping years on hand-over, but more significant differences occur as follows:

Charles J.W. Mundy	1916-17

Richmond T. Hitchcox	1918-19

Roy L. Bromley		1920

John S.R. Oborn		1921 to his death 7 September 1931]

He also gave a list of private school in Burra apart from St Joseph’s.

[The list is neither complete nor in order.  Again refer to Ian Auhl’s book as above.]

Mr H. Pinch: first school in a dugout in Burra Creek

Others were: Dr J.R. Stephens, Mr Grasby (night school), Mr F.W. Holder, Mr Stanton, Mr R.F. White, Mrs Rowe, Misses A. & L. Josling, Misses Goss, Mrs Press, Mrs Gillespie, Miss M.E. Sleep, Miss Johnson, Mr Jones, Mr Matthews, Mrs Blaird, Mrs McLagan, Mr Davis and a branch of MLC.

In the past students could leave at any age once they had gained the Compulsory Certificate, now they had to stay to 13.  The Mayor also gave a short speech in the evening – he said he had gained his Compulsory Certificate when 11 and had then left to work.

Mr E.J. Davey who had been present when the school opened said he had wandered down from home in the Mine Stores and could hardly wait for the speeches to end so he could get to the raspberries, lollies and other good things waiting for them.  Like the Mayor he could not think of great men who had gone through the school, but they could claim Dr Fred. W. Richards, one of the Supreme Court Judges.  He referred to the old feud between children of Kooringa and Aberdeen when lads threw stones at each other – the current lads affirmed that they still fought.
