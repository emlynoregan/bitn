Trooper Packard was accorded a social on Thursday evening in the Institute, presided over by the Mayor, E.W. Crewes.  It was also attended by Captain Watt.  The usual speeches and toasts to our ‘sovereign King Edward VII’ were made and toasts were also raised to Captain Watt [soon to leave for South Africa] and to Trooper Richardson who has returned.  Three cheers were raised for Captain Watt, and Troopers Packard and Richardson and the evening ended with singing of God Save the King.
