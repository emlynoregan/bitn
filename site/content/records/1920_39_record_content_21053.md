Redruth Methodist Church: War Memorial Windows.

Mr & Mrs Charles Bartholomaeus who left Burra some five years ago to live in Adelaide have placed in the church windows in memory of the boys who enlisted and those who made the supreme sacrifice.  They are in the western wall of the transept and the unveiling took place on Saturday 23 October in the presence of a large congregation.  Rev. Alvey led the service and Mrs Bartholomaeus unveiled the windows.

The central window bears the names of the fallen.  The names are surmounted by crossed flags and under that the words: Fought the good fight* 1914-1919.  Above the flags are the Australian ‘Rising Sun’ emblem and the words In Honour.  On either side are windows bearing the names of those who enlisted from the church.  Three sons of the donors head the list.  Rev. C.J. Perry of Clare, late Chaplain in the AIF, delivered the address.

[* Actually it reads Fight the good fight.]
