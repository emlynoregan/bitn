Australia Post is celebrating its bicentenary.  To celebrate this event Burra History Group has set up a display of historic photos and information on the postal services in the district over the years.  A postal service to Burra began in 1846 with the office then being the accountantâ€™s office at the Burra Mine.  The town got a fine post office building in 1861, now the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The present Burra Post Office was built in 1960.  The local staff joined in the spirit of the bicentenary by dressing up in period costume for a day.
