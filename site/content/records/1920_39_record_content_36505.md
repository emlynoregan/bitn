Christmas Tree, 22 December

The Mayoress Mrs T.H. Woollacott presented a Christmas tree to about 200 children of the unemployed in Burra and their parents – assisted by the Burra benevolent Society and the CWA, the Mayor and other gentlemen on Monday evening.  The Institute was decorated for the occasion and a huge Christmas tree was in the centre of the platform with baskets heaped with parcels.  Max Morton played the role of Father Christmas and it couldn’t have been in better hands.  Each child received a gift, an ice cream, a bag of lollies, cakes, some fruit and unlimited cordial.  Parents and older brothers and sisters were given a sit down supper.
