Rev. R.S.T. Pettet of St Mary’s arranged a two-day trip to Adelaide for three of his choir boys: John Kelly, John Voumard & Ray Kotz.  The Rev. & Mrs Pettet set off with the boys on Friday 22 April.  John Voumard (11) had never been to the city or seen the sea.  They visited Rundle St shops and Myer’s Cafeteria, then the SA Museum and the Zoo before going to Outer Harbour where the Strathaird was berthed.  They managed a look over the ship.  After tea at Mr & Mrs Bert Shard’s where they were to stay, they were taken to the city again to see the neon signs etc. and the lights from Windy Point.  On Saturday they visited Parliament House and were fascinated by the escalators in Coles Ltd and then had lunch before going to the Port Adelaide-North Adelaide football match.  The boys were then put on an Enfield tram and rode to the terminus where the Rector collected them and they set off for Burra, reaching there about 8 p.m.
