The inaugural meeting was held at the Sports Complex on Monday 4 December.

Douglas Holloway, President of the SA Federation of Residents & Ratepayersâ€™ Associations Inc. gave an address on the role of such groups.

Chairman Alan Hall said the Association was the only truly unified broad-based body in the community.

Members supported affiliation with the state body.

Their main request to Council was that Council respond to a motion passed at a public meeting at the Old Courthouse on 28 August, calling on Council to produce a Tourism Business Plan for Burra.

The Association will also lobby Council on matters it considers vital to the community and try to ensure Council provided the community with better information on its affairs.
