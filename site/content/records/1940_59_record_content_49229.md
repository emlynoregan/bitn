Burra RSL held its AGM last Saturday.  During the past twelve months £200 was raised to liquidate the Building Fund debt.  Retiring President, E.R. Davey, reported somewhat limited activity for the year, but finances improved.  An Anzac Commemoration Service was held at the Memorial in Market Square, but no band could be arranged.  Tom Robert’s, as drummer, assisted the march to proceed and amplified music was used.  The RSL was represented at the Air Force Day Service.  The Annual Ball in August was well attended.  The President said they needed to build up credit in the Building Fund to carry out repairs as needed.  Painting would soon be necessary.
