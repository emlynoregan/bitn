Weather.  The Mid North was rocked by record breaking rains last week with spectacular lightning displays, flooding rains, high winds and hail.  Much of the trouble that saw SES crews so busy was due to the suddenness with which the storm front moved across the region.  Gutters were simply unable to cope with the downpour and local drains were similarly overwhelmed.  The Burra Creek flowed strongly.  Some people said it was the strongest flow in more than twenty years.  Debris was strewn across roads and a garden wall at the Burra Hospital was pushed over by the weight of water.  [Burra escaped the more serious flooding that inundated houses at Stockport, Hamley Bridge and Riverton.]
