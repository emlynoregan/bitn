Swimming Pool or Grandstand?

The minutes of the Town Council for 18 October 1937 show permission from the Under-Treasurer to transfer the sum of £400 borrowed for the construction of a swimming pool to construct a grandstand at Victoria Park.  Later minutes show the intended pavilion was a small one to accommodate 200 persons.  The advertisement in this paper of 18 December about the intention to borrow £400 for this purpose did not suggest it was the £400 that had been borrowed for the pool.  The advertisement for a poll to decide the issue, following a petition of ratepayers still did not refer to a transfer of money from the pool.  The result of the poll was a majority of 8 from about 150 votes in favour of borrowing the £400 at 5% p.a. to construct buildings at Victoria Park.  Has this poll now given the Council power to borrow a further £400 for the construction of the pool?  We understand this is a moot point among Councillors.  At the last meeting of Council a motion accepting the lowest tender for construction of the pavilion was passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.  Cr Dow has given notice of a motion to rescind this.  It is believed that if the pool is built without the elaborate encumbrances formulated in earlier plans and specifications it could be done for £400-£500 and this has inclined some Councillors to revert to their old love, the swimming pool.
