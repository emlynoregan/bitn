All the houses are built of substantial stone, but irregularly disposed, something like Adelaide of ten years ago.  Rent is high, 10/- for two or three rooms and water 2/- a load.

The general currency is orders from the two great companies.  Also the Aberdeen Hotel issues and Hutchings and a host of grocers.  This is certainly a bad system and the only excuse is the scarcity of cash.  A branch bank is most desirable.
