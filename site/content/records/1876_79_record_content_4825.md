Burra School article by F.W. Holder. 
It is a characteristic of Kooringa that all its best buildings are public institutions churches, banks, the Institute, Post Office and Model School. Until a few years ago no town in SA was inferior to Burra. It had no special purpose buildings for schools, only dilapidated rooms that were rented to the disadvantage of both teachers and students with respect to health, comfort and efficiency. Three years ago Mr Holder, then a teacher, organised a deputation to the District Council to ask that a schoolroom be erected. The Council decided to wait for the decision of Parliament on the Education Act then before the House. The new Act passed and it was expected that really suitable accommodation would be built as it was one of the aims of the Act, but many delays followed before plans were eventually prepared which showed that Burra was to be first in the style and size of its schoolroom. The foundation stone was laid with due ceremony by Mr Bath on the same day that the hospital was formally opened. Sara & Dunstan completed the building at the end of October 1877, but the building remained empty till January 1878, despite children being crowded in inconvenient and unhealthy rooms in the summer heat. The cost of the new building was £6996-8-0 and capacity was 800, or up to 1,000 with extra seating. 
There are six large schoolrooms, a similar number of classrooms and a teachers’ room, lavatories and a large play-shed. It now needs only adequate fencing to be complete. The opening was celebrated with a banquet. The first headmaster was Mr James Cater. Other teachers were Miss Snell, Miss A. Snell, & Messrs F. & J. Snell. Council ignored the claims for a Head Mistress, but eventually under pressure appointed Miss Cox and later Mr W.C. Grasby was first assistant. Average attendance for the six months to July 1878 was 293.5. It is a shame to see space wasted and a building for £2,000 to accommodate 600 would have been more than adequate. The cost at present is £1,207 for staff or £1-0-7 per child per quarter which is higher than at even the best of the private schools. 
[The writer then goes on to condemn payment by results as limiting what is taught and the way it is taught.]
