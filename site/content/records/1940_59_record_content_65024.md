‘Notice.  I had absolutely nothing to do with the wicked vandalism of the Town Council in wantonly slaughtering six beautiful healthy trees near my property.  I thank Crs White and Nankivell for their efforts to prevent this outrage.  “Any fool can kill a tree, but only God can make one grow.”

R. Fuss

Burra North’
