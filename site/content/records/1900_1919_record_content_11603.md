Editorial on the new format of the paper.  The editor announces they have new type, an oil engine to drive the machinery and will be priced at 5/- p.a.  This almost halved the previous cost which they expected to make up in increased volume of sales.  The paper promised increased coverage for the town and district affairs.  Further on in column four the paper offered:

‘If you cannot afford this amount we will willingly give you a twelve month’s free copy, or if you think we will not maintain our high standard we will give you the same advantage.

New subscribers were offered a free three month trial.
