Burra Yacht Club Regatta at the weekend is for anything but professionally built craft.  Vessels must be home made and anything that looks like having a fair chance of winning will be nobbled a little bit.  Rafts of beer cans and milk cartons are common, though the winner in 1982 was more unusual; being made from two FJ Holden car bonnets welded together.  Four racing events are planned along with a Dragon Boat race, a water-based tug oâ€™ war and a thong throwing event.  Live bands will play through the day and proceeds will aid local charities and service projects.
