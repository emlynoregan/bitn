Burra-Morgan Road.  The Department of Transport has announced that a 20 km section of the road will be sealed â€“ taking the sealed section nearly halfway to Burra.  The last section into Burra still requires surveys of European and Aboriginal heritage and surveying of options for the route through Snake Gully and at the Kooringa Road junction along with parking bays.
