Editorial on the Rabbit Congress in Sydney.  There was a proposal to use chicken cholera.  Experiments were to be on an island and an isolated inland area.  The editor believes ‘there is so much risk involved that the utmost care should be taken in the whole matter.’  Results to date suggest that M. Pasteur’s microbes do not seem to have survived.

[There seems to be little dismay that on the release ‘probably all native and other birds that might come into contact with the germs would be destroyed.’]

Many rabbits have been killed by the long drought.
