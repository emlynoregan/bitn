Thirty-eight New Zealand Farmers were welcomed to Burra by the Mayor, I.J. Warnes and other leading citizens in the lounge of the Burra Hotel on Saturday night.

The Mayor referred to Burra’s mining history and said that now it was the centre of the Merino industry with some 17,000 bales of wool shipped out of Burra Railway Station annually as well as a great many bags of wheat.  He spoke of the stud sheep industry and then handed over to I.J. Warnes who spoke about the role of the Stockowners’ Association before giving a longer address on the breeding of sheep, the development of improved pastures and the growing of lucerne.  He also spoke more personally of how he worked his ‘outside’ station of Koomooloo with his Booborowie property, where he also reaped lucerne seed worth 1/2 per pound and which averaged 400 lb to the acre.  He mentioned the impact of the depression of the area and discussed how studmasters had first tried to breed in more wrinkles to increase wool yield and then bred them out again following losses to blowfly strike.  He said he believed in sticking to pure Merino stock rather than crossbreeds.

He had made one very big change at Koomooloo after acquiring it.  It had been the practice to shear between August and Christmas and the lambing rate in April-May was then about 50%.  Now they were shearing in April-May and the lambing rate in spring was between 80 & 90%.  Japan’s withdrawal from the wool sales had hit them hard and they had dropped some £2,000 to £3,000, but he quite agreed with the Government policy in keeping Japan out.

Mr Rose and Mr Chapman responded for the visitors.
