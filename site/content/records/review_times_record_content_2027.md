BCS will be opened on 14 April by the Minister of Education.  An open day will precede the ceremony and visitors will be able to see the school in action and displays on the theme ‘Directions in Education’.  As part of the ceremony Mr Ray Jennison, Chairman of the District Council, will hand over the $20,000 community contribution to the multi-purpose hall.  The day will culminate in a Grand Opening Ball at which the Buy-a-Brick campaign will also come to an end.  The ‘Stone Mountain Band’ led by Big Jim Hermel will provide the music.

[Check the value of the cheque; it should be $10,000.]
