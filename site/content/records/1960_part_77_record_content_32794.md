Burra High School: Headmaster’s Report for 1966

The Headmaster welcomed Mr & Mrs Baulderstone and the guest speaker Dr Southgate & Mrs Southgate and other guests.  He regretted the death in the year of Mr [A.B.] Riggs, one of the House Patrons and a former Chairman of the High School Council.

The year began with 170 students, slightly down on 1965, due mainly to a very small Leaving Class.  Numbers should be steady for some time to come and the emphasis in coming years will be on lengthening the time at school.  1965 produced the most successful Leaving Class ever, with 18 Certificates and a Commonwealth Open Entrance Scholarship won by Denise Griffen.  The Intermediate results were unfortunately far less satisfactory.

The school is in the process of being painted and structural alterations have been made to the Headmaster’s Office, the Library and the Home Science Room.  At last a comfortable and roomy staff room has been provided.  Portions of the yard were repaved and the toilets remodelled.  Thanks to the Parents & Friends’ Association changing rooms on the playing fields were completed and put to use.

Prefects were inducted in March and the Parents & Friends’ Association Annual Ball was held at the end of Term 2.  Arbor Day was celebrated in July by planting trees along the Burra Creek.

Two special religious services were conducted – a combined Methodist and Anglican Easter Assembly, and a Valedictory Service for the second successive year was held in St Mary’s last Sunday evening.

In October the Director of Education, Mr Mander Jones, visited and after opening the new Primary School Library, he addressed the High School Students and reviewed a display of work in the school hall and saw the excellent range of new library books.

Open Night was again held at the start of Term 2, but this year fewer parents came along.

Sport has again played an important part in the school, with a very successful Sports Day in April.  Steele House won the Swimming Cup in March.

At the Inter-High School Sports Day at Kapunda, Burra was successful in retaining the Handicap Shield.  Inter-school winter sports matches were contested against Balaklava and Riverton High Schools (but the less said of the results the better).  Summer sports will be played against Riverton tomorrow.

Another highlight of the year was the tour by 32 senior students and four teachers to Tasmania in September.  Unfortunately the planned camp at Melrose 10 days ago for the Junior School had to be cancelled due to wet weather.  It has been postponed to February.

The club period changed this year.  In Term 1 the lesson was given over to cultural activities such as drama, musical appreciation, singing and art work.  In Term 2 the whole school engaged in debating and public speaking.

Future changes.  The Intermediate Examination is to be abandoned, with no external examination staged by the Education Department at that level either.  It is also probable that the Alternative Course will be extended into the Leaving year.  It remains to be seen how many students will wish to study a PEB type course where there will be no external examination until Leaving level and how many will take the High Schools Alternative Course.  The nature of the gap between the two courses is also as yet unknown.

Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships will be available, awarded on the results of a special mid-year examination (held for the first time this year).  Two of our students gained one this year: Christine Reincke & Shirley Crew – both of them are leaving Burra.

[The Headmaster then discussed the problem of student boredom, their wandering the streets at night and their lack of manners.  He went on to the usual acknowledgement of the work of the Parents & Friends’ Association, the High School Council, the High School staff and the religious instructors.]

Changes for 1967: Miss Briggs moves to the new Elizabeth West H.S. and Miss Jones will return as Mrs Day.
