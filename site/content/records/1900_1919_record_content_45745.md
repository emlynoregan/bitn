‘Ratepayer’ writes saying Mr McLaren’s admission and his idea of excusing himself is only worthy of a politician.  Such regular meetings were frequent when he was Mayor.  If regular, was it in order?  When were the minutes confirmed?  There is no doubt that as Mr McLaren says had he expected to be beaten for Mayor he would have certainly finalised things previously.  ‘What is stirring him now, his interest in Burra, or, as per usual, other quarters!’
