The Town’s Poor.  By last Thursday only three applications for aid had reached the Distress Committee.  The editor feels the Council went about things the wrong way.  A public meeting would have been the place to start and the doctors could supply information about where real distress is to be found.

[The Advertiser on Saturday 22 July seems to have referred to distress in Burra, but it probably drew inferences from the Record article and advertisement as the town does not seem to have found local distress to be excessive.]
