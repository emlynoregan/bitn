Inquest into the death of William Martin was resumed.

Mr Sanders of Hill & Co. Terowie knew the deceased as an employee of the company and believed him to be aged 18-19.  [He had brought the deceased to Burra.]

Michael Kelly, boundary rider of Paratoo, described how Martin and a black boy named Jimmy had been larking about on horses and then described a collision between his own horse and that of the deceased.  Both horses fell and rolled on the riders.  After attempting unsuccessfully to rouse Martin he was brought into Terowie.

There is other evidence of events the same day that seem to have no effect on the death and the jury found death by colliding with one Michael Kelly whilst on horseback at Paratoo which was purely accidental and not otherwise.
