Burra Defence Rifle Club.  The annual meeting on 2 April elected A.B. Hiddle as President, E.A. Pearce as Treasurer and P.A. Roach as Hon. Secretary.

This year improvements were made on the range.  A group of three canvas targets and a shelter house have been provided, resulting in only a small credit balance remaining.  There are presently 45 members.  Class firing results: 6 marksmen, 2 First-class, 4 Second-class and 19 Third-class.  There was a successful carnival at Princess Royal in conjunction with the Cricket Club and a visit to Adelaide during the Royal Visit.
