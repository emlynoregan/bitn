Burra Traders’ Association has voiced its objection to the use of Redbanks Reserve as a recreation area for off-road vehicles.  The Chairman Mr Jeff Hirschausen said the traders were strongly opposed to the present use of the reserve by off-road vehicles and believed that the proposed new rules would be virtually impossible to police.  He said the site would be subject to desecration, deterioration and ultimately destruction.  In the past accidents there had placed a severe strain on emergency services.
