Election Meeting: Burra Institute, 26 March, the Mayor, Dr Brummitt, in the chair.

W.B. Rounsevell spoke as Leader of the Opposition.  The hall was full and the report runs for four columns.  The main issue was taxation.  He favoured a land tax and an income tax with a minimum level of Â£300.

W.H. Hardy writes advocating the reading of the Bible in schools, but the editor contends that what Hardy really wants is religious teaching which a secular Government education cannot provide.
