Weather.  Monday was dusty and windy.  At 12 o’clock on Tuesday a thunderstorm dropped over 1” in half an hour.  In Market Square water could not get away and flooded the footpath at F. Harris’s shop.  Thunder and lightning continued and some roads and footpaths were damaged.  The creeks came down and standing wheat was damaged.
