Burra Town Council, 4 February

Mrs M.S. Bown asked Council to close and sell to her the lane adjoining her home as far up as Lancelot Street, so that it could be used for the disposal of waste water.

It was moved and seconded that a portion of the road be sold to Mrs Bown with provision for a footpath, subject to the Opening and Closing of Roads Act.  [Presumably passed.]

[Where is Lancelot Street?]
