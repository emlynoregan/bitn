The Waukaringa Gold Reefs.  The correspondent of the Northern Argus reports travelling to the field via Mt Bryan and Hallett and thence to Mr A. McCulloch’s station, Gottlieb’s Well.  Then via the Deep Well, Nackara creek to McKoy’s Well where he stopped overnight.  The gold reefs are about 20 miles beyond Waukaringa Run.  The extent of the reefs east and west is marked by a line of white flags.  Another line goes north and south.  The line is pegged on the supposed course of a gold-bearing leader from which the Waukaringa co. is getting some very good stone.  The party at Waukaree (from Burra) have struck another leader and are raising promising stone.  [The report continues with further details.]
