Burra Town Council

Crs Kellaway & Lee moved a letter from the Betting Control Board lie on the table â€“ the letter set out regulations for the establishment of a betting shop in Burra.

Cr Jennison said the Council should refuse to register the betting shop.

Cr Lee said the Board could establish such a shop whether the Council approved or not.

The Clerk said a letter from Council to the Board would not influence it either way.  The Board would hold an enquiry about it in any case.

Cr Harvey wondered if a poll was allowed.

The Mayor said no, but he thought the Council had the last say about a site.

The motion was carried.

[The Councillors were clearly opposed and the general feeling was against any betting shop.]
