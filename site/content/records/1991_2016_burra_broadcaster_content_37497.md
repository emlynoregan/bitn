The Burra History Group in conjunction with the Town Hall Committee is making a permanent display of historic photographs in the supper room.  The cost of frames and mounting is $30 per photograph and a number of Burra businesses have already agreed to sponsor a photograph.  If you can join them, make your contribution at Old Wares, where you can also select which photograph[s] your donation will sponsor.
