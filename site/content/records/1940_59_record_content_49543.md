Burra Town council, 5 March

Council resolved to write to Mr Hawker MP regretting any inconvenience caused by the Record article on the Housing Trust building in Burra.

E & WS advises the cost of a new three-inch main to Victoria Park would be c. Â£500 and no starting date for the work could be given.

SAR advises that orders have been given that locomotives not blow down in the station yard.

Gum trees on the south side of the Anglican Rectory are to be investigated, as the Rev. Pettet complains they are damaging the garden.

Cr Bernhardt moved that the owner of the old mill at Burra North be asked to demolish it.  Seconded by Cr Scott, but defeated.

Cr Pritchard then moved that owners of partly demolished buildings be requested to demolish them.  Carried.

Sympathy was extended to the family of the late F. Harris, a former Councillor.
