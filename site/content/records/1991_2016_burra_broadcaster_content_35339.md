New Smoking Laws apply in SA from Monday 6 December

[While they had a number of complications, the most significant aspects were as follow.]

Smoking is banned in enclosed work places.

There is an exception for hospitality venues, where phased bans began on 6 December with full bans to apply from 31 October 2007.

Pubs and clubs with more than one bar must have one bar smoke free.

Where there is smoking in bars there must be an exclusion zone with no smoking within a metre of service areas and the areas in which smoking is allowed must not occupy more than half the floor space.

[There were further detailed rules about gaming areas.]
