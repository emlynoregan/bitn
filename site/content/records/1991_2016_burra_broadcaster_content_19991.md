CWA National President Mrs Margaret Smith AO visited Burra last Friday and was entertained at a luncheon at the old Courthouse.  She opened the State Conference in Adelaide last week.  The CWA has just celebrated its 70th anniversary and to mark the occasion a new rose, named Mary Warnes after the SA founder, has just been released.
