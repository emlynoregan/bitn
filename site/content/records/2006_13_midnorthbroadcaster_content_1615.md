Redbanks Conservation Park will be on show to the public tomorrow.  As well as an important habitat for native wildlife and vegetation between the rounded hills of Burra and the eastern rangelands, the area has been in the news of late for its megafauna heritage, with fossils of the giant kangaroo and diprotodon.  On 28 September there will be special displays of native wildlife, plants and Australian megafauna, with experts in those fields stationed around the ‘oval’ area.  Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University, a specialist in megafauna, will be among those on hand.  School groups will attend and BCS students have been prepared to lead guided tours.

The Market Square Museum’s 40th Birthday Celebrations drew a good crowd last Friday.  Laurel Neill, a retiring volunteer at the museum accepted a plaque of recognition for the many volunteers that have staffed the museum from 1966 to 2006, from the National Trust of SA’s Vice-President Graham Hancock.
