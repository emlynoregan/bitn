Burra Town Council

Burra Badminton Club was granted hire of the hall at 6/- with the club to remove and replace seats and make good any breakages, but the club will not take preference over any person or body desirous of hiring the hall on that night.

A letter is to be written to ETSA protesting over their use of the parklands at Burra North as a depot for poles, water carts etc.

Donors for school crossing lights will be reimbursed, as the Council will not be installing lights.

The SA Symphony Orchestra will be invited to play in the Burra Town Hall.

P.H. Quirke supplied information about plans for the district schools.

Booborowie: Funds have been approved for paving and fencing.

Black Springs: A scheme for connecting the new toilets to a septic system is in hand.  The Department of Mines is to provide a suitable windmill and overhead tank.

Burra: A detailed plan and estimates for a site-works scheme including paving, drainage and retaining wall is being prepared for the approval of funds.
