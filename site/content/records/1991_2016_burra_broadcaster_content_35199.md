Letter.  Roger Cross again writes about ‘Miss Popularity’ to say he is not alone in believing that the program is ‘rapidly turning our town into the laughing stock of Australia’. 

He goes on to mention some of the events which he considers to be ‘in such shocking bad taste that I can only hope that New Zealand viewers will switch off their TV sets as soon as it goes to air’.
