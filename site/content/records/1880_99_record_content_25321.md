Adelaide Chrysanthemum Show.  J.D. Cave did very well again.  Only the exhibits from the Botanic Gardens and Mr E.T. Smith were superior.  Despite Mr Caveâ€™s blooms being shown first in Burra and them travelling 100 miles, he won 5 firsts and 1 second prize.  He has decided to give slips to anyone seriously interested in improving the plants.
