St Mary’s Rectory Opening Ceremony.

Rev. Canon Webb of Clare dedicated the new rectory on Saturday.  Tables decorated with wattle blossom held every kind of eatable.  Oysters in aspic, salmon croquets, corned beef, lamb, roast goose, roast and boiled fowl, rhubarb tart, apple tart, vanilla creams, jellies and cheese.  Dinner was in the large double room.  J.C. Sandland as clerk of works summed up the building.

The foundations had to be dug 2’ instead of 1’ to find solid ground, adding £33 to the cost, bringing it to £388-19-10.  The contractors had worked very well and in a friendly spirit.  Robertson Bros. of Gawler carried out the work.  He would like to see a verandah, but that could come later.

Mr Winnall outlined the financial arrangements.  They had started with £54 and had borrowed £50 each from three gentlemen.  Collecting since Easter had been successful so that only a debit of £150 remained.

Mr Fuss of Fuss Bros. appreciated the kind remarks with reference to the workmanship and thanked Mrs Wightwick for her hot tea throughout the cold weather.  [This suggests that Fuss Bros. did the carpentry since the Robertson Bros. appear from the above to have had the principal building contract, but the report then says the Robertson Bros. had done the plastering and the Tiver Bros. must also feel proud of their work.]

Rev. Wightwick thanked the Hon. J. Lewis, Mrs T. Sandland and Mr Barker, who had lent sums of £50 each.  [Either Mrs T. Sandland was one of the gentlemen mentioned above, or this is a misprint for Mr.]

The rectory is entered from the eastern side through a large door of ecclesiastical design at the sides of which are cathedral glass.  This leads to a hall 17’ x 10’ fitted with hat racks etc.  To the left is a bedroom 17’ x 13’ x 12’ high.  The drawing room is entered through a passage door where it is divided from the drawing room [sic] by double folding doors 10’ wide to make, when open, a large room 38’ x 14’.  The study is entered from the passage and is 13’ x 13’.  The new building is built up close to the front verandah of the old.  The whole has been pointed and lined though in the absence of the much needed verandah it presents a naked appearance when approached from the south.
