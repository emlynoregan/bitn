Mid North Adult Education Centre conducted a Living History School for 50 people at Burra on 16 August.  Mr Ian Auhl travelled from Adelaide to conduct the event.  In the morning participants visited the Mine site, the old Redruth Gaol and the Dugouts.  After lunch Mr Auhl gave an address on the history and development of the area, illustrated with slides.  This group will be among the last people to visit the old mining area, as this week it will be fenced off for the new mining operations.
