The Burra Mine.  SAMA has published its annual report and balance sheet.  In the half-year just closed the production reached 1,500 tons of 18% ore.  The ore produced did not meet expenses by about £2,800, but rental income reduced this deficiency to less than £1,300.  The costs included significant permanent work.

Captain Sanders reports that in the half-year 52,812 tons of haulage has been done, new exploratory work carried out, a 30 inch roll-crushing mill, a Moonta jigger and other dressing machinery has been erected.  He remains confident of the future.  The Directors have reverted to the old system of treating the ore, the new process known as the convex round bubbles having proved unsuccessful.  [This is a reference to the Buddle Pits.]  The company’s establishment comprises 328 men and boys.
