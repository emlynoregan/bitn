Letter.  Bob Skinner writes applauding Joe Kazimour’s attempt to increase his business and so benefit the town, but he goes on to question some of Joe’s outrage:

It would seem that Mr Kazimour could still display his sign flat against the parapet, as he said he agreed to. (Any safety issues could surely be overcome.)

As for existing garish signs, they are not in keeping with heritage values and he hopes they will go in time.

Advertising can be eye-catching and effective without being offensive.  He feels Mr Kazimour does the Council CEO and planning officers an injustice – they can only advise the Councillors as to the legal requirements and recommended planning procedure.
