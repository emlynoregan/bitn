The Burra Mine

Some large holes have opened up on the edge of the re-timbered Morphett’s Shaft.  They are large enough to swallow somebody and there are fears of further subsidence.  The area has been fenced off and the Mine Museum Committee is awaiting a report from the Department of Mines and Energy with suggestions of how to solve the problem.  The shaft was re-timbered in 1986 as part of the tourist attraction.  The effect of retaining water in the infill has caused the subsidence and distorted some of the main timbers, although the structure appears sound on initial inspection.
