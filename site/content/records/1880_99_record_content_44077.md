‘It is to be very much regretted that Mr Hardy cannot go to work with his colleagues in a proper and gentlemanly manner instead of rushing into print to try to show them up, but even in this feeble attempt he has failed.’

‘Mr Hardy is the misleading star.’

Mr Littlejohn signed an agreement on 5 November 1889, which specified duties and salary.  The new agreement is but a little extended from that and will in no way curtail the expenses of the Council. The extra pay was for a labourer and the new agreement does not compel him [Littlejohn] to do labourer’s work.  The imputation of laxity on the part of the old councillors is wrong ‘but we leave them to clear themselves if they wish’.
