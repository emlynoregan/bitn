Artemus Ward jun. writes in Cornish dialect on Manly Sports.  He regrets the language used by some young men, saying that rather than have a son of his speak so he would have him ‘blow his branes out, or buy shares in the Apoinga Mine’.

He was approached at the football by one who saw it as a waste of precious time.  But he believes it does them much good: ‘I dont think that enjoyin the good gift ov God will bring men down to the pit.’

We don’t want them to grow up ‘only fit to lean agen lamp posts, and grone at the inikivity ov the world, - week, sickly, and narrow-minded, & c., & c., an when they begin to battle with the world, there dishartend before they have well started.’
