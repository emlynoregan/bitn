In the afternoon a visit was made to the home of Messrs Broad Bros, close to the original hut of the Brown Bros, where a re-enactment of SA’s proclamation was held in costume.  The group visited Master Colin Landorf on the way.  He is recovering from polio.  Then the children went to the Anglican Church where there is a plaque to the memory of the Brown Bros.  An excellent afternoon tea concluded the day’s activities.
