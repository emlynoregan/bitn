Christmas Festivities were a record for Burra, as with closer settlement in the district the population has increased and a large crowd assembled in the streets and indulged in a merry time.  On Tuesday the shops were decorated with evergreens and artificial flowers, flags and bunting.  Later in the day the youngsters added to the festivities and business was very brisk.  After tea people came in on every sort of conveyance and by 8 p.m. the streets and Market Square were one mass of humanity.  Hotel bars did good business, but excellent order was maintained.  Gift shopping was very busy and youngsters were everywhere ‘with musical (?) toys’.  The crowd dispersed as midnight approached.
