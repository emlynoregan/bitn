Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The copper price remains c. £68-11-3 to £68-18-6 and while this is well below the £79-15-0 of 1900 which followed ten years of much lower prices, in which four years were at or below £47-8-9 with a low of £37-17-0, the present price is c. £10 up on 1904 and so favours re-opening the mine.  The problem is cost with estimates of £6,000 to £10,000 and the company has not half the former figure and no chance of raising the sum from shareholders.  The ore so far recovered would pay on-site treatment, but will not bear the cost of shipment to Wallaroo for processing.  The Minister for Mines will supply a pump as the result of a public deputation, but the company must make a proposal to the Government.  If the company does not move on this now ‘it must be moribund’.  For many years Burra produced 10,000 to 13,000 tons of ore p.a., averaging from 22 to 23% copper and in the 30 years it was worked from 1845 it produced 234,648 tons of ore and 51,622 tons of copper, valued at £4,749,224.  It employed an average of 1,000 men, provided general expenditure of £2,241,167 and paid £826,585 in dividends.  The mine closed because of low prices, but just before closure Captain Saunders [Sanders] had struck good ore at a comparatively shallow depth below the basin from which the rich carbonates had come.  It closed before its sulphides were touched or workings carried below the 300’ level.  Since then different methods and working costs and market rates should make the mine payable and lead to its resumption.  (From a report in Australian Mining Standard.)
