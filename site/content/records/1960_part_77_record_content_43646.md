Burra Town Council, 18 December

The Town Clerk reports on a meeting with the Minister of Local Government about the merged Council.  It seems certain that the appointment of a Mayor for the new Council in 1969 will be by nomination of the ratepayers.  The first step towards amalgamation has been a Notice of Amalgamation published in the Government Gazette and local paper.

The Town Hall Pictures showed a loss in November of $15 with an average attendance of 90.  Three nights ran at a loss and two shows in December also ran at a loss of $18 to give a loss over seven weeks of $33.

A window has been broken in the Camera Club room and is to be replaced.

Mr Perry has been appointed Acting Town Clerk.
