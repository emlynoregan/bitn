Obituary.  Some weeks ago the death occurred of Robert Joseph Dixon, formerly of Hanson and lately of Redruth.  He was aged 87 before being laid up with a leg injury to which he succumbed after many weeks that at first seemed hopeful.  He came to Hanson district as a small boy with his parents and they lived where the McWaters are now and from where he used to walk to Farrell Flat to work at the blacksmithâ€™s shop when about 18.  At about 20 he took land near Hanson and built a home, living there till about three years ago, when the farm was sold and he and his wife came to live in Redruth with their daughter Mrs M. Woodward.  In 1895 Mr Dixon married Miss Mary Ann Byles of Douglas.  Mrs Dixon still lives with her daughter.  She taught her husband to read, which proved a great advantage to him.  The youngest son, Clarence, died about three years ago, up to which time the old couple had been living with him on the old property with his wife and children.  The other children are: Robert (Croydon), Edith Mrs Turner (Burra), Slias [sic: William Silas] (Findon), Claire [Clara Isabel] Mrs Pattison (Kadina) and Martha Mrs Woodward (Redruth.)  Mr Dixon was a regular worshipper at Hanson Methodist Church and used to recall incidents that took place when the services were held in the District Council Chamber at Hanson.  [Born 13 August 1866 Yurko Station, District of Burra: died 24 October 1953 Redruth, Burra.]
