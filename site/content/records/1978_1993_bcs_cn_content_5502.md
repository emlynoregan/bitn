Ian Auhl wrote seeking information about Elizabeth A. Ward who lived in Burra in the 1930s and was probably elderly then.

[Ian Auhl was preparing Burra-Burra Reminiscences of the Burra Mine and Its Townships and despite widespread enquiry he had been unable to identify Elizabeth Ward who had written reminiscences of Burra that appeared in the Burra Record in 1936 under the heading Memories of Burra.

An Elizabeth Ann Ward died 5 June 1952 aged 92.  She would thus have been born about 1860.  There is no certainty of her birth, but an Elizabeth Ann Ward was born 10 October 1861 at Clare to Richard and Elizabeth nee White and an R. Ward was living in Burra in 1876.  The evidence in the articles she wrote places her in school in Burra 1870-1874.  It seems likely that this is the person writing in 1936.

An obituary in the Burra Record 17 June 1952, page 4 adds the information:

Elizabeth Ann Ward was buried in Burra on 6 June.  Miss Ward had been an active member of the Salvation Army in Burra for 61 years and a long-time Sunday school teacher there.  For the last six years she lived in a private nursing home in Adelaide.]
