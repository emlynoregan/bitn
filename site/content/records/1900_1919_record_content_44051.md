Burra Creek.  There is still disagreement about the use of the Burra Creek.  Mr Lewis held the right to buy the creek including the plantations made by Council, but he would allow the Council to buy the Creek at the same price provided his firm was assured a right of way for their stock to their yards.  As part of this they need the right to impound to prevent town cattle from grazing there and so preserving a bite for the travelling stock.  This would not prevent the Councilâ€™s own horses from grazing.  The current dispute is over this right to impound.  Cr Radford had understood Mr Lewis was leasing only the bed of the creek.  Mr Winnall believed the Council was at least morally bound to grant the lease and since he also points out that the Council is a continuing body he seems to imply it also may have a legal obligation.
