Burra Racing Club, adjourned AGM was resumed on Friday at the Institute.  The Secretary was absent, but he reported a profit on the last meeting of £150.  This has largely allowed the debt to be reduced from £605-8-6 to £434-10-3.  Membership has risen from 79 to 158.  P.W. Clark was elected chairman and J.R. Barker is Patron.  N. Hiles Pearse was elected President with B.L. Symonds as Secretary.  (J. Carpenter is unable to continue as his assistant.)  Mr John Tennant has donated 250 yards of hose towards watering the track.  A.J. McBride has given half a mile of 1½ inch water pipe towards irrigating the track.  Both receive the club’s thanks.
