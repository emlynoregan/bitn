Sir Henry Ayers.

C.B.T. writes in defence of Sir Henry Ayers.

It is fashionable to accuse Sir Henry Ayers of being selfish, obstinate, disappointed and non-progressive.

But it is easy to prove he has always respected public opinion, and has generally placed himself in the front to support the demands of the people.  Take one instance:

‘Ten years ago Sir Henry Ayers was denounced by the squatters and others in their behalf, as well as by many others on behalf of Banks, absentees, and capitalists, as no other public man in this colony has ever been denounced on a question of public policy.  True, he had five-sixths of the people with him as regards the policy he was then endeavouring to carry out; but an active, intelligent minority opposed him, and an influential portion of the Press also opposed him, and the consequence was that day by day and inch by inch he had to fight the battle out.

The policy Sir Henry Ayers then advocated, and which these gentlemen then opposed, was the taxing of the rich and the taking from them for ever the monopoly of our landed estate – a monopoly which some of our ablest and most highly-respected squatters (including, I believe, Mr Hawker) believed and declared they held of right and by agreement in perpetuity.

It is not too much to say that the policy and action of Sir Henry Ayers and the late Hon. John Barrows in those days formed the foundation and cleared the way for the first land reform and for every subsequent one.  And following this up, the same gentleman carried the Land Bill sanctioning substituted residence against an able and powerful opposition, who were in favour of residence pure and simple.  I was then and I am still a firm believer in personal residence as being the best system to exclude the dummy; but the fact remains that the success of the Areas is largely, nay principally, owing to the too liberal policy and energetic action of Sir Henry Ayers.

Under the circumstances it is not gratifying to find that his services in this direction are entirely unrecognised by the farmers; but is this really the case?’
