Kevin William Wallis

Resident of Burra for the past five years.  Married to Barbara and have three boys.  Currently mining east of Burra and am setting up a tourist attraction to help bring tourists to Burra.  My main concern is that, with the current Council being mainly rural people, when rates are increased the town people are the ones who get the increase.  If elected I would like to see:

1.  Market Square altered so it is not under constant road repair.

2.  The Morgan Road bituminised or at the least upgraded.

3.  Tourist attractions in Burra remaining as a community project and not as private enterprise.

4.  The cleaning up of rubbish around the town of Burra and along the creek.

5.  The upgrading of the heavy vehicles bypass road.
