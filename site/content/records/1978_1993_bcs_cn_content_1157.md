BCS Kooringa Building

Last Wednesday a small section of old ceiling plaster in the Kooringa building came adrift in the Years 2/3 Unit.  The Public Buildings Department inspected the area and as a result from 20 August the 2/3 Classes have been using the Youth Club building.  As the ceilings throughout the building are affected they will be completely removed and replaced with a new acoustic ceiling suspended at the height of the present slatted ceiling.  This work will start as soon as possible â€“ possibly as soon as the coming holidays.  Dust and noise will probably mean the removal of the Reception and Years 1 & 2 classes to the Catholic Parish Hall and the Annexe of the Agriculture Classrooms during the work.  We anticipate that in due course the 3/4 and 5/6 Units will move to the same sites in their turn.

The new ceilings should greatly reduce the acoustic problems in the Kooringa Building.

[The Youth Club Building was at the War Memorial Oval and parents were asked to be careful when driving along Smelts Road while students were using it, although it was stated that students would cross the road under teacher supervision at all times.]
