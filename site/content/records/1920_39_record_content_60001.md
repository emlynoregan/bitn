Burra Institute received a visit on Thursday from Sir William Sowden, President of the Institutes Assoc. of SA, who with two other officers is visiting northern institutes.  Mr A.B. Riggs welcomed the guests as local President and opened the meeting.  Sir William gave a speech in which he referred to the great support of Burra & District to the Cheer-up work during the war.  He then discussed the problems faced by institutes and in particular the difficulties Burra had with its mortgage to the State Bank of over Â£3,000.  He believed the Council should take a more active role in the Institute.  It was also important that the libraries be as modern and attractive as possible to maintain their client base.
