Mongolata Goldfield

The storm last Tuesday dropped 135 points in less than half an hour.  Water poured down the hillsides and Block 8 in particular seemed encased in water.  All road crossings were washed out and access is difficult.  The ground in front of the Boarding House was a sheet of water, with the drains around the tennis court simply turning it into waves.  Bore creek was a picture with water coming down between two ranges of hills, turning it into a raging torrent some 100 yards wide at the dugouts.

Two men working on Byles’ Mine, Messrs Robinette & Hazelwood, barely escaped.  The water coming down the hill rose enough to flood one of the air shafts and then penetrated to the shaft and drive where they were working.  When the water stopped rising there was just enough room to keep their heads clear as they waded 150 ft to the shaft.  Much more and nothing could have saved them.  The storm moved off to the south.
