Cr Kellaway in reporting from a conference on unemployment said it had been suggested that in reference to the Mayoral Fund for the relief of the unemployed instead of sending to Adelaide for clothes, coupons should be issued on local traders.  The present system was a nuisance as often clothes did not fit and had to be returned.

The Mayor said he had sent for £16 worth of clothes from the city, but the Government was buying up to £20,000 worth at a time and could buy more cheaply than the local merchants.  Women got the advantage of the goods and in some instances if money were given it would never reach the home.
