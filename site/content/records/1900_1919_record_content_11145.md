Baldina Methodist Church tea meeting revealed that the Sunday school had 13 boys and 13 girls and 5 teachers with an average attendance of 10 pupils and 3 teachers.  Financially it was sound:

Credit on hand from 1903		£1-8-1½

Income from collections 1904		£12-0-0

Expenditure in 1904		£13-3-4

Credit in hand		4-9½

The anniversary collections	£2-7-10

Tea	£5-13-6

Collection at public meeting	15-6

Supper	£2-1-5

Anniversary total	£10-18-3

Cash in hand after the anniversary		£11-3-0½

Since the debt on the church is £8 and the annual repayment is £4 there is ample money on hand.

[These figures show the financial importance of the anniversary to such churches and it is also clear that much of it came from townsfolk who went out to the outlying churches on such occasions.]
