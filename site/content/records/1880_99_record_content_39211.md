W.T. Rabbich replies to the query on the lack of water laid on to the Redruth Reserve.  He says he took every precaution to see that water would be laid on and connected and a hose provided to water the 420 trees planted, but the pipes, though ordered, did not arrive.

Cr O’Leary gave instructions to keep the reservoir full and the engineer on hand at the works.  This was absurd as he was not needed at all times, even to meet Government officials, who could only arrive at certain times by train.  The pipes did eventually arrive and in time to have been connected, so why was it not done?
