Burra Town Hall

Llewellyn Jones from Salisbury is taking on the management of the Burra Cultural Centre. [Town Hall & Gallery] His purpose will be to revitalise the centre and increase use and income.  A Ngadjuri display is planned for the south side rooms.  Goyder Council said some $24,000 of funding has already been confirmed and word on an extra $24,000 is expected soon.  Council budgeted for $20,000 from capital projects to be spent on the Town Hall in 2000-01, but it ended up unused.
