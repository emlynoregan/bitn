Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The company shares are down to 1/3.

There will be a general clean up at the mine and boring will cease.  Rumours of something not very encouraging to residents or shareholders have been around for some time.  Some time ago the Kooringa Prospecting Syndicate took up an option over the property and was going to spend some Â£15,000 in developing the mine.  A couple of boring plants were erected and after much trouble a start was made, but there were many problems, and ultimately little headway.  A fortnight ago some sulphide ore was found, but not sufficient to excite interest.  All the old timber etc. will be handed over to the Burra Burra Copper Co. and all hope of the mine starting again seems gone.  Boring will probably cease on 15 February when the contract expires.
