Austerity Loan Pennant Awards.  There is an article of over Â½ column of detail that ends up concluding that Burra now appears to have come 4th rather than 3rd in its size category and will receive a dark blue pennant rather than a red pennant as in the last issue.  [Where it was described as an Ensign rather than a pennant.]
