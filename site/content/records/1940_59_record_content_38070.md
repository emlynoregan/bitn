Adelaide-Burra Road Race

The War Memorial Committee has decided to hold functions at the completion of the race on 18 September.  There will be a dance in the RSL Club Rooms, with a pasty supper.  Side shows will operate in Market Square during the afternoon.  Accommodation will be needed for about 120 riders and officials for tea, bed and breakfast over Saturday/Sunday.

The War Memorial Committee is currently negotiating with contractors to carry out the grading and levelling of Victoria Park.  When this work begins funds will be needed urgently.  Subscriptions have been ‘hanging fire’ and this has made it difficult for the committee to estimate the amount of money available for the work.

The Wigley Property Sale on Friday saw the 1,363 acres fetch £12-5-0 per acre.  It was bought by Mr T. Ashton.  The property had been advertised in four lots, to be offered separately if the price for the whole was not accepted.
