Burra Passenger Train Service

The Burra Burra DC Clerk recently received a letter from Mr Wilson Minister of Transport saying that he had been advised that ANR intends to cease all local passenger services on the routes to the Mid North.  This would see the cancellation of 17 trains of the Burra-Peterborough service.  It would leave eight services per week on the Peterborough line to connect with the Indian-Pacific.  These would be of limited value to the local residents.  It is anticipated the services would cease on 1 September 1980.

The rail services could be replaced by a motor coach service operating directly to Adelaide and at times suitable for a one-day return trip.  These would operate under licence to the State Government and carry parcels and passengers.

The Council was invited to make a submission.
