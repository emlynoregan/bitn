Larrikinism.

Burra’s hoodlums have recently used a diamond to cut across a ‘YES’ placard on Drew & Crewes’ window.  Damage was £15.

Other acts include urinating on shop fronts.  Respected citizens are continually being insulted.  The Mayor has spoken to M-C North about it.  Cr Killicoat said there was little of it in Aberdeen.  Council decided to appoint two special constables for the holidays.
