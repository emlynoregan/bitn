Burra Show, 6 October.

There was some light morning rain and then a clear afternoon till 4 p.m. when light steady rain set in.  Proceedings were thus not seriously affected.  The ground was well grassed.  The sideshows did a thriving business.  Gate takings of Â£106 were up on last year.  Despite the date being moved after consultation with sheep man, sheep were conspicuously absent.  Agricultural implements were the highlight of the show.  The display extended 100 yards x 25 yards: the largest display put of a showground in Australia by the International Harvester Co.
