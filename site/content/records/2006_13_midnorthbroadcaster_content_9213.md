The Film Breaker Morant will be shown at the Redruth Gaol this Saturday to celebrate its 30th anniversary.  It was shot on location at Redruth Gaol and other sites around Burra.  Those making an appearance included Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, John Waters and Charles Tingwell.  Many locals also made an appearance.  The event will also pay tribute to Edward Woodward, who played the lead role of Harry Morant, and who died last week.  The event has been organised by Paul Marsson and Neil Nicholson of the Burra National Trust together with BRTBA.  The film was directed by Bruce Beresford and scooped 10 awards at the 1980 AFI awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  The audience will be treated to a dinner of spit roasted lamb with salad and dessert and Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group has prepared a slideshow presentation of images taken during the filming.  Market Square featured in the film and the whole production helped to put Burra on the tourist map.  Now 107 years after the Morant and Handcock were executed Jim Unkles, a lawyer with 30 yearsâ€™ experience in military legal matters, has lodged petitions with the House of Representatives and the British Crown for a review of the convictions and sentences.  Lieutenants Morant and Handcock were found guilty of murdering Boer prisoners of war and shot in Pretoria 27 February 1902.  Unkles considers significant errors in the legal proceedings make the convictions and sentences unsafe.  Justice demands a review of the trials, the convictions and the sentences.
