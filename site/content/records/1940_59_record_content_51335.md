Burra Town Council, 23 July

The Bank of Australasia has granted a request for a £2,000 overdraft.

The E & WS Department has cleared the mains to Victoria Park and the pressure should be improved.

Two members of the Board of the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd will attend the next Council meeting.

Council granted the CWA’s request to plant an avenue of trees from the Hospital to the Hanson Turn-off.

L.L. Fiebig asked permission to alter his premises to a service station and lubritorium and to remove one of his existing service stations.  He was advised that he would first need a permit from the Building Materials Office.

Council resolved to get the front of the Town Hall painted.

Council decided to interview T.H. Villis with a view to finding a future site for a rubbish depot.
