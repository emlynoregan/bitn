Burra Hospital

Mr Dean Berry has been asked to submit plans for additions to cost £50,000, as it is thought unlikely the Government would subsidise a scheme in excess of that, on a £ for £ basis.  Mr Berry said the initial cost included camps for workmen.  These are expensive, but unavoidable, as the alternative is good hotel accommodation.  Some money would be recovered from the subsequent sale of the camps.
