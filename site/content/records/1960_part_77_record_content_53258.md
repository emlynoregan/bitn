Hallett district Clerk Mr Max Petersen, who has been on the position for three years, suffered severe spinal injuries in a car accident recently.  He will probably be confined to a wheelchair.  A cabaret at Hallett on 24 October will raise funds to assist the family in this time of financial difficulty.
