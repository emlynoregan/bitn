It will be without a bursar and one staff member in 1996.  Officially the SSO reduction is 16 hours, but changes to the staffing formula could mean the loss of up to 40 hours.

Dee Hill, who replaced Marg. Heath as bursar will not continue.

Barb Secomb will lose her SSO position.

Voluntary community support could be needed to run the gymnasium.

Burra SAIT members will stop work for the last hour today.
