Burra Hospital.  86th Annual Report of the Chairman to 30 June 1963.

The hospital is in a sound financial position.

The overdraft has been reduced from £5,369 at 30 June 1960 to the present figure of £2,292.  There is £2,595 in our Maintenance Reserve and £3,019 in the Donations Account and £418 in the Building Fund.  The year’s operations had a surplus of £1,791.  The improvement has been due to a greater number of patients and an increase in the number of patients in a Hospital Benefits Fund, which has greatly reduced bad debts.  The Board has plans to build four new private rooms, a duty room and a secretary’s office.  A master plan for future improvements is being worked out.  Daily patient numbers rose from average 10.1 in 1962-63 to 14.9.  [Sic: but presumably this must be to 14.9 in 1962-63.]  Outpatients rose from 430 to 454.  Births fell to 59.

[Acknowledgement was given to the Women’s Auxiliary and the Fund Raising Committee.]

Last year the cropping program raised £583.  Seasonal conditions have not permitted any seeding this year.  Improvements this year have been new cupboards, a new electric bell system, new mattresses, blankets and chairs and a range of new fittings and furnishings.  The surrounds were also improved.  Matron Fyfe and Secretary H.L. Foote continue to offer excellent and efficient service, as do the rest of the staff.  Over 900 polio injections were given in the year.
