Springbank Estate has been bought by the Government from W.H. Stevenson to be subdivided for closer settlement.  It comprises 4,652 acres of 1st class agricultural land.  It came on the market because Mr Stevensonâ€™s two sons have enlisted.  In the last nine years, which included the 1914 drought, he has averaged over 20 bushels per acre.  Two bores produce a splendid supply of water.
