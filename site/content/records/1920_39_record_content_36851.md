Mr J.A. Riggs has been handicapper since 1908 except for one or two short periods.

G.L. Nutt has been particularly notable as a marksman, winning a badge at Bisley in England in 1918 and coming 2nd of all the Australians competing.

[Other good scores are then listed along with an anecdote or two.]

On Saturday in the 11th stage of the Kookaburra Trophy the best scores were by H.G. Oates and R. Nutt.
