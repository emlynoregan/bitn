The Underwater Training Centre SA (UTCSA) has sent a submission to PIRSA on the Phoenix Mining proposal to conduct mineral exploration in the Burra Mine Reserve.

UTCSA is a major stakeholder and is totally dependent on the enclosed body of water in the Mine Pool.  Director Martin Phillips said they had been operating in Burra for the past ten years.  Dewatering of the mine area would mean a complete closure of the facility.  The school is on of only three commercial accredited occupational diver training organisations on the Australian mainland.  They maintain an ongoing supply of certified divers for the State’s aquaculture sector.  It arose when accident rates from recreationally trained divers caused WorkCover costs to rise.  Port Lincoln was initially chosen as the site, but a variety of problems, including sharks, prompted the move to an inland body of water with a more predictable and controlled environment.  There were two suitable sites in SA, but the other, Mt Gambier’s Blue Lake, was controlled by SA Water and was unavailable.  Property in Port Lincoln was sold and the move to Burra was made at considerable expense.  In recent times a process of infrastructure expansion has been undertaken, which would be largely complete within twelve months.  If the reserve status of the area were to be lifted their expansion plans would immediately have to be stopped.  They were poised to become an export industry with the potential to continue for many years.  The provision of services to international students has begun and is likely to grow.  The centre co-exists very well with the heritage aspects of the mine site.  UTCSA has observed widely fluctuating water levels, especially in summer, which suggests the aquifer is under stress and this would have implications for surrounding water users in the event of the dewatering of the pool.
