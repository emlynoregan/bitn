Burra Town Council, 3 May

Cr Harvey said he had not moved last meeting that the owner of the Smelts Chimney was to be asked to have it demolished and the report in the paper to that effect was wrong.

The Town Clerk reported that Mr J.G. Carpenter refused to demolish the Smelts Chimney, but agreed to have it fenced and to advertise that trespassers would be prosecuted.

The Mayor speculated about the councilâ€™s right to order demolition and about the possibility of a right-of-way existing on the land.

Cr Harvey said it was not long ago Council was urging the owners to preserve the chimney as a historic landmark.

The Mayor said that at that time it was in good repair.
