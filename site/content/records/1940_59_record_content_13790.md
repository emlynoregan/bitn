Burra Town Council, 17 May

Senator P.A. McBride & Mr Duncan-Hughes MHR reply to the protest about one sale day per month.  The protest will be presented to Mr Dedman Director of Manpower and he will be asked, if manpower is not being saved, to permit a return to the fortnightly sales.  Mr Dedman wrote assuring the Council their concerns would receive his fullest consideration.

The Burra Institute Committee advised it would not be possible to make another doorway alongside the present door to the Council Chamber.  This would involve narrowing the steps to the dress circle contrary to the Amusement Act.

A.L. Bence writes an article of about Â½ column explaining the Quotaring System.  It is necessary to limit sales as replacement stock is hard to get and they themselves are on quotas from mills and warehouses.  Without quotas he says they would have to close within six months.
