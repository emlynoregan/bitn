Let’s Not Forget, a book recording the obituaries of the Burra District 1848-1976 has been completed and published.  It has been a mammoth task under the auspices of the Burra Community Library Board.  Some nine volunteers have waded through microfiche [actually microfilm] copies of the Burra Record and then typists, followed by proof readers took over.  There are over 6,500 entries in the 75 page book.  It retails for $25 from the library.  [Photo of Debbie Brown and Colin Fidock with the book.]
