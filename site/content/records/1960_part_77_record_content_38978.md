St Mary’s Ecumenical Service on Sunday required extra seating in the church.  After a fine service the congregation crowded the Parish Hall to farewell Rev. Sibly and his family.  Robert Reed called on the Mayor to speak.  Mr Baulderstone said Mr Sibly had served as a Councillor for almost a year and had been a wonderful asset to the town.  Mr Stanley Hawker spoke for the other centres and Mrs Matthews spoke for the Ladies’ Guild.  Mr Bob Farrow spoke of the wonderful spirit of co-operation between Methodists and Anglicans in the community and thanked Mr Sibly for his ready help in all things.  Mr Tom Perry spoke as a Warden.
