The Season had a late start and winter was cold and wet, but despite its late start there has generally been a reasonable harvest.  Canola has done very well and the acreage sown is likely to increase this year.  Wheat and barley results have been variable.  Lighter rainfall areas to the north did less well.

BCS.  87% of Year 12 students achieved their SACE and seven of the eight students were offered their first choice at either a university of TAFE.
