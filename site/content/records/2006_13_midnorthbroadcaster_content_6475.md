Bill Overell of the Burra Hotel has accepted a dare to wear a dress to the Melbourne Cup Luncheon in the Burra Town Hall.  The hotelâ€™s dining room is traditionally closed on Cup Day while the staff attends the Town Hall Luncheon.  The dare is based on the following:

If $250 is donated Bill will wear a dress to the Town Hall.

If $350 is donated he will also wear it to the Commercial Hotel when he places his bets on the race.
