First ATM for Burra.  A private cash machine is to be installed in the Commercial Hotel in three or four weeksâ€™ time.  Publicans Ian & Linda Williamson say it will provide a much-needed cash service to locals and visitors alike, especially for transactions after normal working hours.  It will be installed in the hallway between the bar and the gaming room.  Another Burra hotel is also considering installing one.
