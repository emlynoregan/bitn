Mr R. Alexander, in proposing a toast at Yankalilla on 29 August in connection with a ploughing match, made the point that the colony of SA would make more progress in mining if the regulations were changed.  At present a man wanting a licence to mine had to pay £40 in instalments before he could remove any ore at grass.  It would make more sense – as in South America – for the Government to impose a royalty of say 2%.  As it is there are many heaps of ore at grass that will not move because the miner cannot pay the £40.
