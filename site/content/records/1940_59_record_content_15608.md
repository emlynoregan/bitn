Obituary.  Mrs Mary Brown died at Burra Hospital 21 November.  She was born at Leasingham near Clare on 8 March 1869, the daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Dunning of that district and was married on 2 November 1889 to George Brown of Jamestown who died in October 1928.  She came to live in Burra North many years ago.  Five of the six sons saw active service in the Great War.  She and her daughters Maude & May were keen supporters of the Soldiersâ€™ Aid Society.  She was also a member of Burra North Red Cross & FFCF up to her death.  Her youngest son and seven grandsons enlisted in the present campaign and the son and one grandson have recently been discharged leaving the six others on active service.  One son died as a result of the war, some years after his return.  She had been failing for some time and died of heart failure in her sleep.  Five sons and two daughters survive: Tom (Baldina), George (Adelaide), Harry (Gum Creek), Clarrie (Adelaide), Walter (Jamestown), Maude (Adelaide) & May Mrs Clarrie Woodman (Burra North).  There are a number of grandchildren.  [Born Mary Dunning 8 March 1868 near Auburn.]
