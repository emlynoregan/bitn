Utica Coppermining Co.  2nd half-yearly meeting was held in the Dramatic Clubrooms, Kooringa, on Wednesday last.  (For the period ending 14 August 1914.)

No. 2 shaft is now at 100’.  No. 1 shaft at 100’ with a crosscut south 33’ and driving on the lode N-W 23’ and S-E 90’.  Indications are that the lode will continue.  Sinking of a winze a further 100’ has been retarded by water and has gone only 16’.  The installation of an 8 h.p. engine and deep well pump is almost completed and will cope with 6,000 gallons per hour.  Prospects have attracted a £300 Government grant.

On the motion of Mr Fuss the directors were thanked and a motion of confidence in them was carried.
