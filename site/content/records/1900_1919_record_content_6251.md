Editorial on the recent death at the Burra Hospital.  [See report of the inquest]

On 18 August John Stoddart who had been for some time a rabbiter at Gumbowie was brought to the hospital.  He was in Petersburg for two days before being picked up by the police unconscious and locked up and charged with drunkenness.  The officer admitted the deceased was very weak.  He was subsequently fined 5/- which he paid.  On saying he was ill he was allowed to spend a couple of hours in a cell, but was sent on his way as night approached.  A couple of hours later he was found lying in the back yard of a private house and this time arrested for lunacy.  He was discharged and ordered to the Burra Hospital for treatment.  He died a few hours after being admitted.  The post mortem showed he had a fractured skull.  The vague evidence given at the inquest does not account for his movements in his last day or two at Petersburg and this needs investigation.  The police do not know where he got the drink or if anyone had seen him at Petersburg.  They say anyone could be beaten up at Petersburg without the police knowing.  It is a thousand pities he was sent away from the police cell, for the next time the police saw him he was practically dead.  This pitiable case needs to have its circumstances ventilated.  [The editor clearly felt the police had acted very poorly in writing the deceased off as just another drunk without noticing any injury or concerning themselves that he might be suffering from an illness.]
