Fire.  On Sunday just before going to bed J. Lewis noticed smoke in his house and on investigating found all was safe except the door to the servantâ€™s room was closed and upon opening it he found the room thick with smoke.  The bed was smouldering.  The girl was got out of bed and the fire extinguished.

A few more minutes and she would have been suffocated and probably the house destroyed.  She had been reading with a candle on the bed and had dozed off.
