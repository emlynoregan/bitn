Burra Football Association meeting at Farrell’s Flat on Wednesday

There is a lengthy report on the discussion on the handling of the matter which led to Mr Kellaway’s resignation as an umpire.

There was a motion for the final to be played at Farrell’s Flat and dissent and an amendment for it to be at Burra.  The motion was carried.

[Many of the difficulties of the Association seem to have resulted from the technicalities of procedures and rules.]

‘Goal Post’ writes placing the reason for the Burra Football Association’s problems in the hands of the delegates who strive for their own club’s interests alone.  Mt Bryan withdrew because they didn’t like the umpires.  Hallett because they can’t get a team together and now Farrell’s Flat and Aberdeen present threats of withdrawing.  The writer marvels at the curious finals system.  Also in the second round Kooringa play no home games, but make two trips to Farrell’s Flat and two to Aberdeen.  Gate receipts alone will drop £40 as a result.  He also explains the financial foolishness of a final at Farrell’s Flat where the gate won’t even pay for the umpire from Adelaide.
