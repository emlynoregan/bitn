Steve Reeves writes to thank RAG for answering some of his queries put in a recent letter.  RAG has no affiliation or association with the Council, has no chairperson, secretary or treasurer, and Ms Helen Szuty is their spokesperson.  They meet monthly on Thursday s prior to Council meetings, but could not supply minutes, do not have a constitution and are attempting to become incorporated.  They are not happy with all the decisions of Council, especially as Burra [Ward] rates continue to be the highest in the state.  They oppose the sale of assets and the Goyder Sports and Community Centre Project.
