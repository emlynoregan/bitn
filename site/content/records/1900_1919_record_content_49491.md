Obituary.  Bertie S. Williams died on 24 January aged 13.  He was the eldest son of John Williams of Hampton.  [Bertie Simon Williams born 5 July 1903 Redruth.]

He was thrown from his horse and landed on his head, but appeared to be largely uninjured.  He was not taken ill until a fortnight later and then died within two hours.  A blood clot on the brain is believed to have been the cause.
