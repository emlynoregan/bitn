Burra History.  Thomas Parks says when he came to Burra in 1850 the mine was in full swing and hundreds were employed.  Scores of bullock teams were carting ore to Adelaide.  It was common to see bullocks yoked to wagons lying down all over Market Square while owners waited for loading or prepared for the journey.  The hills were scrubby and were cleared for private as well as mine use.  On one occasion it became dark at 3 p.m. and lamps had to be lit.  [Presumably from dust, though the article doesn’t say why.]  A large number of blackfellows were camped about the place where O’Leary’s butcher shop now stands.
