Burra Show was held last Saturday.  The new covered sheep pavilion attracted the greatest number of exhibits seen for years.  Exhibits of wool are thought to be in excess of the number at the Royal Show.  The weather was not good, with rain at intervals in the morning and a cold wind.  Nevertheless gate receipts were up Â£10.  The weather improved through the day and overall the show was a success.  There were more sideshows, but they were considered less spectacular than in 1951.  Entries for ring events were well up.  There were nearly 2,000 exhibits in the pavilions and the quality was well up to standard.
