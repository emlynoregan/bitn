Air Force Association

A Branch of the Air Force association was formed in Burra on Wednesday evening 10 July.  Officers from the Associationâ€™s Executive Committee attended.  The Past president Mr Kilsby said the Association had been formed in 1917 by 30 members of the Air Force of WWI.  In the last war it had done much to work for the benefit of members of the RAAF in supplying recreation equipment for example.  The Welfare Officer Mr McKenzie said the Association had a list of employers who requested the services of former RAAF personnel and had placed many in suitable positions.  There was a membership of 12,000 in SA and over 120,000 in Australia.  The Burra Branch was the 8th to be formed in country districts in the past two months.  A committee of ten was elected and the meeting adjourned for musical items and refreshments.  On the following Friday officers were elected: President, B.A. Riggs; Vice-President, W. Young; Secretary, R.C. Lott; Assistant Secretary, A.J. Hill; Treasurer, T. Secker and Welfare Officer, J. Goodridge.
