Telstra’s CDMA mobile phone network is due to be shut down on 28 January.  Customers need to change their CDMA phones before then to avoid being stranded without a service.  Digital CDMA replaced the old analogue network by Telstra in 2000.  The Next G network will replace it, with Telstra claiming it covers 98.9% of the population – as long as the correct utilities are utilised.
