Football.  On Thursday last an informal discussion took place between representatives of the Kooringa and Aberdeen Clubs and the Gymnasium members.  The Gymnasium committee wanted to discuss the possibility of three clubs in the town.  Their idea was to take six players from Kooringa, six from Aberdeen and six Gymnasium players to form the new team.  Mr Jackson (Gymnasium) said he understood that such a move would involve rescinding some of the rules of the Association and that there would be problems over transfers and clearances.

Mr Moyses said Kooringa had not met this year, but there was some feeling about that if it was going to be Kooringa and Aberdeen this year, Kooringa would not reform and bringing in another team might be wise.

Mr Willshire for Aberdeen said they had no objection to a third team.

The grounds could be Victoria Park.

Discussion ended with general agreement that such a move was possible.  The Gymnasium now has to consult its members and apply to the Association.
