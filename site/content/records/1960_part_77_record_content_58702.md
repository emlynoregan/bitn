By November 1869 they were labelled ‘The Darling Bushrangers’.  On 9 November they bailed up a hawker Charles Young and when he asked who they were Bertram boasted that he was Billy Bertram who had robbed O’Brien and taken four horses from Murchison Station.  After threatening to blow out his brains, they robbed Young of $100 and rifled his van for guns and stores.  This made them guilty of robbery under arms, leading to their being declared outlaws, each with a price of $100 on his head.  After robbing Young they separated.

Bertram was finally captured late in 1870 near Cobham Lake where he was living in an Aboriginal camp.  By this time he was wanted for murder, having killed the same Charles Young he had previously threatened.  He was tried at Wilcannia and hanged at Bathurst Gaol early in 1871.

Baker eluded police for nearly two years and was undone by his arrogance.  L-Cpl Smith heard news that Baker was en route from the Barrier Ranges with a small band of stolen horses.  He had known Baker a few years earlier at Burra.  Baker, travelling without disguise, arrived after dark on Sunday evening.  On Monday he went to the barber’s shop in Kooringa [In 1971 Bert Beinke’s Paper and Book Shop] and asked for a hair cut and to have his hair dyed red.  The barber refused to dye it and Baker abused the barber for taking so long about cutting it.  Baker then walked to Redruth with two other men and sat down outside the court to cut up tobacco for his pipe.  The court was a cheap source of entertainment for idlers, sight-seers and moral busy-bodies in Victorian times and so the place was crowded.  When Smith and Noble approached him and declared he was arrested, Baker attempted to escape, but was chased and brought back.

He was placed in one of the cells behind the police station after a violent struggle.  They found a revolver in his swag, but no arms on his person.  The next day he was taken to Redruth Gaol and within a few days was planning his escape.  [To be continued.]
