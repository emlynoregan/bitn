Dr R.P. Oswald writes outlining the gradual decline in the numbers of volunteers in the St John Ambulance Service.  It has reached a crisis point with only eleven volunteers and this jeopardises the continuation of the service.   If it fails the ambulance would have to come from Clare.  Expect at least an hourâ€™s delay and with only two ambulances to serve Clare and Burra, perhaps more.  A Clare ambulance will also be more likely to transport the case to Clare, jeopardising another Burra service by bypassing the Burra Hospital.
