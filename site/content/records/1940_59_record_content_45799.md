Obituary.  Brian Partridge aged 12 of Ware St was electrocuted on Friday about 7.40 a.m.   He grasped the handle of the pump on the underground tank, put an arm around the pump post and fell over.  His brother Roy picked him up and took him inside.  Dr Heddle was called and pronounced him dead.  M-C Chambers and the Burra Electric Supply Co.’s L. Bourman investigated.  They found an active was leaking to a short piece of conduit, which was through the iron roof of the back rooms of the house.  A galvanised down pipe connected the roof with the tank’s galvanised cover.  When Brian grasped the handle of the pump his leg touched the gutter of the tank and completed the circuit.  Mr S. Kellaway JP deemed an inquest unnecessary.  [Brian Leaford Partridge died 26 May 1950.]
