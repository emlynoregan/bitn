Bachli Bros. Bakers respond to the Council’s call for bread deliveries.

Bread delivery in Burra is not practical because:

By motor it is not possible because motor vehicle restrictions still exist.

The horse float is impractical as we have been unable to obtain tyres and tubes.

The Council wrote a threatening letter and we leave it to the public to judge whether it merited a reply – it ended:

‘failing a favourable reply the Council feels it can do no other than seek opposition.’

Burra bread consumption is less than 400 loaves per day and past experience shows too many bakers are neither good for the town nor the bakers concerned.  If the Council would like to buy our business we invite them to enter into negotiations.  As for wrapping bread; though restrictions have been lifted, we have been unable to obtain supplies of paper.
