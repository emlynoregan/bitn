Kooringa, 8 September.

The Anniversary services at the Primitive Methodist Chapel were preached by Rev. J.S. Wayland on Sunday to a large congregation.  Proceedings from the services and the tea meeting were about £40.

Wool is now arriving steadily at the railway station.  Seven teams arrived yesterday.

Howorth’s Hibernica and Comedy Co. appeared at Lamb’s Assembly Rooms [Burra Hotel] on Tuesday evening before a large crowd.  The scenery was admired and the performers were applauded.  [Hibernica seems to suggest an Irish flavour for the entertainment.]

Shearing is going on steadily.
