Unemployment Meeting in the Council Chamber on Tuesday last week.

The mayor explained The Council was doing what it could and had decided at its meeting the previous night to apply for a special grant of £200 for main roadwork.

There were 48 names on the petition.

The mayor said the quarries were fully working with c. 30 men employed.

Mr Turley said he believed locals had been neglected with men from Port Pirie etc. working on relaying the local railway line.

The Mayor said the town had no debt and if it borrowed there would have to be an increase in tax [i.e. rates]

Mr Geach thought a loan a good idea.

Mr Lawn thought they should exhaust the Government grant first.

The mayor thought they should not be afraid to borrow if it was still needed after their income and the Government grant had been expended.

Mr Thamm moved they urge the Government to get on with enlarging the town reservoir at once.

Mr Phillips thought that married men should be employed locally and single men be expected to go further afield.

Mr Lawn said some single men support families.

Since the meeting work has been found but the report is not very clear about how many and with whom.

[It seems to say 10 married men offered jobs relaying the railway line and 30 men, including single men with dependants could be put on. (Apparently at the same job.)

In the next paper the Mayor’s report makes it clear that it meant that 30 men, married and single, were taken on the railway relay gang.]
