Apology

‘ . . . we understand the said advertisement has caused Mr Joseph Cartwright much uneasiness, and we are indeed very sorry it was published.  Mr Cartwright has not asked us for an apology, but in all fairness to him we offer him an unqualified one and can assure him that the advertisement was not inserted in the slightest vindictive spirit, or with a tinge of malice towards him as far as we were concerned, and we are willing to assist him in any way possible to clear his character of the serious reflection cast upon it.’
