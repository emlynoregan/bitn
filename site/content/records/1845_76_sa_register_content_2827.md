The South Australian Mining Association

The recent occurrences at the Burra Burra Mines are well known to our readers and will make the half-yearly meeting of shareholders a more than ordinarily interesting occasion.  We would ill perform our duty if we did not again express our unbiased views of the actions of the Directors.

We have no doubt that a dividend will be declared, but will the Directors dare to challenge a vote of confidence or censure?

We fear not, though there is no other way they can escape the odium of their unpopular measures, which have jeopardized the welfare of the colony.

A recent letter from Kooringa says there is a resolute strike of all the underground men and that in a few days the surface men will follow.

If , as a consequence the whems [sic: whims] stop, the water level will rise from the 30 fathom level to the 20 fathom level.  The inundation of the intervening levels will sweep away timberwork and materials.  Until recently about 20 men were employed in assisting the timber men underground and in repairing supports in shafts and levels.  Kingston’s Shaft is described as in a very weak state and Graham’s Shaft passes through troublesome ‘country’ and an extensive and heavy ‘run’ took place near the bottom.  These are the two deepest shafts and if they fail it will prevent copper raising from below.  It will cost thousands of pounds to effectively substitute other shafts [or repair those].

We do not need further evidence that the scale of wages published by the Directors is very insufficient, but already many of the best men have left for New Zealand and others await only invitations to depart.

One intelligent correspondent writes that:

The miners are fast moving away.

I do not think many would remain even if their requests were granted, so thoroughly disgusted are they with the Directors.

Many are of the opinion that the whole thing is a swindle – a manoeuvre to sell the proprietors and buy the property.

All thought is but for self, and none for the miners, or the storekeepers or others who have built on the property.

Too much cannot be said of the moderation shown by the miners.

Share prices and dividends must fall.  There is not 10,000 tons of ore at grass that will pay to be sent home.

Strange revelations will be made when Mr Burr’s action comes on.

Another correspondent writes:

Business continues at a complete standstill.

No work is going on at the mine except the dressing of ore at grass.

In the taking of a pile to dress no competition is allowed; the men have agreed that should the Captain and the men who made the first offer not agree then no one will take that work at a lower rate.

About 400 of the miners have formed a club, each member paying 1/- weekly towards a fund to support poorer families while the strike lasts.

No assistance has yet been required.

They consider themselves prepared to hold out for about six months.

The Directors may fortify themselves in their resolve, but it is morally impossible they can exonerate themselves from the devastating mischief, which is likely to follow from their recklessness.

The interruption to the carriage operations is another aspect of the dilemma.  We hear that the drayman’s actions are likely to produce a serious loss to the Association due to heavy demurrages to which the detained shipping will be entitled under their charter-parties.

These successive strikes have arisen from dogged mismanagement.  ‘If it is possible that there is anything approaching chicanery in all this; we hope it will be unsparingly exposed and denounced.’
