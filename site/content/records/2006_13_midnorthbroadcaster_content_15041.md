World’s End Gorge has been undergoing substantial restoration of vegetation and amenity over the past 18 months.  More than 80% of recently planted trees have survived and many planted in previous years have grown well and have made a good contribution to the reclamation of areas damaged by off-road vehicles.  Local schools and interest groups have carried out the work.  A local initiative has seen the formation of the World’s End Action Group. (WEAG)  This is supported by the SA Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources, Management Board (SA MDBNRM) and the Department for Environment, Water and Natural Resources.
