Diprotodon Skeleton Found

Robert Heading, an amateur palaeontologist has discovered the fossilised remains of a giant diprotodon near Burra.  Diprotodons were the largest marsupials that ever lived and weighed up to two tonnes.  They lived in Australia and New Zealand.  The find has interested researchers from Flinders University and the SA Museum, who will visit the site today and assess the skeletonâ€™s suitability for display purposes.  The fossil could be up to 40,000 years old.
