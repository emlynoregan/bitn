Hallett Seismology Station was installed in 1962.  It is unattended except for regular visits by Mrs Hughes who collects the paper sheets on which the information is recorded.  The records are changed daily and sent to Adelaide weekly for analysis.  The most recent significant earth tremor was on 14 June 1979 â€“ the first felt in Hallett for a number of years.
