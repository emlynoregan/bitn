Burra Cemetery. The final article in the series by F.W. Holder. 
The author considers it is ‘not a place one would choose for joyous meditation at all times’ and comes to the conclusion that cremation would be a preferable way to dispose of bodies. But as long as we have cemeteries they should be as pleasing as possible and arranged to suggest peace, rest and beauty. Not because he considered it ‘desirable to encourage the practice of making the cemetery a place [to] walk, for of all places it is the most unsuitable and unhealthy for such use. 
‘Casual Sunday afternoon strolls through the Cemetery are entirely out of good taste and nothing can more grate upon the susceptibilities of those who hold dear the memory of any resting there, than to see a mixed throng carelessly reading the inscriptions, commenting on the character of the monuments, or laughing and playing among the dead far better if the cemetery were not thrown open so publicly as it is for health, propriety and many other reasons.’ 
Mr Wells, the late curator laboured for many years to maintain it in a good condition, but since his times the Corporation has been in control and his care is sadly missed. The writer then suggests that a garden cemetery would be preferable to stark bare ground with regimented rows of graves, or a weed infested wilderness. The cemetery needs expanding and SAMA has agreed to allow expansion towards the creek, but they are very slow in arranging the deeds. Also some sort of structure is needed to provide a place for services in extreme heat or wet conditions or where the danger of contagion makes it undesirable to have the coffin in the church. A large trellis arbour open at both ends and well surrounded with creepers and well roofed would suit admirably.
