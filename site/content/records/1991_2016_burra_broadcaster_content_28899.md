Burra Show

Photography exhibits have been sent to Adelaide for judging.

Outstanding Colour Print – Marie Henson.

There will be a host of food outlets, including:

Cool Cone

Renardo Pasta Van

Home style Hot Food

Trina’s Country Style Pancakes

Grundy’s Baked Potatoes

Burra Kindergarten’s van of ice creams, drinks and show-bags

Show Hall for a sit-down luncheon

Rural Watch for a barbecue.

President Ron Shipard says the show is changing.  The machinery and car dealers are becoming more centralised and unwilling to display at smaller shows, so the emphasis is mainly on entertainment

Horses-in-action

Indoor exhibits

Specialist trade sites
