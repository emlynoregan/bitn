Obituary.  Rex Bown, the only child of Mr & Mrs Alfred Bown of Springbank, died at Burra hospital after an operation for appendicitis.  He was a fine looking, well built boy who looked older than his years and was very popular with his schoolmates for his manly qualities and good behaviour.  Many children from Copperhouse School attended the funeral and over 50 cars composed the cortege, which left the residence of his aunt Miss Netta Bown on Monday afternoon, and scholars and staff of the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School lined the path to the grave.  [Rex Alfred Bown born 11 March 1923 Adelaide: died 13 January Burra, residence Springbank near Burra.]
