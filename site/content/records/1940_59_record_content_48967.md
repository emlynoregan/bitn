Burra Hospital

The Chairman of the Board and J. Gebhardt of the Building Appeal Committee, with G.S. Hawker MP, waited on the Chief Secretary, Hon. A.L. McEwin, on Wednesday, concerning the subsidy for the hospital.  They said the present building was inadequate for modern surgical requirements, patient comfort and for nurse accommodation.  The Chief Secretary said he saw nothing wrong with the proposed plan, estimated at c. £73,000 and the Government would give a £ for £ subsidy on an approved plan.  Some further information concerning drainage was needed.  The proposal would have to go to the Works Committee for approval.  The Government subsidy would not be paid all at once, but would be spread over the building period and also the supply of materials would be difficult.
