Burra Men’s Shed.  Darryl Venning and a hard-working team are busy preparing their premises on Smelts Road for the establishment of a community oriented Men’s Shed.  Sixteen men attending a meeting in September expressed their interest in the idea and ten others phoned in support.  Grants are being sought for the $5,000 to wire the place for safety reasons and more for saws, drills, etc. that go with woodwork etc.
