The Plains East of Burra

[This is a reprint of an article from The Register of 22 August 1898.  It was supplied by N. Hiles Pearse and the suggestion is that it is equally applicable to August 1933.]

Hon. G. McGregor MLC, Messrs R.W. Foster, I. MacGillivray, L.W. Peake, J. Hutchinson & W. O. Archibald and press representatives visited the Eastern Plains at the invitation of Messrs E.C. Lockyer, W.P. Barker, H. Scott, F.T. Jones, T.H. Pearse and P.L. Killicoat, to see the state of the country in the recent drought.  They arrived by the Broken Hill express on Thursday evening and were conveyed to the town by a ramshackle old bus and stayed half at Nankervis’s Burra Hotel and half at Vivian’s Commercial Hotel.  They left at 7.30 a.m. Friday in three traps and were met at Baldina by Messrs Barker and Jones each in a buggy and the party divided between the five traps and proceeded by different routes.  They met several teamsters trying to make a living by carting wood.  The futility of farming in the district has been proved beyond doubt.  This and overstocking in earlier days has led to a barren landscape across [which] the wind blows and carried away the top soil leaving a surface like a claypan or in places gravel.  If caught in the worst brickfielders drivers cannot see the heads of their horses.  Dust penetrates houses to an alarming extent and fine houses have been abandoned as unliveable.  Nothing can stop the drift from filling in dams or piling up to make vermin-proof fences useless by burying them.  Friday was a beautiful day.  Sheep were rarely seen and few birds except for a soaring eagle and a few crows.  An occasional rabbit.  Mr J.H. Angas’s holding came from buying out a lot of small farmers, but now no stock is on his property.  Mr McBride’s country is vermin-proof fenced and we halted at the dams.  One was completely silted up and the other contains only about two feet of water when full.  There have been no good rains for five years.  Country worth £1 to 30/- per acre is not now worth 2/6.

Mr Scott had Redcliffe 40 miles from Burra (now Mr T. McBride’s).  It comprises c. 60,000 acres: 2 blocks perpetual lease and 1 with right of purchase.  Costs are impossible on this.  Rent is 1d odd a mile, there is a land tax on the right of purchase leases, assessed at high value, interest on the vermin-proof fencing and in many cases a district rate as well.

It is impossible to say why this country was ever cut up into Hundreds and put under District Council control.  Mr Scott said there had been no lambing for five years.

(To be continued.)
