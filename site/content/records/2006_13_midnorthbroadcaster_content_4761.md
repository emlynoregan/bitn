BCS joins the rest of the state’s schools in banning junk food.  Food items are divided into ‘Green’ – recommended daily, ‘Amber’ – to be offered only on certain days and in smaller servings, and ‘Red’ – soft drinks, chips, chocolate, cake and pies, which are to be offered on not more than two occasions per term for celebrations.  One of the most commented on banned items has been iced coffee.
