Patriotic Rally, Tuesday last

There was a good attendance despite the short notice.  Members of the RSL occupied front seats.

Mrs H.J.B. Jennison began by singing Land of Hope & Glory.

The Mayor read a reply from the Governor to the town’s telegram.  He led off with a patriotic speech outlining the need to contain Hitler.

P.L. Rosman than sang Pack Up Your Troubles.

Dr Steele then addressed the crowd outlining the history of events leading up to the outbreak of war.

Rev. J.A. Andrews followed and urged all to place their faith in God.

Guy Dollman then sang The Veteran’s Song.

Dr Tohl of St Joseph’s then spoke urging unity in support of England & the Empire.

Mrs Max Pearce sang Australia Will Be There.

H.J.B. Jennison spoke of the failure of efforts to appease Hitler and of the freedom for which they and England were now fighting.  He urged calmness and hard work and preparedness and expressed the possibility of dangers which might soon come from a source ‘not far from Australia’s front door’.

Graham Dow sang Sons of the Sea.

Mr Stanley Hawker spoke, thanking previous speakers.  Addressing those who would not go overseas to fight he said that the Liberty of Australia depended on the supremacy of England and her navy and it was better to fight on someone else’s soil than your own.  He then thanked the singers and moved a vote of thanks.
