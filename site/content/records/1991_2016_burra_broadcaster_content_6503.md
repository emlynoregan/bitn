John Oates

Aged 37 and married to Jackie, with two children

The family has been in the Burra District for three generations on a grazing property

Been on Council 1987-91, which term provided valuable experience

Major Concerns are:

The securing of a stable and financially secure district for future generations

Encouragement of small businesses

Maintenance of pressure to see the Burra-Morgan Road sealed

Finding the right balance in the expenditure of electorsâ€™ rates

Tourism is the icing on the cake, but the backbone of the community is the rural community and therefore their needs come first

Without the rural community the town would lose its doctor, hospital, school, banks, etc.

A Tennis Club member for 15 years

Member of Burra Golf Club for 18 years

Member of the Burra Picnic Race Club for 11 years and currently serving three years as Secretary-Treasurer.
