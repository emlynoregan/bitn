Mr T. Kallio’s car rolled over onto its side when a tyre blew out opposite Mr T. Lehmann’s residence.

Mr R. West collided with a stationary vehicle on the Pig and Whistle Ford on Saturday evening.  His car was badly damaged.

Mr H. Pyke was driving his panel van from the bakehouse towards the main street on Friday, when the steering arm broke on the bridge near Mr O. Oates’ property.  The van smashed through the railing and into the creek, where it turned over and ended with its four wheels in the air.  Apart from the shock, Mr Pyke was not hurt.

Mr & Mrs Hurtle Scott were proceeding along the Baldina Road on Saturday and when negotiating the turn-off to Morgan, some four miles out, the door flew open and Mrs Scott was thrown out and dragged some feet before Mr Scott could stop.  She is confined to her bed with bruising and abrasions.
