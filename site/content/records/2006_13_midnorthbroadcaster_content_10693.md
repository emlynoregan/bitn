Burra Lions Club may be reborn after an absence of fifteen years.  A meeting is called for Tuesday 7 September at BCS staff room to gauge community interest in such a move.  District Chairman Don Pritchard of Clare Lions Club said the response from 200 letters sent to residents was encouraging.  The Burra Lions Club has been closed since 1995.  During its existence it was responsible for planting trees along Smelts Road, work at the Burra North Playground, bench seating at the Burra Sporting Complex, a Day Care Centre TV and recorder and the walking track between Burra and Burra North.
