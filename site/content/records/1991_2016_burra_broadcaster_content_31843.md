Pet Kangaroos Killed.  One night last week two dogs that had escaped from the Council’s pound killed the seven kangaroos at Chris and Maria Reed’s and maimed a further six sheep belonging to Henry Lunn, so that they had to be destroyed.  The oldest of the kangaroos had been at Reed’s for more than 15 years.  There have been kangaroos on the Morehead Street property for most of the years since the 1920s.  The kangaroos will be replaced.
