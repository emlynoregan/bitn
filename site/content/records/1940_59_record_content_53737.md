Obituary.  HM King George VI died on 6 February aged 56.  Burra heard the news of the death with deep regret.  All flags are at half mast.  At the pictures on Saturday night the Mayor asked the audience to observe a minuteâ€™s silence in respect for the late King.  A National Day of Mourning will be observed on Friday next and in Burra there will be a Civic Memorial Service in the Town Hall at 11 a.m. conducted by the Burra Ministers Fraternal.  The Mayor will introduce the theme of the service and the MP for the District, Mr G. Stanley Hawker, will attend.

[Albert Frederick Arthur George, who ascended the throne 11 December 1936 as George VI, was the second son of King George V and was born 14 December 1895.]
