Salvation Army.  The Young Persons’ Anniversary services were held recently.  The Wednesday before last Major Leggett, Divisional Young Persons’ Secretary, arrived in Burra.  He visited the Legion and Youth Group and conducted the Ladies’ Home League on Thursday and chaired the Youth Rally program in the evening.  On Saturday Adjutant Cox (sister to Captain Cox) conducted the Children’s Anniversary.  This busy period ended with the Annual Picnic which took the form of a War-time picnic with the children carrying their own supplies to the Burra North Playground where games and races were held.
