Accident.  A truck driven by Karlif Janmeijf, a building contractor of Murray Park, was being driven to Radium Hill when it overturned on Monday between Mt Bryan and Hallett.  A man in the back of the truck was thrown clear and three in the front seat scrambled clear.  Only one of the passengers, Olafa Snepts, had his fingers so badly damaged that amputation was necessary.
