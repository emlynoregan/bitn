County Burra, Hundred 281 lies north of H. of Mongolata and south of the H. of Wonna and east of the H. of Hallett. 1/4 is rough scrubby country and the rest open saltbush and bluebush. The plains areas are fairly grassed.

[It was proclaimed the H. of Tomkinson on the 18 September 1879: named after Samuel Tomkinson MLC, a member of the Upper House from 1885-1900 and manager of the Bank of Australasia in Adelaide.]
