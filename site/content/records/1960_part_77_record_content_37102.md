Burra Hospital.  The demolition of the old hotel section is almost complete and excavation work is in progress.  Some 2,000 cubic yards of rubble has been handled.  Excavation work will allow continuation of the one floor level for the new building.  In the last four years district residents have contributed about $16,000 including $11,000 for Phase I.  Subsidised by the Government, this represents a total of roughly $50,000.  Phases I & II of the plan plus maintenance and repairs have amounted to well in excess of $100,000 with the balance coming from Hospital revenue and subsidies.  The complete value of the whole plan will amount to over $200,000.  This means the present donation when subsidised $15,000 will represent one sixth of the second $100,000.

Donations presently stand at $5,263.70.
