Editorial on the Burra Institute.  There are plans for a new membersâ€™ room.  The committee has decided to get specifications for a new room and has shelved ideas for a billiard room, at least for the near future.  The editor wonders whether the opposite choice might not have been better.  What, he asks, does the Institute really offer the young men of the town.  If the committee wants to attract young men it must supply something that will appeal to them.  The Institute needs to be a club combining instruction and amusement.  Once there they may be turned to other matters more profitable and elevating than billiards and such games.  The Burra Club points to the need of such a place.  The Institute should become a more popular resort for the younger people of the town even at the risk of incurring debt.
