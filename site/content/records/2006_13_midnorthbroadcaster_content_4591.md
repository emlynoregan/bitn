Nurses.  The Federal Government has offered a $6,000 incentive to get retired nurses to return to the job.  There is at present no shortage in Burra, but Clare has several vacancies.  Ms Leslie Phillips at Burra Centre of Lower North Health did not think the offer would have much of an immediate impact.  Many would need refresher courses.  Other comments have suggested that $6,000 may be an insufficient incentive.
