Goyder Council

Will discuss with Police and the Bon Accord Hotel management the problems associated with youth hanging around the streets after hours.  The sealed area near the hotel is a mixture of hotel land, council land and roadway.

Council has declined to provide public toilets at the saleyards/road train depot site.

Mayoral paintings and photos in Burra Town Hall are to be moved to the Art gallery for twelve months, following reports of damage.
