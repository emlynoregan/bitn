Brown’s original holding was 153 square miles with an annual rent of 15/- per square mile.  The lease was later reduced and the rent increased.

In 1878 the town was surveyed after an unsuccessful attempt to establish one midway between Burra and Booborowie.  Allotments sold for £5-5-0 for a quarter-acre block.

The Methodist Church was the original building in the town and for many years also served as the school.

The Catholic Church followed and for many years these were the only buildings in Booborowie, until North and South Booborowie Estates were sold.

Mr Charles Fahey opened the first store.

The Hotel was built and the licence transferred from Opie’s Hotel in Burra by the licensee, Alf. Taylor.  [1917]

A baker and butcher then appeared and a school, bank, store and blacksmith.

For many years entertainments were held in the Booborowie Woolshed, but in 1922 the local Hall was completed.

When a telephone line gave communication to trunk lines it was housed at the premises of Ted Wall, local postmaster and mail contractor and this service was carried on by his son-in-law Bob Morris, until the post office was removed to the township.

In the afternoon a visit was made to the home of Messrs Broad Bros, close to the original hut of the Brown Bros, where a re-enactment of SA’s proclamation was held in costume.  The group visited Master Colin Landorf on the way.  He is recovering from polio.  Then the children went to the Anglican Church where there is a plaque to the memory of the Brown Bros.  An excellent afternoon tea concluded the day’s activities.
