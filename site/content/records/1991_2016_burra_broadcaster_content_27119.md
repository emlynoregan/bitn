Goyder Council

Will erect signage at Mt Bryan to direct traffic to Sir Hubert Wilkins’ Homestead.

Mt Bryan Progress Association has been given permission to relocate Mt Bryan School playground equipment to the Sir Hubert Wilkins Memorial Park, provided they maintain, update and carry the public liability insurance.

Approval has been given for the re-roofing of the Burra Art Gallery at a cost of $11,800 from the Burra Capital Projects Fund.
