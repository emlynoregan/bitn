Burra Town Council, 18 March

Cr Dow moved his motion on notice that Clause 10 of the agreement with the Kooringa Tennis Club that prohibited play on Sundays and Good Friday be cancelled with the consent of the trustees.

The Mayor considered this important enough to be considered by full council.

The Town Clerk read the clause and said the agreement had five years to run.  He also confirmed that with the consent of the trustees a clause could be cancelled.

Cr Dow said the trustees were Messrs J. Barker, H.W. Tiver & Andrew Tennant.

He said he was not acting on behalf of the tennis clubs and that there were two factions for and against Sunday recreation and that some with no objections to Sunday play objected to play on Good Friday.  Cricket he said was played on Sundays and some people could only play on Saturdays and Sundays.  To prohibit Sunday play savoured he said of class legislation.  Not seconded.

Notice having been given Cr Jennison moved that the words Good Friday be deleted from the agreement with the Kooringa Tennis Club and Cr Riggs seconded this.

No agreement appeared to exist with the Aberdeen Club.

Cr Dow wanted to know why Good Friday and not Sunday should be deleted and why there was an agreement with Kooringa and not with Aberdeen.

He felt that he was trying to get through to Council that Good Friday was the basis of Christianity and the one day that should be held sacred above others.

Cr Jennison said he wanted the two agreements brought into line.  [Which two agreements?]

Cr Dowâ€™s motion would be the thin edge of the wedge for organised sport on Sunday.

Cr Riggs thought all the rest of the state played sport on Good Friday.

The Mayor said they played tennis everywhere on Sundays.
