Mrs J.P. Murphy was given a farewell morning tea at the Presbytery by Rev. Father Nesdale & Miss Nesdale.  The Mayoress and Mesdames J.C. Sandland, M.A. Phelan, George Hann & S.M. Lane attended and a wallet of fifty £1 notes was presented to the widow.  Friends had already presented her with a xylonite ‘toilet companion’.  Mrs Murphy intends to use the money for a small headstone in memory of her late husband.  She is moving to Victoria and left on Thursday afternoon.
