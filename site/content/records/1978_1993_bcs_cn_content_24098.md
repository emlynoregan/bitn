BCS.  Personal Profile: Kevin Fahey

I was educated at Parndana Area School, trained at Wattle Park Teachers College and have spent all but one year of my teaching career in the country.  T taught at Bordertown Primary in the late 1960s and early 1970s and then in Adelaide for one year before going to Port Broughton as Acting Principal.  In 1876 I was appointed to Andamooka as Deputy Principal and in 1981 became Principal when it was reclassified as a Special Rural School.  In 1987 I was appointed Principal of Roxby Downs Area School, from where I have come to Burra.  My wife Yvonne is from Bordertown.  We have two girls, Shannon and Cher, who are 19 and 17.  Both are now in Adelaide; Shannon in a bank and Cher studying nursing at Underdale.  I have formerly played many sports with a special love for football.  I now intend to take up golf again and spend time setting up my rock collection.  Yvonne has given up a job in a jewellery store and has a special interest in a variety of crafts and in gardening.
