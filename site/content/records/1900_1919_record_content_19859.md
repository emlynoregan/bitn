Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  It is almost six years since the Burra Burra Copper Co. took over from SAMA and at the time it was thought that mining would be revived, but despite many efforts nothing tangible has resulted.  A boring machine has now arrived on the scene from Kapunda and another is due in a week or two.  Boring operations will be commenced shortly.  A bore will be put down at the rear of the old blacksmithâ€™s shop.
