Royal Adelaide Show

For the second year in succession BCS students were fastest in the Briggs & Stratton Engine Teardown Competition on 7 September.  The competition involves dismantling and re-assembling and then starting a three horsepower Briggs & Stratton engine in the shortest possible time.  Jason white and Fraser Neill recorded the fastest time in the heats.  Damian Slade & Daniel Neill unfortunately could not get their engine started.

Jason and Fraser cruised to a comfortable victory in the finals, recording a time of 13 minutes 35 seconds, while the second team, from Reynella East, took about 19 minutes.

In the Lead Steers Competition BCS also did well.  There were 70 entries from schools across SA.

[Detailed results are printed.]

The leaders from BCS:

Petrice Messenger – Red Poll ‘Maleerlad’

Peter stockman – Shorthorn ‘Bundy’

Alex Stockman – South Devon ‘Whisky’

[Other team members are listed.]
