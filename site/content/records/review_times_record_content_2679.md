Burra Show.  Report of the President Mr Jock Duncan for 1985.

I feel the Burra Show is well balanced and offers something for everyone.  This yearâ€™s show will be opened by the Leader of the Opposition Mr John Olsen.

[The report then outlines the various sections in the 1985 show so that this is not really a report on 1985, but merely spruiking for the 1985 show.]

He does say that this year costs have risen and the Society had spent more than $3,000 in maintenance, sign-writing, upgrading of pavilions and bituminising roads.  He was confident that due to the show being on a long weekend, it would continue to attract visitors and so be a financial success.  He thanks in particular the secretary Mrs Jean Jamieson and also repeats the frequent error of mistakenly numbering the shows; in this case wrongly claiming the 1985 show is the 108th.
