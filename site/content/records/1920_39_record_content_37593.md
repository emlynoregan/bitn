This year the Government has advised there will be no subsidy from them, which means the society will have to find another £35.  The annual show was held on 22 October and was a significant change from the two-day show early in October.  The later date separated us better from the Adelaide Show.  There were a record number of entries.  Last year (1929) there was a loss of £22, but in 1930 there was a profit of £33.  Improvements for the year cost only £4-9-0 and this went on 100 new trees, of which 80 are still growing.  Elected were Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, S.H. Robinson & A.B. Riggs.
