In the week school children will be taught swimming under control of their teachers.  Twelve competent instructors have been appointed including Mr Thomas and two from the Education Department.  Mr Woollacott thanked all those who had given gifts and trophies for the carnival.  The carnival commenced with a spectacular dive into the pool from one of the high cliffs by Mr L. Winkley.  Results of events are printed.  There were no events for ladies, though in future we believe provision will be made.
