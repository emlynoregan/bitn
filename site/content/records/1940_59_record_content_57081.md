Obituary.  Walter Scott Murray, one of SA’s leading merino sheep breeders, died at his home Wootoona Terrace, St Georges on Friday 21 November aged 76.  For 50 years he was associated with Cappeedee Stud, Hallett, first as manager for his father and then as partner with his brothers and finally in partnership with his only son, John, who is the present manager.  The stud was founded in 1843.  Mr Murray was born [8 May] 1876 at Rhine Park, [Kongolia from 1918] Eden Valley and educated at St Peter’s College and Roseworthy.  He took over management of Cappeedee in 1902 and married Miss Goddard in 1904.  The reputation of ‘Murray’ merinos grew under his direction and they were much sought after in SA, WA, NZ and South Africa.  He was a past president of the SA Stockowners’ Assoc. and of the SA Stud Merino Breeders Assoc.  He has also been a Chairman of Hallett DC.  He was also much interested in the Masonic Lodge.
