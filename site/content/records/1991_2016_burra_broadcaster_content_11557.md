Council Amalgamation.  Public meeting at Hallett.  186 people attended.

Hallett Council Chairman Peter Mattey said that the Council recommended amalgamation with Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda after lengthy debate and negotiations.  This he said was the best deal they had been able to broker with surrounding councils.

Cr Sullivan said a full-time gang will be on construction, giving greater efficiency and Hallett would be rated at the rural rate.  Rating parity would be achieved over ten years and the net debt would be eliminated by 2002.

Cr Mattey said councils to the west had vetoed efforts to merge with them and those to the north would not commit to a financial direction of a merged council.

John Hale, a past Councillor and Chairman objected to suddenly having to ‘get in bed with Burra’.

Robert Jenson from Terowie questioned the benefits for the northern wards and other speakers expressed concern about Burra’s debts.

Burra Burra DC’s Steve Kerrigan has since confirmed their council’s net debt of $456,418 less self-servicing loans of $492,613, which leaves Burra Burra with a surplus of $36, 195 at the end of June 1996.

(The self-servicing loans were:	Paxton Square Cottages	253,984

Effluent Scheme	187,940

Sports Complex	7,274

Half Caravan Park’s loan of	86,831	)

A speaker from the Hundred of Whyte (to the west of Hallett) expressed a desire to amalgamate with the west where most of their shopping activities centred upon Jamestown.
