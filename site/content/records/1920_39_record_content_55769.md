The Burra District Council held its last meeting last Friday and to mark its ‘passing’ members were entertained by Cr & Mrs Kellock at dinner.

Chairmen Cr N. Hiles Pearse, Cr H.W. Tiver, Cr Reg. Warnes, Cr W.H. McWaters, Cr G. Glen Hawkes, Clerk Arthur A. Davey & Overseer John J. Parker.  Cr Eddie Finch was absent in Adelaide.

Cr Kellock reminisced about the Council when he joined it 19 years ago when the members had been the late T.H. McWaters, Edwin Finch & C.B. Warnes, all now deceased along with Robert McBride, John Reed & N.H. Pearse.  The deaths had led to the election of H. McWaters (son of T.H.), Eddie Finch (son of Edwin) & Reg Warnes (nephew of C.B.).

He praised N.H. Pearse as a perfect Chairmen, who allowed all to debate a point and then quietly gave his own opinion.  He gave great assistance and wise guidance over 14 years in the chair.  Cr Warnes seconded these comments.

Cr Pearse responded.  He referred to the great spirit of co-operation and team work on the Council.

‘The new Council he wished the best of luck, but why the change he could not see for as far as economy was concerned he did not think it possible the Council could be run on less expenditure.’

Cr Hawkes then proposed the District Clerk and eulogised Mr A.A. Davey who had been clerk for 25 years.  He hoped the new Council would appoint him to carry on.  Cr Tiver seconded his words.

Mr Davey replied saying each Councillor had carried on in a courteous and happy manner.  When he took office in 1910 he said he found the old Councillors hard yet just, but he weathered the storm and got on amicably thereafter.  He also failed to see where the amalgamation of four Councils could bring economies.

Cr McWaters then proposed the Overseer & Mr Parker responded saying his 14 years in the office had at first not been as difficult as they might have been thanks to the help of the Chairman and Mr Davey and the other Councillors.

The first meeting was held in S. Drew & Co.’s office 9 December 1872.  Cr Isaac Killicoat was appointed chairman.  The other Councillors were H. Dawson, S. Drew, J. Dunstan & D. McCulloch.

J. Dunstan was appointed Clerk pro tem.

The next meeting was 26 December 1872 at the [original] Burra Hotel when J.D. Cave was appointed Clerk and Collector at £75 p.a.  Messrs cave & Goodfellow were appointed joint assessors at £40 each and the first assessment was ordered.

On 6 February 1873 tenders were called for an office in Kooringa, Redruth or Aberdeen.

On 20 March 1873 Mr Tiver offered them two rooms at £24 p.a. and this was accepted.

On 30 September 1873 the Secretary of the Burra Institute advised it was available for meetings at £20 p.a.  It was resolved that this offer be accepted provided a new room was built for the clerk’s office by the end of three months.

On 23 December 1873 the Clerk was instructed to have the furniture, safe etc. removed to the Institute and the Council had met there ever since.  In June 1876 Burra was proclaimed a Corporate Town.
