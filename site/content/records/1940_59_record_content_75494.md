Obituary.  The well-known composer of music and lyrics Mr Frederick Woodrow died suddenly at Hallett on Tuesday last aged 62.  He was a member of the TPI Assoc., being paralysed from the waist down since WWI.  His most famous song was in honour of the Queen Mother: God Has Blessed Each White Gerdenia [sic].  He composed many ‘army’ or ‘marching’ songs during WWII.  He was keen on horse racing and owned and raced many horses successfully.  As the owner of Fruition (according to his brother) he boasted he was the only owner game enough to match his horse against the great Phar Lap.  For the past twenty years he has practically lived in a car, being driven from town to town and state to state by a driver-secretary.  He was en route from Broken Hill to Adelaide when his sudden death occurred.  He was pronounced dead at Burra Hospital by Dr Miller and buried on Wednesday in the Burra Cemetery.  [Died 4 December 1956 Hallett, residence Parkville, Victoria.]
