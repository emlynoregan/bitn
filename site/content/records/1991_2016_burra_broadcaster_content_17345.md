Goyder Council & BCS have expressed concern at the delay in the construction of Burra’s mobile phone tower.  The proposal has the support of the local community and the State heritage Branch and is currently being assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission, which has asked for more detail.  The Commission is seeking to know its impact on each of 39 individual heritage items in the town, listed separately on the National Estate Register.  It also wants information on what steps Telstra will be taking to minimise the impact of the common service trench on any archaeological, bio-diversity and heritage issues.  Goyder Council considers all this has been covered by the State Heritage Assessment and the repeat process is a waste of time and money, causing needless delay.  The Commission has also requested information on alternative sites and photographs with greater clarity of the hillscape and skyline and thinks Telstra should seek the advice of an architectural archaeologist and expert on biodiversity.
