Seaside Trip.  An effort to raise funds to send the children free or at greatly reduced cost has not met with much response here.  Mr John Melrose of Ulooloo has offered to pay the fares of all teachers and children of Hallett and to contribute to all local working expenses in proportion to the number of children.  Mr R.J.M. McBride has contributed Â£5.  Friday pictures in Burra will aid the cause.  The feature is The Crescent and the Cross.
