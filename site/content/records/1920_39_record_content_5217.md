Hallett & District Soldiers’ Memorial was unveiled by the Governor on Wednesday 7 September.  As the Governor was departing by train a tremendous storm broke with thunder, lightning and heavy falls of large hail as the train left.

A football match was played in the afternoon in which Willalo 5.6 defeated Hallett 0.14.

A splendid tea was served from 4.30 to 6.30, though many would have appreciated a luncheon earlier in the day.

A first class concert was held in the evening, marred only by visiting larrikins who were spoken to and the second half passed without their disruption.  A dance followed.

An unfortunate event occurred between the two.  Having a grievance against a leading man several returned soldiers rushed after him into the hall throwing the place into a panic.  M-C Lown assisted by some young men of Hallett quickly ejected the intruders.  Some 20-30 men were bent on mischief throughout the evening and M-C Lown’s task was no easy one.
