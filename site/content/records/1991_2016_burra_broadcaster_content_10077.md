Mid North Sheepdog Trials – part of the Country Games – were held at Burra Showgrounds on Saturday and Sunday of the Easter Weekend.  There were 95 entrants and it involved 300 sheep.  The sheep proved unusually intransigent, resulting in many retirements and disqualifications.  Antony Ireland of Clements Gap won the open event with ‘Percyton Flo Jo’.

Local farmer Stephen Kellock of Kelvale Merino Stud won the Farmers’ Trial with his Kelpie ‘Tinker’.
