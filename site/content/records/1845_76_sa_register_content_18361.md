Kooringa News, 30 March

A fire has been raging at Tothill’s Belt about 25 miles from here.

There has also been a fire to the north for two or three days.

Two men have gone to work at Murphy’s Mine this week and they should report in a few days.

Another find about a mile further on, on the same Wandillah Run promises samples in a few days.

The Crown Lands Ranger has been prosecuting people for illegally depasturing cattle.
