Burra Slag Extraction Co.

F.W. Holder, Sir J.W. Downer, Hon. L. O’Loughlin (Commissioner of Crown Lands), Hon. J.V. O’Loughlin MLC, and forty local residents paid a visit to the Burra Slag Extraction Works to witness the operation thereof.  They had been invited by J.F. Martin and were met by the manager, M. May.

Erection of the machinery began in 1899.  After many difficulties the cost of the plant reached £8,000 and later modifications have added at least another £4,000 due to the unusual hardness of the slag.  Although it was being successful the process was too slow and additions were needed to double the output.  Now 700 to 800 tons a week is treated in three shifts of men to produce a concentrate assaying 70-80% copper and leaving between 0.125% and 0.25% copper in the tailings.  About a quarter of the heap has been treated so far and it is expected work may continue for another 4 years.  The works employ about 40 plus the teamsters carting wood.  The plant requires about 7-8 tons daily.  Trucks carrying about 4 cwt are hauled up every few minutes – about 215 a day.  The lighting at night is by five electric arc lamps of 15,000 candlepower each.  Copper already treated and stored in a heap is valued at £800-£900.  A few pieces weighed several pounds, but most of it was in small pieces from gunshot size to pea size.  A small concentrating plant is nearing completion and this will take ore from tributers who are getting too small an amount to justify sending it away for concentration.  After the visit refreshments were served.  There were speeches all round and toasts.
