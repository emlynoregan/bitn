William T. Bleechmore of Auburn writes on 10 December to complain of the very poor service provided by the mail conveyances in the north.  He recently had but a very precarious seat on top of mail bags when travelling to Auburn.  He says he has often heard that southern coaches are far superior with a mail guard in charge.
