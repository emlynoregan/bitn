All the law did was to make it more inconvenient.

The Bookmakers had learnt the game of avoiding police detection.

Witness 3.  F. Leonard

A presently unemployed barman.

Knew of six illegal bookmakers in Burra.

Hotel keepers did not like betting in the bar, but there was nothing to stop a punter from betting in a hotel.

Hotel keepers that he had worked for had not encouraged illegal betting.

It was possible to get a bet in hotel lounges frequented by women.

Witness 4.  J.P. Sara JP

Tendered a declaration that when betting shops were in business he had had difficulty collecting his accounts.  (This evidence was not accepted.)

Witness 5.  Rev. A.S. Barrett

Spokesman for the Ministers’ Fraternal

There would be a race meeting in Burra on 8 June.

Legislators were against betting shops.

In one year betters had lost an average of £146 each per shop per month to the bookmakers.

[Note.  If this means, as it seems to, that each better was losing £146 a month, it cannot be correct, given that weekly wages at the time would not have been as much as £10.]

Betting shops had been banned at the beginning of the war because they were a social evil.

The closing of betting shops in Burra had not been detrimental to the town.

The proposed betting shop would not be very attractive, but people would patronise them instead of sporting bodies.

He suspected betting was going on in Burra today, but had not heard any complaints from parents about the involvement of minors.

The shop would encourage young people to bet.

Betting would never be entirely suppressed, but a betting shop would encourage it.

Seven of the town’s nine JPs had signed a petition against a betting shop.

Witness 6.  S.J. Woollacott

Was a dam sinker and contracting farmer.

Had found betting shops to have a psychological effect on men he had employed.

Mob psychology led men to bet more than they intended.

He would not employ a man with betting tendencies because it had a detrimental effect on his work.

Employees had gotten into financial troubles because of betting.

He had never had to keep employees wages back to pay the grocer before the days of betting shops.

Witness 7.  R. France

Was the officer in charge of the Burra North Police Station.

There were at least six bookmakers in Burra.

Most operated in hotels.

All but one hotel had a bookmaker attached to them.

It had proved impossible to detect them.

He thought a hotel would suffer in business without a bookmaker attached.

Illegal betting in the town was not noticeable except to punters.

Betting shops would not have much effect on hotels either way.

Betting shops would make it easier to control illegal betting since the legal bookmaker would be on the side of the police.
