Burra Classic Cycling Race will be held next Saturday.  The event will be the 90th Megafert Burra Cycling Classic.  It began as an annual event in 1907, but there was no racing during the war years and also for a brief period in the mid-1950s.  The first race went from Burra to Adelaide, finishing in King William Street at the City Baths, where the Festival Theatre is now located.  The starting point for races later alternated between Adelaide and Burra.  As Adelaide grew the finishes were pushed further into the northern suburbs until the mid 1980s.  More recently the courses have been a variety of country routes.  This year the race is from Burra to Mt Bryan and then to Robertstown via Burra and back to Burra for a distance of 125 km.
