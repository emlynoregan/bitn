Weather.  On 21 July an inch of rain with some hail and fairly heavy snow fell throughout the district.  The rain began about 5 p.m. Sunday and continued to about 3 a.m. when heavy hail fell.  Snow began to fall at about 7.10 a.m. becoming quite heavy by 7.30 a.m. and continuing until 8.15 a.m.  Burra and the surrounding hills were covered in snow. At Hallett it lay two to three inches deep for miles and also at Mt Bryan, where it remained on the Mount till late afternoon.  Snow was also reported at Clare, Mintaro, Whyte Yarcowie, Booborowie and Farrell Flat, where there was a further light fall at 2.30 p.m.

In the hills between Mt Bryan and Booborowie it lay six inches deep for some time. The main street of Burra was covered by three to four inches.  Mr George Fairchild reported heavy snow on the Booborowie mail run via Leighton.  Power failures were reported from Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Between Waterloo and Burra power interruptions have occurred in the past few days, but magpies were to blame, having been building nests with short lengths of fencing wire.  It was generally said to be the heaviest fall of snow for at least 40 years and possibly since 1901.  It will easily be remembered as occurring on the same day man first set foot upon the moon.  Burraâ€™s 105 points of rain includes 21 points of snow.
