Burra Hospital

The Chairman of the Board recently presented the 110th annual report.  Harry Quinn said the 1986-87 year had been one of change and challenge.  It had been a time of financial restraint and increasing demand.  All hospitals faced a 1% budget cut after allowing for only a 4% inflation rate.  Burra was one of the cheapest hospitals in the state on the basis of cost per occupied bed day and had felt the cuts more than some places with ‘fat’ to cut.  Additional monies had to be sought to balance the budget.  During the year the part-time physiotherapist was not replaced and one trainee nurse position was cut.  Community support had been ongoing and was much valued.  Meals on wheels continued to provide a service for an increasing frail aged population.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary enabled the hospital to buy much needed equipment.  During the year the SA Health Commission proposed to remove obstetric and neo-natal from all country hospitals, but after community response any change appears to have been deferred for the time being.  SA Health refused to update laundry equipment and the hospital has transferred laundry services to Central Linen, effecting a saving in salaries and goods and services.  This reduced the need for voluntary sewing women who had worked for years for the hospital.  He thanked Mrs Florrie Scroop and her helpers for all their efforts over the years.  Burra St John Ambulance Service had donated a $2,900 patient lifter.  Bathroom floors had been resurfaced and several other safety initiatives undertaken.  Unfortunately requests for funding for an Aged Persons Hostel near the hospital were unsuccessful.  The casualty and outpatient area needed expansion due to increased tourist traffic.  There had been no major building improvements for fourteen years.  Stronger approaches to SA Health were needed for more equitable funding for expenses and capital works.
