Notice.  Tenders are called for a New Generator with the usual fixings for 30-40 lights for the Hospital.  [Presumably an electric system.  The hospital had a Delco electric generator before the Burra Electric Supply Co.’s arrival in 1924, but I don’t know when they changed from gas, which had been installed in 1904.]
