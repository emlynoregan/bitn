Tallow was also a problem and in short supply especially in 1857-58.  In February 1858 the stocks of candles ran down to 7 days reserve and in 1859 they also got down to a few days.  In 1860 the candle maker asked SAMA to erect a shed for him 3-ft x 17ft x 6ft and when they refused he gave a monthâ€™s notice.  Wilson had been very satisfactory and when his successor arrived he had to be retained to initiate him into the mysteries of the office.
