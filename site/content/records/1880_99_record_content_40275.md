Lost Man.  News reached M-C O’Callaghan of Redruth on Friday that a man had been found under a brush fence 20 miles east of Burra on Corona Run at the Blow Fly.  He went out and brought the man into hospital.  He was James Martin, c. 63, who had been sent out in search of sheep by Mr W. Dare of Piltimitiappa and had got lost.  Eventually, growing weak, he had lain down and was found by Robert Stewart, employed by Mr Barker of Baldina.  Stewart and another man named Kellock seem to have been rather relaxed about getting Stewart to hospital as soon as possible.  We hear Martin is progressing as well as can be expected having been out 8 days without food or water.
