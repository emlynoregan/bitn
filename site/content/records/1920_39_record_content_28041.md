Vandalism, Sacrilege & Robbery

On Wednesday 19 September a trail of offences began at the railway station where rainwater tanks were drained of 2,000 gallons of water.  A car was driven into a blind lane at Mr H.E. Finlay’s and the offenders may have intended from there to interfere with the waterworks.  Next they turned their attention to an unoccupied shop owned by T.H. Woollacott where they smashed the windows.  Probably since then other thieves have stolen four bags of cement from it.  A window was then smashed in F.M. Pearce’s shop.  Next £5 worth of damage was done to Sara & Co.’s petrol bowsers.  Thomas & Co.’s flour mill was then broken into and the unlocked safe was opened and its papers scattered (it never contains money).  A piece of hose from Sara’s bowsers was left in a desk there.

St Mary’s Church was then desecrated.  Flower stands on the altar were overturned and the water has ruined a fine white linen altar cloth 2ft x 12et edged in lace, when dye from a red under-cloth ran into it.  The linen cloth was the gift of a lady some 30 years ago.  The cross was removed from the altar to the steps and the litany desk capsized and the porch window smashed.

The offenders then rang Dr Steele’s door bell before breaking into Drew & Crewes’ where the cash desk was ransacked, but no money had been left there.  In the showroom drawers were opened.  A Winchester rifle was stolen and the entire stock of sleeve links.  From one of the firm’s vans they took its stock of women’s hosiery, men’s ties, 30 packets of cigarettes and matches and tobacco – and possibly more, as yet unchecked.  Windows of the office at McKenzie’s were broken, but bars prevented entry and lastly a window at the Record office storeroom was smashed.  The cards holding the sleeve links and some cloth (minus of course the links) were later found in the men’s urinal at the Kooringa Methodist Church.
