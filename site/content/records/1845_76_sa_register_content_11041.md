Central Board of Education

Redruth

A letter was read from Mr A.H. Forder, from which it appeared that he was fulfilling the conditions on which his licence had been granted – that of applying part of his stipend to the purchase of desks, maps and other school apparatus.

It appeared that the Inspectors had formed very good expectations of Mr Forder as a teacher.  The Secretary stated that they had lately furnished him with maps and class-books from the depot to the amount of about £10.
