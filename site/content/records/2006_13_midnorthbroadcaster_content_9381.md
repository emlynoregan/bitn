Meredith Satchell writes as President of the Burra Town Hall Committee supporting Pip Edson’s congratulations for the Burra Visitor Centre and endorsing her call for a more suitable venue.  She also mentions the present Centre’s history as Elder Smith & Co.’s office dating from 1890: an effective space for them in the 19th century, but not for the Visitor Centre in 2010.
