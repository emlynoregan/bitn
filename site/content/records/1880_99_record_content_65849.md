Burra Waterworks problems continue and on Monday no water was available in the south end of town.  Once wells were common here, but now they have mostly been either filled in or fallen in through neglect, so many people had to cart water in buckets for great distances.  People are complaining about paying for water they cannot get.  It is not the local authorities that are to blame.  ‘The pumps are useless, the reservoir is no good and the water when it is pumped is passable for garden purposes or to wash out hen houses, and the like.’

A new scheme is required and the visit by the Conservator of Water this week may result in some alteration.  A pump at one of the fine wells in the town would be better and more of a certainty.  We have a real opportunity at present as we are not burdened by a lease of the works: though we might have been had the Government gone about its business in a businesslike manner.  As the water level in the Waterworks is still falling there is no promise that we will not soon be without it altogether.
