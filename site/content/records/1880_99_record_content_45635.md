Stock Tax Meeting, Burra Institute last Friday morning.

Many stockowners and others were present and Joseph Flowers was voted into the chair.

P.L. Killicoat, as convenor, read statistics to show the large number of animals being imported into SA annually in excess of exports.  He cited several reports in favour of the tax proposals.

J.M. McBride said it was impossible for the small grazier or stock owner to compete against Queensland and with 30 years experience he knew the disadvantages of the SA owners who needed to be encouraged to stay on the land.  With the low price of wool and other causes he found it hard to get a living at all.  He did not believe the tax would see meat prices rise.  Often stock at markets could hardly get a bid owing to stock from other colonies swamping the market.

T. Warnes moved that the meeting support the introduction of a tax on stock entering SA at £4 per head for horses, £2 for cattle and 3/- for sheep.  He supported all that had been said.  The tax would not affect the freezing business as meat could be sent to Port Augusta in bond and then exported.

W. Cockrum 2nd the motion and agreed with the previous speakers.  In recent years he could hardly get a bid for sheep due to the imported animals and it would be worse now that Victoria had imposed a tax.

Mr Melrose of Ulooloo would favour banning stock from crossing the border.

Mr A. McCulloch was a free trader, but would support this tax.

Joseph Flowers also said he had trouble selling any stock he raised due to the swamping of the market.

T. Warnes moved that other centres in SA be communicated with and asked to support the movement.  A committee was set up to further the cause.
