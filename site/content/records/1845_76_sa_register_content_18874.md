‘Traveller’ of Long Desert writes 26 July

[He is concerned about the laxity in policing the character of persons most fitted to receive public house licences and gives an instance of a house providing uncomfortable accommodation and hosted by a woman ‘…not on very distant terms with a person having an interest in the business’.  The implications of his statement are clarified later in the letter.]

‘I sincerely trust that Major Warburton, or some one on his behalf, will exercise such influence  the next licensing day as will prevent out public-houses being turned into houses of bad repute by the granting of licences to unmarried men of immoral character.’
