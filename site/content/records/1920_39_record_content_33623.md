Burra Town Council, 17 February

A.J. Potter requested the demolition of the old cottage opposite his residence in Commercial St be hurried up as it was a camping ground for undesirables.  [Mrs Howell’s.]

Cr Woollacott said he was the contractor and it would be done at once.

Cr Frank Harris’s resignation due to ill-health was received and accepted with regret and a minute of appreciation was recorded.  The fine was waived.

The Inspector complained that the attitude of the Bench re proof of an animal’s ownership was quite contrary to the meaning of the Act and 11 cases were recently withdrawn as a result.  Apparently all anyone has to do is say they are not the owner and the bench will rule in their favour.  It would seem that a public pound is the only solution.

Cr Woollacott said the Inspector had his sympathy in trying to put a stop to stock straying, as only recently as only recently he had £20 damage done to his garden by stray stock.

[But he then launched into an attack on the Inspector for his inadequate identification of livestock amid attempts by the Mayor to get him to stick to the motion which was the receiving of the Inspector’s report.  Other Councillors then got in on the act.  They all agreed that straying stock was a nuisance, but some joined Cr Woollacott in attacking the Inspector’s actions.  One might be excused for doubting Cr Woollacott’s bona fides in this matter given the number of times he had been fined over the years for straying stock.]

Cr Pearce appeared to hint that Cr Morgan visited people in Kooringa who had received summonses and that such visits might not be serving the Council’s best interests.

The Mayor said that Cr Morgan can refuse to answer that question.

Cr Pearce: ‘One of the men summonsed had come straight and told him what Cr Morgan had suggested to him.’

A committee was appointed ‘to go into this matter to bring something concrete to go on with’.

[Presumably this referred to the wider question rather than Cr Morgan’s alleged activities.]

Sgt McDonald had approached the Mayor concerning the unemployed to see if Council could employ them in connection with the Child Welfare League.  [They would be working in return for rations.]

Cr Woollacott didn’t like the scheme.  He felt men were asked to do more work than the rations were worth.

The Mayor said they would not be so asked.

The Sergeant’s problem was not knowing who to hand rations to unless there was some scheme devised.

Other Councillors saw it as a way of cleaning up the town.

The Mayor undertook that they would get 15/- worth of rations for 15/- worth of work and a motion in favour of the scheme was passed.

The Mayor proposed to set in motion the process for selling about 30 unclaimed lots in North Ward so they would generate rates.
