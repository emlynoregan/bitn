Strange events in Thames St.  On Tuesday at midnight in Thames St someone entered Mr T. Halls’ yard and poisoned his dog, but having decided the poison wasn’t working, he decided to shoot it.  The shot missed the dog and hit the door and window of the house.  (The poison killed the dog soon after.)  Mr Halls then awoke and got up to see what was going on.  He harnessed two horses to his buggy and was about to start when a second shot was heard.

Two young girls just coming from the Post Office saw something on an old well, which they thought, was a ghost.  They aroused Mr Blight who got his gun, put a charge of powder in it and ‘shot’ the ghost, which shuffled rapidly off.  Halls then arrived, but the ghost vanished before it could be captured.  A young man then appeared on the scene with guns and sticks and was bailed up as a suspect.  He later appeared to be innocent.

By now a small crowd had been roused and several young men headed off in pursuit in the direction of Redruth.  Though they could not find the offender or offenders, they did find another innocent party whom they chased and managed to bail up one or two more before getting home about 2 a.m.
