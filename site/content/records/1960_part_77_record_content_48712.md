Burra Town Hall Pictures

In recent months efforts have been made to improve the hall and a good deal of money has been spent.  At the pictures, unfortunately, good programs are being spoiled by children tracking in and out at any odd time and youths making a nuisance of themselves.  The police have been advised and in future those who disturb the theatre risk being removed.  Parents are asked to exercise control over their children.  The program regularly runs at a loss.
