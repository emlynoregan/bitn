Burra Town Council, 2 June

The Town Clerk reported on ‘The Guns’ correspondence etc.

In the first instance a trench mortar was sent to the Council, but on a protest the Government accepted an exchange of the mortar for a field gun and this was accepted by the Town Council on behalf of the town.  The agreement called for four trustees to be appointed to see the proper care was taken till the machine was taken over by the Council.  E.W. Crewes, S.M. Lane, Mr Radford and the Town Clerk were appointed.  The gun was formally received and handed over to the Council to be placed in a park within the town.  Mr Crewes approached the Prime Minister for a second gun and was successful.  It was forwarded with advice that it was unnecessary to appoint further trustees.  The trustees had only to see the guns were properly placed in the town.

The Mayor said this all clearly showed the Council had complete control of the guns once they were handed over and so the RSA request came down to a meeting between Council and RSA.  Since the letter had been received certain members of the RSA had appeared at a ball in costumes which contained markings ridiculing the Councillors*.  This was uncalled for and discourteous.  The League should officially repudiate any connection with the matter.  Council will receive a deputation.

* The report of the ball in 51, 20, 21 May 1930, page 2 says that the award for most original man went to J.E. Hogan & Mr Tom Canny of Hanson who went as ‘The Guns’.  The colour and camouflage resembled the town’s guns and one bore the description: ‘This gun was captured by the Burra Town Council after heavy bombardment by Major Pearce with eggshells.’  The other bore the words: ‘This gun was captured by the Burra Town Council during a bayonet charge led by Corporal Allen.’

Cr Woollacott moved that the Council try to devise means of helping the unemployed through winter.  Borrowing £500 would be an honest attempt at relief.  Other towns were taking similar action.

In Adelaide there were various funds.  He thought it would give 25 men 8 days a fortnight to see them over the worst of winter.  Some married men were too proud to go to the police station for rations.  There was any quantity of work that needed doing: painting bridges or pointing the cemetery walls.

Cr Kellaway though six days a fortnight would make it go further.

Cr Pearce said a poll of ratepayers would be needed and before that a definite scheme would have to be devised to put to them.  Some men in the past had not done a fair day’s work for either rations or money.

The Town Clerk said they already owed the bank £700 which was 25% of the annual rate, which was all they could borrow.  They might ask the Local Government Department for an advance of £200 or £300 on the Main Road Account.

Cr. Lee wanted a special meeting of Council to consider it.

Cr Allen wanted to defer the matter for a fortnight.

Cr Morgan favoured borrowing with ratepayer approval.

Cr Woollacott said the present overdraft would be wiped out by the rates now due and ratepayers’ approval was therefore not needed.

The Mayor said a special Act was passed last year appropriating a certain amount which could be borrowed by Councils without approaching ratepayers.  Particulars could be got from the Highways Board.

The Town Clerk said it would be Christmas before they got a loan.

In the end it was resolved to write to the Highways Board about a loan and to the Local Government Department about an advance.

Cemetery Desecration.  Recent vandalism at the cemetery included the breakage of glass domes over everlasting wreaths, breakage of a cross belonging to the family of W.G. Hawkes and two or three other stones had been pulled down.

Cr Woollacott raised the matter and Cr Kellaway said the tap on the tank had been left on to drain the tank on several occasions and the curator’s barrow had been dumped in an open grave.
