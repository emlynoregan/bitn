Mr James Fitzgerald of Pert WA has written to Sgt McDonald of Redruth saying that in 1864-66 he was one of the four officers at Redruth together with Donally, McKeevor & Campbell.  There was little country fenced at Hallett and Mt Bryan and northwards and very limited areas at Melrose & Pt Augusta.
