RSL Masquerade Ball was held on 20 May and eclipsed any of its predecessors.  President L.M. Gordon & Mrs Gordon and Secretary G.H. Dow had prepared it all carefully with the aid of a splendid committee.  The financial results were eminently satisfactory.  As well as the usual range of costumes the event of the evening was the arrival of H.H. the Dato Gajah from the Federated Malay States complete with his Private Secretary and a harem.  H.H. arrived on an Arab Steed and his three favourite wives came on giraffes.  Nine other gorgeously clad wives followed on foot accompanied by native servants, a tiger on a chain and a giant slave ‘Hercules’.

A.L. Bence was the Dato of Gajah and Mr Steer the Private Secretary.
