Goyder Council had a serious problem two years ago with leakage from Burra effluent ponds.  They fitted them with plastic liners and now they are doing too well, in that there is an excess of treated water they don’t know what to do with.  It would be suitable for irrigation of a woodlot, but not for release into the creek.  It will be considered as part of the Council’s long term plan.
