Burra Sporting & Athletic Club reports that the profit from its sports meeting on 9 October was about £70.  A heated discussion took place about making presentations to soldiers who returned a considerable time before the club started and eventually it was decided to send wallets to:

Pte Voumard	Pte McBride	Pte Prior

Pte Lockett	Pte Stewart	Pte Parks

Pte Aldridge

And to Pte W. Nankivell when it is established he enlisted at Burra.

The following minute was then recorded:

‘That wallets be sent to all returned soldiers who have lived in the Burra six months prior to enlisting and that have enlisted at Burra – but not otherwise.’
