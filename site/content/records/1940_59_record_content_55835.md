Burra Burra Hospital Inc. held its AGM at the Burra Town Hall last week.  Chairman, F.T. Marston, reported on the year.  The year was the first for which ratepayers had been directly represented on the Board and the first in which two women had been members in Mrs Ashton and Mrs A.G. Tennant.  Despite steeply rising costs the trading account overdraft had been reduced by c. £550 and then £1,010 further by donations.  Mr R. Campbell had been appointed full time secretary.  A drive had been made to collect outstanding debts.  Assistance from various bodies had helped to see a medical refrigerator installed, an aspirator for the operating theatre, a Romesse room heater for the laundry drying room, children’s cots and more fly-proof doors etc.  The CWA had attended to linen and mending.  The Building appeal Fund Committee had launched an appeal for the construction of Nurses’ Quarters and improvements to existing buildings and had abandoned plans for a major rebuilding.  Building and equipping the Nurses’ Quarters would require £25,000.  It was expected the Government would grant a £ for £ subsidy, leaving Burra to raise £12,500.

Present daily costs per bed were £2-10-0 and daily average fees were £2-3-0.  The 7/- gap was derived from Government subsidy and Council ratings.  Dr G.L. Mellor took over from Dr Heddle as MO on 13 June.  Dr Mellor stressed the need for more girls to train at the hospital.  The Medical Officers supported the building proposals.  He thought the town needed an ambulance.
