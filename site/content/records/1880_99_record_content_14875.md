Editorial on The Chinese Question.

This article concentrates on the use of Chinese labour to crew ocean liners and ships in the intercolonial trade. It reports an address by Rev. J.C.  Kirby in the Port Adelaide Town Hall on the coolie labour question where he said: ‘Unless checked in fact and it has gone very much too far as it is, this land would become a huge, leperous, [sic] festering Chinese colony, “evolving”, to use the Darwinian term, a future nation of hybrids.’

‘Mr Kirby might have gone still further, and pointed out to an intelligent and enthusiastic audience that the foul subterranean grub that gnaws at the root of that fair tree of “Social Purity” of which he is the leading champion and cherisher, is to an almost incredible extent, the Chinaman.’
