Koonoona Sales exceed $3 Million

Sales of the historic Koonoona property south of Burra have realised over $3,000,000 with lots 1-6 still to be sold.  Koonoona was originally taken up in 1855 by a grant to Mr James Logan.  It was an important Merino stud.  At the time it comprised 43,000 acres, but it has been gradually reduced to the current 12,558 acres.  In recent time it was a well-know stud property of the late Mr Ron Pearse.  In 1980 the property was sold and Fares Rural Co. Pty Ltd operated there.  It was a large international company and shipper of live sheep and carcase meat to the Middle East.  The property became effectively a huge feed lot.  A $7 million pellet mill was mooted for the property, but it failed to eventuate and Fares Rural relocated to nearer Adelaide.  In 1984 it was sold to Gary Radford and in 1989 it became Old Collinsville Pty Ltd, managed by Neil Garnett as Principal.  Since 1993 the registered owner of Old Collinsville and Principal Paddy Hanbury and family adapted Koonoona for cereal and lucerne production, with pasture improvement and conservative stocking of the strong grazing hills.  It has also been committed to commercial on-property ram production.  The current land sales have almost finished carving up the original land holding and only lots 1-6 remain to be sold.
