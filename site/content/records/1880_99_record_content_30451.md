The good health record of the town in the past two years was marred this year by a mystery disease [which claimed several lives].

Tree planting continued to fill in the gaps.

The cemetery debt had been reduced to £9 from £30-9-9 at the start of the year.  This was possible by using the curator for public works when not required at the cemetery and it should allow the debt to be eliminated next year.
