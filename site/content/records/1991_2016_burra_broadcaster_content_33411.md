Goyder Council has secured funding from Planning SA ‘Places for People Program’ to review the Master Planning Option for Market Square and Best Place.  The rest of this article is full of wonderful planner’s jargon, of which one paragraph will suffice:

‘There is now an increased awareness within the Council and the communities of Goyder of the need for an integrated approach to Market Square and best Place to reinforce links between the performance of the town and its tourism potential, historic character and coherence and vitality of the public realm.’

Night Owls Bowls Competition 2004 was won by ‘Mary’s Boys’: Bob Taylor, Bob Coathupe, Matthew Opperman and Mary Anderson.  [Photo]
