Mid North Football Association held its AGM.  The Association had a credit balance of £500.  W.E. Blatchford presented the President’s report on an interesting year.  Clare had two ‘A’ Grade teams and while Saddleworth did well, Riverton just managed to come out premiers.  Roy Noack of Saddleworth won the Mail Medal.  Rex Smith of Sevenhill won the Jennet Trophy for best and fairest in the ‘B’ Grade for the 5th consecutive year.  The Colts’ first year was also successful and Riverton were premiers and won the Blatchford Cup.  Elected: Patron, W. Knappstein (Clare); President, W.E. Blatchford was re-elected; Senior Vice-President, V. Jenner (Mintaro) and Secretary, N. Burfield (Auburn).  There will be 14 teams this year in two divisions.  Number 1 Division will comprise two Clare teams and one each from Riverton, Saddleworth, Auburn, Manoora Robertstown and Aberdeen (a new team for the Mid North).  Number 2 Division will comprise Seven Hill, Mintaro, Marrabel, Farrell Flat, Tarlee and Watervale (a new team).  Division 1 competes for the A Grade Shield and Division 2 competes for the Clayton-Dunn Shield.

Aberdeen Football Club was admitted to the Mid North Football Association last Friday night.  Aberdeen colours are blue jumper with white sash, white shorts, blue socks with white tops.  The election of club officers is to be decided at a meeting this week.  The home ground and training ground is to be the Racecourse Oval.
