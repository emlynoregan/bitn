SA Stockowners’ Assoc. Burra Branch

Meeting 25 September at the Eastern Telephone Building with President I.J. Warnes in the chair.

The meeting discussed mainly compulsory sheep dipping.  The areas subject to compulsion had been extended to include all of the Counties of Dalhousie, Kimberley and Burra.  Mr Warnes said although tick was not a problem, lice were prevalent and easily transported.  He favoured compulsion.  Mr Maurice Collins spoke in support as well.  He had some tick experience.  Mr E. Finch dipped and favoured it.  Ticks were prevalent on the borders of ‘The Gums’.  The measure received strong support.
