Cliques: Ed. on the problem of town cliques - of a religious, political, municipal and medical nature. The editor thought they were of relatively recent origin.

Entertainment: About 800 attended a first class performance of Wilson's Circus. The trained horses were particularly good.

Baldina: Opening services were held for the new Wesleyan Chapel.  The building had cost £60 and £40 was raised at the opening.

Baldry: Anniversary of the Wesleyan Chapel

Accident: N. Opie, A.E. Jaffrey, C. Preece were thrown from a buggy when the horse was frightened by a lady's umbrella, but they escaped serious hurt.

Burra Parl. Club met last Tuesday, but there was no quorum. Mr. Ball, the Chief Secretary, moved that the club be dissolved in favour of a more general debating club if one were desired - religious questions, he felt, would have to be rigorously excluded. Party feeling had grown too strong for the original intention of the club to survive. Mr P. Lane suggested that without a quorum the club could not be dissolved and would have to die a natural death. Others concurred.
