Eric Fuss, Secretary of the Burra History Group, writes to correct the statement in the paper last week that the 2009 Burra Sow was the 132nd.  Although the first Show was held in 1877, a number of years have been missed since then.  There was a gap due to lack of interest from 1886 to 1893. A very bad season caused the cancellation of the 1897 Show and the same reason combine with the outbreak of WWI saw the cancellation of the Show of 1914.  There were also no shows from 1940 to 1945.  This makes the 2009 Show the 117th in Burra.
