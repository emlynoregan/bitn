Burra Town Council.

P. Clark of the Commercial Hotel writes about his intention to build a billiard room.

Larrikins have broken several panes of glass in the main road lamps.

When the Mayor said that several were left unlocked, Cr Lowe said larrikins wrench the locks off and Cr Walker reported similar problems in North Ward, where even doors are wrenched off.

Flowers are being stolen from the cemetery and ribbons from wreaths.

Cr Lane said the new lamp at the Post Office was burnt out and probably beyond repair.

The Town Clerk expected to complete the canvassing of the town re electric lighting by Saturday.

He said there was a buyer for two blocks of land in Hampton that the Council owned.

Council decided not to sell at present.
