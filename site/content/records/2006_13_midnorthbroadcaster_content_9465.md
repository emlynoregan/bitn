Arson.  An early model XC Ford car was the target of an arson attack in Chapel St on Saturday 23 January.  Hallett police and the MFS attended.  Pt Pirie Crime Division also attended.  The owner and local tow truck operators were lucky to escape serious injury when the car interior reignited while it was being transported to Adelaide on a trailer.  With smoke coming from the vehicle a hasty 7 km run was made to Manoora main street where local workmen extinguished the flames with hand held fire extinguishers before CFS crews arrived.
