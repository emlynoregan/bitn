Football Visit.  There are two brief references to unseemly behaviour on the weekend when the Exeter Football Team visited.  The nature of the disturbance is not specified.  The paper stresses in both places that it was followers of the team and not the members of it that were responsible, saying the problem was ‘caused by another party altogether who were merely out for a joy jaunt, and attached themselves to the team like barnacles to a ship.’  [Though it is not easy to decide whether these are the words of the reporter or of the Exeter Captain.]
