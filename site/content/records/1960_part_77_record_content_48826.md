Boy Scouts and Cubs

After several weeks of tests and acquiring of uniforms the investiture of Burra Scouts and Cubs is scheduled for Friday 19 December.  This will be the last meeting for 1969.  Money raising is proceeding well, but the $500 has not yet been reached.  Four Scouts have already been invested: Andrew Thamm, Andrew Webster, John Brak and Kym Spackman.  [The Scouts and Cubs to be invested are listed.]
