Burra Mine.  Mr Allen MP asked a question in Parliament concerning the possibility of a gas line from the main pipeline to Burra.  He also corrected a mistake in the newspaper report, which said production would increase to 500-700 tons per day over 18 months to stabilize at 200,000 tons a year and this would yield 200 tons of copper metal per annum.  Actually it will yield 2,000 tons of copper metal valued at $3 million.  Initially the company will use fuel oil so will the Minister take up the question of supplying natural gas to the mine?  The Hon. F.W.H. Coumbe undertook to bring the matter to the attention of the Natural Gas Pipeline Authority.
