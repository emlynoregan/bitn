The Anzac Dawn Service at Burra attracted about 200 on Friday.  This was one of the biggest crowds for years.  Rev. Michael Hillier (Anglican) conducted the service in mild weather.  Terry Wilson played the Last Post.

Raymond, Owen & Kingsley Prior were back in Burra for the service. They are old Burra boys who went to Copperhouse School.  Two visiting Vietnam veterans were Phil Rapinett from Broken Hill and Robin Fairchild from King Island, Tasmania. Burrs RSL President Len Simpson was happy to see ‘a mighty good crowd’ and ‘really happy to see a lot of young people’.
