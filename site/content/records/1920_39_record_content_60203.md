Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate.  Half-yearly meeting of shareholders.

Chairman of Directors A.E. Hamilton reported on a very satisfactory half year.  Two crushings totalling 30 tons 5 cwt yielded 23 oz 6 dwt 13 gr.  In March a further 25 tons should be processed.  To date 175 tons 14 cwt has produced 739 oz 3 dwt 10 gr, or an average 4 oz 4 dwt per ton.

Byles’ Mongolata GM for fortnight to 22 February

Open Cut.  Engaged in breaking ore. About 126 tons of ore already treated with crushing to continue for some time yet.

Main shaft sunk from 227 to 243 ft.  Heavy rains on Tuesday penetrated via the open cut to the mine’s tunnel and brought with the water a deal of rock and debris.  Cleaning up has taken several days.  Little damage was done to the mine workings, but considerable to the change rooms and roadway.
