Learn to Swim Campaign

Fifty children learnt to swim and 135 gained certificates.  The instructors were Mr K. Hicks, assisted by Mr P. Tattersall.  There were 50 Beginnersâ€™ Certificates, 44 Progress, 24 Junior and 17 Senior Certificates.  Bad weather forced cancellation of the carnival planned for the Burra Pool last Friday.
