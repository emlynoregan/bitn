Burra Hospital Board Meeting, last Thursday.

A letter was received from Mr I.J. Warnes enclosing a cheque for £260 and one from Red Cross for £150 for the cost of installing an X-Ray plant.

Mr Winnall said they had received promises of two substantial donations such that with a £ for £ subsidy would allow the construction of a maternity wing.  The donors wished for the time to remain anonymous.  A committee was appointed to consider the next step.  They felt this was more important than an Isolation Ward.

Dr Steele had prepared sketch plans for the proposed wing comprising two wards 22ft x 18ft each, an observation room 18ft x 12ft, a septic room 15ft x 14ft, a labour room 15ft x 14ft and four private rooms 14ft x 12ft with a 6ft passage and two bathrooms to be connected to other buildings by a covered way.  A deputation will wait upon the Chief Secretary about the £ for £ subsidy.

As the new board will comprise 12 members and there will be 7 representatives of Councils, leaving five vacancies to be filled by election, there will be elections on the same day as the District Council elections and if no such election, then by post.
