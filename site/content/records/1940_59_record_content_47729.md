Burra Show was back to the pre-War standard this year.  Ring event entries were over 340, an all-time record.  The weather was excellent.  The show was one of the best ever.  The display of fleeces was outstanding.  Flowers showed an amazing variety.  Iceland poppies and pansies were particularly good.  In Arts & Crafts, Miss V. Ockenden’s pupils were central, with 118 pictures on show.  [Particularly mentioned were Miss Venda Launer of World’s End’s oil portrait of PM Menzies and her ‘Hunting Scene,’ also Len Bence’s oil of ‘The Old Mill’ at Burra.]

Ladies cooking received high praise and the school work and the CWA display were also commended.  The display of Agricultural Machinery was far larger than in previous years.

Swine were few, but good.  Sheep were well above average in quality and quantity.  Cattle were of high quality and in better numbers than usual.  Dog exhibits were low.  Pigeons and poultry numbers were up.  Dairy produce was meritorious and needlework well up to standard.  Sideshows did good business, though the boxing tent was absent this year and on the whole they disappointed.

Sheaf-tossing was an innovation that attracted much interest and was won by H. Wardle from T. Willis with a throw of 34 ft.

The gate taking were more than 50% up on 1949.  The Show Society President welcomed Mr Tom Playford, Premier of SA, who opened the event.

Miss Margaret Jeffery will represent Burra as the SA Quest Girl for Legacy.
