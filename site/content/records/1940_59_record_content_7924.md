Burra Town Council, 3 November

A.B. Riggs wrote to Council advising that the subscribers to the Burra Institute had held two meetings as required and voted to offer the Institute to the Corporation for the amount of the liability to the State Bank on the day the Corporation took over, provided the Corporation would give free use to the Library Committee of the two rooms now in use and also honour the Picture Show agreement.

The next step was for copies of this resolution to be sent to the Institutes’ Association and then carry at a ratepayers’ meeting a motion giving the Corporation approval to buy the property.

Messrs Bednall & Hewitt wrote re a Certificate of Title belonging to A.D. Sellars of property adjoining Helston Street and offering to purchase this street, which was at present not in use.  The Clerk advises that certain portions of the Act would have to be complied with before the Council could agree to such a sale.
