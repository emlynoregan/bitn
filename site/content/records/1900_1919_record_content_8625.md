Letter to Editor from ‘Ratepayer’ asking:

Question:	Editor’s reply:

Did the Council a month ago vote Mr Prior [Pryor] £10;

said to be in lieu of one month’s notice?	Yes

Was this amount ever put on the pay sheet?	No

Has Mr Prior ever received the money?	No

Can the Council legally withhold it?	No

Who is guilty of refusing to hand over the money and carry out

the Council business?	We cannot say.

‘Ratepayer’ writes re the same topic and says that when Mr Pryor applied to the Town Clerk he was referred to the Mayor (Mr Sampson) and that gentleman refused to pay.  Where are the Councillors?  Why do they allow the Mayor to run matters contrary to the wishes of the whole Council?
