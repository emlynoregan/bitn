Stock Tax Meeting of Ratepayers at the Institute on Monday last.

In the absence of the Mayor Mr J. Sampson took the chair.

Cr Rabbich moved ‘that this meeting views with alarm the agitation taking place in different parts of the colony and also the notices of motion on the notice papers of both Houses of Parliament for an increase in the present tax on stock coming into South Australia, as such, if adopted, would only result in the policy of taking from the many for the benefit of the few.’

The Friday morning meeting he said would have had a different outcome if held in the evening.  The proposers of the tax had only their own pocket in mind.  It was a great advantage to get fat sheep and cattle at our command.  The tax would certainly increase the cost of meat to the consumer.  The variability of rainfall made SA unfit for the production of fat stock.  He felt small graziers would be more harmed than helped by the tax.  Now they bought stock far cheaper that they could raise it.  With the tax there would be no such advantage.

There were interjections accusing the butchers of profiteering and Mr Rabbich said he thought the squatters did better than the butchers.

Cr Linkson 2nd the motion and spoke in support.  There were no amendments and the motion was carried.

Cr Hardy moved that any change be deferred until it could be made an issue at a general election.  He felt the earlier meeting had been arranged at a time to prevent the workingman from attending.

A voice complained that this meeting was one-sided.

The small graziers’ interests, he thought, would not be served by the tax and they should unite with the general body of taxpayers.  2nd F. Carey.

J.M. McBride then challenged the previous speakers.  With the influx of stock from Queensland local graziers were lucky to sell any stock.  He then got stuck into the butchers who bought fat cattle at 5/- per cwt and 45 lb sheep at ½d per lb.  16 or 20 years ago the price of cattle was £15 per head and meat was the same price as now.

Mr Riggs then said that since Victoria had imposed a tax SA had to react and 3/- a sheep was a fair thing to protect small graziers and farmers.  He denied the earlier meeting had been timed to avoid the workingman being present. He was however prepared to wait for the resolution of the matter at the next election.

P.L. Killicoat said the other meeting was timed to allow country people a chance to return home in good time.

The motion was put and carried.

Cr Linkson moved that the outcome of the meeting be forwarded to the district MPs for presentation to Parliament.  2nd Cr Hardy and carried.
