[There are photographs; one of the turntable suspended from the overhead timbers and showing the solid timbering of the tunnel.  Another is a close-up of the turntable with the spliced rope attached, on which the steel worked.  Animal fats were used for lubrication and are still evident around the central spindle.  There is another on page 7.]
