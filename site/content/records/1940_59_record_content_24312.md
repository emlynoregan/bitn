Burra Primary School

The Education Department is in the process of getting an independent valuation of some land adjacent to the school with the view to compulsory acquisition of it for a playing area for the school.  It had been unable to reach an agreement with the owner for the purchase of the site.

The Annual Methodist Concert at Booborowie was held on 17 November and was a success although the cool conditions reduced the sales from the strawberry, cool drinks and ice cream stalls and the deluge of rain made it hard to hear the artists.

The Annual Gala Night at Leighton hall on 19 November was held in ideal weather and realised Â£40 to be split between Leighton Red Cross Branch and the Hall Committee.
