Mr Lane denied any prior knowledge of the appointment.

Messrs Winnall and Bartholomaeus moved the motion be not put and that was carried 6 to 4.

The Chief Secretary suggested the Board appoint a special committee to confer with the Medical Officers about an amicable arrangement of their differences.  This was complied with.

The six-month balance sheet showed that £900 of the £1,500 had been spent.

Mr Hawkes said they were worse off than ever before, but the Chairman said they had got in £102 this month with more to come.
