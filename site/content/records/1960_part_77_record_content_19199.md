[The paper then reprints Dr Steele’s views on education from the History of Burra High School.  He was answering a view of a Professor who deplored wasting money educating the masses.  Dr Steele said: ‘It might be dangerous to educate the masses, but personally, he felt it right to give the boys and girls every chance, this was a duty parents owed the child and the nation.’]
