The parent bodies have been very helpful and valuable.  Traditions such as the annual ball and the banquet always receive 100% support.  The banquet is to be held this coming Thursday.

Money has been set aside for the erection of changing rooms and the installation of fans in the iron rooms.  Subsidy will be granted when funds become available.  The Association has also provided additional furnishings for the sick room and crockery and an electric urn for what is still only a temporary staff room.

The High School Council in conjunction with the Primary School Committee has done excellent work and this has made successful representations to the Education Department to purchase land in front of the school.  The Council also supported my moves to have pathways in front of the school repaired.

Other moves, which I anticipate will come to fruition soon, are for the remodelling of the toilets and headmaster’s office, paving of the yard and the provision of proper staff facilities.  The school still lacks many of the desirable features that modern education needs for effectiveness.

One innovation this year was an open night when teachers were available for interview by parents who were also invited to visit classrooms as they saw fit.

For a long time the High school has followed the traditional academic courses leading to Intermediate and Leaving Public Examinations.  I am pleased, if a little apprehensive that next year we are to have an alternative course leading to an internal Intermediate Certificate.  This should cater for a large percentage of students, while still giving the enlightenment which we claim an education should do.

In spite of all the promise here; I still fear the problem of the closed mind.  There is an absence in the district at large and in the school itself of an academic climate.  There is little point in the school trying to open up the mind of the child unless firstly he is encouraged and inspired by at least some other lively minds and worthwhile intellectual pursuits outside of school and unless there is some opportunity to continue his intellectual growth once he has left school.

[Mr Farrow then developed this theme at some length.  He went on to speak of the donors of prizes and trophies and to thank those who organised the hall.  He spoke also of the House system and wished departing students well.]

Staff changes: Mr Ayliffe has transferred to Norwood High School and Miss E.J. Newman of Findon High School has been appointed Senior Mistress at Burra.
