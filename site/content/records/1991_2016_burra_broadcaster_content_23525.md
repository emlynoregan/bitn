Rev. Rod Peppiatt’s address on Burra history at the celebration of the Masonic Lodge’s 100 years occupancy of the former Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church is printed over two issues: this extract occupies about ¾ page.

The union of three branches of Methodism in 1900 was only achieved after many years of hard work.  This union freed the Kooringa Primitive Methodist for use by the Masonic Lodge.  The Methodist churches in Burra in the 19th century were certainly a strong focus of worship and of social activity.  Some of the preachers were of the ‘fire and brimstone’ variety and they must have offered an interesting diversion from the routines of everyday life.  A story is told that Mr Philip Santo baptised a number of converts in Schneider’s Engine pool.  Several workers did not turn up for work the next day until the afternoon.  When questioned by Captain Roach about this they said they couldn’t come to work with all the sins of those men in the pool.  Apparently Captain Roach accepted the excuse, but that ended baptisms at the mine.  Whatever the reasons for the strength of the churches in the early days, it is clear that we are dealing with a people who were passionate in their faith and had a zeal for spreading the gospel.  Three strands of Methodism were represented in Burra: the Wesleyans, the Bible Christians and the Primitive Methodists.  The word Primitive in that group’s name indicated their desire to get back to the original teachings of Methodism: a back to basics movement.  While there were differences between the three strands of the faith they also co-operated on many occasions and there was generally good will between them.  One consequence of the enthusiasm of the Methodists in Burra was the surprising number of church buildings in the townships.
