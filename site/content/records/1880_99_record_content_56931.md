Editorial.  Burra Town Council wasted a great deal of time last meeting.  The meeting started at 7.30 p.m. and went till 10.25 p.m.  Work in the North Ward that was not authorised was objected to.

Cr Rabbich objected to the word ‘gentleman’ instead of Councillor in a reference to himself.

Cr Hardy was equally wroth at the use of Mr instead of Councillor in reference to him.

Foolish and perplexing interjections were common.  It is amazing that the Mayor did not unceremoniously adjourn the meeting until the councillors were prepared to conduct the business in a proper manner.  We find that a complaint was received by ‘the skin of its teeth, with the determination that no further notice be taken of it.  Isn’t it a glorious age we live in, and are we not blessed (?) with a queer Council?’
