Burra Town Council, 9 October

W. Duffy, surveyor of the Midland Road Board objected to kerbing in Aberdeen as narrowing the main road.  He also wanted it lowered.  He is to be advised the road width is being maintained at 46’ and Council agrees to lower the kerb 6” opposite Mr Rabbich’s.

In reference to the frontage line of Dr Brummitt’s new building, he was told the line from the S-E corner of the Institute fence to the National Bank must be adhered to.

The Creek path to Mitchell’s Flat is to be attended to.  Mr Dobbie will be asked to supply specifications for the Market Square work in connection with fitting a windmill and tanks.
