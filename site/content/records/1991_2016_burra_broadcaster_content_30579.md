Burra Red Cross found that its banner cannot be cleaned because the colours would run.  Jan Tiver has given it a good brushing and it has been rehung.  The Mt Bryan Branch is hosting the Northern Zone Conference on 14 April, but falling membership means it will in future have difficulty in hosting meetings and conferences.
