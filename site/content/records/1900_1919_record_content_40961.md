M-C Queale:

Heard the alarm at 11.30 p.m. on 2 March and saw Allen’s place alight.  The ridgepole was then burning.  Tried to save Pederson’s boot shop and Truscott’s.  Stayed all night watching the fire and then put on another man.  Was watching again the next night as there was still some stuff smouldering at the front.  Spent 10 minutes in Truscott’s and went home, returning c. 10.15 and saw people running in the lane next to Harrap’s.  Found Truscott throwing water on boxes of straw and straw envelopes and noticed smoke coming from the outhouse.  Paper was burning on the seat.  There was no doubt an attempt had been made to cause another fire.  There was no sign of fire between 6 and 9.45 p.m.  On Wednesday afternoon visited the room behind Harrap’s and some paper had been burnt on top of a modern dresser and the calico ceiling had been burnt.  Don’t see any connection between the burnt paper and the big fire.  It seems a deliberate attempt to burn the room down.  Allen’s back door looked as though it had been pulled out.  The shed was not scorched.  On Wednesday morning there was no sign of fire in Harrap’s back room.  Don’t recall any burnt hessian in the ceiling Wednesday afternoon, but there was some in the evening.  On two other occasions there have been attempts to burn these premises.  Got a black-tracker up, but there was insufficient evidence for an arrest.
