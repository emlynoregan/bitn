Burra brass Band gave a concert in market Square on Sunday afternoon.  The President Mr Marston introduced the Mayor who made an appeal for funds on behalf of the band.  He said the band had provided the town with a much needed tonic in a time of depression, but it needed funds to keep going.  In the future the Mayor said the band intended to compete in the Tanunda Competitions.  The Mayor offered 10/- for every £1 raised that afternoon.  The collection raised £2-15-0 and the Mayor added his 37/6 to bring the total to £5-12-6.
