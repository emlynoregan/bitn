Kooringa Wesleyan Church

Rev. D. O’Donnell of Clare’s lecture on Temperance at the Institute on Saturday was postponed when heavy rain produced a very small attendance.  He preached twice at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church on Sunday and on Monday at the Institute delivered an address on ‘Tom Hood: his life, character and works’.  Poor weather again reduced his audience.  The Temperance lecture was given on Tuesday to an audience that was not large, but ‘respectably filled’ the hall.
