Fires.  A devastating fire started on the west side of the Camel’s Hump and swept through part of the Leighton area last Monday, burning all the stubble, grass and fences on several properties.  Conditions were similar to those of the 1919 fire.  Improved fire fighting equipment helped check the fire this time and it was brought under control on the northern end of Mr Keith Dunstan’s property of Gum Creek South.  Landholders affected were Messrs Max Jacka, H.W. Player, Sid Pearce, V. Brabich, V. Porter, S. Sanderson, T.J. Canny, A.S. Sommerville, K.A. Duncan & Jesse Humphrys.  [A ‘Thanks’ notice in the paper of 19 April adds Alan G. Drew.]  The fire area was about 10 miles x 1 mile and about 6,000 acres were burnt.  Other landowners were affected, but their names have not come to hand.  Stubble burning was the alleged cause.  Grass cinders reached Burra 16 miles away.

Another fire began accidentally at Booborowie on T.J. Bailey’s property.

At Canowie Mr Hatchard lost 2 tons of lucerne and 2 haystacks.

At Spalding there was another outbreak and again burning stubble has been blamed.
