Kooringa News, 28 August

Scab has so far not broken out as a result of flocks moving through from Wellington.

Lambing rates in the district have been high and feed is plentiful, but stock prices are low.

Following the fight between Irishmen and Cornishmen at Booborowie the Local Court fined Thomas Fahey £5 including costs for assaulting John Webster.  Jeremiah Fogarty was fined £4-11-0 for assaulting Webster and the same amount for assaulting Richard Glogg.

In itinerant sweep, Robert Charteres was fined £5 for drunkenness in the streets of Kooringa and in default seven days in prison.

Six persons have each been fined £3 with £1 costs for keeping unregistered dogs.

A survey party taking levels for a contemplated branch line to the River Murray passed through Redruth on Monday 26 August.
