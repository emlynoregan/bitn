Booborowie Football Club held a barbecue lunch on Saturday 14 October.  It was reported at it that due to staunch supporters and hard-working ladies, it had a new afternoon tea shed almost paid for and the dressing shed and showers had been greatly improved.  There is also an excellent scoreboard.  A presentation was made to Secretary Ray Gasmier who is leaving Booborowie to take over the bank at Kimba.
