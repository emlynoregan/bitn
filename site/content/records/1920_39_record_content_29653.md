Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club, 28 January.  The annual sports were an unqualified success in ideal weather, though a bit cool for the water, which reduced entries in those events.  About 1,200 people attended with 400 cars parked.  There were a number of sideshows and the Point Pass Band played.  A good luncheon was provided under Mr & Miss Pratt.  As well as swimming and rowing events there were land races, sheaf tossing and throwing the weight.  Gate takings were c. £80.

The sports results are printed.
