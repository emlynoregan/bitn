Mr Andrew Gebhardt, Chairman of the Lewis Board of Management

Mr Gordon Davidson, Chairman of the SA Heritage Commission

Mr Bob Lewis, representing the Lewis Family

Mr John Bannon, Premier of South Australia, who declared the cottages open.  The points were made that:

The project was a good example of joint action by Federal, State and Local Governments.

The accommodation was unusual if not unique as tourist accommodation in Australia.

The cottages had been threatened with demolition on a number of occasions and had been saved by the intervention of the Lewis Family and Mr Ian Auhl.

A great deal of negotiation had gone on and an Act of Parliament passed to transfer the ownership of the Square to the Burra Burra DC.

The cottages are the earliest examples of company housing in the Southern Hemisphere.

They were the first items protected under the Aboriginal & Historic Relics Act.

Mr Ian Auhl had written the Official Paxton Square History, which was available in pamphlet form.

The restoration work had provided employment and business opportunities for locals.

After the official opening people were free to wander through the cottages and many paid tribute to the architect Mr David Gilbert.  They enjoyed Benceâ€™s Gallery and the National Trust Cottage [Malowen Lowarth] where Colin Fidock and Miss Kath Millard and a group of BCS students provided a most entertaining re-enactment of what life in the cottages might have been like 100 years ago.
