Burra National Trust held another general meeting on Tuesday night at the Burra Town Hall.  Over 50 (mainly members) attended.  Chris Reed was elected chairman for the night.  He explained that a meeting had been called due to the reluctance of the Burra Branch Committee to convene a general meeting.  The purpose was to discuss National Trust Burra affairs and the Passport.  He insisted the meeting be conducted in an open and transparent manner and that the outcome should indicate a clear path forward.

He reviewed the meeting of 21 February at the Court House, which had an unsatisfactory outcome.  He established that the committee had not taken notice of the concerns of the rank and file members and long term residents concerning the proposed changes to the Burra Passport made by the committee.  The Regional Council of Goyder has received a draft Memorandum of Understanding from National Trust SA to promote and develop the Burra Passport in its present form.  The Council is ready to sign, pending the outcome of this meeting.

National Trust SA Council Members also attended and they took minutes and recommendations back to the SA National Trust Council meeting held last Thursday.

That meeting passed the following recommendations:

Maintenance reports in respect of Goyder Council properties leased to the National Trust be provided to the State Office by the Burra Branch and then forwarded to Goyder Council.

Glenys Carse, Chairman of the Regions’ & Branches’ Committee become a member of the Burra Branch sub-committee and a member of the Burra Branch who is not a member of the Burra Branch Committee join the sub-committee, having been chosen by votes of branch members.

Burra Branch Sub-Committee report to National Trust SA Council by 17 May 2008 on recommendations for contractual arrangements for the Burra Passport.

Arrangements based on the most recent leases and sales agency agreements remain in place until new arrangements are endorsed, except that the National Trust be released from maintenance obligations for Council owned sites for the period for which the Goyder Council has retained its share of the Passport income.

Chris Reed has recommended that a further general meeting be called as soon as possible to elect a member to the sub-committee.
