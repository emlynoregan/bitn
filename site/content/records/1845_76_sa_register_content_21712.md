The Width of Tires Act

This new Act will come into operation on 1 July 1868.  Its second clause requires that ‘no person shall carry on any public road in any wagon dray cart or other vehicle a greater weight than that next mentioned, that is to say for each wheel of every two wheeled vehicle a total weight, including such vehicle, of eight hundredweight avoirdupois and for each wheel of any four wheeled vehicle a total weight, including such vehicle, of nine hundredweight avoirdupois for every inch of width of bearing surface of the tire or felloe.’

[More details follow.]

The penalty for overweight is 1/- for each hundredweight or part of a hundredweight.  Also the Act requires that the name of the owner be painted on some conspicuous part under pain of a fine of not less than 5/- or more than £5.
