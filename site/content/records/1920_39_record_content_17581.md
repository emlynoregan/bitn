Burra Town Council, 19 November

There was some dispute about the lopping of a tree adjacent to the Bowling Green.

Burra District Council was in favour of creating a shared pound with the Town Council in Victoria Parl, but the Council need legal advice as to the power to use park lands for such a purpose.

The Aberdeen Road is to be tarred at once 20ft wide.
