Burra Town Council

The tender for the enlargement of the Burra Reservoir has gone to SA Reinforced Concrete Co.

Trees are being ringbarked by horses tied up to them.  The matter needs thought as tying up posts would be a danger to pedestrians in dark streets at night.

The Corporation will be brought under the Building Act, giving it a say in the type of structures to be erected in the town.
