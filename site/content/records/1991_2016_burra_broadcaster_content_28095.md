Regional Council of Goyder

Rate revenue for 2002-03 is set to rise by 6.97%.

In the coming financial year they will spend:

$50,000 on the Eudunda Railway Yard project.

$14,000 on the Booborowie water project.

$10,000 contribution to the mobile phone tower between Booborowie and Farrell Flat.

$21,000 upgrading public toilets throughout the area.

Loan payments this coming year include:

$98,000 for the Council Office upgrade.

$290,000 as last payment on the crushing plant.

$52,000 on the Paxton Cottages loan.

[Next year’s $28,000 will be the last payment on the Paxton’s loan.

Burra Swimming Pool repairs will cost about $11,800.

Goyder Council is assessing its support for the Community Activity Centre at Burra North.
