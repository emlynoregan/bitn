‘Basketball’ is a new game for girls that has been introduced into England.  This really splendid game is an importation from America . . . the great beauty of basketball consists in its extreme simplicity.  Basketball is, in fact a sort of football played with the hands and the teams are disposed in much the same manner with goal-keepers, backs, half-backs &c.
