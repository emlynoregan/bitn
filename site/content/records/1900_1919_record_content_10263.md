Editorial on the Burra Record.

The editor has been pleasantly surprised at the response to last weekâ€™s announcement that they were making a series of changes to improve the paper and boost circulation in the face of a period when trade was at a low ebb.  The cost of the Record would be cut to 1d [from 2d] with the aim of increasing sales and doubling circulation.
