[This article takes up again the rabid racism of the Chinese Question editorial and has passages of even more purple prose.]

e.g. ‘a great proportion of our agricultural labourers, dam sinkers, road makers, shearers, bricklayers, builders, mechanics, et hoc genus omne, are runaway sailors, “niggers”, Malays and Indians, to whom we must now add Egyptians and Assyrians! - to say nothing of “the yellow agony”, in the shape of almond eyed, meek and gentle Mongolian.’

‘Does Mr Cotton mean to establish veritable homesteads among us for the very lowest dregs of Africa, Asia and the black peopled islands of Melanesia?’

[The writing style is rather incoherent, sprinkled with Latin tags and full of extreme hyperbole and arrant nonsense.  It is not said who Holder put in place as acting editor while he went to NZ, but this reflects neither Holder’s style nor attitudes.  The style and comments made in his obituary strongly suggest it was Benjamin Franklin Langford, as does a notice later in 1884.  See: VI, 397, 12 Dec. 1884, page 2 and XV, 388, 11 Oct. 1899, page 2]
