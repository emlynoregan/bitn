The Phosphate Mines.  Lily Dora Mine has been shut down because the payable phosphate rock has been exhausted.  Mr H. Hassell took over the claim along with other claims some time ago and about 250 tons of selected rock have been despatched, but cartage costs means only high percentage rock is economic.
