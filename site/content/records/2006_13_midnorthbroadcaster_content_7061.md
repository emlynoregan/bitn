Burra Men’s Shed was officially opened last Wednesday.  Darryl Venning had the idea for a men’s shed after learning about other sheds at Snowtown, Moonta and Pt Broughton.  In December 2007 he found a shed that was previously used by the old Highways Department and after nine months of red tape and supporting phone calls district ranger to the new owners, the Department of Environment and Heritage, a five year lease was arranged.  Donations and a grant from the Community Benefits SA Program, Regional Council of Goyder and a Seniors Grant enabled the shed to open for business.  Assistance with paper work was given by leisure activities co-ordinator Verna Saunders and by John Monten, both of Lower North Health.  John assisted with securing the grants and in supplying occupational health and safety equipment.  Some of the activities to be carried out will be woodwork, metal work, painting and restoration of furniture and some electrical and computing help.  There are currently 23 members.  So far the shed has made toilet surrounds for Jazz in the Monster Mine, two plinths for the Burra Art Gallery and some large-scale wooden toys.  [Photos pages 10 & 17.]
