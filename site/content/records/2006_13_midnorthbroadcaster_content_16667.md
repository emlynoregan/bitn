The Mid North Community Men’s Shed Forum was held last week in Burra.  It was the first of its kind in the region and saw about 60 members assemble at the Bowling Club for lunch.  Guest speaker was Keith Bettany who spoke about his father’s experiences as a POW at Changi as an English artillery man.  There was also a visit to Burra Men’s Shed.  His father had recorded his experiences in a series of small sketchbooks and cartoons.  The gathering represented Men’s Sheds from Whyalla, Port Pirie, Port Wakefield, Barossa, Nuriootpa, Riverton, Clem’s Shed, Quorn, Jamestown, Booleroo Centre and Burra.
