Weather.  Thunderstorms which struck the Gum Creek area on Thursday delivered one inch in fifteen minutes at Peter Driver’s property and one inch in twenty minutes at Gerald Gask’s.  Heavy hail accompanied the fall, damaging oats and barley crops.  The creek came down within minutes.  Burra recorded only 28 points.  Over the ranges to the east some areas reported 80-90 points and creeks ran.
