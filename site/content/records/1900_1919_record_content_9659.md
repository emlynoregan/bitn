Burra Hospital’s Gas Lighting.

Details occupy ½ column.  The installation was by C.C. Williams and his foreman Mr Patrick Dower.  There is a generator carrying 36 lights.  Almost all the building is now lit, but a few more lights will be needed when finance permits.  R.M. Harvey presided at the opening.  Dr Sangster spoke, particularly of the advantage the lights would be in the operating theatre.  He particularly thanked the eight young girls whose bazaar had raised some of the money needed. (Nellie & Rita Vivian, Nellie Pearce, Ivy Ward, Irene Crewes, Neta Pearce, Milly Pascoe & Eileen Johnson.)  The hospital had played a vital role now for 27 years.  Revs. W.G.M. Murphy & W.F. James & Mr Winnall also spoke.  There were musical items and refreshments.
