Burra Town Hall Pictures Committee has decided to install Cinemascope for the pictures.

[Column 1 of this article is mostly unreadable.]

Arrangements are also in hand for redecorating the interior of the hall and for providing new seating in the dress circle.  As there is an opening either side it will not be necessary to have a central aisle as at present. It is hoped that Cinemascope and the redecoration and new seats will be installed by mid-February 1958.
