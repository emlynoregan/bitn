Editorial: The Dying Year

1890 has been an average sort of year.  There has been no great calamity of war, but conflict between capital and labour has continued.  Stanley has returned from the interior of Africa.  The Irish question remains unsettled.  Harvests have been good – one of the best.  Expenditure on mining has been considerable, but without great results except for gold at Waukaringa.

Politically we would willingly draw a curtain over the year’s work – ‘the whole year has been apparently wasted in office-seeking and twaddle.’

The Burra Mine remains at a standstill – though not half prospected.

The town has been improved, especially through tree planting.  Stock sales have made Burra the chief market place in the colony.  New offices have been erected for the salesmen.  [Elder, Smith & Co.]

Changes at the Institute hold promise and the oval has become more popular.

During the year the Record changed hands.

2nd Leader on The Burra Oval.

The United Friendly Societies’ Sports at the oval on Friday proved the value of that place of amusement.  Were the running and cycle tracks put in good condition profitable first-rate sporting events could be staged several times a year.  At present the cycle track is too dangerous to attract the best wheelmen.  On Friday £30-£40 was taken at the gate.
