Electric Light.  Ratepayers’ Meeting on 24 June at the Institute.

The Mayor said Burra was in a good position to install electricity with no competing gas supplies and no town debt.  Gawler and Kadina, both with debt, had successfully installed it.  Jamestown had borrowed £3,000 to install electricity and Angaston was to be lit as well.  In Kooringa canvassers had promises for 450 lights without banks, public buildings or offices, where directors had to give consent.  Council was for going ahead borrowing at 5%.  He would not support paying more.  A scheme for Kooringa could be got for £2,300 with another £700 to include Aberdeen, which would need another 300 lights to make it pay – or £12 a month.

The firm, Messrs Turner, Robertson & Co. would undertake to run the plant, guarantee to pay the interest, 8% depreciation and a certain profit – depreciation being on £1,300 and not on the wires and posts.  He was in favour, but the Council needed sanction of ratepayers for the scheme to raise a loan.  Mr Crewes said he was a novice and was present to learn the pros and cons, but was for electricity: acetylene gas was dirty and expensive.

Mr Turner said each light with lamp would cost 22/- and a 50 candlepower light would burn 2 hours for 1d and 16 candlepower 4 hours for 1d.  The present estimate allowed for 60% extension, which was believed adequate.  There would be a saving on street lighting of nearly £30 in Kooringa.  In the unlikely event of the scheme not paying there would be a charge on the rates.  Council would carry the wires 60’ from the main free and the charge would then be 1/- per yard to the consumer.

Mr Crewes thought a margin of 60% for growth was insufficient.  Burra was going to grow and might have another copper mine.  He also wanted North Ward included.  He moved the meeting approve the installation of electric light.  Mr H. Thomas 2nd.

He believed the powerhouse should be in the centre instead of at the depot down in Cemetery Flat.  Mr Turner said any large plant was out of the question and uneconomic.  In canvassing Aberdeen he could get a promise of 21 lights.  [Though he says he was there for 1½ hours of which 1 hour was wasted with hotel keepers.]  If the powerhouse were not at the depot it would require land rental and another building and so cost another £1,000 and would not pay.

Mr Crewes thought if it wouldn’t stand another £60 p.a. costs then ‘it must be pretty near the rocks’.

Mr Turner said a large engine would mean a loss of at least £10 a month.  It was cheaper to duplicate when needed.

Mr Dane thought the canvassing was inadequate: he hadn’t been asked and he lived next door to a Councillor and was dying for electric light.

The Mayor said the limit for the town was to borrow £4,000.  More enquiries would be made and another meeting held after a thorough canvass of the town.

The motion was carried almost unanimously.

Mr Winnall was not sure that moving the Council borrow £3,500 was wise, as if passed any 20 ratepayers could demand a poll and the motion would not be binding on Council.  Nevertheless, he did so move and Mr Hodge 2nd.
