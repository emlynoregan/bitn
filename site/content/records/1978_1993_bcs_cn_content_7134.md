Burra Show Society.  President’s Report

The annual show on 9 October was a success considering the poor seasonal conditions.  Gate takings were up c. $200.  There were record entries in Floral Art, Pets, Junior Needlework and Sheep and average entries elsewhere.  In the year the main hall was repaired and gutters and windows were repaired and painted.  Horse stalls were remodelled and rebuilt with piping stalls, thanks to the Pony Club.  Painting was also done on the front of the Secretary’s Office, Flower Pavilion and along the Pets’ Section and Canteen area.  Further painting and repair is needed to ceilings and roofs of the three main pavilions as well as to the poultry shed.

There is a healthy bank balance of $7,718, so some of this work can be done in 1983.

It is with regret that we note the recent death of Mr Fred Atkin, who was our valued handyman around the showground.

The assistance of the Rural Youth Club, Pony Club, Pistol Club and Scouts and Cubs throughout the year and on show day is much appreciated.

Office Bearers for 1982-83: Patron, Mr Murray Stockman; President, Mr D. Kellock; Vice-Presidents, Mr J. Duncan & Mr R. Shipard; Secretary, Mrs J. Jamieson.
