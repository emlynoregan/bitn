Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight to 12 September

No 2 open cut near the creek has been cut to 20 ft west at a depth of 7 ft.  Several small veins were exposed.

Riggs’ Tunnel Shaft has been sunk to 14 ft and a windlass erected.  Timbering was needed at the bottom.  It is hoped to encounter slate in about another 10 ft and then to drive west to re-cut seams.  The last crushing of 12½ tons yielded 2 oz 12 dwt plus 2 oz 3 dwt 1 gr by cyanide.

Another 25 ton crushing produced 4 oz 11 dwt 6 gr with tailings not processed.
