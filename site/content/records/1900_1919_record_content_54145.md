J.V. Lord writes from Oakvale Station re the huge fire then raging.  He understands the fire extends from near Wentworth right through the north to Buckalow and Netley boundary and from Popalta Station to Oakvale – an area about 70 miles wide by 100 miles long.  So far we have kept the fire off Oakvale, but it fronts the whole eastern boundary (about 20 miles long) – in places quite close and in others distant.  Wind is the real threat.  We have had a fire on the southern boundary 28 miles long, which was held with great difficulty.  Postmark Station lost much grass.  This fire is now going south towards Morgan vale & part of Pine Valley, but we expect to hold it at the Morgan vale boundary.  13 points of rain last night have checked, but nor extinguished it.
