The Burra Amateur Swimming Club was formed at a meeting at the Institute on Friday.  Two shelter sheds are to be built on the edge of the pool.  A 6’ x 4’ raft will be placed in the centre and two parallel ropes will be placed across the learners’ pool.  There will be 3’ wide steps to the water’s edge and timber staging in front of the shelter sheds.  A carnival is planned for 16 March.  The swimming season will run from 1 October to 31 March annually. President, S. Burns; Secretary & Treasurer, Rev. H.C. Farley.
