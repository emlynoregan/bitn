[The first services in the church were actually held on the 20 December 1903, which makes 1953 a more reasonable Jubilee year than a 1904 opening would suggest, though why celebrate in June is not clear.  It was in June 1903 that the name of the church was chosen and memorial stones were laid on 14 October that year.]
