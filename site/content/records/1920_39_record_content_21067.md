A Shell Depot for Burra

It was due solely to the enterprise of the British Imperial Oil Co. that petrol pumps have replaced the old expensive tins and cases of petrol.  Bulk distribution began in Australia in 1915 when Shell fuel oil, motor spirit and ‘Pennant’ lighting kerosene were brought to Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide in bulk.  The difference in price today is 3/- for every 8 gallons.  Bulk depots have now been opened at Jamestown, Clare, Kadina, Kapunda, Broken Hill, Port Pirie, Quorn and Loxton.  For primary producers bulk containers of 4 and 8 gallons are available.  Shell will hire pumps to garages who do not wish to install their own due to the cost.  This saves the consumer at least 3d per gallon.  The opening ceremony at the Burra Depot will be at 3 p.m. on 3 November.
