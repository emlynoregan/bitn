Obituary.  Edward Oates died 31 January 1956 aged 92.  Mr Oates sold a small farming property at Leighton in 1902 (owned many years later by Mr R. Wigley) and purchased a property at Mt Barker.  Sub clover and super were not then known and the pastures were so unproductive that he sold up and returned to live in Aberdeen and rented a 2,000 acre grazing property ‘Munjibbie’ east of Terowie.  Later he bought 600 acres at Baldina, which he sold to take up a portion of South Booborowie when it was subdivided.  After WWI he sold the Booborowie land and lived in semi-retirement at Bridgewater.  About 1924 he bought a small farm at Kapunda, which he sold in 1928.  He then retired to Burra.  After the death of his wife, sixteen years ago, he lived with his daughter, Mrs H. Shearer, at Sefton Park.  Until being confined to his bed about two months ago, he had remarkably good health and retained all his faculties, including a good memory and could read newspapers.  He is survived by two sons and one daughter: Rupert, Horace and Eunice.  While in Burra he and his wife were actively associated with the Methodist Church.  He was for a short while a Councillor for Baldina Ward of the District Council.  [Born 30 December 1863 Upper Wakefield District of SA.]
