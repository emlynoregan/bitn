Obituary.  A ¾ column article is reprinted from the Kapunda Herald on the late William George Goodchild.  He came to Kapunda c. 1864 and worked in his uncle’s office.  (Mr J. White)  He then became manager of the Clare branch of the English & Scottish Bank and later went into partnership with Mr James White as auctioneers and stock salesmen.  He married a daughter of Mr William Oldham.  In 1872 he went to the NT when the gold rush occurred there, but returned to Kapunda and entered into business as an auctioneer on his own account.  Shortly he joined with Mr Coles to form Coles and Goodchild.  When Mr Coles retired the firm continued briefly as Goodchild, Austin & Co. and then finally as Goodchild, Duff & Co.  He was respected as an honest man and made a JP in 1879 and had recently been elected Worshipful Master of the local Masonic Lodge.
