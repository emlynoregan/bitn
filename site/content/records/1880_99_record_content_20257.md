We contend it is absolutely illegal to enclose portions of streets and reserves and to give any right or title to any person over any portion illegally enclosed.  The Council have no power to permit any person to occupy any portion of a street with or without rent.

As to the Mayor’s enclosure of an area with a stone wall which unmistakably gives it the appearance of being part of his property; that is not at all justified.  At the very least it should have had an application before Council for approval.

The year’s Council is not a pleasant one to review.  It began with talk that everyone that went before it was all-wrong and about what wonders were to be performed.  It continued with great storms and restlessness when criticised and ended in a very discreditable way with members of Council, including the Mayor, flatly contradicting each other.  It is the first time there has been such a display and ratepayers have been good-humoured and long suffering.

The gravest piece of maladministration was the sale of Short St to Cr Tiver and Mr Preece for less than half its value.  It could not be bought again we assert for £100 and was sold for £20.

Ratepayers though do not deserve much sympathy.  The very matters they queried on Thursday and condemned, were reported by us in full and might at the time have been prevented, but no one cared to intervene.  We have often protested, but have been called harsh and critical and the ratepayers left us to stand alone.  Some people only wake up at election time and ask questions only when it is too late to do anything.
