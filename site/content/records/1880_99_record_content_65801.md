Firewood Creek Survey.  On Saturday evening a deputation waited on the Treasurer, the Hon. F. W. Holder, to impress on him the need for a survey from Firewood Creek to Burra.  In the event that the operation of the Burra Mine begins the town water supply will fail as the mine is dewatered.  Firewood Creek and any other source need to be considered.  The bore had gone through 250’ of useful lode and with copper prices rising Mr Lewis said he saw no reason why the mine should not be developed.  E.C. Lockyer considered the current water was unfit even for bathing and he thought Firewood Creek could be a useful site.  A dam there would eliminate the need for pumping with its attendant costs.  Mr Winnall said the water in the Waterworks’ Well had fallen 8-9” lately and several feet during the past year.  It was in effecting an addition to the piping that the recent break had occurred.  Burra did not often run to the Government for every little need so this matter was something the Government could easily undertake.  The Treasurer undertook to send up an engineer as soon as possible to get a reply on the feasibility and cost.  He did however see a difficulty regarding cost, which was likely to exceed £10,000.
