The Swing Bridge opposite the Town Hall will be replaced.  AMRCO Aust. Pty Ltd has quoted for two-ten plate multi-plate arches each 5 ft wide with a span of 25 ft, giving a rise of 12 ft 9 inches at a cost of Â£428-5-0 less 7% F.O.R. Sydney.  It was decided to order the spans, which will be the basis for a solid construction bridge to be erected a little north of the old bridge, to serve as a crossing for the school and the swimming pool.  The old bridge will later be removed.
