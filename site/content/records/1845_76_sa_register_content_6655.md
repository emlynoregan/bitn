The NSW Gold Diggings

[The reports from the Bathurst district confirm large auriferous deposits and there are statements that 400 men working around the Government Geologist were making 1 to 2 oz of gold a day.  The £1 gold licence is confirmed, as is the rising price of provisions, with flour reaching £30 per ton.

A letter to the Register removes any doubt of the fact that a vast quantity of gold is to be found between Summerhill in the south and Dubbo in the north, known generally as the Wellington District, 35 miles from Bathurst and 150 miles from Sydney.  Gold is selling at £3-3-0 to £3-5-0 per troy ounce.  Six men in a few days raised 17 ounces and another report said men were getting an ounce per day.

While men can easily make 15/- a day, the cost of provisions is very high and as a result many robberies are taking place.  Excitement is still rising and men are arriving in large numbers.  Other industrial pursuits in the colony are being neglected and as a result wages have suddenly risen almost 25%.  A complete madness has overtaken the colony.  [Details are given of law and order issues and the costs and means of getting from Sydney to the area, as well as reports on how other parts of the economy are being affected.]]
