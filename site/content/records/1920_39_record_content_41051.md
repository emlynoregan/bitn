Mongolata Goldfield

Prospects continue to look good.  A strong attempt is being made to float Mongolata No. 8 with entirely local capital.  From Mongolata No. 8 9½ tons and returns have totalled over £380 and after wages have been paid members of the syndicate have received handsome cheques.  But the process is slow without funds.  At present 7-8 tons is at grass.  Two men took six weeks to get this out, the other man being engaged in sinking the shaft.

There is a long report of an interview with W. Rogers of Broken Hill, son of the late John Rogers of Baldina, who has been visiting and who has spent his time in New Guinea on a gold mine.
