Departures from Burra

Rev. D.G. Haydon & Mrs Haydon with children Barry & Janet left for Broken Hill early this month after a stay of 4¾ years.  Rev. Haydon has been particularly active in youth work and during his term the Redruth and Kooringa circuits were amalgamated to form the Burra Circuit.  He was President of the Burra Cricket Association for two years and led the Kooringa tennis team to victory last season.  Mrs Haydon was President of the Redruth Methodist Ladies’ Guild and a member of the Church’s House Committee.
