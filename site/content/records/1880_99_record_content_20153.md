The public works this year have been work on about 200 chains of roads and 300 chains of footpaths.  The relationship with the Midland Road Board has previously been rather strained, but we have this year managed to put them on a better footing.  As a result the Board has ceded to Council control of the Main Roads except for the actual metalled centre, which has allowed us to effect many improvements.  Examples: -

The footpath from St Mary’s to the Mine Bridge

A lengthened culvert near the Hospital

A widened road and footpath near Dr Sangster’s

A widened approach and relocated fence on both sides of the Commercial St Bridge near Mr Lewis’s

A widened approach on the N-E side of the Kingston St Bridge

New culvert and infilling of a dangerous drain on the S-E end of the Kingston St Bridge

Improved street junctions on Morehead St

Widening of the road near Roach’s Mill
