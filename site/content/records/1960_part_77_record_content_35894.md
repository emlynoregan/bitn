The Burra to Adelaide Cycle Race was held last Saturday.  It was won by 56-year-old Keith Thurgood for the second time.  He had previously won it in 1935 and until 1967 the race had never been won twice by the same rider.  The route started in Burra, went five miles towards Mt Bryan and returned via Burra and the Main Adelaide Road to Elizabeth and on to the finish at Modbury via Golden Grove Road.  Riders faced a fierce head wind for much of the way.  Results:

K. Thurgood (14 minutes)

I. Hennig (14 minutes)

The fastest time was by K. Smoker of Whyalla in 4 hours 18 minutes and he was also the first country rider to finish.
