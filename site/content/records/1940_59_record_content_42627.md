Obituary.  Herbert William (Bert) Morgan aged 44 died at Burra Hospital on Sunday night after a fairly long illness.  He was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Herb. Morgan.  He was educated at Burra and then worked on his fatherâ€™s Morgan Vale & Wildildie Stations.  Just before his father died two years ago H.W. Morgan bought a farm near Spalding.  Sixteen years ago he married Miss Sylvia Walker.  He had been a keen tennis player, footballer and a rifleman.  He helped re-organise the Spalding Rifle Club after the wartime recess.  He is survived by a wife and two sons aged 14 & 4.
