Burra Town Council

Men have been put on to plant the trees that were to have been planted by the children on Arbor Day.

There has been no reply from the Railway Commissioners re the Aberdeen Crossing gate.

L-C Thomas will do his best about damage to tree guards etc., but all is quiet until his back is turned.

Several tree guards have recently been destroyed, this time those who destroyed them have stated they were willing to pay for the damage.

Bagot, Shakes and Lewis have summonsed the Corporation for trespass leading to the flooding of their yard following removal of stones earth etc. under Council instruction.  Council will defend the action.
