Burra Easter Bowling Carnival

Almost 100 men and women players took part on Monday and a large gallery observed till the last bowl at 10.30 p.m.  Catering provided for morning and afternoon teas only, except for a light ea for about 30 players and committeemen.  The final was between a Clare Team skippered by R. Scott and a Burra Team skippered by L. Phillips.  The game was a draw after 12 ends.  In the play-off on the 13th end the umpire could not separate the opposing shot balls and the Clare Team finally won by one shot on the 14th end.
