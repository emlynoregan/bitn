Burra Country Music Festival & Yacht Race.

Plans are underway, but much has yet to be done to complete the steps to revive the event.  It has been decided to make the yacht race the Peter Reilly Memorial Race.

The History of the Burra Yacht Club

In the winter of 1980 Burra experienced some severe flooding, which resulted in several feet of fast flowing muddy water passing over the Bon Accord ford

After a hard day’s work north of Burra, Jimmy (Tracker) James couldn’t wait to get to the Bon Accord to sample some of its fine ale and made a calculated decision to cross the ford in his car.

The water was deeper than anticipated and the car stalled mid-way.

Peter Reilly noted Tracker’s desperate plight and effected a resue.

After many an ale at the Bon Accord, Peter and Tracker got into a discussion about which of them could sail the farthest down Burra Creek.

The only way to settle it was to try it out.

On the appointed day the pair arrived at the present site of the regatta, armed with stubbies and their respective craft and the race was run in accordance with a suitable lack of rules.

Nobody knows who won this inaugural event, as neither craft completed the course, but all and sundry thought it a great idea and plans were laid to make it an annual event.

A club was formed and in 1981 the first full scale Burra Yacht Club Regatta was held.

In the 1st Regatta the ‘Open Cutter’ of Burra won, but was challenged in 1982 by the ‘Mallala Special’.

For his role in the foundation of the club Tracker James was made permanent Commodore of the Club and Peter Reilly was appointed Chairman and was presented with the ‘Order of the Burra Yacht Club’ for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.

In honour of his devotion to the club the main event of 2014 will be known as the Peter Reilly Memorial Race.
