Obituary.  Mr James A. Pearce died suddenly at his residence at Payneham on 2 July.  He had been born in Kooringa 24 December 1873, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs William Pearce (of the old Burra firm of Bath & Pearce).  He was educated at the Burra Model School and afterwards at Prince Alfred College.  He was also a clever pencil artist and was a pupil of the late James Ashton of Adelaide.  He was a highly regarded caricaturist, with works accepted by leading SA and interstate magazines.  After leaving college, he and his brother carried on their fatherâ€™s business for some time.  After the business was dissolved, Mr Jim Pearce left to reside in Adelaide.  For some time prior to his retirement, he was employed by the State Government.  While in Burra he was keenly involved in sport and was one of the earliest members of the Burra Rifle Club.  He is survived by a widow (nee Miss Ethel Powell), two brothers, Mr Will Pearce of Chatswood NSW and Charles Pearce of Strathalbyn and one sister, Mrs James Bentley of Tusmore, Adelaide.
