The Annual Mt Bryan Hall Dinner Dance was held recently.  The theme of decorations reflected the Year of the Farmer.  Currently one of the cloakrooms is being refurbished to become the home of historical records that are stored at the hall.  Glass fronted cupboards were purchased recently with the contents on display creating much interest on the night.
