Editorial on the [Co-operative] Village Settlement Schemes.

These have been seen for some time in Victoria and NZ and now nearly 1,000 men, women and children have gone to the same along the River Murray under an Act passed in 1893.  This requires 20 or more over the age of 18 and such associations may be granted up to 160 acres for each villager on perpetual lease.  Most settlements so far are communistic â€“ all property owned or acquired being held in common, not individually.  There are some problems in getting through the early years before fruit crops can produce.  People who are long unemployed nevertheless are finding it attractive.
