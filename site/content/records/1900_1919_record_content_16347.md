Editorial: Settlement on the Land

The writer is in favour of closer settlement and feels that the Government should be doing more to see people settled on land and making it more fruitful.  If not by actually paying them then at least by giving cheap leases and assisting with setting-up costs of implements, clearing, fencing and the like.

The weather has been more congenial after a heatwave in which working horses were sunstruck and birds died by the score.
