Burra Hospital

The new wing is completed internally, with just a few finishing external details to come.  It brings the Hospital into line with some of the best in the state.  The sunroom on the western end will be a useful addition.  In the wards new beds have replaced old and they can be raised and lowered.  Children’s Ward has large observation windows from the corridor.  The whole has been designed to be light and cheerful.  A sunken area alongside the Children’s bath allows a staff member to wash a child without uncomfortable bending.  Several new share rooms have been built.  The staff dining room opens into a small courtyard.  The kitchen is large and modern with stainless steel equipment.  A small room adjacent is provided for Meals on Wheels helpers and communicates with the kitchen through hatches.  Large incinerators have been placed in the old kitchen.

The Labour Ward and its satellite rooms are business-like and can deal with any emergency.  General patients can be placed in unoccupied midwifery wards if it is necessary.  The whole appearance is of hotel-like comfort combined with every consideration of practicality from emergency lighting to the 2,000 gallon rainwater tank beneath the floor and the whole now being on one level makes life much easier for those working there.
