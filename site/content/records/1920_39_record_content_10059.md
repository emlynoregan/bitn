Fire spread through grass on W.H. Sandland’s Koo-owie 10 miles south of Burra on Monday morning destroying fencing and 1,200 acres of grass.  The fire was virtually confined to Koo-owie.  Mr Sandland had just brought in 2,100 sheep from his Balah Station due to drought.  They were on the road near the station and during the fire Mrs Sandland took charge of them for five or six hours.
