St Mary’s Church has received a grant from the Department of Environment and planning for painting work.  During 1986 about $25,000 will be spent on the 106-year-old building.  Cement mortar in the western wall was fretting.  There had been problems ever since lime mortar had been removed about 26 years ago.  It was hoped repairs would be completed by 31 March.
