Mt Bryan.  Item on the local terminology.

Until a few years ago ‘Mt Bryan’ was taken to mean what we now call Mt Bryan East and the area of some seven or eight farms around the railway station was referred to as Mt Bryan Flat.

[The town at the railway station was laid out as a private town in 1878 under the name Mt Bryan.  A contiguous subdivision was laid out by the Government in 1907 and called Mt Bryan East.  This was obviously confusing given local usage applied that name to another locality.  Officially the whole town became Mt Bryan in 1941.]

The Government has purchased a large area for closer settlement.  There are already new farms at Petherton.  The article goes on to refer to the pegging out of the Government Town without naming it and predicts a great future for the centre.
