MNRDB

The Minister of Trade & Economic Development Karlene Maywald, publicly criticised the Board when two reports landed on her desk.  One highlighted some minor clerical errors.  The other was the Howeâ€™s Report, which was a governance audit, instigated by the Board to fine tune its operation.  A large turnover of staff in the past twelve months resulted in some inconsistencies in its reporting to the Department.  Board Members found that a lot of extra time was being spent on reporting and addressing the extra workload, eventually making their function unworkable.  As a result all but one member resigned this week.  Clare & Gilbert Valley Council, the Regional Council of Goyder, Northern Areas Council and the Office of Regional Affairs has agreed that a new Board needs to be quickly appointed.
