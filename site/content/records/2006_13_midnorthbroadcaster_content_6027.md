AGL Energy Ltd has sold the 71 MW Hallett 2 wind farm to Energy Infrastructure Trust (EIT) managed by ANZ Infrastructure Services (ANZIS).  Arrangements are similar to their sale of Hallett 1 wind farm to Perpetual in December 2006.  EIT will fund remaining development and construction costs and will own the farm, while AGL will buy all the energy and all the Renewable Energy Certificates produced and maintain and operate the property.
