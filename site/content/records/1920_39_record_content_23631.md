The discovery of gold in Victoria then led to the departure of most of the men and work in connection with the mine and smelting stopped.  When the men eventually returned work was resumed.  Paxton’s Square was built to provide accommodation for miners and was named after one of the directors of the company.  When the railway reached Kapunda the Gulf Road was abandoned in favour of sending ore there.  When G.S. Walters left for England in January 1852 Mr G.K. Horn went with him to get mules from Valparaiso.  Captain Coleman arrived on 17 July 1853 with 70 mules from Montevideo – 180 had been shipped, but only 70 survived a very rough voyage.  Other shipments followed.  A Company Farm was established at Mintaro to grow hay for their horses and mules and as a spelling ground for both.  This property is now Mr & Mrs Alex Melrose’s ‘Kadlunga’.  The Auburn to Clare district began to supply Burra with fruit, vegetables and dairy produce.  In 1860 copper was found at Wallaroo by a shepherd called Jimmy Boer, employed by Captain Hughes and not long afterwards another of his shepherds, Paddy Ryan, found copper at Moonta.  These mines had the advantage of coastal locations.

Mr Treloar says in 1867 he had the opportunity of visiting the Burra Mine in working condition underground and seeing Morphett’s pump working to supply the launders serving jiggers, samplers, crushers etc.  The town then was bustling with mule teams for Kapunda and boarded up wagons branded P.C.C., but before long it was possible to earn more at Wallaroo and skilled miners moved on to Yorke Peninsula.  The mine at Burra closed in 1877.  In its some 29 years of activity it paid £2,241,167 in general expenses, produced 234,648 tons of ore & 51,622 tons of pure copper at an average 22-23% copper per ton.  When the mine closed people left the town for fresh fields and there was little sale for property.
