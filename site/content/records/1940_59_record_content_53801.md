The RSL held its AGM its club rooms on Saturday night.  A minute silence was observed in remembrance of the late King.  Elected were: President, I.D. Richardson; Vice-Presidents, H.C. Cornelius & R.C. Lott; Secretary, C. Davey and Treasurer, J. Sorrell.

The President read his report on an active and successful year.  Repairs and a repainting of the outside of the building were accomplished.  The Ball was very successful, as was the annual Smoke Social.  Many thank were due to the Ladies’ Auxiliary who helped so much with both these functions and with the Children’s Party.  Two badge days were held.  The TB Soldiers’ Appeal raised £14-5-0 and the Anzac Day Badge Appeal raised £15-10-0.  Another Ward in the Legacy Appeal was adopted by donating £25.  We obtained the services of the Ex-Navalmen’s Band for the Anzac Day Service on 29 April, where the collection was £32.  Services were attended and wreaths laid on Remembrance Day and Air Force Day.  On 1 June the President unveiled the Honour Roll of those who served [in WWII] from the Leighton District, in the Leighton Hall.  The President also attended the presentation of the Charter to the Burra Sub-Branch of the Air Force Assoc., their annual Smoke Social and the Cocktail Party prior to their Ball.  Early in the year we entertained the recruiting party and we regret the recent disbanding on the local platoon [of the CMF.]  There were no Anzac Sports this year because we were involved in organising the Jubilee Sports, from which our cheque for £34 has been handed to the Celebrations Secretary.  Two active committee members left the town: Dick Aldridge went to Adelaide and Ray Hughes went to Georgetown.  Their places have been taken by Tom Fuller and Cec. Beckwith.
