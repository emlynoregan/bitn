Leighton Oval

[In reviewing the Preliminary Football Final the paper’s correspondent apparently expressed the view that a better oval than Leighton could have been found.  An anonymous writer then challenges this view and made a couple of interesting points.

There were practically no improvements at the ground, but the club was formed during the war, so improvements were not possible.  There is a ‘scoring end’, but quarterly changes of end render this no advantage.

The editor says the disadvantages are:

1.  The ground slopes down to the ‘scoring end’.

2.  It is of difficult access without a vehicle.
