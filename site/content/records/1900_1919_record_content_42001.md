A meeting was called 31 May at Jubilee Hall to decide how best to assist our wounded.  The meeting was convened by Rev. J.C. Jennison and Mr C. Bartholomæus and chaired by E.W. Crewes.

The Mayor thought that the Government ought to be providing the basic necessities such as blankets etc. and that Burra donations were extensive.  The Cheer-up Society and the Red Cross were already in the field so he was unsure what the convenors had in mind.  If they were thinking of another branch of either society he thought that divided efforts were not always the best, though he admitted that the distance to walk to attend meetings in Kooringa was a factor.

Cr Radford said that blankets etc. would doubtless be provided, but that for items like pyjamas ladies could make them at half the cost.  He moved the formation of ‘Our Soldiers’ Aid Society’ with the aim of rendering such aid to soldiers wounded or on active service as was deemed necessary.  He envisaged pyjamas, slippers, sheets and possibly patchwork quilts.  When convalescent temporary homes might be required and light work.  Also little luxuries like bacon, eggs etc might be sent to hospitals.  He felt that Aberdeen needed its own organisation.  By the time ladies carried their machines etc. to Kooringa they would be out of breath.  There was no sense of opposition to Kooringa.

Mrs Killicoat would provide afternoon tea at 3d a head to cover the cost of material.

If the committee so desired they would offer Abberton Park for the duration as a convalescent hospital – it could accommodate 25-30 beds.  Burra could equip it and offer it to the authorities complete, but for the nurses and medical comforts.

The motion to form the society was carried.

Rev. J.C. Jennison nominated Mrs Bloyd for President.  Mrs Bartholomæus was elected Vice-President, Mrs Frank Sara became Secretary and Mr Guy Tiddy was elected Treasurer.  Mr C. Fuss moved membership be 1/- for ladies and 2/6 for gentlemen.  Lieut. Killicoat’s offer of Abberton Park was accepted in principal and the authorities are to be informed of it.  The Methodist Church trustees offered Jubilee Hall free for all meetings.  Subscriptions so far are £9-3-6.
