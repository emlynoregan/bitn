August Miller, blacksmith, after 29 years in Burra, has decided to try the ‘Golden West’ and so leaves on Saturday week.  He worked for Statton & Henderson in the early days and when that partnership dissolved, for W. Henderson.  Later he took over the shop known as Hudson’s in Thames St and has worked there ever since.
