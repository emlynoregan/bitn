Cr Bevan moved that the Medical Officer & Inspector visit Burra State School and inspect the tanks and facilities for drinking water.  He had been told the water in the tanks was undrinkable and that lately the tap water was too hot to drink.  Children had been taking their own supplies in bottles, but the headmaster had put a stop to this.
