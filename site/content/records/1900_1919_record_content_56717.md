Obituary.  Mr William Sleep, brother to the Misses Sleep of Kooringa, has died in Ashburton New Zealand.  He was born in Kooringa in 1845, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Sleep.  When a young man he went first to Willowie where he entered into business and second to Moonta for 27 years.  He went to New Zealand two years ago, as some family members live there.  He was a staunch supporter of the Methodist Church, being a Sunday school teacher and a lay preacher.  He married Miss Dobney of Kooringa who died several years ago.  Four sons and one daughter survive: Edgar & Frank in New Zealand, Fred in Kadina, Percy in Adelaide and Mrs Trewartha in New Zealand.  There are two sisters and one brother: Miss A. Sleep and Miss M.E. Sleep, both of Kooringa and Fred in Victoria.  His youngest son Pte Theobald Sleep was k.i.a. in France in 1916.

[Born 23 June 1845 Kooringa.]
