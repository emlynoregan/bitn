Mr E.W. Dunhill of Burra North completed 73 years of service as a Local Preacher in the Methodist Church on 20 September.  This is a record unparalleled in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook and in early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909.  He took up residence in Burra in 1915 and carried on a business as a blacksmith for 45 years, relinquishing it only five years ago at the age of 83*.  Mr Dunhill was the first man in Australia to receive a certificate recognising 60 years of service to the Church as a Lay Preacher.  He has also given long service in Sunday school work, with 37 years as Superintendent.  The President of Conference sent a letter of congratulations to Mr Dunhill, who will be 90 on 19 October.

[Clearly this does not accord with his being 90 in October.]
