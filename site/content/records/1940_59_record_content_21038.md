The 28 had only two two-man rubber dinghies and two hollow planks on which to keep afloat.  Fortunately SOS calls had been made and 90 minutes later a Sunderland flew low over them and dropped ten rubber Carley floats.  Four were secured by the men, but they were too seasick by then to gather the other six.  They lashed the floats together and spent a freezing cold night in them.  The floats contained only a few small bottles of water and some lollies.  The pilot, who was in charge, gave the men a small drink as night fell and a lolly, which eased the seasickness.  Soon after dawn the Sunderland returned and signalled that boat rescue was one and a half hours away.  The crash boat arrived at 9 a.m.  The old boomship Beryl was twelve miles away and when she arrived 25 of the party were transferred to her.  Three, including Sgt Broad were rushed straight to hospital in Pt Moresby, where he reports receiving excellent treatment.  He spent eight days in hospital before flying to Townsville and then Brisbane and on to Burra by train.  [Further details printed.]
