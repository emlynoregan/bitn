Lawn Tennis

Last week Dr Steele presided at a meeting in the Town Hall Lodge Room to inquire into the chances of reviving the Burra Lawn Tennis Club.  Dr Steele said that in about 1942 the Club became inactive because of diminishing membership and high costs.  The power cutter and hosing had been sold.  He was not sure what assets survived, but the nets seemed to be in repair and there was £36-13-3 in the bank.  Other assets included two sprinklers.  Mr Bednall explained that at first a syndicate with a capital of £300 had been formed and this syndicate had purchased certain assets for the club and provided the courts.  Club members then paid 5% interest on the money because syndicate members wanted to see assets maintained.  The arrangements had been successful up until the war and the syndicate was anxious to see the club going again.  The assets of the club belonged to the syndicate.

Mr Bednall said it would cost about £20 to start the club again; mostly in labour to cut the lawns and water them.

One club had recently started in Burra North and there was talk of another in Burra. Asphalt courts were costlier to play on because they wore balls and shoes out more quickly and racquets needed more frequent restringing.  The courts needed attention soon.

Mr J. Barker said there was a fair amount of couch grass in the courts now.

Mr Bednall said they should have at least £50 to start with and this would not be found from ordinary subscriptions.
