Burra Open Bowling Carnival

On Saturday the ladies served a knife and fork poultry luncheon for 130 bowlers and visitors in the Masonic Supper Room in two sittings.  In the club house they provided morning tea for 100 and afternoon tea for 150 and tea for about 40 finalists and committeemen.  About 150 to 200 onlookers attended and cars lined Thames Street from Market Square to the greens.  On Monday with mixed rinks a further 100 men and women players took part.  Next year it is expected the club will be able to improve on this outstanding success with accommodation for twice the players.  [Results next issue.]
