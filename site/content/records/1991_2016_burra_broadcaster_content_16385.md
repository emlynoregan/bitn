The Regional Council of Goyder has applied to the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program for funds to develop a copper interpretive centre at the Burra Mine at a cost of $750,000.  This would complete the Burra Mine Museum and provide visitors with a unique experience.  It is the first opportunity to seek such a grant since the SA Sesquicentenary.  Morphett’s Enginehouse would be the main focus and there would be three primary components:

Reconstruction of Morphett’s Boilerhouse.

Construction and installation of a full size replica Cornish Beam Engine.

Essential maintenance of the Enginehouse and reintroduction of the Shears to the Enginehouse to support the main beams.
