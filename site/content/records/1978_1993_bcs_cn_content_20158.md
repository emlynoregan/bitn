BCS.  New facilities.  This year the school will receive its Open Access Suite.  This will be provided at the eastern end of the Redruth Building and will consist of a kitchen for senior student comfort, a tutorial area for small group instruction, a DUCT room for sending and receiving lessons, an office for the Open access Administrator and a quiet study area.  [A plan is printed.]
