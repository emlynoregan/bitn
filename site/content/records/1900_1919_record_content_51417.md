Attempted Murder at Copperhouse.

On Wednesday Mrs H. Fisher’s two small daughters found a parcel wrapped in brown paper and addressed to their mother.  When she opened it there was an explosion.  A pistol had been concealed in the box in a position likely to shoot someone standing up when they lifted the lid.  Fortunately Mrs Fisher was seated with her young baby in her arms and the powder from the shot blackened her arm and the baby’s face.  So far the police have made no progress.
