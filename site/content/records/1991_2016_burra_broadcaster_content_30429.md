The Burra Cemetery Committee has just received funds to repair and resite the last of the headstones that have been leaning against the western wall for a number of years.  The six remaining historical headstones dating back to the 1870s will be resited.  The story goes back to the 1960s when the local Council bulldozed a section of the cemetery plots where the 99-year leases had expired.  The rubble and headstones were used as landfill for the Aberdeen tennis courts and the bridge on Ayers Street, but some were rescued by history conscious locals and since then a number have been resited at the cemetery.
