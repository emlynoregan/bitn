Redruth Court

Ebenezer Robert Dangers was charged on the information of Joseph Jackson  with the theft  on Sunday of a purse, three pound notes and other small items at Mr Williams’ Boarding House Redruth.  [This was a somewhat confused case because all the men involved were drunk at the time of the alleged offence.]

Dangers had gone to the Police Station on Sunday at about noon to report he had been robbed by Charles Odgers of £3 while at the White Hart Hotel that morning.  Dangers was made to turn out his pockets and the P-C Francis Bennett found a purse and other items Dangers said were his property.

On the way to the White Hart Dangers said the £3 was Jackson’s and Jackson identified the purse.  Dangers was found to have some notes hidden in his sock.

When examined Jackson admitted he had been drinking Sunday morning and might have given Dangers the money.

Charles Odgers was examined and denied taking the money, but said Dangers had offered to fight him for £1 and had gone to Jackson’s room and come out with some notes in the purse.  Dangers had then said that he was flush with money, let’s go and shout.

Dangers said they did not fight, but being in liquor, he afterwards forgot where he had put the money and thought Odgers had stolen it.

The bench dismissed the case.
