A ‘Correspondent in the North’ writes with the idea of canalising the River Broughton as a means of transport to the coast from the Booborowie area.  There are, he says, a dozen springs in the Booborowie area and a good source of water at Gum Creek and more from the Hutt River, which would supply the water for a waterway, but urgent action in needed before all the land along the route is alienated in the present rush to bring agriculture to the area.
