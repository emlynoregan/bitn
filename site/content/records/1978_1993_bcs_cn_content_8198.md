Some of the social implications were:

A pensioner is on a different social level from a recently unemployed person.

Unemployed people are extremely sensitive about their status within the community and apt to react to thoughtless generalisations.

There is resistance in the community to many of the programs that have the potential to improve and/or increase the say of the unemployed in community affairs.

This resistance states the premise that if you provide a suitable environment for unemployed people, including low income housing, you will attract more unemployed people, which we don’t want anyway.

Some of Burra’s unemployed are coping remarkably well, while others cannot successfully come to grips with the change in their lifestyle.  Some have high level skills.

What can Local Government do?

Take no action – deciding it is a matter for State and Federal jurisdiction.

Take action – play a supportive role by using avenues provided by Community Development Boards, sporting and service clubs etc.

[The article then goes on to discuss some ways in which this can be done and how ingrained attitudes of the community and of the unemployed may be changed.]
