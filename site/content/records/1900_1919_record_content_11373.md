Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Firing in a shaft near the Hospital has damaged the building and repairs are to be carried out.  If work is resumed there the firing will have to be very light, but resumption seems unlikely.  There is no hope of the mine yielding returns unless it is unwatered.  Development work is going on very slowly.  Talk of pumping out the mine pool seems to have died again.  All that has been done is to reject tenders when they have been called.
