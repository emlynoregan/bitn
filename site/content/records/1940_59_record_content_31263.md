Burra Salvation Army asked if the Council could either sell or donate the instruments of the old Burra Brass Band to the Salvation Army.

Cr Kellaway said they could not be sold as they were in trust.  He moved they be loaned to the Army.  Carried.

The Salvation Army was granted the right to use one or two lights on the rotunda for their Saturday night meetings.
