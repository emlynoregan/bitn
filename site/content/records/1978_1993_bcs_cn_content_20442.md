Robyn Page

I have been a Councillor for the past two years and have sought to maintain contact with a range of community groups through involvement with:

The Lewis Board of Management

Burra Mine Museum

Burra Swimming Pool Committee

Finance Committee

Planning Committee

I maintain an interest with the National Trust and the Community Newsletter.  If elected I would pursue a number of issues:

Support and encourage local industry and business

Seek to improve services for seniors

Pursue effective and efficient use of plant and resources

Develop short and long term plans for tourism

Press for the sealing of the Morgan-Burra-Spalding Road

Revise rates and rating structure across the district.

With the reduction of the number of Councillors from 11 to 7 it is important that people vote.
