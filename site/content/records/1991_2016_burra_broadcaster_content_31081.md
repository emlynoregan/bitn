Burra Visitor Centre has made a good start to 2003.  Manager Andrew Glen says there has been a smooth transition to the new management, with the transfer of former employees John Arthur and Elly Monfries and two new enthusiastic employees in Stephanie Bavistock and Stephanie Crowley.  Weather has also been good and the re-accreditation process has ensured SA Tourism funding for 2003.  Support from the National Trust, Goyder Council and local businesses has been excellent.
