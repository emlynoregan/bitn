Burra Town Council, 16 February

The Mayor has for some time objected to the structure of the two standing committees (Finance & Public Works).  Both have three members with the Mayor as Chairman.  In theory he has a casting vote, but in fact if a motion is moved and seconded there can never be a need for a casting vote and neither can an amendment ever be moved.  The Mayor wanted a deliberative vote, but information from the Municipal Assoc. said the only way out was to increase the size of the committees.

Cr Pearce was quite satisfied with the status quo.

The Unemployment Relief Committee has approved the work suggested by the Council.

Mr Bednall advises how to proceed against owners of cars plying for hire without licences.

The auditors say there were no suspicious circumstances about the missing receipt form – their advice had been purely formal.

The Town Clerk thought the by-law on drivers’ licences should be suspended due to the depression and bus-drivers’ licences halved.  So moved by Cr Bevan and carried.

H. Wilson was appointed Overseer.

The telephone is to be removed from the Town Clerk’s residence at the end of the present term.

Each ward to be allotted £200 for the year.

It was resolved after discussion that the Town Clerk’s salary be £274 for all duties, which was down from over £300 altogether last year.  If this was unacceptable he was to be given six months’ notice and applications called for the position.
