Fire.  A fire on Monday, which began in a paddock of Miss E. Bailey’s, burned a narrow strip for one and a half miles in a northeast direction and spread quickly through Clem Bailey’s property and thence to Mr M. de N. Lucas’s where volunteer fire fighters saved a house near Gum Creek School, but a new hay shed full of baled hay was destroyed.
