Regional Council of Goyder

Mt Bryan Progress Assoc. has purchased irrigation materials to the value of $273.65, which Council decided should come from the Parks & Gardens budget.

Council has established a committee to arrange functions to deal with the official opening of the RN3870 Road.

Council has officially named the linear park which runs from the Black Bridge on Ludgvan St to Stock Street in Burra, as the Thomas Pickett Reserve.  This commemorates the discoverer of Burra in the area, which led to the establishment of the Monster Mine and the town of Burra.
