Perlite Project.  The proposal to build a factory to manufacture Perlite in Burra would be a major boost for the town.  It would boost property values and increase the population.  It is expected that initially 30 jobs would be created, rising perhaps to 80 in the longer term.  An environmental assessment is being done, but no problems are expected from that.
