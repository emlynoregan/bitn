Burra Races are in doubt.  Owners and trainers are demanding that the Clubs pay freight on horses travelling to country meetings.  So far the Racing Assoc. has refused.  Nominations for Burra Races on 19 October close today.  SAJC has allowed a deferral of nominations pending the result of a meeting to be held on Thursday.
