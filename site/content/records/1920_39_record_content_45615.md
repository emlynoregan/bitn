Alex Kotz of Bright had his thigh broken when a Jersey bull charged him on his horse on 30 March.  He was unseated in the second charge and only saved from further damage because his dog and horse stood between the bull and him.  He was rescued by his brother Norman and Bert Finch who heard the noise.
