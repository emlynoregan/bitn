Burra Copper Festival planning is under way.  A feature of the weekend will be a production at Redruth Gaol by the Arts Council, the National Trust and Flinders University drama students.  One idea is for country music and bonfires along the creek.  A committee has been formed to organise an arts and draft exhibition.  A bullockiesâ€™ breakfast is being contemplated to start the Gulf Road re-enactment, which will be started by Kym Bonython.  Bullock drays, horses and mule teams will take part in the trek to Pt Wakefield, leaving Burra 13 October and due in Pt Wakefield on 1 November to greet the Jubilee 150 ketch Falie, which is to take the copper ore to Pt Adelaide.  The route passes through Farrell Flat, Mintaro, Leasingham, Auburn, Hoyleton, Halbury, and Balaklava.
