The annual vestry meeting reported the Sunday school had 100 scholars and 11 teachers.  There were 88 communicants.  This year the communicants were down by 8 and the scholars by 3, but since the Rev. Wayland came four years ago the scholars were up by 24 and communicants up by 20, and that in spite of the removal of 50 scholars and 53 communicants.  He estimated adherents at 320-350.

The church debt had been reduced to £168.

A bazaar in preparation will probably realise this amount.  Mr Gebhardt of Mackerode has promised to donate the £50 owed to him and Mr P.L. Killicoat the £25 due to him.  There is also a rumour of another £25 donation.

Income for the year was £380 and expenditure £388 which brought the overdraft to £90 of which £78 was due in 1885.  The stipend of the clergyman was reduced a further £25, having been cut by £50 two years ago.
