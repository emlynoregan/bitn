New Parliamentary Electorate.  The ‘Burra’ Electorate will disappear and be absorbed in ‘Frome’, which becomes the second largest in area and the smallest in population in the redistribution.  Mr Claude Allen, the present member for Burra, will contest Frome if endorsed by the LCL.  [Details of subdivisions and their populations are given.]
