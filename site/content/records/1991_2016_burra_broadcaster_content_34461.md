Burra Cycling Classic Results

In the Rudy Project Burra Classic Cycle Race there were 48 open riders and 14 junior competitors.  The ride took place in fantastic weather, albeit a little windy.  Andrew Roe crossed the line first.  In the junior Kooringa Hotel 37 km scratch race Edward Petney was the winner.  It was in that race that Sean Boyle*, sprinting home in 10th place, was involved in a sickening collision with a car.  He was taken to hospital with a punctured lung, but no breaks.  He is now out of intensive care. [Sunday race results are also printed.]

[* The previous week he was Shaun, but see also Issue 664, page 2 where he writes a letter of appreciation as Sean Boyle and Issue 708, 24 August 2005, page 3, where he is reported as winning the U17 50 km event that year.]
