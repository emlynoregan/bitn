Burra High School Reunion

Brian O’Reilly brought along an interesting relic from the laying of the Burra School foundation stone in 1877.  A relative of Thomas Bath (who laid the stone) has in his possession a beautiful wooden mallet inscribed with the day’s details.  One end can be opened to reveal a very tightly wrapped Burra newspaper with an article describing the event.
