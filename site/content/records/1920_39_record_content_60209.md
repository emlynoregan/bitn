Byles’ Mongolata GM for fortnight to 22 February

Open Cut.  Engaged in breaking ore. About 126 tons of ore already treated with crushing to continue for some time yet.

Main shaft sunk from 227 to 243 ft.  Heavy rains on Tuesday penetrated via the open cut to the mine’s tunnel and brought with the water a deal of rock and debris.  Cleaning up has taken several days.  Little damage was done to the mine workings, but considerable to the change rooms and roadway.
