From the start there was a club and doctor’s fund to which men contributed 1/- a week and boys 6d.  It gave in return medical attention at 14/- a week.  A hospital was built opposite the Mill and Dr Mayne was the first medical man.  A reserve of 3,000 tons of firewood was built up and sawn timber was constantly arriving.  Henry Solly of Leasingham received £10 for delivering a special log for Morphett’s engine house and £14 for two very large stones.
