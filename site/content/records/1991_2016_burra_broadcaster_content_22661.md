Burra Show Hall

When members of the Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club opened the hall at the weekend they discovered that part of the ceiling had fallen down.  Ron Shipard, President of the Show Society inspected the damage and decided the hall was unsafe to use.  The Table Tennis Club will have to find an alternative venue until repairs can be effected.
