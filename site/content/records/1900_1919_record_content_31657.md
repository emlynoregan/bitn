SAR.  A Robertstown delegation has sought to extend the railway district for the new line and to shift the route slightly to that along the three-chain road from near Eudunda to beyond Point Pass at section 166, where it meets the proposed route.  This would save land acquisition.  The site of the Robertstown station would be shifted, as the chosen place is boggy in winter.
