Burra Day Care Centre

State and Federal Governments have allocated $76,063 towards the total cost of $130,000 to renovate the existing Aberdeen Football Clubrooms in Morehead Street, to provide a community based respite service.  The architect for the project is Mr Douglas Alexander of Flightpath Architects and tenders will soon be called.

Ongoing planning will be controlled by a Council Section 199 Committee, the inaugural meeting of which will be held on 21 June.
