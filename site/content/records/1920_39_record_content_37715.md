Frank Treloar: Looking Back

The first three hotels were built in Burra by SAMA and were the Burra, the Pig & Whistle and the Smelters Arms.  Burra Hotel was located on a site designated for a hotel in the early survey.  It was well built with assembly rooms, which made it the leading hotel in the north for many years.  Nearby was the first brewery in Burra.  When SAMA started to sell freehold of sites it allowed the ground on which Lawrence’s and Lynch’s hotels to be purchased. [The present Burra & Commercial hotels.]

With their coming into existence in more central locations the trade of the Burra declined.

[This may be true in part, but the present Burra Hotel in its central location was previously called the Miners Arms and dates from 1847, so it didn’t ‘come into existence in the 1870s, though the Commercial was a new hotel in 1876.]

The original Burra Hotel was then converted into the hospital.  By now however, there have been many changes and little of the original building remains.

The Pig & Whistle was ‘situated near the creek on Mitchell’s Flat in the centre of the area occupied by miners’ cottages and was essentially the miners’ hotel’.

[Interpret this ‘on Mitchell’s Flat’ with care: it was certainly near Mitchell’s Flat, but on the southeast corner of Stock and Thames Streets on allotment 256.]

After the miners left for Wallaroo it had a fitful existence until one evening about 35 years ago it burned down.  [This figure is inaccurate.  The fire was in February 1883 and the business staggered on in a back room that survived for the rest of the year.]  The licence was transferred to the Kooringa Hotel [in 1884.]
