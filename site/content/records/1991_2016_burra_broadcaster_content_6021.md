SA Stud Merino Sheepbreeders Association Gala Night attracted a crowd similar to 1994.  The Kensington-Norwood Brass provided the music and there was an extraordinary magician, a talk by American Danny Neef, IWS representative in New York and a fashion parade.

The Champion Ram came from Dusty McGowan of ‘Deloshanda’ Stud, Kielpa, Eyre Peninsula.
