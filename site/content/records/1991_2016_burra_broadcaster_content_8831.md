When mining began at Burra in 1845 Swansea in Wales was the world’s principal copper smelting centre.

The site at Burra is of world significance as possibly the only example where remains of a pre-1860 Welsh-style smelting works survive.

The site was listed on the State heritage Register in 1984.
