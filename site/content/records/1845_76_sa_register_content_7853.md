Accident/Obituary.  The Burra Mail was involved in a fatal accident at Gawler last Friday.  The mail from Burra did not reach Gawler till 9.30 p.m. on Friday, the roads being so heavy due to the rain.  On turning into the main street, the driver checked the horses to avoid a dangerous hole in the middle of the road and having avoided that, the horses trotted on.  Scarcely 100 yards further on it was found that the pole had snapped off.  The road was on an incline and the driver found it impossible to prevent the coach from running on the horses.  As a result they became unmanageable and the coach tipped over 50 yards from the Post Office.  When lights had been obtained it was found that Patrick Joyce, a farmer from near the Catholic Chapel on the Light, had been killed on the spot.

His body was lying in a confusion of luggage.  Several other passengers were injured, including J.W. Macdonald, the Special Magistrate, returning from holding court in Burra.  He had a deep gash on his forehead and severely injured a knee.

An inquest was held on Saturday at the New Bushman Inn on the body of Patrick Joyce.

His injuries are described as a fractured skull, two broken collarbones, a dislocated right arm, dislocated thigh and four or five broken ribs.  The fractured skull or the broken ribs would have been adequate to have caused death.  The driver was George Beams and the Guard Thomas Simpson.  Simpson gave evidence along the lines of the story above.  Beams corroborated the account.  He said the pole had been broken previously, but had been mended in Kooringa and Fridayâ€™s break had been in another place.  J.W. Macdonald gave evidence and completely exonerated the driver.  The verdict was death by accident and misadventure.  The jury did, however, recommend that Mr Chambers keep one or two spare poles along the road.

[Patrick Joyce died 30 January 1852 aged 50.  His residence was described as near Kapunda.]
