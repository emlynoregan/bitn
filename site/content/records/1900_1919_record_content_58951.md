The Matron is to be advised that the request for her resignation was withdrawn.

The Secretary of the ATNA wrote cancelling the hospitalâ€™s registration as a school for training nurses due to low patient numbers.  Enquiries are to be made re the status of nurses admitted as probationers before the cancellation.

Inspector General of Hospitals is to be advised that Burra Hospital had not reduced its fees as alleged by Dr Ashton, to compete with his new private hospital.

D. Jones tender was accepted to paint the morgue.

It was advisable for all hospital staff to be inoculated for influenza.
