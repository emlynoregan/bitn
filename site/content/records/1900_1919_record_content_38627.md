EXTRAS

Between XXI, 1905 and XXI, 1906 a series of ‘specials’ were printed.  They were apparently issued at about 5 p.m. each day with up-to-date war news.  More were promised between XXI, 1906 and XXI, 1907.  None are preserved with the hard copies or on microfilm and it is not clear how many of these ‘extras’ were printed, but the issue for the first Saturday of the war is specifically referred to.
