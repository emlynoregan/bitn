RSL VDC Parade in Adelaide is reported in Â¾ column.  26 Burra men went by train and some more by car.  The SA Governor, Sir Malcolm Barclay Harvey took the salute with Sir Harry Chauvel, in charge of RSL VDC in Australia.  The report also tells the story of how Arthur Bence came to play a round of golf at Mt Osborne with WA amateur golf champion Bill Hughes, without initially knowing who he was.  [On page 2 this story is corrected to say that Higgins won the Victorian Allcomers Title and the ACT Open.]
