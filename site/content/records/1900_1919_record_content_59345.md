Burra Town Council.

The Overseer reported on the Hampton Roads.  Wellington Rd had not been formed and was very bumpy, but if gutters were cleared out and bumps attended to it would do.  A watertable was needed on the South and East [sic] sides of High Street, but to make a proper road would cost £60 for about three users.

Cr Radford said Hampton produced about £4-10-0 in rates and about £3-10-0 was available for c. 60 chains of road, which would not pay for rubble for one of them.  The road needed doing, but was on a hill and the first rain would wash away most of the work.

The matter was left in the hands of the North Ward Councillors.

The Postal Department said electric lamps could be placed on telephone poles for 3/- per annum.

The Bowling Club delegation waited on the Council.

They asked for 40’ adjoining the Depot in Kooringa, either purchasing it or on a 99-year lease.

An alternative site across the creek was mentioned.  The Mayor said the creek site would be more central.  After discussion the club was offered the 40’ requested at 15/- per foot.  [£30]
