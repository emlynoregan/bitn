Redruth Court, 30 November.

Thomas Kitchen fined 5/- for each offence for twice allowing cows to stray in Kooringa.

Jane Clode fined 2/6 for allowing a cow and calf to stray in Redruth.

Ralph Bartle was charged on 21 November with embezzling £2-4-0 from the Corporation of Burra.

The Town Clerk, John Darby Cave, said that Bartle was then engineer of the Burra Waterworks and on 21 November failed to hand over £2-4-0 paid to him by W.H. Batchelor and did not report the receipt of the same.  He left Burra on Saturday without leave.  There may be, as he claims, £7 due to him in wages, but this does not give him the right to deduct any money he collects because wages are due.

W.H. Batchelor produced the receipt for the money.

Henry Thomas Eaton [Policeman] said when the defendant was arrested at Burra Station on 29 November he said he had not embezzled anything: all the money collected was in a drawer at his house.  He said he believed it to be £2-13-9.  But the money was not there.  He said he had been down to pay it over, but could not as Mr Tiver was talking to the Town Clerk.  Bartle said he was hardly likely to abscond with £2-4-0 when the Council owed him £7.  He did not apply for leave of absence as the matter was very urgent and arose after office hours.

The Bench dismissed the information.  [But see the Town Council report for 5 December in the paper of 6 December 1887.]
