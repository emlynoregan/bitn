Burra Show Society, Sheep Dog Trials & Sheep Show 1, 2 & 3 September

Total entrance money taken was £22 about £17 of it on the Saturday.  The no-competitive sheep show at the same time was not very successful as the important potential exhibitors stayed away, perhaps waiting to see what they would have to meet and waiting for next year.  Mr Melvin Collins was the only exhibitor in the non-competitive class and Mr F.H. Collins the only one in the competitive class.

Novice Stakes: won by T. Turner’s Ross.

Maiden Stakes: won by F. Whittington’s Storm.

Flock Dogs Competition (to work 25 sheep) (run for 1st time): won by A.T. McWater’s Hemp.

Open Class: won by A. Collins’s Garry.

Association Championship: won by F. Whittington’s Posey o’ Buchan
