Burra Show Society, General Committee Meeting 10 December.

The show was a success and there was £198 at present in hand, but there was still a considerable amount to come in for advertising in the catalogue and for members’ tickets and c. £100 to pay on accounts due.  Finance committee to report on what debentures could be paid off.

Letter from the Burra Racing Club protesting about the removal of rails and the loss of a lock from the totalizator building.

Mr Warnes said the Club had always used the Society’s things and vice versa and the Club’s letter should not have been written.  Mr Radford said ‘the tone of the Club’s letter was certainly not nice and calculated to rub the wrong way’, but he also observed that ‘the reply would not be oil on troubled waters’.

The committee approved the President’s action

Leighton Agricultural Bureau offers a £5-5-0 trophy for the best three samples of wheat to be shown in glass jars – samples of 1-2 lbs.  Offer accepted.
