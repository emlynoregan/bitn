BOBfest will now be held in April 2008.  This change of date will enable Goyder Council to reconsider their financial support for the event.   Council involvement would enable Goyder to host an event of this calibre in the region as part of the group project within the next two years.  BOBfest allows young people to network with other music enthusiasts and industry professionals.  They can also hone their skills in event management, risk management, publicity and promotion, financial control and OH & S.
