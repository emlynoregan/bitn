Burra Hospital.  96th Annual Meeting of the Board of Management

The Chairman said the recent $250,000 improvement made the hospital one of the most up-to-date in country SA.  The financial position improved despite salary increases of some $11,000.  Patient fee increases have resulted in a surplus of $29,547.  The long awaited rebuilding has occurred.  In July the new Maternity Wing, Private and Share Wards, Children’s Ward and new kitchen were taken over and a room has been built for Meals-on-Wheels.  The laundry has been moved to the old kitchen.  Grounds and roadway will be improved and a new retaining wall will be erected around the lawn area.  All kitchen crockery and utensils have been renewed and linen and some furniture.  Costs have been met from our own funds.  The coming year will see painting and renovation to the exterior including the secretary’s residence.  Matron’s residence will get a large sitting-dining room and a carport.  The Nurses’ Home has a new oil heater.  In the past year patients have average 20.1 and 40 babies were born at the hospital.  The hospital has land under crop from Tom Rogers and Don Stockman and would welcome further offers of land from ratepayers.  The Hospital Auxiliary continues to provide welcome assistance under Mrs S. Scroop.  The Burra & District Fund-Raising Committee contributed $1,000 for new furnishings.  Last October Matron Fyfe resigned after 13 years to take effect from 7 December 1972.  She was much involved in the detailed planning of the new hospital.  Matron Phillips was appointed, assisted by Sisters R.Z. Brown, R.M. Lucas, R.B. Seaford, E.A. Oates, J.E. Wall and J. McBride.  Sister I.J. Byles left the district after 10 years of valuable service.  Sister Good has carried out her duties as tutor.  The Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer has kept the administration at a very high level.  The Ambulance Service intends to install a radio base at the hospital.
