World’s End School was closed about 12 months ago due to the shortage of teachers.  Since then some parents have been boarding their children at Point Pass, from whence they attended Eudunda Area School.  Some children took correspondence lessons.  From this morning six of them will be coming to Burra each day under the care of Mr A.G. (Tom) Heinrich.  Mr Heinrich is not the permanent contractor for the conveyance of children and Mr W.E.D. Young has the contract.  Area Schools are still in the experimental stage, but are proving most successful and Burra Primary School could be made into one such institution without much alteration.
