Editorial on The Boer War.  This is a very patriotic piece, lauding the ‘fairness which has characterised all [England’s] proceedings in the war’ whereas ‘Treachery, villainy and corruption have predominated on every conceivable point by the Boers, and this, of course, has made the war more terrible’.
