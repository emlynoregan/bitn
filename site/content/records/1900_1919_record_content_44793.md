Local Board of Health.

The Adelaide Hospital reports admitting Elsie Rosenthal and Tommy Halls.

[Later made clear they were the two meningitis cases mentioned in the previous paper.]

Letter of condolence sent to the parents of Pte Jones who died from meningitis.

[The report here suggests that the arrangements for the transfer of the two patients to Adelaide were botched at the Adelaide end, but only permits inferences on what happened – the ambulance seems to have failed to meet the train.  See later for more details.]

In the last fortnight there have been three cases of typhoid and three of meningitis.

The typhoid has been attributed to unhygienic milking conditions in Burra.

The Mayor outlined the events of the Sunday outbreak of meningitis.  Dr Ramsay-Smith in Adelaide had recommended the transfer of the patients to Adelaide, but insisted that travel arrangements etc. had to be handled by the Local Board of Health.  After much difficulty the Mayor had got the Medical Superintendent of the Adelaide Hospital to arrange for the police ambulance to meet the train.  He then had to pay the fare of the nurse and patients to Adelaide.  A carriage had been reserved and the patients admitted to Adelaide Hospital.

Cr Killicoat said Pte Jones case was sad; he had been placed in the isolation ward, ‘a shed not fit for a dog to live in’.

Cr McBride said he had not been there, but in a room at the rear of the hospital.

Of the cases sent to Adelaide he said the nurse and her patients were left in the carriage at the Adelaide Railway Station for two hours without a soul coming to help.  Finally a nurse arrived with an ambulance and the two nurses had to get the patients into the ambulance as best they could.  He thought a complaint to the Central Board was only fitting.
