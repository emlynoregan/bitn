The Locust Menace.  Mr I.J. Warnes convened a meeting at the Liberal Union Rooms on Friday that was well attended.  He cited other occasions when his efforts had first been derided as futile (rabbits and the telephone line), but he had ultimately been vindicated.  He did not think they could kill them all, but they could make a difference.  At present they stretched from Wilcannia to the West Coast.  He outlined the life cycle of the hopper.
