The Sale of the Institute.  Another bit of the red tape associated with the sale has been unravelled.  The Minister of Education has consented to the transfer.  The Council solicitor will now have a Memorandum of Transfer and other necessary papers drawn up and it is expected the transfer will probably be in force from 1 July.
