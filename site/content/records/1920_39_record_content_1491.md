Motor Ambulance Meeting was held last Tuesday.  The present ambulance was a gift long ago of Mr J.M. McBride and is worn out and almost useless.  A lorry is currently used and is unsuitable.  An ambulance is available for £223 and possibly for £200.  Dr Steele said a new ambulance would cost at least £400, so this was a good offer.  Mr Dane moved that those present guarantee the amount required and this was passed unanimously.  A collection will be organised.
