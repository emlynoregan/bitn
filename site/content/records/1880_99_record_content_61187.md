The Mayor’s Report.

The year began in debt £40-0-8 and is presently in credit £42-2-8, which compares with a credit of £4-12-1 at the same time last year.  Most of the credit balance will go by the end of the year, but the Ward accounts are in credit.

The rates received were £403-5-11, about £32 down on last year.  The Government subsidy was £113-0-4.  Public works used £169-0-8. (Lower than last year because of beginning in debit.)

We have also paid £220 for the redemption of a bond and interest.  In 1897 the last of these bonds for £200 with interest of £10 will fall due.

The first bonded debt was incurred in 1879 and amounted to £400.  Other sums were borrowed in 1882, when the total indebtedness stood for some time at £2,700.  In 1885 a further £500 was borrowed.  These amounts have been paid off in instalments of between £100 and £300 p.a. and no less than £699 has been paid in interest. And by next year this will be £709, irrespective of interest paid on overdrafts.

I do not presume to criticise those who incurred these liabilities in the past and who expended the money on the roads, footpaths, bridges and other works we have used, but it will be a great relief to be free of the encumbrance of debt.

With some revision the assessment for 1897 is that of 1896, but the total rateable value of the town, at £8,659-9-0 is £116-10-0 down on the value of the previous year.

[The figures of income and expenditure are then printed in some detail.]

The Waterworks.

These have been carried on satisfactorily through the year and at a lower cost than in recent years: £628 to 2 November compared with £704 to the same time in 1895 and £800 in 1894.  Receipts from rates have fallen off seriously by no less than £84, but this has been offset by the significant sales of water to SAR in the last summer.  Mr Lapidge has maintained the works in good order.  His task has increased by the enlargement of the reservoir and the wilful waste of water by some consumers.

Main Roads.

The Government grant of £242 was an increase of £25 and all but £3-12-4 has been expended.

Local Board of Health.

The sanitary state of the town has been fairly satisfactory.  A few cases of typhoid occurred early in the year.  Drought led to stagnation of water in the creek and attendant foul odours.  The draining of a number of the stagnant waterholes has very much improved its condition.  The account began in debit £12-17-0 and is presently in credit £17-13-2.

The Parklands have received relatively little work this year, although some dead trees have been replaced and the oval has been improved.  This account began the year in debit £81-19-10 and is now in debit £39-1-6.

The cemetery has a credit balance of £31-4-6, which is gradually dwindling year by year.

After the Mayor had read his report Alexander Harris wanted to know if there had been any difficulty in procuring wood for the Waterworks.

Council had just agreed to take 25 tons at 13/- a ton.

Mr Harris wanted to know why the price had risen from 10/- to 13/- a ton.

The Mayor said that the cost of feed for horses had considerably increased and in Adelaide carters’ prices had risen 6d a day.

Mr Harris started to make a statement, but was constrained by the chair to asking questions only.

When he tried to suggest that the price was unfair the chairman suggested that perhaps the unfairness lay elsewhere.
