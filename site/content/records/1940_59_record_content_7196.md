Cpl A.M. Tippett

A letter to Mrs G.S. Hawker says he had a good time in Greece, although at time ‘things were a bit warm’.  It was beautiful, with snow-capped mountains, but the agriculture was primitive, with wooden ploughs pulled by bullocks.  He managed to spend a few days in Athens doing all the usual tourist things before going north to the front.  The later evacuation from Greece had some warm moments, but he made it to the coast and a ship where he got a cabin, but not for long, as the ship was sunk.  He escaped without getting his feet wet, but with only the clothes he was wearing.  At the time of writing he was back in Palestine in a good camp with hot and cold showers, a picture theatre and wet and dry canteens.  The days were hot, but the nights required two blankets.
