Burra Hospital.  We have had left at our office drawings showing the proposed alterations and additions to the Burra Hospital.  We understand the contract was signed on Wednesday 5 July 1876, with work to be completed in six months.  The architect is William Beattie of Port Adelaide and the contractors are Messrs G. & W. Sara.  When completed it should be a great improvement on the present building.

[This refers to proposed additions to Bleak House, the old Mine Hospital.  This work did not eventuate: see later references to the Burra Hospital.]
