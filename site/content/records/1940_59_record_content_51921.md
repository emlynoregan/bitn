Burra Town Council, 3 September

The Bank of Australasia advised of its merger with the Union Bank of Australia from 1 October 1951, to form the Australian and New Zealand Bank Ltd.  (ANZ)

The Town Clerk was authorised to attend to such documents as would allow the transfer of Council accounts, funds etc. to the ANZ Bank.

A General Rate of 4/- in the £ was declared, plus special rates: Hospital 5½d, Street Lights 4d and Fire Brigade 2½d.

A motion was carried to accept Mr Villis’s offer of a rubbish dump site at the Burra Mine.

The dump at the rear of Memorial Oval will be closed.

Advice is to be sought from the Highways & Local Government Department about the possibility of the town being by-passed by the new sealed road.

Badminton.  In the Final the RSL 9-16 8 defeated an un-named team 3-105.
