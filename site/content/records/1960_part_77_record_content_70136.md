Burra Primary School Council.  Report for 1973 from Ian Allen, Chairman.

Thanks to Mrs Avis Webster and the other women who have made the school canteen such a success.  The Education Symposium on 10 August 1973 was a success, but the Council was disappointed that so few local parents attended; instead attendants came from the surrounding districts and from as far away as Clare and Saddleworth.  Joint finance meetings with the High School have been useful in sharing costs of purchases.  Departmental Heads from Adelaide and representatives of the Primary and High School Councils met on 30 November 1973 concerning the new school and the plans, estimates etc. are now in the hands of the Public Works Standing Committee.  We hope tenders will soon be called.
