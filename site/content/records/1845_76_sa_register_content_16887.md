Kooringa News, 22 October

The weather lately has been delightful, but yesterday afternoon there was a severe dust storm and through the night there was lightning and some heavy drops of rain.  This morning there is a strong wind from the north with much dust.

The Bon Accord Mine is ‘knocked up’.  [Closed down in Cornish mining terminology.]

I have seen some fine specimens from the Adelaide Mine, mixed with gossan and containing 52½% copper.  Should sufficient quantity of high grade ore be found there is no doubt it would prove a profitable speculation to the adventurers.  [Gossan: a ferruginous secondary deposit.]

A horse being put into harness in the new spring van of Messrs Drew & Co. bolted on Tuesday morning.  It sped down the hill, across the street and over into the creek where the bank is over twelve feet high.  Luckily little damage was done beyond a bent axle and some spoiling of the ginger-bread work on top.
