Botanists Ann Prescott & Millie Nicholls led a group enthusiasts around the Mine Hill on the evening of 10 November in drizzling rain and low temperatures to see a wonderland of plants.  Twenty-five species were gathered in a short time.  Ann estimates c. 50 perennial species are in the area.  The hill is one of the few places in the Mid North where there are native grasses in such profusion and in such good condition.  Native grasslands covered much of the Mid North area from Crystal Brook to Clare, but most have been cultivated or grazed.
