Recycling.  Redline Waste Management has offered to collect paper waste from Burra and the Council has seized the opportunity.  Redline will provide the containers and collect them from a central point in Burra.  Various business sites will use woolpacks to collect their waste and Redline is looking for a club or organisation to help with paper drives to collect household paper.
