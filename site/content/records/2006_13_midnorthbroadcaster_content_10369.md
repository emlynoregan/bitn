Steve Royal writes in response to the public meeting arranged by the Regional Council of Goyder for 5 July.

In the near future there will be many perceived benefits presented to the residents of Burra and the Mid-North.  Please remember on thing.  Phoenix Copper Ltd exists for the benefit of Phoenix Copper Ltd.  It does not exist to benefit Burra, its heritage, residents, its water catchment, groundwater, the State of SA or the environment.

I urge anybody who is concerned about the Phoenix Copper proposal, which may lead to exploration (and subsequent mining) in a Heritage area and in the middle of a town, to come to this meeting.

It is essential to the future of Burra that Phoenix is not allowed to get their wish to remove the Reserve protection on the Monster Mine, and that exploration/mining in the Burra State Heritage area is also not allowed.
