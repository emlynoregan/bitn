Obituary.  Charles Morgan who died on 29 January was born at Kooringa 8 February 1865.  His parents’ home was where Mrs Lott’s house now stands.  He was the only son of the late Henry and Ann Morgan of Kooringa and he was educated at St Joseph’s Convent and then Mr White’s School.  The convent was then in the building now used by the Burra District Band for practices.  After leaving school he assisted his father, who was a baker in the bakery at the rear of the property known as the Hon. John Lewis’s.  His father later opened a bakery in Aberdeen where Charles later took over the business.  Later still he started a business in the premises known as Uhlmann’s [Ullmann’s] at the corner of Bridge and Kingston Streets, where he remained for 17 years.  He left Kooringa in 1919, but after about 12 months returned for a further two years before retiring.  In December 1903 he married Jane Wilton, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs J.J. Wilton of Thebarton who survives.  About eight years ago he had a serious illness from which he did not fully recover.  He has two sons in the Postal Department: Edward at Kooringa and George at Kalangadoo.  His only daughter Elizabeth lives with her mother.  There are two granddaughters, Beth and Helen.  Mrs E. Hobby of Kooringa is the sole survivor of Henry Morgan’s family.
