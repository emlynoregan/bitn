Burra Defence Rifle Club & Burra Cricket Clubâ€™s picnic and sports went off on Wednesday, but for some reason the attendance was not large and the takings were therefore disappointing.  The shops and public school closed for the occasion and the Burra Band played during the day.  The results are printed.
