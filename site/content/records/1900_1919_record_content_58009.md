Burra Hospital Board

The hospital has been approved for soldiers when there is insufficient room elsewhere.

The Inspector-General of Hospitals asked what arrangements could be made for an outbreak of influenza.  A reply was sent stating the accommodation and saying when necessary tents were erected for infectious cases.  The usual Â£3 was allowed for Christmas cheer.
