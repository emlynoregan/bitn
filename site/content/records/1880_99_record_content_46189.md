Burra Co. MI.  On 30 July [Sic: this must be an error since the paper is dated 27 July!] the Burra Mounted Rifles visited Gawler for a rifle match.  The trip included a visit to the engineering works of James Martin & Co. which employed about 450 men.  The range was flat and the conditions windy.  Burra lost to Gawler Co. Mounted Rifles by 147 points and the men were then given a splendid lunch before returning to Burra.
