The Waikerie Band visited Burra on 28 April and gave great support to the local band at the Anzac Sports and in the preceding procession.  A dance after the sports at the Oddfellows Hall had music supplied by the Waikerie Dance Orchestra derived from the band.  The crowd was much too large for comfortable dancing.  On Sunday there was a practice session at 10 a.m. when Mr W. Symonds the Pt Adelaide Bandmaster conducted the two bands.  In the evening the bands performed at the Market Square rotunda.  The difference that Waikerie’s superior instruments makes was heard when some of the local boys were loaned Waikerie instruments for some items.  The mass of nearly 50 bandsmen for the procession was an exciting event.  Supper followed the Sunday evening performance.  On Monday morning several carloads of locals accompanied the Waikerie men to Mongolata which was visited before they left for home in the afternoon.  [The details of the visit extend for ⅔ column.]
