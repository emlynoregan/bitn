The Tarcowie Hotel closed on Australia Day after 130 years of service.  The proprietors Bob & Leah Tonks decided not to sell up and instead will retire there and make the hotel their home.  They have been in the hotel for almost ten years.  Rising costs and falling population combined with public risk insurance to force the closure.
