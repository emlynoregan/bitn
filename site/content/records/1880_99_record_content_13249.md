Editorial on The Recreation Ground.  About two years ago the Town Council obtained the promise of 7 acres of land from SAMA for use as a recreation ground.  The terms were that the Council enclose the land and plant the ground within two years and on completion the ground would be conveyed to the Council.  Ratepayers approved a loan of £500 and a further £200 more has been spent on levelling, tree planting etc.  Several hundred trees are now doing well and the central oval has been planted.  The trust deed is now being prepared.  The question is whether it must always be open to any member of the public free and on this depends the provision of further facilities such as a pavilion etc.  If no income can be derived the Council would not be at all justified in expending more money on it than is needed to maintain the oval etc.  Council has long decided that any clubs could use the ground for half the gate.

We have been amused at the way in which some persons ask for more exclusive rights and yet decline to assist the Council.  They use the public ground for practice and yet go to the other side of Aberdeen whenever money is to be taken.  It is not reasonable to expect the Council to hand over the ground to two clubs for their use alone on all holidays and occasions when the public might desire to use it.  This would be unjust to other clubs and users.  These two clubs are not prepared to contribute towards past expenses or to guarantee anything of the cost of the pavilion.
