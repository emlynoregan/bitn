Burra Burra Mines

The AGM of the scrip holders of the SA Mining Association was held at the Auction Mart Tavern on Wednesday evening last.  Charles Beck was called to the chair.  The Directors’ and Auditors’ reports are found in our advertising columns.  They are highly satisfactory documents and were unanimously adopted by the meeting.  An alteration to the Association’s rules was approved that one director should reside at the mines and should be amenable to the direction of the others.

W. Allen	1276

John Waterhouse	1167

The first five were elected.
