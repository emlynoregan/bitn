Kooringa News, 14 March

The election is creating great interest.  On Saturday Mr Dale addressed electors on behalf of himself and Messrs Lennon and Cole, also candidates.  On Monday evening Mr G.S. Kingston, one of the late representatives, came forward and explained his political opinions.  He was unfavourably received and the motion proposing him as a fit and proper person was negatived by a large majority.

Yesterday the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF celebrated its anniversary with a procession and dinner.  They listened to an address from the minister at the Bible Christian Chapel in the afternoon and had an excellent dinner in the evening at the Burra Hotel.  Mr Macdonald SM presided.  [The toasts are listed.]
