Kooringa Dinner for G.S. Kingston

Friends of Mr Kingston gave him a dinner at the Burra Hotel last Thursday to celebrate his election to the Legislative Council.  Mr Mason of the hotel was instructed to spare no cost and accordingly prepared a feast including every available luxury.

A group of 50-60 gentlemen assembled at 6 p.m., including three Directors of the SA Mining Association as well as its Secretary and Dr Chambers, who occupied the chair.  The main guests were G.S. Kingston Esq. MLC, Montague Featherstonhaugh Esq., Captain Henry Roach, J. Waterhouse Esq., Henry Ayers Esq. and T.W. Powell Esq.  Mr Gollin was Vice-Chair at one table and Mr McWilliam at the other.  After the meal speeches and toasts were interspersed with musical items.

The Chairman began with toasts to the Queen, Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family and then the SA Governor.  James Chambers followed with a song.

The Chairman then proposed G.S. Kingston.  He described Mr Kingston’s win as the triumph of principles over prejudice and animosity.  The campaign had been one of the grossest abuse and scurrility.  It had been a campaign fought on personality and personal vindictiveness.

Mr Kingston responded.  Having thanked them all profusely he said that by the next time they met he hoped the Lieutenancy would be removed from their Governor’s title.  SA had no need for the supervision of Sydney, its ruler or its Council.  Mr Godfrey then followed with a song.

Mr McWilliams proposed the Chairmen of SAMA, to which Mr Featherstonhaugh responded, during which he said:

‘I believe the Directors of the South Australian Mining Association have always conducted the affairs of the Company in a spirit of openness and liberality; and in every undertaking have always consulted the interests of the officers and men in their employ.’

Having recently returned from travels in other Australian colonies he could say that he had seen nothing to compare with the South Australian spirit or the monster mine.

Mr Ayers then sang Have You Heard of the Monster Mine?

Mr T.W. Powell then proposed Mr Henry Ayers, describing him as the keystone in an arch of which the inhabitants of Burra were one buttress and the SAMA Directors were the other.

Captain Matthew Bryant then sang the Ivy Green.

Mr Henry Ayers returned thanks for the previous toast.  Their presence at Kooringa tonight gave proof of the success of the mining interest and of the trading community of the Burra.

‘The late floods have operated in some measure to retard operations, but the mine looks as promising as ever, and very shortly a large number of men will be employed with every prospect of a busy and prosperous summer.’

A song by Mr Barnett was followed by Mr Gollin’s toast to agricultural interests.

Mr Pearce sang The Vital Spark, after which Mr Kingston proposed the Town and Trade of Kooringa and Mr Godfrey proposed the health of the Captains and operative Miners of SA and especially Captain Roach:

‘The Burra Mine would not have been what it is had it not been for the well-known practical skill and knowledge of its Superintendent.
