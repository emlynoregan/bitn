Curlew has crushed 36 tons for 73oz 10dwts 10gr, with tailings to come.  This is crystalline gold and 7/- per oz dearer than ordinary gold.  Mr T.H. Villis of Curlew also has a magnificent lot of specimens taken from another promising outcrop.  Since the erection of the battery we believe Curlew has produced 700-800oz.
