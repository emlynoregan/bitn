The special train notice showed that the train was running nearly two hours late.  The accident occurred in fog which limited visibility to c. 100 yards.

[The noise of the tricycle would have drowned the noise of the approaching train as stated in the 2nd leader which also said these vehicles should have rubber tyres.]  The inquest was adjourned to 2 July.
