Burra Creek is losing some 18% of its water between the two bores which feed the creek.  Due to pumping costs Council has decided to close down No. 1 bore opposite Peacock’s Chimney for the rest of this financial year.  In this time the creek will be cleaned and leakage areas identified and plugged.
