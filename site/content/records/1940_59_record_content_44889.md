Rabbits.  The British Governmentâ€™s contract to buy Australian rabbits ran out on 31 December and was not renewed.  British companies are gradually getting their way through red tape for licenses to import, but the price they offered was so low that Australian exporters closed down.  Local buyers, Messrs Cummins and Franklin (Burra Cold Stores), have arranged for an Adelaide firm supplying state needs to purchase Burra rabbits, so local trappers can continue to sell them.
