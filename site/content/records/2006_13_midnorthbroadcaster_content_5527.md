AGL Hallett Stage 1Wind Farm was opened last week by Sa Premier Mr Mike Rann on a quick visit to the Mid North.  Another wind farm is under construction by AGL with two more under investment consideration.  The Premier said that in 2002 there were no wind farms in SA and today SA has more than half the nation’s installed capacity – at about 53% of Australia’s total.  There are presently seven operating wind farms in SA and another four planned or under construction.  The Premier also turned the first sod at Suzlon Energy Australia’s regional service and maintenance centre at Jamestown.  Suzlon Energy is the major supplier of wind turbines to AGL.
