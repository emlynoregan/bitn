Obituary.  Eli Goodridge was born at Hinton Martell in Dorset in 1828 as the eldest son of James Goodridge.  He was qualified as a teacher, but his health forced him to come to Australia by the Sir John Lawrence in 1863.  He was employed by Hon. W.W. Duffield who had a mill at Gawler, but moved to the station of Duffield and Porter: ‘Koonoona’.  After three years he moved to G.A. Gebhardt’s ‘Mt Cone’ and later took up butchering at Redruth.  In 1873 he started farming for himself at Ironmine and c. 1878 he moved to Gum Creek.  He was associated with the Ironmine Methodist Church and was a District Councillor for several years.  In 1849 he married Maria Maidment, daughter of Isaac Maidment of Monckton in Dorset.  Two of three sons survive: T.P. Goodridge of Gum Creek and I.J. Goodridge of Booborowie.  There are 14 grandchildren and 23 great grandchildren.
