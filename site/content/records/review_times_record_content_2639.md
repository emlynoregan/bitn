Burra National Trust will again operate the passport system for the October long weekend.  Members will be on hand at the sites and the Trust will also display three of the town’s old fire engines at the Burra show on 12 October.  They were last displayed at the 1983 Copper Festival.  At the Burra Yacht Club Regatta the National Trust will provide billy tea and damper.  The Trust is running a bus tour on 3 November to the Gladstone Gaol, Orroroo’s Yesteryear Gallery and to Terowie.
