Mr & Mrs M.G. Dobson were given a public farewell at Burra Town Hall on Wednesday evening.  After residing in Burra for a considerable time the Dobsons have been transferred to Brunswick, Melbourne.

[Mr Dobson came to Burra in July 1944.]

The Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston said it was a long time since a gathering of this nature had taken place in Burra, because they were restricted to those who during their time in Burra had interested themselves in numerous phases of the town’s social, civic or sporting activities and who have worked for the betterment and enjoyment of the community as a whole.  If anyone fits that description it is Mr Dobson.  He spent some months here in 1922 and then returned with his wife in 1927, when they stayed for seven years.  They returned 4½ years ago to manage the Bank of Australasia, to the delight of all who had known them previously.

Mr Dobson has thrown himself into any movement organised for Burra’s benefit.  He has been a player of merit in both cricket and tennis clubs and as a League Footballer in his day, he has been  more than willing to pass on advice about the finer points of the game to the younger generation.  He has been a staunch helper in church affairs, a keen member of the centenary Committee, a member of the Institute Library Committee and in the war was willing to help any patriotic effort seeking assistance.  His particular ‘baby’ was the Burra RSL Sub-Branch.  In business he was kindly and helpful.

Mrs Lindsay Thomas gave a piano solo.

Mr H.J.B. Jennison spoke on behalf of the town’s sporting bodies.

Mr A.L. Bence spoke for the business people/

Rev. R.S.T. Pettet spoke on behalf of the churches.

Mr R.K. Crewes spoke for the RSL.

Mr W. Carpenter spoke for the Burra Football Club, Mr M.T. Fuller for ‘the man in the street’, Mr E. Weich for the town’s police officers and Mr L. Hawke, Mr R.C. Lott and Mr K. Paltridge on behalf of the staff.

His Worship then made a presentation of a wallet of over £50, given spontaneously from all sections of the community.
