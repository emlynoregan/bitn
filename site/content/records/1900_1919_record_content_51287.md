History of the Burra Burra Mine, by James Thomas Snr, No. 6.

The heavy rain took some time to send the floodwaters as far as Burra.  They arrived in the early morning and the evacuation of property began.  As it was summer it was not cold, but the piles of furniture etc. by the flour barrel chimneys were pitiable enough.  The men went to arrange shelter and every available building was soon occupied – churches, schoolrooms, engine houses and sheds of all sorts.  Nearly all of the huts caved in.

Soon after news of the Victorian gold discoveries arrived.  People sold everything they could to finance a trip to the gold fields.  Many went by ship, but some walked.  Within a month virtually every able-bodied man had gone.  They aimed to get enough to return, but when they got £200 or £300 most could not resist a rest, which generally meant a spree.  A few did manage to retire, but most returned after four months or so and returned with money to squander.  Some repeated the journey and the folly several times.  But by the second or third time their ground had been taken by others and the alluvial gold was mostly gone and capital was needed for mining the reefs.  All in all a few did well and saved their money, many did well and spent it and a few did not return.
