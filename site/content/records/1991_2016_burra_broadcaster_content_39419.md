Pig & Whistle Site.  The site of one of Burraâ€™s earliest hotels, the Pig & whistle, on the corner of Thames and George Streets, is part of a block being prepared for low income housing by Unity Housing Company.  Progress was halted pending investigation by a team from Austral Archaeology to document the site.  The hotel has no known photographic record or sketches.  The team found layers of stonework, ash residue and a cobblestone floor of what is believed to be the hotel stable.  Broken glass, bottles and lead bottle tops were recovered.

It is believed the hotel catered for miners who occupied surrounding cottages and that the front faced west onto Lower Thames Street.  It opened in 1854, had eleven rooms in 1874, from Council records and an assembly room was added in 1876.  The building was destroyed by fire in March 1883 and it was alleged the fire was caused by an arson attack.  [Photo.]
