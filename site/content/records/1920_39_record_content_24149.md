Burra Town Council, 5 September

Local Government Dept forwards a further £200 for main roads.

The Mayor & Cr Harris are to arrange a button day for the Limbless Soldiers’ Association.

The Electric Supply Co. advises that a light near the hospital would cost £4-17-6 to install.  Installation was approved.

Mr Oborn offered 60 sheoaks and a dozen other young trees to replace those killed by frost along the creek and offered to look after the same.  The offer was accepted and he was voted £2-2-0 in appreciation.

Cr Riggs moved a change to the way money from rates is allotted to Wards: 5/14 to East and North Wards and 4/14 to West Ward.  At present after deducting common expenses 75% of the rest of the rates is divided in proportion to the rates collected in each ward.  The main problem was that in North Ward there are several roads that are practically main roads, but are not so designated and have to be maintained by the ward.  The proposal would move about £41 from East Ward and £19 from West Ward.

The Mayor was sympathetic, but thought it needed further consideration.

Cr Bednall wanted ratepayer input.

Cr Kellaway was opposed – it should go to ratepayers.  The cemetery road in East Ward was like the North Ward roads: used by the public generally.

Cr Harris said North Ward had had an opportunity to take in the new houses at Graham, but only a few voted to do so.  Kooringa feeling was against the move.

Cr Allen was also opposed.

Cr Riggs said if North Ward had taken in Graham it would only have meant more roads to keep in order.  The motion was lost.

It was resolved that no vehicle be allowed on any metal road with tyres on which were any metal bar, spoke or stud grips, without permission from the Mayor or Town Clerk.

The agreement between the Council and Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd had never been ratified.  It was carried that this be done.

The owner of the car on the footpath previously reported agreed to pay a £2 fine and the matter will not proceed to court.

Kooringa Tennis Club AGM 7 September elected: President, P.J. Pickering; Patron, John Barker; Secretary, M.G. Dobson.  An ‘A’ Grade team is to be entered in the Association.
