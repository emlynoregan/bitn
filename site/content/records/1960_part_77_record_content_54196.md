The New Burra Police Station/Court House is expected to be completed by June 1971.  The old station and residence in Chapel Street is currently being demolished and should be cleared by Thursday.  The SA Housing Trust will erect the new building.  The old residence had not been occupied since the transfer of Constable Muldoon to Frances earlier this year.
