Obituary.  Mrs Mary Ann Lord died at Cross Road, Kingswood on 23 April.  She was born in Burra in 1863, the eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs Samuel Baker.  In 1885 she married Mr John Vivian Lord who died in 1935.  He was a pioneer pastoralist of the Barrier District and acquired his original 10,000 acre lad lease over 50 years ago and later acquired ‘Silverdale’ and ‘Wandavale’ and in 1923 bought ‘Thackaringa’.  In 1904 he acquired ‘Pine Valley’ and in 1909 ‘Oakvale’.  They left the Broken Hill district in 1912 and bought Sandergrove Estate near Strathalbyn and lived there till it was sold in 1924.  In 1923 J.V. Lord formed a partnership with his sons – eventually six of them joining the partnership.  The firm acquired Kalkaroo Station near Mingary in 1926.  Six sons and two daughters survive: Harold V. Lord (Pine Valley), Hurtle Lord (formerly of Balcanoona), Percy Lord (Thackaringa), Sylvester Lord (Pinnacles), T.L. Lord (Oakvale), Eric Lord (Kalkaroo) and Miss Alice & Miss Mabel Lord (Eureka Station).  [Born Mary Ann Baker 19 December 1863 Welsh Mound, Redruth (Burra).]
