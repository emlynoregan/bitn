Mr M.A. Radford writes from ‘Canegrass’ countering statements that severe frosts were in any way unusual out east.  Recent frosts he believed equalled a visitation about 1927 when the lowest reading was 22°F [-5.5°C] in the air and 16°F [-8.8°C] on the grass.  At times 32 consecutive frosts have been recorded.  What was rare on 24 & 25 June this year was the extra cold combined with fog which then froze on the trees.

Air temperatures at Canegrass in late June were:

Date:		24	25	26	27	28	29

Temperature °F	28	28	31	23	22	25

°C	-7.2	-7.2	-0.5	-5.0	-5.5	-3.8

On 28 June the grass temperature was 16°F (-8.8°C).  On two of the nights water in the dams froze over and numerous pipes burst.
