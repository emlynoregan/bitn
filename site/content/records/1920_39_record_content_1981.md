Farrell’s Flat has protested the match they lost to Aberdeen on 21 August because Byles and Williams of Aberdeen had played with another associated club contrary to rule 27.  The Byles accusation was withdrawn (he being confused with his brother).  The discussion went on for two hours without resolution.  After the meeting it was found that a definition under clause 6 nullified the whole complaint and Farrell’s Flat’s appeal should therefore fail.  (Williams was asked for an affidavit and has refused to give one.)
