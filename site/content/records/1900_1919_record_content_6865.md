Reminiscences of the District Synod.  By J.B.  [This, I presume, stands for Rev. J. Blacket.]

He recounts early Burra history and says he left Angaston on top of Hill & Co.’s coach and drove on good roads to Nuriootpa, changed horses at Greenock and then went on to Roseworthy via Freeling.  The northern express then took him to Burra.  At the station he got a cab with various others and set off.  They went to the Reformatory and then on to the Methodist parsonage.  He was supposed to get off at a friend’s place in Redruth, but ended up staying the night with T.W. Wilkinson.  In the morning he climbed the hill for a view of the town.

‘The wisdom of those who encouraged tree planting on so large a scale is to be commeded. [sic]  What a desolate looking place the town would be without its trees!’

He was then eventually transferred to his host, Mr R. Reed of Redruth.

One morning before synod work started he went over the old mine.

‘What a busy scene Burra must have presented!  Where all is now death (with the exception of a few men delving in the soil.)’

‘By the way, a few lamps along the street in which the Institute stands would be of service.  The darkness in places was such that a careful “lookout” had to be kept to avoid collision with other pedestrians.’
