Football.  At Hallett oval 23 July

Mt Bryan	2.1	3.5	3.8	4.12	(36)

Hallett		2.1	3.1	3.5	3.5	(23)

The Hallett correspondent says Hallett has decided to withdraw from the Association as its prominent players are going shearing and the team has become uncompetitive.

[It would seem this was not an Association match in view of Mt Bryanâ€™s withdrawal from the Association and the report that Stan Kellaway was the umpire.  See also the next football item.]
