Obituary.  Elijah Thomas Prior, who died at his residence in Chapel Street on 13 August, was born at Firewood Creek [Nelson] near Burra 4 April 1861, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs James Prior, late of Mt Bryan East.  He was educated at Mr West’s School in Burra.  When he was still a lad his parents moved to Mt Bryan East where they carried on Farming for a number of years.  The farm is now called ‘Glen View’.  He married Elizabeth, a daughter of Mr & Mrs Owens, old Burra pioneers.  He always took a keen interest in local affairs and was fond of sports, especially football, cricket and tennis.  He was a valued member of the Mt Bryan Cricket Club in his younger days.  The team would drive down to Burra in buggies and they gave Burra a good hiding in March 1902.  He was never absent from a football match and in his memory the Kooringa Club wore black armbands last Saturday.  He was equally keen on tennis and was at the Kooringa courts every Saturday through the season.  Bowls also interested him.  For a number of years he and his wife lived at Copperhouse, before moving into Burra.  He was fond of music and a member of the choir at Mt Bryan East.  Wherever he lived he took an active interest in the Methodist Church and Sunday school.  He was a regular church attendant until ill health kept him at home.  Prior to that he attended morning and evening services.  He is survived by a family of four sons and four daughters: Mrs J. Coon (Stony Gap), Arthur Prior (Burra), Mrs R. Honan (Kooringa), Charles Prior (Belalie North), Thomas Prior (Booborowie), Mrs W. Coon (Adelaide), Gilbert Prior (Burra) and Miss Elsie Prior (Kooringa).  There are 13 grandchildren.  Mrs John Honan and Mr Elisha Prior of Hallett are his only surviving sister and brother.  The late Mrs William Collins of Mallett Station was a sister.
