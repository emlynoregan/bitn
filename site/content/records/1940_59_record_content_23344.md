Burra Town Council

The Government has asked the Council its opinion concerning betting shops.  The mayor said he did not think it would be right for the Council to make this decision and it was rather a matter for the ratepayers.  He did however, agree with the Mid North Local Government Association that if Councils were going to have to be responsible for betting shops, then they should also have the profits from such shops.  When they existed in Burra Cr Harvey said the Government was reaping about £50 a week in taxes and Cr Kellaway said that sum should go to the town if the shops were to return.

Cr Jennison said that he thought the Centenary Committee was having some difficulty in getting sufficient light to brighten the town for the celebrations.

It was resolved to ask the Electricity Co. to install three 500 C.P. lights at Burra and Burra North and that the Town Hall be lit up with the strings of lights the Council has on hand.

The Burra RSL Appeal has reached £2,108-14-0.  [Donors are listed.]
