BCS Copper Toxicity

Since the last report two hoggets and a ewe (all merinos) have died from copper toxicity and it is suspected in another death.  Normal copper levels in soil vary from 0.2 to1.5 parts per million.  The Hocky Paddock reading was 88 ppm and in small paddocks on the flat up to 292 ppm.  The readings from pasture plants were also high:

From 17 to 58 ppm and also high in iron (90 to 705 ppm) though excess iron does not cause the problems associated with copper.

A possible solution is to apply superphosphate containing molybdenum.  This element when present in small amounts can lock up the copper so it is not then present in plants eaten by sheep.  This will be followed up next year.
