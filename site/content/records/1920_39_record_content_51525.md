H.H. Byles writes re who found the gold at Mongolata.  He says he was in no way responsible for the statements in the Smith’s Weekly article.  We all know, he says, that the late Ted Bywaters found small quantities of gold at Mongolata.  It is also known that gold was found there 40 years ago by the late Ben Williams and the late W. Moore.  What H.H. Byles can claim is that he found the reef and the payable gold that put Mongolata on the map as a goldfield.  He also says the pegs put in by Ted Bywaters were 3-4 chains away from his own and that when he registered his claim the Department of Mines informed him they had no previous applications for a claim from there.  Mr Bywaters had told H.H. Byles that he was glad Byles had pegged a claim, as he didn’t know where his gold had come from, having found it in the dirt in small quantities.  Byles didn’t claim to have found the first gold, but it was by his perseverance and efforts that Mongolata was what it was today – a field that had produced £40,000 worth in a little over 3 years.
