Burra Swimming Pool.  The pool committee met on Thursday evening last and decided to call tenders and also called a meeting of sporting bodies and others to make a drive to raise funds for the project.  To date they have donations and promises of £120 plus £400 from the Council, but considerably more will be needed.
