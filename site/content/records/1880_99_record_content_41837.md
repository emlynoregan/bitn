Burra Town Council.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s drain is being done.

The road on the north side of the brewery is to be made from the ditch material excavated and then topped with quarry rubble.

Given that the Government is refusing a bridge at the Bon Accord Cr Sampson moved that the Council write to the Treasurer to have the ford put in order.

Complaints received of stray cattle in Kooringa at night and on Sundays
