Volunteers will photograph all buildings in Burra on the same day within the next two months.

A dramatic event is planned for Redruth Gaol in association with the Arts Council and Flinders University drama students.

In 1985 the Trust became involved with several issues including the redevelopment of Market Square.  I am disturbed that Council seems reluctant to consult with us over issues of major importance.  The Councilâ€™s recent decision to form a Burra Heritage Advisory Committee is a good one.

[Mrs Wright then went on to thank all those who had helped the Trust throughout the year.]

Elections: President, Mrs Maureen Wright; Vice-President Management, Helen Stockman; Vice-President Works & Buildings, Barry Wright; Vice President Funding & Catering, Cheryl John; Secretary, Robyn Page; Treasurer, Avian Pink and Curator, Colin Fidock.

The guest speaker was Jeff Daniels, development officer from National Trust Headquarters who spoke on Heritage in Trust.
