Ron Edwards writes in response to Dr Cross’s letter last week urging the banning of the discussion of creationism in Burra:

Open discussion of ideas is surely a right of people in Australia.  ‘If creation is such a “dangerous belief” then surely all the correctly trained students will spot the flaws in the creation arguments.  I invite one and all to come (Sat. 31st Aug. 7 p.m.) and consider both points of view for themselves.’
