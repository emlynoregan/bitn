Preservation of Historic Relics

When it comes to keeping local heritage we can think about it, talk about it and argue about it, but are we prepared to pay for it?  In the past year there has been much heard about the historic mine buildings and their preservation.  The District Council and Samin Ltd have investigated the question.  Samin Ltd has identified the buildings which will remain and which will be demolished in the progress of their activities in the next two or three years.  Samin reports that operations starting early in 1971 will open cut the section of the ore bodies which were mined by underground methods in the last century.  The ore will be leached by an ammonium process for the recovery of copper oxide.  This is expected to extend the present open cut to approximately 2,000 feet in length by 900 ft in width.  The dimensions are based on the need to create wall slopes flat enough to ensure the safety of the open cut when it is mined to a depth of 300 ft.

The structures to be affected will be those on the western side of the open cut, namely the two old winding houses and old offices.  Three small roofless buildings closest to the southern end of the open cut will also be affected.  The old magazine to the west and the buildings at Morphett’s Shaft will not be affected.

Mining is expected to start at the northern end, which means the buildings affected will be preserved for at least two years, but will be removed within the next three years.  So the buildings in danger of demolition in the next three years include Grave’s Shaft and Pit Head and the round chimney at Peacock’s Shaft.  It has been suggested these two examples of old Cornish building could be relocated for tourist interest.  It is thought the cost of each would be $7,000.  Time would be limited to 1971 for the operation and funds could be sought state-wide.  Site Engineer Mr E.L. Hope has suggested, and arrangements have already been made to restore the old Powder Magazine.  And the Morphett Shaft Poppet Head could be restored with the necessary working pieces to effect the past appearance and purpose of the building.  This would be the cheaper operation and most interesting from a tourist point of view.

District Clerk Mr Perry felt the Council would not be prepared to spend rate money on such a project and neither would it  have other than a low priority for any royalties from the Mine.

This leaves public donation as the source.

Samin are prepared to alter their program of works to allow the removal of the buildings.
