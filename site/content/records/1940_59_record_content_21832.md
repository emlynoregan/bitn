Burra High School

At the end of first term Mrs Spark resigned and Miss G. Owen was transferred to Murray Bridge.

So far only Miss K.R. Butler has been appointed in their place, leaving the school short staffed.

The school has not of late been noted for its academic success and understaffing has much to do with this state of affairs.  Teachers are often called upon to teach two or even three classes simultaneously and this cannot do justice to either the teacher or the students.    Results of the 1944 examinations were not at all brilliant.

At present the staff comprises only two senior teachers, assisted by one junior and the possibility of another.  There should be at least three senior teachers and one junior teacher.
