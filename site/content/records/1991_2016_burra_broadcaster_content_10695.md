Burra Residents & Ratepayers’ Association held a well-attended meeting at the Sports Complex on Sunday afternoon and resolved to ask that the Council consider amalgamation with either Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn or Robertstown, Eudunda and Part of Hallett.  District Clerk, Steve Kerrigan explained the rate situation for the Burra Burra DC compared with the average for Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn.  Burra’s town rate was 46% higher and its rural rate 37% higher.  He said Council had wished to gather enough information on merger proposals before calling a public meeting planned for 12 August.  Council considered Burra would be better off if it remained the centre of a new district.  Cr Kellock said that a number of Clare Councillors had said that they thought Burra’s eastern boundary was too far away and they did not want to include parts of Hallett, Robertstown or Eudunda.
