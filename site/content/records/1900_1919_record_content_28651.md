Cr Hardy pointed out that the scavenging of the town was very unsatisfactory and contentions had arisen over what the scavenger had to take away as per his schedule of duties.  He moved a special meeting of the Board be held during the next two weeks to go into the matter and to ensure justice to both the scavenger and the ratepayers.

Cr Parks moved an amendment that no meeting be held and consideration of the matter be held over till the scavenger’s contract ran out.

Cr Hardy’s motion was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.
