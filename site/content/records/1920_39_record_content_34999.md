Burra Burra Show Inc.  General Committee meeting 21 July.

Money allocated for Sheep Dog Trial prizes was £31-4-0, down £6-2-0.  The trials resulted in a loss of c. £16.

The meeting on 21 July decided to have a railcar from Adelaide for the show, and to cut out the train from Terowie, but get a quote instead on a railcar.  The rest of the report deals with the prize list for the annual show and other arrangements for that as well as a report from the Northern Shows Association.  Burra was allocated the date 22 October.
