Cr Radford referred to an old shaft at the back of Fuss’s which had only a low fence to protect children.  The owners’ to be told to fence it or otherwise attend to the danger.  The owners were Sincock & Burchell of Moonta and the shaft was about 80’ deep.  The Council had fenced it on their behalf about 4 years ago, but last year Mr Woollacott had driven over the place and knocked the fence down.
