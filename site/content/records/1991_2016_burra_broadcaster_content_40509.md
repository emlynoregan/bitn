Letter from Peter Brodie, saying he attended the public meeting in Peterborough 0n 29 March with the SA Cabinet.  He asked about the secrecy by the Health Advisory Council and queried the requirements for a twenty-four hour, seven day a week doctor to be available for accident and emergency and stressed that it needed to be a resident doctor.  Presently there is no resident doctor and no accident and emergency service â€“ how long before no hospital?  He was promised answers.
