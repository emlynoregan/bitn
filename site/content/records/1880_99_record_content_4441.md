Editorial on the Chinese Question.

The editor was strongly against the anti-Chinese legislation on the grounds that it was ‘a policy inexpedient, dishonourable, and based upon prejudice and not upon fact.’  He said the Adelaide Advertiser always refers to ‘the yellow agony’ which has no substance, but is ‘simply pandering to the common prejudice.’

The objections to their herding together in filthy living conditions can be met by enforcement of our sanitary regulations - only constant inspection restrains many Europeans from equally unclean habits.  The immorality of the Chinese is often referred to, ‘but in view of our own city vice we should not speak too loudly of this!’

This problem really argues for the immigration of Chinese women.

‘The prejudice between race and race should be now, in this period of intercommunication, a thing of the past.’
