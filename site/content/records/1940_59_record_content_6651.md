The Council could strike a special rate to assist the Institute.

They could let the Government step in.

It was now up to the ratepayers.  The Council had done all it could.

Moved Crs Marston & Samuel that the proposal to take over the Institute be proceeded with, subject to the consent of the ratepayers.  That the takeover be from 1 April 1942, free of encumbrances for the sum of £3,200 with instalments to be paid every six months over a period of 30 years.  This was carried unanimously – with of course the understanding that the Bank’s Directors might yet not agree.

A ratepayers’ meeting to discuss the proposal was scheduled for 30 July, with the date for a poll to be fixed later.
