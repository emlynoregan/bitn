Old Kelvale is featured as a new stud at this year’s 2002 Stud Merino Field Days.  Graham & Judy Kellock and David and Jane Hill are running the new entity, born out of a half share in the Kelvale Stud.  The Old Kelvale display at Burra Oval will contain a selection of 1½-year-old rams and a selection of ewes so visitors can see the type of sheep they aim to breed.  The Kellock family has been breeding merinos and lately poll merinos in the Burra district for 125 years.  In 1962 they started breeding rams and registered the Kelvale Stud in 1966.  Their aim is to retain the size, structure and wool cutting ability for which the bloodline is known, while continuing to improve wool style and micron.  [2 photos.]
