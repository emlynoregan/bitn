Conference of District Councils

This meeting on Friday 25 May at the Eastern Telephone Building was convened by I.J. Warnes Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC to consider proposals by the Government to amalgamate DCs.  Mrs Warnes was elected to the chair.  Councils represented were: Booborowie, Hanson, Mt Bryan, Yongala, Spalding, Burra, Hallett, Terowie, Caltowie and Hutt & Hill Rivers.  Also present were the MPs G.F. Jenkins, Alex Melrose & A.D. McDonald.

Mr Warnes seemed most concerned that pastoral and farming areas should not be mixed in the one Council and so if amalgamations were forced on them the new boundaries should run north-south rather than east-west.    Mr Jenkins said all that could be done was to give evidence to the Royal Commission and wait for its recommendations.  The Government could then be lobbied regarding the recommendations.  They could accept or reject these, but not change them.  [Though in one or two cases already dealt with the Commission had consented to alterations.]  The meeting canvassed each Council for its views and not surprisingly they all thought they were doing things very efficiently and that amalgamations were not desirable.  Despite a lot of talk there were no resolutions passed.
