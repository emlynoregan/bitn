Burra Red Cross held its AGM on 14 July and elected: President, Mrs Baulderstone; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames L. Bence & T. Padbury; Secretary, Mrs S. Gare and Treasurer, Mrs A. Wright.  The past year saw six meetings with an average attendance of 10.  [Details in ¾ column.]

Burra M & BHA held its AGM and elected: President, H. Stockman; Vice-President, V. Secomb; Secretary, G. Hall; Assistant Secretary, P. Male and Treasurer, J. Broad.

The secretary’s report.

It was a financially successful year, but a disappointing lack of interest was shown by mothers using the clinic.  The Baby Boutique in the Burra Town Hall on August was well supported and takings were $254.62.  The Annual Badge Day raised $56.80 and a trading table and raffle in November raised $63.  Booborowie Young People’s Group Walkathon raised $168.17.  This income enabled us to donate $250 as our share of the house at Clare for the Sister in Charge.
