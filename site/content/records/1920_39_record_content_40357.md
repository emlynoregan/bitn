Church of England Day School held break-up festivities at the Parish Hall 17 December.

The hall was decorated and there was an exhibition of scholars’ work.  Rector Rev. J.S.W. Coles presided.  The school had improved both in facilities and achievement this year.  Better heating was installed for winter.  French was added to the curriculum.  Archdeacon Bussell had visited on 9 February and the Bishop of Adelaide on 21 July and was very satisfied.  Miss F.M. Orr who was the founding teacher resigned at the end of the middle term and was replaced by Miss P.M. Gall.

After the report for the year a program of recitals was presented followed by the distribution of prizes by the Mayor who also expressed everyone’s appreciation for the school’s secretary Mr J.F. Stephen who is leaving the town.

Dux for the year was Helen Gordon and second was Peter Spencer.

The school is out of debt.   Mr Stephen was presented with a gold-mounted fountain pen.  Mr Bednall will take over as secretary.
