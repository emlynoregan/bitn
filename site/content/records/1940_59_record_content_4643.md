Pte Phil Ogilvie writes to his parents at Booborowie from Palestine.  At Christmas he was able to meet his two brothers, Gunner Stewart Ogilvie, attached to 2/12 Field Regiment 23 Battery and Pte Irvine Ogilvie 2/28 Battalion, both of whom were camped nearby.  He tells of having pork and chicken for Christmas dinner with plum pudding and of getting a hamper from the Lord Mayor’s Patriotic War Fund.  He says he visited Irvine’s camp on 28th December and received a visit from Stewart on 29th.  He writes of visiting the beach at Tel Aviv and of visiting Jaffa.
