Stuart Norris is known far and wide as Australia’s Greater Picker.  He has recently been interviewed for ‘Today Tonight’ by Paul Makin.  They undertook a five day trip together, buying along the way.  On 2 April thay left Burra and headed for Horsham and Castlemaine, Niyat, Swan Hill and Echuca, etc.  Stuart bought and Paul filmed along the way and the pair returned to Burra on Sunday 6 April.  Paul then filmed at the Pharaoh’s Tomb for about three hours on Monday.  The film will be shown in three separate segments on Today Tonight in WA & SA – though in Burra we don’t get Today Tonight..
