‘On Thursday next, at nine o’clock, and reaches the Burra Burra by way of Bagot’s, on Friday.

The “Reformer,” stage cart, the fastest and best conveyance on the road, and driven by a man that has been persecuted, prosecuted, fined, and confined for long periods in Britain’s Bastiles [sic] in that glorious battle which freed the press from the shackles of taxation; the effects of which will be knowledge, union, and liberty, with peace and plenty for all mankind.  If his struggles with many others in this good cause do not entitle him to support, they do to gratitude.

Remember, in this place, where we have not yet a college

Without sheets from the press the folks cannot get knowledge;

So drivers who on the North Road cut their capers,

Don’t forget to carry the Adelaide papers.

Apply to W.G. Nicholls, Temperance Hotel, Hindley-street West.
