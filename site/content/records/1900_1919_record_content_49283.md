Burra Institute, Annual Meeting.

The credit balance was over £200.  In the year Commercial Classes have been run.

For two years ending in December 1916 the committee has given £44-8-6 worth of hall use to patriotic efforts.

The Library now has 4,658 books.  12 scholarship subscriptions have been again given for 1917.  Mainly due to Orchestral Classes becoming members the membership has increased.

In December 1915 single members 99 and double 25 for total of 124

In December 1916 single members 148 and double 25 for total of 173

Orchestral and Choral Classes were limited by the war, especially the Choral Class, due to enlistments.

Commercial Classes began with an attendance of 28, but in the second quarter had fallen to 19 and finally to 16, due only in part to removals.

Plans for enlarging the hall and for a billiard room are on hold for the duration of the war.

Elections: President, Mr Winnall; Vice-president, Mr Harcus; Treasurer T.H. Wilkinson [T.H.?]; Secretary, J. Drew.

Messrs Drew and Crewes were elected to fill trustee vacancies caused by the deaths of Mr A. Bartholomaeus and Mr C.C. Williams.

Mr Crewes moved the billiard room be considered as since 6 o’clock closing young men had no place to enjoy themselves except the hotel billiard rooms.

Mr Dane felt a new piano was a higher priority.

Mr McLaren felt enlarging the hall was the highest priority.

Mr Crewes’ motion to consider the Billiard Room was lost.
