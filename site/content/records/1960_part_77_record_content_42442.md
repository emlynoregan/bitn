The Hospital Department has increased Burra Town Council’s contribution to the Burra Hospital from $973 to $1,373 – a 41% increase.  The Council is strongly objecting, as this has occurred after the budget for 1968-69 has been prepared and the rate declared.  The Hospital Board has not requested an increase in contributions.  Increases have not been ordered for the Burra Burra DC, the Robertstown or the Hallett Councils.
