Ratepayer writes that the government is asking the Council to take over a seven year lease on the Waterworks.  This would be reckless for such a ‘tin pot affair’.  It is impossible to keep on with such a ramshackle affair any longer and impossible to get decent water from the present well.  It is time to voice your concern at the ratepayers’ meeting.  [This meeting was scheduled for 16 November in an advertisement on the same page.]
