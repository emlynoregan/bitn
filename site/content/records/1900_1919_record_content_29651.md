Obituary.  Richard Austin, who died at Glenelg on 21 May, arrived in Burra 56 years ago and began work as a miner.  He later became a butcher and farmer.  He married twice.  His second wife was Julia Killicoat and they had one son, Henry.  Though not active in public affairs, he helped financially many causes that promoted the welfare of the town and district.  Not feeling well he went to Glenelg for a change of air and to consult Dr Sangster Jnr.  Complications set in and he died of heart failure aged 83.  The funeral procession in Burra was one of the longest for some years.
