Letter.  ‘A Ratepayer’ writes re Sunday tennis.

The writer was not sure when the club started, but some thirty years ago it played on courts near the site of the Aberdeen Croquet Club lawns.  At the time the players worked eight or nine hours a day with only Saturday afternoons off.  The young lads spent many hours scraping off the top soil to get to the clay, and also built seating around the courts.  Now some members think there is not enough time to play and so want the Council to grant Sunday Sport.  The Aberdeen Club has been a great club and at Easter many came from across the state to the tournament.  ‘Although there may not have been a written agreement, there has always been a definite understanding there should be no Sunday play.
