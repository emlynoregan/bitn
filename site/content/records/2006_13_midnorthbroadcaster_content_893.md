Letter.  Stephen Boyes writes complaining of the lack of a specific Burra section in the paper, whereas there is such for Eudunda and Peterborough.  In last week’s edition he says, with 64 column inches per page, Burra scored 11 column inches of news and 27 column inches of sport, 4 photos and 7 inches of what happened 40 years ago, plus one advertorial.  He warns that if this continues the paper will have no Burra readers or advertisers.

[The editor’s response was that the last issue was an important time for Peterborough and it all balances out.]
