Burra Bowling Club.  President S.J. Woollacott’s report.

The year has been a social and financial success.  There were 71 members last year and 69 this year.  The Blue Team won the pennant in the North Eastern Association, but in the Mid North Association both teams finished near the bottom.  The Easter Tournament was a great success.

[He continues after discussing the club games and tournaments.]

Three things now need our attention:

The present toilet facilities are an embarrassment and a completely new block is required.

The clubroom requires lining.

Some feel that external lighting is required.

The toilets would cost £400 to £500 and one Night Tournament would cover the £20 interest charge.

The death during the year of their oldest member Mr E. Finch was greatly regretted.  He had been a foundation member and a past patron.

[The report concludes with thanks to committee members and a number of individuals.]

Winners of the Club Trophies:

Championship	K. Williams

Handicap Singles	K. Murphy

Championship Pairs	H. Foote & M. Jacka
