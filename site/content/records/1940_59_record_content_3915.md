Bowden Salvation Army Citadel Band visited Booborowie on Saturday and Burra on Sunday last.  Envoy Winfield, the officer presently in charge at Burra, offered the band for a performance at the Rotunda at 2.30 p.m.  They also played at the Burra Hospital.  They drew only a fair attendance at the Rotunda, which was unfortunate as the concert was in aid of gifts for the boys leaving for overseas.
