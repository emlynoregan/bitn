Streetlights.  The arc lamp on Henderson’s corner is proving troublesome and complainants say it is inadequate as a replacement for the lamp at the pump – especially for those needing to use the troughs at night.  Last Thursday an accident occurred there when a driver drove his horse full butt against the trough in the dark, being unable to see the railing.  The horse was nastily gashed on the chest and the driver shot over the front of his vehicle.  On Monday the lamp went out after only one hour.
