Local Board of Health.

The Town Clerk reported the Isolation Hospital had been dismantled.

The Burra Hospital Matron had taken charge of the blankets etc. and local storekeepers had taken some stuff back.  Some £30 worth of material had been stored at the depot.  A statement of the whole cost of the operation is to be prepared for next meeting.

The acting inspector is to be paid £2 a month.

Cr McBride objected to the nurses attached to the Isolation Hospital working in private homes.  This nursing should have been at the Isolation Hospital, whose costs, borne by the Board, were ongoing while the patients contributed nothing and had the nurses at home.

Mr Crewes said the nurses’ fees would be recovered for the Board.

Cr McBride said there was no occasion for them to be idle: there was enough work in Adelaide.

Mr Crewes: the Isolation Hospital was closed as soon as the Medical Officer thought it safe.
