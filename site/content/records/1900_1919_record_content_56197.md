Mrs F.A. Gregg (Bon Accord Hotel).  The Inspector reported it to be fairly well furnished and clean.  It had neither sample rooms nor billiards, but stabling for six horses.  It was hard to say if it was necessary.  It was used mainly by railwaymen and wheat lumpers.  The toilets were pits, but septic tanks were being installed.  Constable McCarthy said it was well conducted and necessary for the class of people who used it.  Mrs Gregg had it for six months after her husbandâ€™s death: he had held the licence for seven years.  She was very busy on sale days and when there were functions at the Showgrounds.  It was largely used by Booborowie people.  Several other witnesses gave support.
