Burra Youth Club.  Ten members competed in the SA Youth Club Swimming Championships at the Unley Pool on Friday 19 March.  Burra was the only country club of the 18 clubs entered, but they arrived late and the under 12s were unable to compete.  Lynette Corner returned with four second place certificates: two gained in the under 15 events and two in open events (up to 18).  Brenda Willmott came second in the Under 15 breaststroke.  The boys were less successful, but nevertheless enjoyed the meeting.  They got home at 1.40 a.m. on Saturday morning.
