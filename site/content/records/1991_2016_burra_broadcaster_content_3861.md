Pascoe Photographs

The Pascoe Collection of stud sheep photographs is currently on display upstairs in the Burra Tourist Office.  They were collected over a number of years and hung on the walls of Joe Pascoe’s barber shop, which was in the premises now occupied by Carlin’s Coiffure, until the early 1970s.  The Stud merino Breeders’ Association purchased the array and have now restored many for display.
