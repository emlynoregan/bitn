Hallett 3 Wind Farm proposal continues to divide the community.  About 95 people attended a ‘Save Mt Bryan Fighting Fund’ meeting at Hallett Hall on Friday night.  It had been organised by Dawn Booth, Malcolm & Lyn Kelly and Bill Quinn to inform the community of the progress of an appeal against the proposal with the hope of gaining support with the costs.  The appellants had earlier met with Channel 7 reporter Chris Warren.  The appellants are contending an alleged serous negative impact on the environment, such as erosion, as earth moving and road works are required.  They also allege a significant impact on character and landscape quality, and potential to impact on natural heritage.  They also fear excessive noise.  Local farmer, Andy Thomas alleges he and his family have suffered various health issues including sleep deprivation since the erection of the turbines behind his property at Mt Bryan.  The first hearing for the appeal is scheduled for the Environmental and Development Court of SA in May.  [Photo of opponents of the wind farm.]
