Burra Apex Club

At a meeting held on 9 July to wind up the clubâ€™s affairs it was decided unanimously by members present to continue the club.  A new board was elected: President, Eddie McNamara (Telecom, Burra); Vice-President, Don Griffen (farmer, Mt Bryan); Secretary, Wayne Johns (hotel proprietor of Mt Bryan) and Treasurer, Col. Baker (teacher of Burra).  Service clubs across Australia report falling membership over the last five years.  The continuance of the club will greatly aid the survival of the Burr School & Community News.
