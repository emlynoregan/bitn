The Grand Centenary Ball was held on Friday 2 October in Burra Institute.  Arrangements were in the hands of Messrs M.W. Bednall and Max Pearce and the event proved a huge success in every way.  Decorations were the responsibility of Mr & Mrs Bednall and Miss Rica Motley.  The result was a glorious floral scene with streamers and elaborate bows in tones of gold, brown and deep red.  The attendance was one of the largest seen in the hall for many years.  The Black Diamond Orchestra attended from Adelaide and dancing continued to 2 a.m.  Mrs W.H. Sandland organised supper assisted by a large committee.  It was so well arranged that there was no crowding and everyone was easily served.  The Mayor declared the Ball open.

[The description of ladies’ gowns extends for almost 1 column.]

During the evening Mr & Mrs Tretheway of Adelaide gave special exhibitions of old and modern style dancing and ‘other acceptable items were given by “Yodelling Romeo” of 5CL fame’.
