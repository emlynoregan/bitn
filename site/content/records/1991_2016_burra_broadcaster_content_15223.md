Policing in Burra

The local committee appointed to report on progress says:

The complaints fell within the Resolution Process.

The investigation process is basically completed.

When finalised, the report will go to the Police Complaints authority, who will make the decision.

The management side of the report is likely to be handled by Inspector J. Langmead of Pt Pirie.

Local officers will undergo behaviour and leadership courses conducted by the Police Academy.

The local police station will undergo random behavioural management audits.
