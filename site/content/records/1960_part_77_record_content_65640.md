Burra RSL.  President Ben Kotz reported on the year’s activities.  There were 10 monthly meetings.  The annual dinner was very successful and badge days were again held.  Patronage at the Annual Anzac Service was poor – it may be our last.  Various people hired the club rooms and unfortunately considerable damage was done – by nobody of course!
