The Government has decided to cease operations at the quarry and on Saturday 22 men and boys were thrown out of employment.  Over the past two years it has had a good run, employing up to 36 men at times.  The bidding on Wednesday was apparently higher than the Government was prepared to go.  At present it is cheaper to bring ballast from the Mitcham Quarry.  Aberdeen would need to put in crushers to make it pay.  The Government has a lease for four years, but at present will not work it except for occasional small quantities.
