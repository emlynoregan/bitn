Golf at Farrell’s Flat.  ‘A Golfer’ writes from Farrell’s Flat and comments on a report that the Wetherston Golf Club had put its holes in dangerous proximity to those of the Farrell’s Flat Club.  He says the club applied to Council for permission according to a plan that was submitted and the holes were pegged out according to the approved plan.  The Club was formed when Farrell’s Flat Club fixed its subscription so high as to preclude many intending players.  The Wetherston Club wanted to approach the Farrell’s Flat Club and ask them to reduce their fees and so double their membership.  They refused to entertain the idea and so Wetherston decided on a separate club with lower fees.
