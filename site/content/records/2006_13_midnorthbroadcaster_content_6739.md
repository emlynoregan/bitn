Rural Youth is being wound up as an organisation after more than fifty years.  The Burra Branch was very active in the movement’s heyday.  The club organised many social events, including balls, weekend rallies and camps.  Clubs competed against each other in both skilled and fun events.  Skills learned included meeting procedures, debating, public speaking, stock judging, dressmaking and cooking.  Training was offered for competitions in shearing, photography and public speaking among other things.

The wind-up followed an enquiry from the office of the Minister of Agriculture concerning its status and the Supreme Court appointed a liquidator on 18 November 2008.  A meeting on 18 December will hear submissions on the distribution of the organisation’s $60,000 of assets.
