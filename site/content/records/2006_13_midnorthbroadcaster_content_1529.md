Burra Passport.  The Goyder Council and the National Trust have come to an agreement on the management of the Burra Passport product.  Council and the National Trust have a 50% ownership of the product.  [Presumably this means ‘each have a 50% ownership’ rather than 50% together.]

Earlier this year the NTSA presented Council with a proposal to continue to manage the passport heritage sites, of which the Council has four and the National Trust has three.  The NTSA proposed to redistribute the income:

Maintenance of Council properties	30%

Maintenance of NTSA properties	30%

[After this the article’s distribution of income become unclear, but the proposal was to decrease the commission paid to the Burra Visitor Centre from 30% to 10%.  After objections this offer was increased to 15%.]

Council rejected the offer of a 15% commission to the Burra Visitor Centre.

On 5 September Council agreed to a compromise of 17.5% till 30 June 2007, when it will be reviewed.

Council agreed that audited accounts of both the Burra National Trust and the Visitor Centre were needed to assist in the understanding and appreciation of their financial positions.
