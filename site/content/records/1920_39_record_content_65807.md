Obituary.  Thomas Turner died 7 February aged 78.  He was born at Mt Bryan 23 August 1858, the son of the late Mr & Mrs Joshua Turner.  He was educated at Mr Whiteâ€™s School in Kooringa and after that worked for a while at the Burra Mine.  He then went to Mt Gipps Station beyond Broken Hill and when silver was discovered there he took up carting, as the railway only went to Terowie.  He was later employed by Dr Brummitt until Dr Brummitt left Burra and he took up dam sinking, but for the last 37 years has been engaged in droving.  In conjunction with his son Cliff Turner he was active to the last.  He was active in the Burra Show Soc. and regularly entered the Sheep Dog Trials.  He was one of the oldest members of the Foresters.  He married Miss Mahomie Gillett, eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs G.B. Gillett of Manila Farm, Gum Creek in 1866.  She died about two years ago.  Of a family of four two survive: Mr Clifford Turner and Miss Hilda Turner both of Aberdeen.  One child died in infancy and Miss Ethel Turner 25 years ago.  Mrs W. Williams of Kooringa is a sister.
