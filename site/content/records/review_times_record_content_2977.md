Burra Town Hall has a new management committee.  At a public meeting on 5 March Mr Barry Wright was elected president with Mr David Thamm as Secretary and Mrs Freda Pink as Publicity Officer.  Cr Norm Maxted is the Council representative.  New boards have been installed in the stage floor.  Burra Apex Club has offered to re-polish the main floor and has also requested the telephone be relocated to the ticket bay in the foyer and other minor repairs be effected.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said the Town Hall usage had changed recently as young adults now seem to prefer pubs for their entertainment.
