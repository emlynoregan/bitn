Obituary.  Mrs Elizabeth Wall of Booborowie died 23 October at Burra hospital after a lengthy illness.  She was born 3 August 1858 and was aged 81.  Her early life was spent around Kapunda and subsequently her parents the late Mr & Mrs Hannabel [sic: for Hannibal] Williams moved to the Ulooloo District.  The deceased married Mr Edward Wall 6 October 1880.  He died in 1914.  The couple moved to Booborowie about 54 years ago where they conducted the Booborowie Eating House and Post Office for many years.  Since her husbandâ€™s death Mrs Wall has lived with her daughter at the original homestead.  She is survived by Mrs J.M. Murphy, Mrs R. Morris and Mrs H. Cousins all of Booborowie.  There are 14 grandchildren & 12 great-grandchildren.  Four brothers also survive: Charles Thomas Williams of Thebarton [sic*], William Williams of Leasingham and John Williams of Hampton.  Her only sister Emily died some 12 months ago.

[*If four brothers survive, presumably this should read Charles & Thomas of Thebarton.  Emily Jane probably died 13 November 1938 at New Mile End but like the deaths of most of the brothers it is hard to be sure since the ages given at death do not correspond to the years of the birth registrations.]
