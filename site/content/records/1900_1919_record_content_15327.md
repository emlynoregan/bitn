A Bolt.  Ted Wall was driving from Booborowie last week and stopped to pick up a dog.  While he was out of the trap the horses bolted, knocking him down.  In the trap was 11-year-old Lily Oates, who with great fortitude managed eventually to pull them up without damage after negotiating ruts and two nasty washaways.
