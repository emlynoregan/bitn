Emergency Fire Services

On 1 October 1948 the Government places the Emergency Fire Services under the control of the Commissioner of Police, so that there would be better co-ordination of preliminary measured for the prevention of bushfires as well as one control for the direction of voluntary assistance in any outbreak.  Trailer pumps have been placed in various districts and these have been under the supervision of The Commissioner of Civil Defence.  That supervision now transfers to the Commissioner of Police.

[The line of command and the steps that will be taken in combatting outbreaks are then outlined.]
