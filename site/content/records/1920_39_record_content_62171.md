Tree Planting

In Burra in treeless streets and in reserves holes have been dug, good earth placed in them and tree guards have been made.  Old trees have been trimmed and are responding well.

Cr Dow was dissatisfied with the number of trees allotted to West Ward.  There were for instance no trees for Church Street.  He disputed Cr Jeffery’s explanation that in some places holes were hard to dig and thus expensive – anything from 3/- to £2 a hole.

Cr Kellaway said it had been discussed at the last meeting and Mr Fairchild estimated the cost in certain places to be at least £1.

The Town Clerk said he had taken Mr Fairchild to various places.  Hill Street was too narrow for planting and Ware St had hard blue metal where a hole would cost £1.

Cr Dow wondered what size.  Clerk: 3 x 3 x 2 ft 6 inches.

Cr Dow said it was nonsense [to suggest the cost mentioned.]

The Mayor thought there were places in West Ward where it was possible to plant trees.

Cr Dow said yes: nearly any place except the caps of reefs.

Clerk: Carabs [sic: for carobs] would grow in stony ground and fifty had been ordered.

Cr Dow said plenty of carabs were growing in the Ware Street locality.
