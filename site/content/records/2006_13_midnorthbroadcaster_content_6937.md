Jazz in the Monster Mine on Saturday had to contend with hot weather, but fortunately a cool change later in the evening brought relief.  It turned into a beautiful night to follow a dreadful day.  Gail Kingston and Hot Foot Jazz together with Sass-E Singers kept the crowd tapping and moving to the swinging tunes.  There were many repeat visitors and some of the audience came from as far away as Japan, Italy, Korea and Germany.  Major sponsors for the event were AGL & Ray White Real Estate.  Coloured lights lit up the surrounding cliffs to create a unique atmosphere.  [Photo]
