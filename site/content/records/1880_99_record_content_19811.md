Burra Flower Show, last Wednesday in the Institute.

Despite a reputation a few years ago as a place where nothing would grow, Burra now produces flowers the equal of anywhere - especially those grown under shelter.  Mr T. Drew’s efforts in this class were particularly notable.  T.W. Pearce’s and Dr Brummitt’s being also very good.  Increased competition is however, desirable.  In cut flowers: ‘One notable exhibitor, Mr Fuss, stood out altogether, and the rest had to be content with fewer and less meritorious exhibits than their fastidious taste would have approved . . .’  Captain Killicoat carried all before him in the roses and Mr Cave in the annuals.  Other winners of note were Messrs C. Oppermann, Holder, Wilkinson and Lasscock.  Bouquets were a disappointment.  Attendance this year was rather small in the evening.

[* The observation about Mr [H.C.W.] Fuss seems very strange, as his name does not appear once in the prize list.]
