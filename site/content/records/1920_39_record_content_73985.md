Burra High School opened the year with about 65 students.  It is hoped the Booborowie transport scheme will be in operation within the year.  Parents are disappointed it is not operating now.  The cost should not be much as the Government will offer 1/- per day subsidy and 1/6 to those who cannot afford any extra costs.
