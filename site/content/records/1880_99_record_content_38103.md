Mrs E. Finch was driving home from the Wesleyan Church in Kooringa on Sunday morning with six children in a spring cart when the sight of a young lady at the side of the road with a parasol frightened the horse.  It swerved, ran the cart over a steep bank, turning it completely upside down, which threw the horse onto its back.  Mrs Finch gashed he forehead and one little boy broke an arm, but all were lucky to escape without more damage.  The gorse was somewhat bruised and the cart smashed.
