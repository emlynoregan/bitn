Gum Creek School Welfare Club held its first birthday in the Leighton Hall on Thursday.  In its first year it raised £60 to support the school with £30 worth of library books, a strip film projector and several other aids.  The school was opened in 1897.  The birthday cake was cut by Miss E. Bailey who had been one of the original students.  The afternoon produced £29-10-0 profit for the organisation.
