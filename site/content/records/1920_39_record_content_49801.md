The Mayor claimed not to have been approached by the Town Clerk before [on this issue].

The Town Clerk said he had been.

The Mayor said it was up to him to decide on the receiving of a deputation.

Cr Sampson accused the Mayor of trying to force his ideas on Council and allowing no other ideas to prevail.  [And the suggestion was that it was a habit of his.]

The argument then reverted to the horse issue.

The end seems to have been that the argument fizzled out without any resolution formally and the deputation was not heard.

J.H. Murison writes a letter ti the paper to explain what happened in this storm in a teacup.  Because a Brass Band Musical Festival has been arranged in Burra for 27 & 28 April when the Waikerie District Band will visit, he was anxious to see if anything could be done to allow the bands to play within the railings as the rotunda itself will hold only half a band.  He approached the Mayor about a deputation and the Mayor pointed out the irregularity of the procedure, but realised the need for action id anything could be done and promised his support.  He did not promise anything, but expressed a belief that the whole Council had the interests of the Band sufficiently at heart to consent to waiving the formalities considering the urgency of the case.
