Alf Carne replies at great length to what he terms Cr Button’s ‘vulgar and splenetic attack’.  Cr Button’s letter was a protest against a quite innocent expression in which we hoped Cr Jennison would have the support of two diggers in the new Council which Cr Button took somehow to be a reflection on the members of Council.  Crs Bevan & Jennison and the Mayor have assured me they took no such interpretation.  On the 16 November we merely affirmed that we welcomed the entry of returned soldiers into all forms of public life.  In his later effusion Cr Button ignores this and makes a violent and coarse attack on the RSA and myself.  The President of the RSA did not make the phone call Cr Button alleges.  Cr Jennison has never expressed his indignation.  Why is Cr Button concerned that Mr Thompson changed his mind?  He is allowed to change his mind.  For business reasons he decided not to nominate.  This is not a breach of faith.  Cr Button’s laboured attempts at jokes are not in good taste and are offensive.  [Much more in a ¾ column letter.]
