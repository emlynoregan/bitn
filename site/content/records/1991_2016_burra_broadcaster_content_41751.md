The Re-Created Burra Cheer-Up Hall was opened in the Mary Warnes Room of the Burra Town Hall on 18 May.  It is an initiative of the Burra History Group in line with the ANZAC Centenary Program.  The group of about 20 who gathered were welcomed and an introductory talk was given by Eric Fuss, who explained the history of the Cheer-Up Society in Burra and Adelaide.  Don Lloyd spoke of his familyâ€™s connection with the Society and his sisters, Claire and Mary and Cousin Aileen cut ribbons to officially open the room.  [5 photos.]
