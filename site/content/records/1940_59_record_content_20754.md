The Salvation Army has asked to borrow certain of the Burra Town Band Instruments.  The Mayor believed that the Corporation had given £30-£40 to the band to purchase instruments on the understanding that if the band collapsed the instruments would pass to the possession of the town.  Cr Lee also believed they vested in the Corporation, but said quite a number were missing.  The clerk said he had nothing in writing regarding the ownership and Cr Kellaway believed the Council was merely the custodian.  His Worship then suddenly remembered that the funds to buy instruments had come not from the Council, but from the Seaside Picnic Committee.

Mr J.T. Pascoe, who was the band’s secretary when it went into recess in 1937, later contacted the paper and said a minute was placed in the books stating that the Council be asked to act as custodian until another band was formed in the town.  He also said many of the players owned their own instruments.
