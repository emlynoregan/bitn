BCS is busy rehearsing for performances of Man of Steel, which will be presented early in term III.  The school will host language students from Athol Park Language Centre between 30 June and 4 July.  This will be the third time the school has hosted the students who will be billeted with town families.  Some of the students, whose ages range from 12 to 22, were refugees.  A careers counselling seminar in Adelaide has been arranged for later in the term.  40 Burra students from Years 10, 11 & 12 will join students from Clare, Riverton and Balaklava for the excursion, which includes a visit to Technology Park.

The school hopes to launch its Jubilee 150 book Relatively Speaking during the Copper Festival in October.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said the school was seeking a sponsor to pay the $13,000 it will need to produce 1,000 copies of the book.  The book is in the final stages of preparation.  About 690 contributors from students at Burra Community School, and from Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Hallett Schools have prepared work for it.  Entries are either historical memories of families or contemporary observations, which will be of future historic interest.  Information is listed alphabetically by family and includes photographs.  Louisa Fidock of BCS has won the competition to design the cover.
