Black Springs CWA & Patriotic Koonoona Employees are to hold a Garden Fete at Koonoona Station next Saturday to aid POW Funds and Christmas Hamper and Cheer-Up Hut Emergency Work Fund.

Burra Red Cross held a successful penny drive last Friday afternoon.  Lines were drawn from the Savings Bank to Messrs R.D. Pascoeâ€™s and the results were very satisfactory.
