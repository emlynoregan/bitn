Goyder Council

Council will seek further submissions from the community before deciding on whether to reduce the number of Councillors from the current 13 and to dispense with wards.

Work on the Kingston St Bridge is progressing well.

The wind-damaged lighting tower at Burra Oval has yet to be replaced.

Andrew Glen of Burra Visitor Centre and the BRTBA President Sue Ryan reported to Council on the Centreâ€™s achievements since the start of 2003.

Council has offered $37,000 yearly towards the running of Burra Visitor Centre.
