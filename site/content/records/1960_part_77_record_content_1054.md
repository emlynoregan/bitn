Judith Willmott, winning 8 events and 24 points in the Junior Girls.

George Kelly who won 15 points in the Junior Boys.

Lorraine Irlam was second best for Draysey with 18 points.

Anthony Tame for Riggs won 17 points.

At the conclusion of the event the Headmaster Mr M.W. Scriven announced there would be a special Swimming Cup to be held from year to year by the house winning the carnival and to be known as the Roy Jeffery Cup, as a tribute to the former headmaster whose efforts had done so much to provide the Burra Swimming Pool.
