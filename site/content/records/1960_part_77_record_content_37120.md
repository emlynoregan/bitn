Editorial on the local water supply.

An apparent fall in water quality has apparently prompted some people to believe that local underground water is being mixed with River Murray water.  This is not the case except for 90 minutes on 18 October when local water was pumped while Hanson pumps were changed over.  Murray water appears to have deteriorated.
