Burra Town Council, 17 November

Applications for a new assessment of the town will be called.

The Under-Treasurer advises that as the loan referred to in correspondence has been paid back a new loan will have to be made.

The Mayor said the £400 could be returned to general revenue and a new loan obtained.  He asked if it were a matter to be decided by ratepayers.

Burra & District War Memorial Committee has been working in the expectation of receiving the £400 and Council was duty bound to support their scheme.

Cr T.H. Woollacott had said at the ratepayers’ meeting that the £400 was actually Council money.

Legal ad vice on the need for a ratepayers’ meeting will be sought.

A.B. Aldam sought removal of street trees in Thames Street.  Council will inspect.
