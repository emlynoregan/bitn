Advertorial spruiking the show ‘I’m Not a Dentist’ by Henri Szeps, saying it is a funny, moving and inspiring autobiographical show from his birth in a WWII refugee camp in Switzerland to his rise to eminence in Australian theatre.  He is best known now for his portrayal of Robert Beare, the favoured son (and dentist) in Mother and Son on ABC TV.
