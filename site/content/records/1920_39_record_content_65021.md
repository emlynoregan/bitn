Hallett School

Friday saw a reunion of old scholars and a meeting with present scholars.  Some 101 old scholars attended and there were at least 50 other visitors.  Reminiscences and humour prevailed.  Photographs were taken and at 5.30 p.m. a knife and fork tea was held in the Institute, followed by a concert at 8 p.m. in which present scholars gave the first half and old scholars provided the second half.

[A list of attending old scholars is printed.]
