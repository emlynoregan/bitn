[From the petition it would appear that the morning train was arriving 19 minutes later and the train to the city was leaving 22 minutes earlier, which gave some 40 minutes less time to attend to correspondence requiring an urgent response and in particular reduced the time in Burra for buyers on market days.  These were three Fridays in the month and the new arrangements gave buyers only from 12.30 to 2.30.  This calculation is somewhat speculative, since the paper continued to publish on page 4 the same timetable it had for months past.]

[A changed timetable is finally published on 19 July and it may be what the complaint is about, as the train from Adelaide is show to arrive 20 minutes later at 11.32 a.m. and the one to Adelaide departs 22 minutes earlier at 3.09 p.m.]
