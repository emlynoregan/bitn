Ian Auhl repeats the report from 15 December 1909 of:

The Grand Balloon Ascent at Burra Oval on 11 December 1909.

Oddly Australia’s first powered flight had been a 5½ second event at Victoria Park, Sydney on 9 December 1909 by Colin de Fris in a Wright bi-plane.  The first balloon flight in SA was from North Terrace in 1871 and in 189o the two sisters Gladys & Val van Tassell had ascended and then returned to earth by triple parachute.  When the article was being researched Ian Auhl asked Mrs Mary Walker, widow of the late Oswald Walker, who was then 90, if she remembered the 1909 event.  She did, clearly, and even recalled that the pilot Rinaldo had landed on a woodheap at Killicoat’s (Abberton Park.)

Viceroy Tea Carnival

A great crowd assembled on Victoria Park on Saturday to witness the balloon ascent arranged by Messrs Wilkinson & Co. of Adelaide as a novel way of advertising their Viceroy Tea.  It created a big sensation.  The inflation of the balloon was watched with great interest.  At the report of a pistol shot, it was released and rose quickly some hundreds of feet, carrying with it Rinaldo, seated comfortably on a trapeze. At the climax he hung by his toes on the fast drifting balloon and then, hanging by his hands, he turned a complete somersault before taking his seat again.  The crowd cheered.  Another pistol shot was the signal for him to drop from the balloon and his body fell towards the earth rapidly, but suddenly a parachute opened and Rinaldo was seen seated on the trapeze, from which he saluted the crowd with a cheery wave of his hand.  Eventually he landed somewhat uncomfortably in P.L. Killicoat’s woodheap at Abberton Park, sustaining a shaking and several cuts, but with his grit and determination undiminished.  W.J. Richardson brought Rinaldo back to Victoria Park in his motor car.
