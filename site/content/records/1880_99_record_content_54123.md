Burra Town Council.

The Show Society is to be allowed to charge 1/- for admission to the oval for adults and 6d for children.

Cr Parks moved that John Jenkins be appointed overseer of work at 7/- a day.  Not 2nd.

Cr Parks then resigned as Chairman of the Public Works Committee.  Accepted.

Cr Harris moved and Cr Sampson 2nd that Mr Littlejohnâ€™s services as Waterworks Engineer will not be needed after one month.  This raised much discussion, but eventually the motion was withdrawn.

Cr Sampson resigned as member of the Waterworks Committee.  Accepted.

Cr Harris resigned as Chairman of the Waterworks Committee.  Accepted.

[The ill feelings towards Mr Littlejohn go back to 1892 when there was a bungled attempt to oust him that resulted in his re-employment at an increased salary.  This apparently rankled with some and attempts to replace him continued through 1893.  See particularly the ugly events concerning charges of leaving the engine while it was running and of drinking on duty.]
