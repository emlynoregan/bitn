Horticulture.  Joe Parks has brought in some of the finest heads of chrysanthemums seen in Burra since the days of Hon. J. Lewis, Dr Brummitt, J.C. Cave [sic: for J.D.], C. Drew & T.W. Wilkinson.  He also had some fine potatoes.  The latter were matched by those of Joe T. Pascoe.  R.D. Pascoe has a fine show of carnations.
