Obituary.  Rev. James Rowe died 14 February 1903 [Aged 78].  Notes from a sermon preached in his memory by Rev. W.F. James at Redruth Methodist Church 22 February.

J. Rowe preached his first sermon aged 18 and entered the Bible Christian ministry three years later.  After five years he and Rev. James Way, father of SA’s Chief Justice, were sent to SA as the first Bible Christian ministers in Australia, arriving in 1850.  Mr Way settled in Adelaide and Mr Rowe in Kooringa, where there was a church to seat 200 and three local preachers.  After a month he walked most of the way to Adelaide, preaching by the way.  On the return journey he almost died of an illness at Kapunda, but survived another 52 years.  For some time he and his wife lived in a hut in the Burra Creek with a household of eight members.  Then a friend allowed them a room in his house.  The church prospered till the Victorian gold rush.  Mrs Rowe supplemented their income with needlework, often 16 hours a day to provide the necessities.  After the men returned a manse was built and the size of the church doubled.  For a time the circuit was fifty miles long, but then Kapunda was attached to Gawler.  Mr Rowe opened services at Riverton, auburn and Watervale.  After six years in Burra Mr Rowe began work in Adelaide.  After a struggle £1,000 was raised before the opening of the church which is now the social hall of the Central Mission.  In 1859 Mr Rowe went to superintend the Mission in Victoria, where he spent 18 years.  The circuit at Geelong was 140 miles long.  The term at Ballarat was hard and in Melbourne he managed a book room.  One day he left Melbourne by coach and travelled 60 miles before breakfast and the road being too hard for the coach, then rode 60 miles to reach his destination by 8 p.m. that day.  Mr Rowe returned to SA in 1877 and for six years worked at Moonta and Auburn.  He was president of the Conference in 1881 and returned to England two years later where he superintended the erection of the beautiful church at Forest Hill in London and visited widely.  He returned to SA and spent a further six years in the circuit before being superannuated.  Later a purse of sovereigns and an illuminated address were presented him in Franklin St Church.  His strong willpower made him a formidable opponent.  Mrs Rowe died two years ago.
