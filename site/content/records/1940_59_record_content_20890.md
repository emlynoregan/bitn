Burra Town Council, 19 March.

The Town Clerk has said he would be retiring at the end of this financial year.  At present the Council is paying £274 per annum because the position is part-time.  The award for a full-time position is £343 plus an allowance of 6 pence per mile for motoring.

The Clerk said Sgt E.R. Davey had approached him about obtaining the position.  Cr Bevan asked if the Council had to advertise the position and the Clerk replied in the negative, but a letter from Manpower stated that the correct procedure would be to call for applications through the press.  The Mayor said he thought the position could continue to be part-time and he felt sure Sgt Davey could carry out the duties satisfactorily.  Cr Fisher asked if Sgt Davey was the only returned man available.  Crs Bevan and Kellaway moved that if Sgt Davey could get a release from the military and permission from Manpower that he be employed as part-time Clerk as from 30 June 1945.

Crs Harvey and Fisher moved an amendment that applications be called through the Burra Record and the Advertiser – not because he had anything against Sgt Davey, but in case there was another returned man who was qualified to take the position.  Crs Bevan & Kellaway then withdrew their motion and the amendment was carried.
