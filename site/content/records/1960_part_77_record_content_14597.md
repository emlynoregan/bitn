Burra Burra DC, December 1962

The Minister of Local Government approved the payment of £250 from surplus funds of the Terowie Electricity Supply to the Terowie Institute.

Application to install petrol pumps adjacent to the main road at Terowie was refused and notice served on A. & F.T. White to remove the pump already installed.  (This followed advice from the Highways & Local Government Department.)

Request to C.B .Nourse, as owner of the lot, to remove the petrol pumps installed on the kerbside of MR 45.

SAR’s intention concerning the future of cottages adjacent to the northern crossing at Terowie (west of the cemetery) is to be sought.
