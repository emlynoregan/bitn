Mr Birdseye has taken over the Bon Accord Hotel.  Mrs Jones, who bought it when the estate of E.C. Lockyer was wound up, has cleared the money she put down and has now let the place for five years.

Tom Vivian is about to retire from Opie’s Hotel – he is the son of the genial Harry Vivian of the Commercial Hotel.

Mr & Mrs C.H. Ewins have returned from a holiday on Kangaroo Island, where they were guests at the boarding house of Ted Lockyer, who asked about all the Burra folk.

Mr & Mrs B.W. Pearse of Caroona have gone on a 12 month trip to the old country and the continent.

W. Pearce was elected auditor of Burra Council on Saturday.

The Fuss Bros are demolishing the building on the corner of Chapel & Commercial Sts, being the contractors for the new offices of Dalgety & Co.
