Burra Hospital

Several residents and groups have expressed concerns that the SA Health Commissionâ€™s Area Health Plans could result in the loss or reduction of obstetric, acute care and surgical services from Burra Hospital.  To date Burra Hospital personnel have received no information from the Health Commission on this.  Plans to reduce surgical and obstetric services in the Barossa Valley and Upper North Country Areas were met with strong opposition and were subsequently modified to the satisfaction of all concerned.  The Board of Burra Burra Hospital and staff concerned will reject any plans to remove or reduce present services.  Such moves would:

Reduce facilities, qualified staff and job opportunities and emergency services.

Reduce availability (or loss) of local medical practitioners.

Greatly increase travelling expenses and trauma for surgical and obstetric patients and their families.

John Chilton,

Secretary-Manager.
