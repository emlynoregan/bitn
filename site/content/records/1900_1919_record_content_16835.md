Burra Races last Wednesday were very successful and a credit to the officials, especially to the secretary, Billy Hardy.  They were held in Ted Finch’s paddock and a profit over £40 will result.  Last year the old club was resuscitated with some difficulty and a loss of £5 resulted.  This time there was a large attendance.  The main race was the Burra Handicap which paid £16 for 1st and was won by M.F. O’Dea’s Curate, which also won the Welter Handicap.

In the selling Hack Race, Mason, riding Miss N.M. O’Dea’s The Blackhawk pulled up most obviously to allow Mr A.T. Fairchild’s Honeyboy, ridden by Williams, to win.  The Blackhawk was disqualified and Mason has been banned from racing for 12 months.

The writer of the report wondered why so many police were at the track with such light work for them there, and why they didn’t stop the illegal betting that was going on.
