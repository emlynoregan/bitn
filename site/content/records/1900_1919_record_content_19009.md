The prospects of something being done are looking up and a more systematic development of the property is hoped for.  It was thought at first that the new company would keep the pumps going, but they will stop tomorrow.  All but three of the tributers have knocked off.  Had they been allowed to work systematically they would have returned some handsome profits, but they were limited to abandoned stuff.  ‘We say without fear of contradiction that the Burra Burra Copper Company has lost a golden opportunity in not allowing the tributers to develop the mine, and thus prove it at no cost, but a profit to shareholders and the sooner a revolution takes place the better it will be for the town.’
