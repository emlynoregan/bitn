Obituary.  Mrs Richards, wife of T.E. Richards of Hallett, died 11 September.  She was a life-long resident of the district and a very popular one, much sought after in cases of sickness or trouble.  In earlier years she was organist of the Methodist Church and her musical services were in great demand at social functions.  She was the daughter of the late A.J. & M. Williams and had first married the late Rev. J.M. Lucas.  A husband and five children survive: M. Elsie (Mrs W.J. Bald), Mr A.G. Lucas, and Austil, Clarice & Thomas Richards.
