Weather.  Last Wednesday a severe dust storm struck Booborowie, lasting from early morning til late evening.  Visibility was poor all day.  It is feared the wind will have shaken much grain from the heads.  Soil erosion is a growing problem in the district and an overhaul of agricultural methodology is clearly needed before the ultimate depletion of some of our best cereal producing land.
