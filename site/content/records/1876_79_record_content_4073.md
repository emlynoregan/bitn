Redruth Wesleyan Church. The anniversary services continued over the Queen's Birthday with a tea meeting. Rev. R.W. Campbell spoke on `American Backwoods Preachers.' Cash & promises amount to over £IOQ, reducing the debt on the chapel to about £490.

During the year £111 had been raised by subscription and £120 by the ladies' bazaars.

Bible Christian Schoolroom has been recently renovated at considerable expense. Its improvement was celebrated by a public supper and entertainment on Friday, proceeds to assist the improvement fund.
