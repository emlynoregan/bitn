Paull’s Mine.  Mr C.A. Fuss local director addressed local shareholders on Friday evening at Mr Winnall’s office and gave an interesting account of the mine’s present and future after spending some six weeks at the site.  He was there when the machinery started and has pushed work on in an extraordinary fashion.  Several lots of ore have been sent to Wallaroo and returns are anxiously looked for.  A vote of thanks was passed for Mr Fuss’s work.
