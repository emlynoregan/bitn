Burra High School Headmaster’s Report.

At the end of 1934 Miss Prior was transferred to Adelaide High school after four years at Burra.  Her place as Commercial Studies teacher was taken by Mr L.A. Braddock, who has proved to be a tower of strength.  This is the first time that a second male teacher has been appointed to this school.  Since two thirds of the students are boys, this in a desirable innovation.  Attendance this year has averaged about 49 compared with 44 last year.  Of the 44 on the roll last December, 36 re-enrolled in February, which is very pleasing.  The parents allowing children to leave as soon as they are 14, to swell the ranks of the unemployed, or to enter ‘blind-alley’ occupations, are few.  The 1st year class this year was small.  Last year five sat for the Intermediate and two for the Leaving Exam.  The results were very satisfying with five Intermediate Certificates and one Leaving Certificate.  These certificates were presented on Empire Day by the State Governor.

Intermediate Results

Joy Bentley 8 subjects with 2 credits

Clem Davey 7 subjects

Kathleen Drew 6 subjects

Jean Neil 5 subjects

Laurence Walker 1 subject to complete a certificate

Frank Pearce 6 subjects with 1 credit but no certificate (no English)

Leaving Results

Laurence Walker 5 subjects & certificate

Jack Pengilly 4 subjects (no certificate)

Joy Bentley completed the three year course in two years and yet got the best results, indicating outstanding ability.

This year ten sat for Intermediate, two more sat for individual subjects to complete a certificate and two sat for Leaving.

Sport has seen considerable activity this year.  On 30 March we went to Clare for tennis and cricket.  The boys were easily defeated in cricket, but the girls suffered only a narrow loss in tennis.

On 13 April in the return matches the boys were again defeated, but the girls won the tennis 10 sets to 2.

This year a sports day for our own students was an innovation and was a great success.

Senior Boys’ Cup	Warren Mumme

Senior Girls’ Cup	Joy Bentley

Junior Boys’ Cup	Laurie Bevan

[There is no mention of a Junior Girls’ Cup]

In the Combined Mid-Northern High School Sports on 11 September at Clare, the shield went to Kapunda for their sixth successive win.

The Governor, Sir Winston Dugan, attended the Empire Day celebrations and presented the University Certificates [Intermediate and Leaving] to successful students and Minda Badges to those who had collected most for that institution.  The recently purchased House Shield was presented for the first time and the Jubilee Portrait of HM the King [George V] was unveiled.

A hobby display was also arranged for this occasion.

On returning to Adelaide, His Excellency passed some very flattering remarks to the Director of Education, concerning what he had seen at Burra High School.

Other school activities included debating, a school magazine and students also took part in outside events such as the Empire Shopping Week Essay Competition, in which Burra High School students were successful in taking three of the top four prizes.

Joy Bentley got a gold medal for best essay.

Nancy Pearce came first in the Intermediate Division and won a gold medal.

Geoff. Rosman came second in the Intermediate Division and won a silver medal.

In the Royal Empire Society Competition five essays from Burra have been forwarded to London for final judging.  Those of:

Joy Bentley and Nancy Pearce in Division A

Brian Riggs and Ray Prior in Division B

Geoff. Rosman in Division C.

The inspectors have commented very favourably on the school.

Two members of staff will leave this year: Miss Parry and Miss Waterhouse have been transferred to Woodville High School.
