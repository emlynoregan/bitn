Mt Bryan Primary School will receive a £100,000 upgrade.  The new school of solid brick will replace existing buildings.  Solar water heating will be included.   The new building will comprise two learning areas, a resource room, a wet area and office and storage space.  The contract has been let to D.G & M.N. Benton of Booborowie.  Work will start soon.  Rising fuel costs have encouraged small school upgrades rather than bussing students to other schools.
