Danny O’Brien (Burra):

‘I remember sitting outside on the verandah and it was snowing.  We had the television on and my mum was so frightened she thought the world was going to end.  Mum always told me as a kid that the moon was made of cheese and I remember saying, ‘Hey mum I wonder if they’ll bring back any cheese’ and dad said, ‘Yeah, they’re clever, but I bet they won’t land on the sun.’
