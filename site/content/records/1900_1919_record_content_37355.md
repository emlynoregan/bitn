Salvation Army Harvest Thanksgiving was celebrated last Sunday.  Major Mackey came from Adelaide to conduct meetings and the services were crowded.

18 February 1884 was the date of the founding of the Burra Corps with Major Thurman and Captain Webber.  [The present officer seems to be Captain Steer.]
