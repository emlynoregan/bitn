Burra Golf Associates held their AGM on 25 September.

President Mrs M. Nicholls welcomed Associates.  The highlight of the season was Judy’s winning the Zone Silver Salver.  Another highlight was Burra’s win in the Pennant Competition after having played in it for years without a win.  Open Day entries were down and it was not a financial success, but it was enjoyable.  Congratulations go to the ‘A’ Grade Champion Mrs Jeffery, the ‘B’ Grade Champion Mrs Oates and ‘C’ Grade Champion Mrs Gebhardt.

Elected were: Patroness, Mrs A.L. Collins; President, Mrs M. Nicholls; Vice-Presidents, Mrs R. Wuttke & Mrs E. Jeffery; Treasurer, Mrs R. Gordon; Secretary, Mrs F. Reed, Assistant Secretary, Mrs E. Oates; Captain, Mrs D. Field and Vice-Captain, Mrs J. Oates.

The pennant was presented to Mrs D. Field, Captain of the Burra Team, at a social game at Clare on 26 September.
