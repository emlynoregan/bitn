Pte Hartley Harris writes from France dated 22 April.  He is presently with the 9th Battalion Band.  Their billets were shelled the day before and c. 30 were killed including three members of the band.  The letter was continued on 23 April, when two more bandsmen died and the band was broken up as a consequence.
