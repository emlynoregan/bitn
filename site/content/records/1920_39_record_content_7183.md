St Mary’s Church: Dedication of Memorial Windows

On 12 March at 3 p.m. a special service was held to dedicate three stained glass windows.

The first part of the report details the previous stained glass in the church.

In the chancel the stained glass window by Jones & Willis of London from 1892.  This is the McCulloch window representing the crucifixion.

A window to the memory of John Winnall in the chancel wall.  This is the oldest window dating from 1871 and was transferred from old St Mary’s on Limestone Hill.  [It honours John Winnall who died 16 July 1871.  It was made by Edward Brooks and installed in early 1873.]

In the transept the St Luke window is a memorial to Dr Nesbitt who died in 1894.  [It was made in 1895 by Montgomery & Grimbly of Adelaide.]

The St John window is in memory of John Sandland who died in 1909.  [Made by H.L. Vosz of Adelaide.]

The Martha & Mary window is in memory of Martha Lewis who died in 1894.  [Made by Montgomery & Grimbly in Adelaide in 1895.  Martha Lewis was first wife of the Hon. John Lewis MLC.]

The ‘Light of the World’ window [based on the Holman Hunt picture] was erected by Dr Carr [sic] to commemorate his wife Kathleen who died in 1911.  [Made by H.L. Vosz of Adelaide.  Note that the name should be Dr Caw.]

The Loving Shepherd window commemorates Alfred & Priscilla Barker and their grandchildren Priscilla Maude Maclean [d. 1867], Ella McLean [d. 1871] & Hector William Barker [d. 1887].  [The maker is not known.]

Three memorial windows were added on Sunday:

The St George window in the transept which reads: ‘AMDS and in loving memory of Morton Reginald Sandland, born at Koonoona Station and killed in action at Beersheba, on October 31 1917 aged 27 years.  Duty nobly done.’  [The maker’s name is not known.]

The great western window of over 150 square feet which is dedicated: ‘To the greater glory of God and in proud memory of Waldemar Robert Hawkes, and those brave and gallant heroes from this parish who gave their lives in the great war 1914-1919’

[This window has four main lights featuring St Edmund, St Alban, St Mark, St Andrew, St Michael, St George, St Faith and St Agnes.  There are also three smaller superior lights showing Samuel, David and a heavenly orchestra.  It was made by Jones & Willis of London in 1921.]

The St Peter window in the nave commemorates John Bailey who died 3 October 1913 and his wife Elizabeth Dinah Bailey who died 17 April 1920.  [Made by Jones & Willis of London in 1921.  John Bailey was a farmer at Gum Creek.]

The three windows are said to have cost together c. £1,300.

[Note the corrections and additions in this summary come from St Mary’s Church Burra – The First 150 Years by John Devenport.]
