New Wesleyan Chapel at Mt Bryan Flat was opened on Sunday 29 October.  Rev. S. Worth, formerly of the Kooringa circuit preached three sermons.  On Monday W.R. Ridgway presided at a public meeting after a tea.  The Kooringa Wesleyan Choir attended.  The congregations would not fit into the 20 ft x 30 ft x 14 ft high building, which cost Â£220.  A day school will soon be opened in the building.
