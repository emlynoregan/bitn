Red Tape.  J.V. Lord of Pine Valley Station recently needed a spark plug urgently for the engine used to pump water for stock.  He was instead sent certain forms to be filled out before he could be supplied.  We understand he was able to surmount his difficulties by other means before red tape left the sheep to perish.
