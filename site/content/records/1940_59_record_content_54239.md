Burra Hospital Finances are showing some improvements after months of detailed planning and care.  The Hospital received a special subsidy of Â£300.  The shortage of nurses and the collection of accounts remain problems.  The first is acute and no relief has been forthcoming.  A double or single certificated sister is urgently needed and also five or six girls to train.  The second difficulty is being tackled resolutely and more than 40 legal requests for payment have been made since October.
