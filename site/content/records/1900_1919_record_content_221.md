Burra Town Council

Tenders accepted for lamp lighting: H. Tiver in North Ward for £7-14-0 and W. Geake for two lamps in Kooringa for £13.  [Though the report says lamps for North Ward the sum involved suggests one.]

Burra Waterworks.  The level of water in the well remains about the same.  SAR is taking a considerable quantity.
