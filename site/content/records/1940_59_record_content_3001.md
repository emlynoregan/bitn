Mr & Mrs A.L. Bence held a flower stall in front of their premises on Friday and raised £2-6-0 for the Red Cross Ambulance Fund.

[This became a series of stalls over 15 Fridays run by the Bences and Red Cross, ending 15 November, with many contributors and was a very useful addition to the fund of £87-0-6.]
