Burra Hospital proposes a Palliative Care Suite.  Following completion of a Palliative Care Certificate Course by Director of Nursing Lesley Phillips and Clinical Nurse Consultant Cathy McPherson, the Burra Hospital not offers recognised Palliative Care.  The service will soon be further complemented by the completion of a new Palliative Care-Support Care Facility as part of a proposed $300,000 Hospital Building internal development program.  Burra Hospital Ladiesâ€™ Auxiliary has committed funds towards the Palliative Care project.
