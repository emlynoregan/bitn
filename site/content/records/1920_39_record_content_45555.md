Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co.  At 92ft level south drive has reached 163ft and started a rise to test a gold-bearing formation.  Values low.

At 52ft level south drive has extended to 84ft with little gold.  South drive off No. 3 winze extended to 28ft following a gold-bearing seam 18” wide.  Stoping from four faces above the 52ft level: three in low grade ore.  The 6cwt side-tipping truck in use on the 52ft level saves a lot of handling.

A new air main has been laid from the compressor throughout, which gives better pressure to machines.  So far no defined lode disclosed and values are erratic.

Golden Harp.  Shaft to 44’6” and close timbered.  Expect to open cut at end of coming week.

Wilton Hack, manager.
