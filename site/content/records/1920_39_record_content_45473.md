Burra Town Council, 20 March

Concreting required on the bridge near Mr Shortâ€™s at Aberdeen is to be done.

Cr Sampson gave notice to rescind the motion making Mr Voumard a casual worker.  He said the situation was awkward as Voumard now had to see to the horse practically in his own time.

The Mayor said a casual hand could be put to any work.  Ward balances were nearly exhausted. Voumard was paid 11/9 a day, which was 1/3 extra for feeding the horse.  It was a problem where they would get money from to pay the men for the next nine months.

Mrs Steven applied for permission to erect sheds to keep pigs in Aberdeen and apologised for having already erected them.

The Inspector said he had been favourably impressed with the arrangements.  Cr Bevan said he understood she had been granted permission to erect the sheds elsewhere and thought she could move them to her own property.  The Mayor disliked the site on hard rising ground with a house below.  In the end the permission sought was granted.
