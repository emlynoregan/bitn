The Burra Burra Mines

The 12th Annual Report of the Directors of the SA Mining Association has been published.  It is a cheering document with no indication that one of our greatest industries is showing any signs of decreasing.  The company’s prospects are brighter now than they were six months ago.  The price of copper in England has recovered to its position before the recent fall and even exceeded that point.  New and valuable lodes of ore have been discovered to be exploited simultaneously with this increased price of copper.  The Directors are so confident that they will pay on 3 June and again on 2 September next a dividend of 100%.  This they expect to do even if the copper price falls again, but there is no indication that is likely.

In the past six months 5,360 tons of ore were raised.  The average copper content was 24%.  Ore raised in the 12 months to 31 March was 10,450 tons.  The cost of raising it was £90,719 gross, or £8-13-8 per ton.  The amount realised was £186,278 gross or £17-6-6 per ton.  The total profit was £95,558, or £9-2-10 per ton.  To the total profits must be added £2,292 for rents etc. for an aggregate profit of £97,851.  The last three dividends have been paid from this and an outstanding balance, leaving the account £64,534 in credit.  When the produce now available is sold it is likely there will be an additional sum of £37,242 to be added to this, making a total profit of £102,776.

The Burra Company is now employing 708 persons.  Of these 693 are working at the Mines, 10 are at Karkulto and 5 in Adelaide.

In the place of the late Captain Allen Mr Thomas Graves has been appointed a Director and in lieu of Mr A. Jaffrey, who has left SA, Mr John Hector has been appointed.  Otherwise the group remains unchanged; the five retiring Directors all having been re-elected.
