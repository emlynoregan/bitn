‘Councillors say they are “full up of these corrobories [sic] and waste of time caused by one obnoxious individual.”

The editor then says he has received a number of disgraceful and abusive letters since refusing Hardy a position and ‘a postcard of recent date was not allowed to pass through the post office and which was subsequently forwarded to the Postmaster General.’

‘they could only emanate from a man of illiterate bearing.’

‘Councillor Hardy was so sorely disappointed at his meeting with adverse criticism and his feeble attempt to censure the chairman of the public works that he is trying to find fault with the report of that memorable meeting.’

Following the disturbance over the Waterworks engineer resulting in the Council’s paying £31 p.a. more: ‘We told him then to lay back and allow competent men to proceed.’

G)	Jan. 11 1893.  [This related to Hardy’s attack on the Town Clerk’s actions when a breakage occurred at the Waterworks.]

‘W.H. Hardy in his usual contemptible way . . . asked the Mayor who supplied the editor of the local paper with the news . . . ‘

‘it is foolishness for Councillor Hardy to try to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.’

H)	Jan. 11 1893.  [In Council proceedings the paper reported an attempt by Cr Hardy and Cr Kitchen to get the Waterworks engineer to personally pay for extra labour put on at the time of the breakage.  The passage most offensive to Hardy seems to have been: ‘This was in direct opposition to Cr Hardy’s wish, who for some unaccountable reason has not had a good word to say for the engineer since that time, consequently plots have been devised to oust him, but they have proved fruitless, though he has been the victim of a very unpleasant time.’

Mr Symon said he would show the statements made were justifiable and true.

Mr Hill would show, he said, that the private feelings of the writer had gotten the better of him and the attacks on Hardy were unwarrantable: hardy was merely trying to do his duty.

Hardy was then sworn in.

He gave evidence of having bought the papers concerned, though Mr Symon was continually interrupting and picking up Mr Hill on technicalities and trivial matters of law.  After considerable legal nitpicking it was avowed by Hardy that he did his best not to obstruct the business of the town.  Attention turned to his offer of services for 10/- per week.  The letter he wrote on this was produced and is reprinted.  It is dated 21 Sept. 1891.  He also said he made the same offer twelve months earlier.  A second letter of 25 Sept. 1891 is also reprinted.  Hardy denied he had offered to be a ‘general lackey’ on the paper.

Mr Symon, ‘What do you call it then?’

Mr Symon asked why Hardy had waited so long to bring action.  Hardy said it was the 5 October item that had been the last straw.

Symon remarked that there had still been a three or four month delay.

Hardy said he did not recall writing anonymous nuisance letters to Davey, but his replies about sending unstamped letters or open postcards reflecting on Davey were evasive with a series of answers like: ‘I don’t think so.’ or ‘I won’t swear I didn’t.’

Mr Symon then produced a letter which was sent by Hardy to Davey.  It is reproduced in the paper.

[The version in the paper had more elaborate underlinings.]

Symon asked if Hardy thought it abusive of the defendant.

Hardy said he did not especially intend it to be offensive and said he did not know what ‘Anguis in Herba’ meant.

Symon, ‘Did you think it meant ‘A snake in the grass’?

Hardy, ‘I don’t know.’

Symon, ‘Are you in the habit of writing things to people not knowing what they are?’

Hardy, ‘No.’
