Burra Hospital Cropping Project has received offers totalling 70 acres and some offers of labour, but more offers of labour, seed and super are still needed.  Chief Secretary, Sit Lyell McEwin has granted a subsidy on the new 50,000 gallon cement tank, which will be commenced shortly. The tender has gone to Concrete Tanks Ltd with A.L. Clode & Son to do the roofing and guttering.  It is hoped to have it ready for this winter’s rains.

Donors of land: John McBride (17 acres), Koonoona Proprietors (16-20 acres), Burt Broad (8 acres), Jack Terry (2½ acres) and Peter Drew (22 Acres).
