Burra Town Council, 31 March

Council will inspect the site of the proposed Road House at Burra North where B.H. Rogers seeks permission to remove 34 ft of kerbing so the area can be graded back to the petrol pumps, located 8 ft inside the boundary.  The area and about 100 square yards of the driveway are to be sealed later.
