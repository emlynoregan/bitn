Cr Dare said there should be a fire brigade.

The Town Clerk said he was the secretary and about the only one left of the brigade.  He would endeavour to get some men together.

Local board of Health.

The Central Board had sent 10 doses of influenza vaccine.  The Mayor had asked for 100.

Cr Radford said that in the event of an influenza outbreak they should be prepared.

Two tents have been sent to the hospital and in an outbreak the Town Hall would have to be used.

Cricket.  On 27 January Terowie 298 drew with Burra 7 for 136.

Women’s Christian Temperance Union continues to meet at Jubilee Hall.  At the meeting on 4 December there were 15 present and 12 attended on the 8 January.

Scout Hall.

On Saturday 1 February the Boys Recreation Hall was opened by the Mayor, Mr Crewes.  The day was extremely hot.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ band attended.  Scoutmaster Rigney described how when the troop was formed some three years ago they had met at the old White Hart Hotel, but this unfortunately burnt down.  They had then accepted Mr E.C. Sedgman’s offer of a room at the Waterworks Department for the next two years and now through the generosity particularly of Messrs James Reed & I.J. Warnes they had their own room.

Mr Crewes in opening the building said it had cost £395.  They had £200 of that and hoped before the day was ended to have raised the other £195.

After the opening a bazaar had been organised with stalls on either side of the room.  Mrs I.J. Warnes declared this open and together with the promenade concert in the evening £46 was raised.
