Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1937

W.E. Richards was Headmaster with L.A. Braddock, C.R. Isom, H. Simonds and Albert Swanson (Junior Teacher).  A Parents & Friends Association was established for the first time – 30 attended.  School uniforms were introduced.  There was a special assembly on 11 May to celebrate the Coronation of King George VI.  Mr Davidson relieved for two months during Miss Isom’s illness.  Burra hosted the Mid North Sports (which had to be postponed due to rain) and Burra won for only the second time.  (The previous win had been in 1929.)

1938

W.E. Richards was Headmaster with Lloyd Draysey, Marjorie Koehne, Marjory Edington and Beresford Pitman.  Enrolment was 68.  On 1 October a wireless and amplifier were presented to the school when the Minister of Education Hon. S. Jefferies and the Director of Education W.J. Adey attended.

[The money for the purchase had come from a combination of Departmental, School Council and Seaside Committee funds.]

(To be continued.)
