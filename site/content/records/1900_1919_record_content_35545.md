The American Boys.  There is a one-column article on how the boys are handling Aussie slang.  It is now interesting for the examples of outdated slang terms.

These boys were 47 members of Columbia Park Boys’ Club, San Francisco, who are touring the world for educational purposes.  They will arrive Saturday morning at 11.30, be welcomed at the Institute by the Mayor, Council, clergymen and residents.  They will then meet those who have offered to billet two each.  A football match will be put on in the afternoon.  In the evening in the Institute 42 performers will put on a show for their own benefit.  On Sunday morning there will be church and on Sunday afternoon a Grand Band Concert in Victoria Park at 4 p.m. where there will be a collection for Minda Home and to buy a convalescent chair for the hospital.
