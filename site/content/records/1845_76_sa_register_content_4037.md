‘Tre-Pol-Pen’ writes from Adelaide 18 October 1849.

[He writes in response to a letter that appeared in the Register on 22 September, in which he says William H. James attacked the present method of disposing of mineral lands in SA, without offering any practical method of improvement.]

The comparison with Cornwall is meaningless.  In Cornwall all the land is in private hands; while in SA most of the lands yet vest in the crown.  Anyway, what is the case in Cornwall – the discoverer does not get a bonus, nor does usage recognise any claim to a grant.  All is optional for the proprietor, who may work the ground himself, or he may delegate that power to others.  The discoverer never gets it unless it is a respectable company of adventurers, who undertake to work the discovery and pay to the proprietor a rent or rate of dues proportional to the produce raised.

In SA the discovery is actually in a better position.  He often has the opportunity of buying the land from the Crown at a comparatively nominal figure (never the case in Cornwall) and if he has no capital, he can still obtain that end by co-operation with other parties.  If the discovery is on private land he can proceed as he would in England.

The assertion that there are vast mineral deposits known, but kept secret in SA is all moonshine.  It is, after all, only in connection with capital that mineral property is rendered available and advantageous.  The discovery in itself is not the whole; the operations of extraction must be carried on.  Without capital, the ownership of mineral property would be an evil rather than a benefit, since such parties might choose to keep from the public the exploration of such minerals as would be of benefit to the general prosperity.
