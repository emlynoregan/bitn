Burra Greening Australia District Committee is seeking new members.  Chairman Dave Parnell said the group is planting the banks of the Burra Creek and are willing to plant trees on private land if the owners are willing to prepare the land, pay for the trees and care for them.  They recently planted trees on Bruce Stockmanâ€™s property.   So far they have planted some 550 trees.  The first Burra Tree Committee failed from lack of Council and other Government support and waning interest.  A new group was then formed as part of the Courthouse Co-op for the unemployed and the remaining members of that group were the nucleus for the Greening Australia group.  They had received a grant of $1,000 in 1984, which was used for a watering tank, tree guards and the Burra Creek project.  There is a core group of about 12 members who spend a couple of hours on Sunday afternoons to plant trees around Burra.
