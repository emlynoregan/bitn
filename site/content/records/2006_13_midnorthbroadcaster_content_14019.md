Farrell Flat Institute Hall Centenary

A very successful weekend of celebration was held on 28-29 January to mark the centenary of the laying of the foundation stone for the Farrell Flat Hall.  Over 600 people attended the events.  A plaque at the hall was unveiled by long time resident Clyde Atkins and a new heritage walk compiled by Laurel Neill and Sally Fieldhouse was launched.  Also launched was a 196-page pictorial history of Farrell Flat, Times Past, by local author and historian Gerald Lally.  The day was rounded off with an old time dance in the newly refurbished hall with local band Bold as Brass with MC Jack Kleinig.  About 90 attended.

On Sunday the Clare Valley Flying Group staged a fly over and the oldest living resident, Marie Abbott, who turns 100 in October, cut the birthday cake, assisted by 2012 Citizen of the Year, Lorraine Stevens.  The cake was cut with the trowel used 100 years earlier to lay the foundation stone of the hall. Visitors spent the day talking to old friends, taking the heritage walk and visiting the community garden and the private garden at the railway station.
