Burra Rifle Club.  AGM at Lord’s Burra Hotel on Saturday night.  Only 10 members attended.

The club is in a sound financial position.  The secretary tried to show that the club should carry on during the war rather than go into recess.  The support of the Pearse family from ‘The Gums’ is much appreciated.  [The nature of their contribution is covered in some detail in the report.]
