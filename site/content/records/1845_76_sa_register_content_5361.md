26 November

William Gibson was charged with stealing three money orders from George Evans.

Evans had received the money orders from the Patent Copper Company and that evening had gone to sleep under his dray with the orders in his trousers, which he placed under his head.  Next morning he found his trousers outside the tarpaulin and the orders gone.  He went to the Copper Company, got the numbers and reported them to the police.

Constable George Nixon found that an order for £9 had been changed that morning at Marks & Gollin’s store.  Mr Gollin accompanied him in a search for the man who had changed the order and was able to identify the prisoner as the person.  When arrested Gibson had on him orders for £6, £3, 2/6 and 7/5 in coins.

Bezaleel Gollin gave corroborative evidence.  He also said he gave the prisoner a £6 order in change, but was unable to identify the order found on Gibson.

Charles Mosebey, lodging-house keeper, said the prisoner, who had lodged with him in Adelaide, came to his house at about 6 a.m.  Mosebey refused to let him in until he had paid a debt incurred in Adelaide.  Gibson paid with an order for £1-17-6.  Witness paid the order away for some meat at Boord’s store.  Witness’s wife accompanied Gibson to Marks & Gollin’s store, where he paid for purchases with a £9 order.  The order produced was the same.

Edward Hall confirmed Moseby’s purchase at Boord’s store.

Gibson was remanded to the next day for further evidence.
