D.J. Dullea, manager for Bennett & Fisher confirmed the evidence of the £250 compensation.

Christina E.E. Robinson, wife of the plaintiff gave corroborative evidence.

Humphris said he had accepted £250 compensation and a stack of hay and was quite satisfied.  He said the plaintiff had come and the first thing he had said was ‘Are you going to buy these cows?’  When the defendant said he would not at the same price he had received the plaintiff got angry and asked who left the gate open in the paddock.  He said the plaintiff rushed at him and hit him with a right hand that just grazed his eye.  He then struck back in self defence.  Plaintiff got up and rushed at the defendant again and the latter struck him again.  Defendant’s wife then ran between them and Mrs Robinson said, ‘Stop hitting my husband.’  Defendant’s wife said, ‘He hit mine first.’

Humphris denied threatening Dullea if he gave evidence and denied swearing.

Lily Victoria Humphris, wife of the defendant gave evidence in corroboration of her husband’s account.

Frederick H. Greenfield, farm assistant, gave evidence supporting Humphris.

The bench awarded £50 damages.

Mr Winnall for the defendant said there would be an appeal.

The SM said there could be no appeal as regardless of who struck the first blow the defendant’s own testimony showed he was unnecessarily violent.
