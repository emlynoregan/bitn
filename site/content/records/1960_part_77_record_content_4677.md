Burra Small Bore Rifle Club

The official opening of the Small Bore Range was held on Saturday despite adverse weather conditions.  The SA and Australian Champions attended and the first possible for this range was fired by C. Lewis of Ramco over 25 yards.  About 70 people attended.  Captain of the Burra Club Mr R. Angel welcomed visitors.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone performed the official opening.  Afternoon tea followed.

Of the seven trophies being competed for on the day the SA Champion Mrs Barbara Pain won four, the Australian Champion Mr John Murphy won two and C. Lewis of the Morgan Club won one.

But as any one shooter could only claim one range trophy Mrs Pain had to concede the 75 yard trophy to V. Pfitzner of Pt Augusta West Club and she kept only the grand aggregate trophy and presented the 100 yard trophy to Mike Thomas, while the best Burra Club score in Night Aggregate went to J. Brown.

Mr Murphy retained only the afternoon aggregate trophy and gave the 50 yard trophy to Milton Mitchell.  Mr C. Lewis, who was best over 25 yards, presented his trophy to the highest Burra scorer in R. Angel.

Tuesday nightâ€™s best scorers were W. Corner, A. Angel and M .Mitchell.
