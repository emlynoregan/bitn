Military Entertainment.  This was a great success.  Mr Roach in particular is entitled to the credit for writing the libretto of The Vegetable King, which is a parody of The Flower Queen.  Proceeds were good and the only fly in the ointment was the behaviour of certain larrikins who should be made an example of.
