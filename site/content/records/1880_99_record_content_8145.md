Editorial on Municipal Topics.

Last year a scheme was suggested for borrowing of £2000.  This year opened with a debt of £850, which was paid off.  Spent this year:

South Ward	£744-13-6

Middle Ward	£357-13-2

North Ward	£475-19-10

Recreation Ground	£638-3-2

Total	£2216-9-8

A £100 bond was also repaid and £372 is in hand for the town survey.

£150 is in hand for works not begun or in progress.

The only real disappointment has been the cost of the Recreation Ground.

With the survey money and the £150 in hand there will be over £500 to be expended next year over the usual income, which will allow the maximum claim for Government subsidy.

We anticipate North Ward will have 	£285

Middle Ward	£310

South Ward	£275

But as South Ward owes Middle Ward £100 and the General fund £111-13-6 effectively it will change to:

North Ward	£285

Middle Ward	£410

South Ward	£64
