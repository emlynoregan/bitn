Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  Plans have been laid for the push on 13-17 January rather than the Australia Day long weekend.  Mr Chris Reed, one of the organisers, said they thought there would be too much going on at that date.  The committee is aiming to boost the prize money to $30,000.  If they are successful in getting sponsorship the first prize will be $10,000, with $3,000 for second and $2,000 for third.  There will also be a fourth prize of $1,000 and $500 for fifth.  $1,000 prizes will also be awards to the winning over-40 team, the service team, the all-female team and the under-17 team.  Second in each category will get $500.  An allocation of $5,000 for fun-runners has yet to be determined.  Mr Reed said the aim was to tie the event into the opening of the Broken Hill Mining Museum and the Burra Copper Interpretive Centre in the Bicentennial event.
