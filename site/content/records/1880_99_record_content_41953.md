Editorial on the Bon Accord Bridge.

The reply given by the Treasurer re a bridge at the Bon Accord ford indicates that he is satisfied that one is required.  Were he not it would hardly pay to obtain a report from the Inspecting Surveyor of Main Roads.  Mr Hargrave’s report recommends construction and gives the estimated cost as £1,100 in timber, or £1,460 in iron and that the latter is preferable in the long run.  The Treasurer replied that if it could be done for £1,000 maximum he would be prepared to go ahead with it.  A suggestion that the Council forgo the £300 annual road grant for one year to put towards it is penny wise and pound foolish as it would have to be made up later.
