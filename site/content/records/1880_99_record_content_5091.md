Burra Show, was held at the premises of the English and Australian Copper Co. [i.e. the Old Smelts Yard]

The day started fine and clear, but ended with squally showers with some small hail.  Attendance was nevertheless exceedingly large at almost 2,000 and the gate takings were over Â£56.  Generally it was a great success.  The main complaint concerned the narrowness of the passage between the areas where the horses, implements, and sheep were and that where the flowers, vegetables, dairy produce and fowls were displayed.

[Note no Chinese names in the vegetable section.]
