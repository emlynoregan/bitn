Burra Town Council, 15 September

Mr G.S. Hawker has been supplied with further information about the priority of the Saddleworth-Burra Road to enable him to question the Minister about it.

Council will support the Burra High School Council in getting the Education Department to support a Technical School at Burra to provide classes in Wool Classing, Dressmaking, etc.

A. Coverdale sought permission to place a swinging verandah on the western side of his shop.  He was asked to provide the specifications.

The Highways & Local Government Dept. advise of an increase in road grant from £21,000 to £70,000 and the sum of £236 to be allotted to the Corporation.

Cr T.H. Woollacott congratulated the Mayor on being elected President of the Mid-North Local Government Assoc. and the Town Clerk on being elected its Secretary.

The mayor invited all Councillors to the dinner he was giving to the representatives of the League of Wheelmen on Friday Night.

The Clerk reports an offer for seven cedar chairs belonging to the Town Hall.  Tenders will be called.
