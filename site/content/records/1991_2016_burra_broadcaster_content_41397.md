Maureen Wright was recognised in the 2016 Australia Day Honours List with an Order of Australia Medal (OAM) for her services to cartography and the community.  In 1973 Maureen and husband Barry undertook a fourteen month charting voyage along the River Murray from Renmark to Yarrawonga and in 1975 published the first of eight editions of River Murray Charts.  It has become the ‘River Bible’ for fellow boaters and has sold more than 70,000 copies.  Maureen has also served on countless committees, including:
