Football.  A match in fancy dress at Victoria Park on Wednesday created much fun.  It is reported in more detail on page 3 where it says Â£14-5-0 was raised for the Burra Benevolent Soc.  The Muffs 37 defeated the Association players 17.  There is a list of players and how they were dressed.  There would seem some irony in R. Gully appearing as a policeman.  [Personal note: C. Fuss was a coachman.]
