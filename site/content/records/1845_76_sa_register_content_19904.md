Kooringa News, 19 October

About 30 people assembled at the Burra Hotel last Monday 15 October to hear Mr McCulloch declared elected unopposed as the new member for the District of Burra in the House of Assembly.

Michael Manning, who had been charged last week with stealing 26 [uncertain – the figures as printed are blurred] of Mr McCulloch’s sheep, was discharged after providing evidence that he obtained them legally.

The road between Kooringa and Yarwood is in a deplorable state.  Accidents like broken axles are frequent.  It is to be hope the Central Road Board will act because the north and north-eastern traffic is compelled to use this road.  [Yarwood was a few miles down to road towards Sod Hut and Black Springs.]

Weather.  Splendid rains fell in the past week.

Special services for the Bible Christian Missionary Society were held last Sunday and Monday.  On Sunday three sermons were preached by Rev. R. Lang of Auburn.  On Monday about 200 persons attended a public tea and at 7 p.m. there was a public meeting addressed by Revs Lange, Warner and Allen.
