Robert Sanders of the Burra Mine also writes on the same topic.

The statements made by your correspondent are quite uncalled for and as the representative of SAMA and as manager of their property in this neighbourhood I emphatically deny the statements in your correspondent’s letter.

The Reverend preacher has never made application to me or to any official of the company, on the subject of sanitation.  Neither has anyone in authority found fault.  I challenge  anyone to show anywhere in SA where an equal number of working men and their families have so much room for each individual and where the sanitary condition of a township is superior to that of Kooringa.  On a previous occasion Paxton Square was denounced as a hotbed of sickness.  Bur here there are 33 houses, containing 91 rooms varying from 17  ft  by   15 ft to 14 ft square and 10 ft high under the ceiling, in which reside 161 adults and children.  The place has been pronounced by everyone else the most healthy, most roomy and best ventilated houses and there has been less sickness and death in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in any other part of the neighbourhood.  The company’s houses compare favourably with workmen’s houses belonging to other people in the neighbourhood or to any other place in the colony.

As for the system of allotments allegedly cut up by speculative owners: has not a company an equal right to charge a fair value on their property and choose, or refuse to sell or lease, as any private individual has?  The township is not in fact cut into insignificant fragments.  Each house built by the company has a greater piece of land than the houses in the Government Township of Redruth, or in Aberdeen.  Anyone can have 1, 2, 3 or 4 allotments if he wishes to purchase them.

The company is far from illiberal.  It has given land to every section of the Christian church, sufficient to build a place of worship and a minister’s residence.  Also it has given a cemetery, a slaughterhouse site, an acre for an Institute, land and buildings for use of a hospital (valued at £650) and has just given an acre to the Church of England for a place of worship, which at prevailing prices is worth £525.  Also it has given land for a main road towards Baldina and is about to give land for a public school and playground for 1,000 pupils.  These facts speak for themselves.

I am sorry anyone should so far forget themselves as to denounce a company which has done so much and is still doing so much good for the community.

Our pay sheet is at present about £28,000 per annum, the greater part of which is spent in these townships.
