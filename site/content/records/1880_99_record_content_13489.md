Editorial on The New Ministry.  Parliament adjourned for two weeks so the Government could formulate its policies, which the editor thinks will be difficult, given the contradictory stance of its individual members.

2nd Leader on one policy almost certain to be agreed upon - the construction of a railway line from Terowie to the NSW border near Silverton.

From Terowie the line would be 145 miles.

From Burra direct it would be 167 miles.

From Burra via Terowie is 185 miles: the direct route saves 18 miles.

The direct route suggested runs 7 miles to the east from Burra and then northeast via the main woolsheds: North Dam (60 miles from Burra), Government Dam (67 miles), Anamba Well (107 miles).  We are satisfied a Burra line would be the best, but now it seems only the Terowie line will be surveyed.
