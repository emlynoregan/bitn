Characteristics of the paper in 1977.

The paper seems to have had local correspondents and to have reported sporting results if and when they were sent in.

Burra news is regular, but generally very brief.

The Council and Burra School affairs are covered regularly, but briefly.

The ‘Out and About’ column continued as in the Burra Record, but usually in a shortened format.

Major events like the Copper Festival received adequate photographic coverage, but scant description.

Although I have not noted sports results, they seemed to me to be far less complete than in the Burra Record.

The quality of the photographs is poor.

The paper usually had 12 pages, but was sometimes large.

There was no improvement in spelling, especially of people’s names.

My impression may be biased, but it seems to me there was better coverage for the Peterborough, Jamestown and Orroroo areas.  Whether this was due to a lack of reporting from Burra or from editorial decisions later in the process, I cannot say.
