Burra Hospital Board meeting 2 February.

A letter from the Local Board of health was discussed.  In the past 12 months £40 has been spent on mosquito proofing the hospital and its drainage vents.  A new pit is being dug to combat excess overflow from the kitchen and laundry.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the work of Mr H.C. Atkins, who is now severing his association with the board.

Mr & Mrs H.C. Atkins were given a farewell at Farrell Flat on Tuesday at the Farrell Flat Hall.

Mr Glen Hawkes returned from the city to chair the meeting, which began with a concert program.  Mr Hawkes said that Mr Atkins had arrived there in about 1898-99 and took up land when the Old Koonoona blocks were cut up.  Mrs Atkins had been born in the district.  They had worked hard and not spent their income in riotous living, so that now they were able to retire in comfort.  Mrs Atkins had always played a prominent part in district affairs and Mr Atkins had been most active in public and sporting affairs.

Mr R. Mickel spoke on behalf of the Farrell Flat District, Mr J.M. Howard for the Porter’s Lagoon Tennis Club and the Cavandale Tennis Association.  Mr E.B. I’Anson said Mr Atkins had been a founder member of the Boat Club and its president for 18 years and had aided it financially.  [The club was financially sound in 1945, but was in recess until the drought broke and there was more water in the lagoon.]

Mr H.R. Piggott spoke on behalf of Porter’s Lagoon residents and other speakers were Messrs Matt Smith, G. Neill and S.C. Genders.

Mr Atkins was presented with a wallet, Mrs Atkins with a silver tray and Miss Atkins with a table mirror.  Mr Atkins and then Mrs Atkins responded to their well-wishers and Miss Atkins followed.
