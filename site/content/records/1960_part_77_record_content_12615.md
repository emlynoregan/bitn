Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1945

The staff comprised H.O. Pederick Headmaster, G.W. Owen, M.C. Spark, E. Maddern & K. Parkinson (Junior Teacher).  The enrolment was 47.  During the year K. Butler replaced M.C. Spark and G.W. Owen, who were transferred.  In April plans were prepared for building a new residence for the High School Headmaster.

1946

The staff were Hubert O. Pederick Acting Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, Kath Butler, Joan Tapley & Colin Laubsch (Junior Teacher).  Enrolment was 72 – an increase due to a new Hallett bus run.  The Parents & Friends Association held its first Annual Ball in the Town Hall to raise funds for the school.  Profits were £15.  Dr Steele, who was the first President of the High School Council and who had held office for 26 years, left the district.  One of the school houses was called ‘Steele House’.  The other was named Draysey House in honour of a previous Acting Headmaster who gave his life during air operations in WWII.
