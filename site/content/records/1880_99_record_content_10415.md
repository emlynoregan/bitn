The Public Meeting at the Institute on Wednesday had the Mayor in the chair.  The 1st motion approving the Govt’s taxation policy was moved by Cr Sampson.  The poor paid more than their due through customs duty and a tax on real and personal property would be fairer.  Cr Ward 2nd.  Though imperfect this was a move in the right direction said Mr Holder.  As the 1st £500 was exempt it did not fall on the poor and at 8/4 per £100 over that, it was not excessive.  P. Lane also thought it imperfect, but supported the principle.  Carried with one dissention.

F.W. Holder then moved the meeting agree with the abolition of school fees in state schools, which fell most hard on poor families with many children.  The taxes proposed should easily cover the £22,000 to £24,000 collected in fees.  Also the present exemptions often went to the wrong people.  2nd Cr Brown and carried unanimously.

Cr Geake moved that the meeting disapproved of the present migration policy, which saw £30,000 to £40,000 spent to bring out migrants who then moved to other colonies.  Also at present many men were out of work, yet migrants were arriving.  He favoured free passage to those nominated by friends here.  2nd Cr Rayner and carried nem. con.

Rev. S. Knight moved the meeting endorse the Hon. J. Colton’s action in favouring the proposals of the Social Purity Society.  Dr Brummitt 2nd.  Carried.

Rev. S. Knight moved the meeting endorse the reading of selected passages of scripture in state schools without explanation.  Mr Kitchen 2nd.  R.W. Mathews supported and W. Pearce, P. Lane, J. Sampson jnr and W.F. Coglin opposed.  Carried by 2 votes.
