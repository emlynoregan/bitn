Ray Jennison reflects on 13 years as a Councillor

In that time Local Government has undergone many changes.  Most significant were the granting of adult franchise and the recognition by State and Federal Parliaments of Local Government as the third tier of government in Australia.  Local Government now receives 2% of total Australian personal income tax revenue as an untied grant each year.  The Federal Grants Commission assesses each Council on a needs basis and for 1981-82 the Burra Burra DC will receive $118,000.  These two factors brought more responsibilities, such as planning, community development, health and welfare, libraries, environment, tourism, fires and emergency services and the arts to add to the traditional Council worries over rates, roads and rubbish.  I believe the changes have been for the better in that they have given local communities more say in fashioning their life styles.

The opportunity to really lift our district came in 1969 with the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils.  The new Council could rationalise staff and speak with a more powerful voice to State and federal Governments.  The foresight of the Town Council in acquiring the old Burra Mine site paid a bonus in 1970 when SAMIN re-opened the copper mine and we were able to receive royalties.  This enabled the Council to build the new Civic Centre and purchase the Tourist Office site – both of which are proving their worth to the district.  The building of the Community School has strengthened community feeling and brought a new depth to our lifestyle.  Along with it came the closing of the Institute Library and the establishment of the Community Library.  Another important event was the Burra Conservation Study and its recommendations have been adopted by our Planning Committee as the basis for development and conservation of this historic, heritage rich district.  These changes made Council aware of the need for greater input from the community, resulting in the formation of the Burra District Advisory Committee.

Many impressive projects have been started or completed in the last 13 years:

Sealing of the Burra-Spalding Road

The Burra Oval watering scheme

The common effluent drainage scheme

The Tourist Office

The Pest Plant Control Scheme

Building the Civic Centre and the District Clerk’s residence

Raising the district contribution enabling us to have a full size sports stadium [i.e. at BCS]

The Community Library

Sealing streets in Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat

Purchase of land for an 18 hole golf course

Building six new tennis courts

And about to commence is a new Sports Complex at the Burra Oval.

I consider it a privilege to have been able to work in this fulfilling role and wish the new Councillors well.
