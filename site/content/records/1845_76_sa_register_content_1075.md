28 November 1846, page 4

A Visit to the Northern Mines of SA

We started from Adelaide in a rather extraordinary looking covered vehicle, ponderous and springless with three horses abreast.  We left at 2.30 p.m. Thursday 12 November and headed north on the great North Road.  Beyond the windmill there is a very pleasant-looking road-side inn and at the little village which has grown up in the Pine Forest we saw several neat and almost genteel residences.  The Primitive Methodists have a neat chapel there, which is well attended.  Further on there is a neat and commodious inn kept by Mr Isaac Jepp and near it a steam flour mill, at present unemployed due to the recent bursting of its boiler.  The projected stone bridge over the Dry Creek is as yet only a pile of stones and the apologetic present bridge on a circuitous road into Dry Creek Village is a sad affair.  Not so the inn of Mr & Mrs Smith, which is ‘in such deserved repute’.  The traveller on the road to the Little Para is surprised to see the number of wildly circuitous tracks [needed to avoid boggy patches.]
