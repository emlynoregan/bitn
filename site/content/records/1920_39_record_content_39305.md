Obituary.  Mr George March died in Burra Hospital 15 September of heart trouble after a short illness.  He was born at Kanatta Station on 2 August 1861, the second son of the late Mr & Mrs William March.  He was educated at the late Mr J. Fogg’s school in Kooringa and at 12 went to work for W.H. Banks at the Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel).  His first job was chaff cutting (horse drawn) on the site of the Kooringa Service Station and he then went to drive for Mr Banks at the brewery – mostly around Burra and to Eudunda.  He later worked for Messrs W. Symons & E. Ellery as a bullock driver and a dam-sinker on Boolcamatta Station.  Later he worked for T. Thorington & J.V. Lord dam-sinking at Buckalow Station before going to Broken Hill, returning to Burra in 1893.  He then was a cab-driver for 33 years before retiring five years ago.  He was a devoted member of the Methodist Church and a member of the Foresters Lodge where he was a Past Chief Ranger and a trustee.  He never married and is survived by his brother Mr William March.

[George Edwin March.]
