Burra Town Council, 1 March

Sara & Co was granted permission to erect another bowser.

The Director of Australian War Trophies sent the agreement which the trustees of the guns had signed.

Their duties were to receive, permanently house, pay freight and arrange the handover to the town.

The Town Clerk held that the handover had taken place, but there was no minute to show it.

Messrs Woollacott and Pearce were granted permission to build a house for Messrs Bagg Bros. in Paradise.

J. Edgar Pearce’s tender to build the shelter shed for £33-12-6 was accepted provided it included painting.

A.A. Nankivell’s offer of a ¼ acre in Chapel St for a public pound for £60 was refused.

Various road matters and problems at Victoria Park etc. were discussed.

Cr Kellock moved that the resolution to shift the guns from Market Square be rescinded.

The debate focused upon what was then to be done.

Cr Harris wanted the opening between the Memorial and the Rotunda maintained, as it was much used.

Cr Woollacott did not care one way or the other, but wanted the guns to have a proper place and to be looked after wherever that place was.  He thought a public meeting was in order and the motion might lie on the table till then.

Cr Kellaway favoured instead a conference between the RSA and Council.

Cr Riggs favoured, if the motion to move the guns were rescinded, a special rate in 1927 to enclose the guns and mount them decently.

After exhaustive discussion to little purpose the motion was put and lost, which meant a similar motion cannot be put for 12 months.

It was resolved to meet with the RSA.

It was also resolved not to ask the trustees of the guns to attend that meeting.
