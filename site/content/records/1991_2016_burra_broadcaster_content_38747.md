Droughts pose particular problems with 1995-2009 particularly difficult.  Succession planning in those years has enabled Ryan to return to the property from a position in Kalgoorlie as a diesel mechanic.  John is a founding member of the Burra Rangelands Action Group, which addresses such things as feral goats, rabbits, foxes and weeds.  It involves 26 landowners in an area stretching from 50 or 60 km north to south and 20 to 30 km east to west.

The Riley Car Club currently has c. 70 vehicles touring the Burra District.  They will continue to Pt Augusta on 7 August and from there will farewell 27 of the cars heading north on a ‘Rileys Through the Red Centre’ run – a south to north crossing of the continent.
