Editorial comment on Cr Harris.

‘Cr Harris, at the last meeting of the Burra Town Council, said he hoped the newly elected member would prove a better man than his predecessor.  Dirty work!  Fancy saying that when he is hundreds of miles away.  He wouldn’t dare say it to his face, but its [sic] only Alex. Harris, you know.  He is a professional at that sort of business.’

[This comment by the editor would seem to give grounds for a possible court case and in the issue of 7 November he wishes to ‘unconditionally withdraw every reflection in the paragraph and apologise to him for having published it.’]
