The Rail Service

SAR says it cannot run a train to Burra on Wednesday and Saturday mornings due to coal shortages and lack of staff.  Cr Baulderstone says running a railcar just in front of the Broken Hill Express three nights a week hardly fits with this excuse.

Cr Woollacott sympathised with the SAR.  With increased road competition the railways had decided to run the Broken Hill train as an express to Burra, reaching here in three hours.  Other towns along the line were served by the railcar.

Cr Baulderstone said in his opinion it would be sensible to cut out one railcar from before the express and run it on Wednesday and Saturday mornings.

The Commissioner will be asked to reconsider his decision.
