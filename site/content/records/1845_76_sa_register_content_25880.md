Survey of Lands East of Burra.  SA Parliament.

Mr Rees moved that in view of the unemployment levels all the lands currently in the World’s End, Cowper’s, Barker’s and Hallett’s Runs be thrown open to selection.  He said the land in question had been discussed before and the Government was opposed because the land was outside Goyder’s Line of Rainfall.  Recently the Treasurer had said he had no objection to throwing open the land, but he predicted if people took it they would be ruined.  Rees thought his constituents would take the risk and the Government had no right to dictate what they were able to do in that regard.  He pointed out how wrong earlier prognostications had been about the land around Burra and Mt Bryan.  The squatters said the land was sterile and they had lost money there.  The Government would be doing them a favour in resuming it if that were the case.

[Rees then cited a number of wonderful results from experimental plantings on land beyond Goyder’s Line, but contiguous with that already released.  Mr Pearce seconded the motion and spoke in support.  He said it was necessary to open as much land as was suitable for growing wheat between Kapunda, Burra and the Murray Flats.  The land in question was suitable when there were easterly rains.

The Chief Secretary, Hon. A. Blyth said there was never a time in the history of the colony when there were so few unemployed.  The survey would be illegal as the lands were not included in the Bill.  He hoped the hon. Members would support the Government in abolishing the line of rainfall.]
