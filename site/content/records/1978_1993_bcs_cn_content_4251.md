Jubilee 150 Meeting

Although this was poorly attended several interesting proposals were discussed:

Mrs Pam Marlow has agreed to supervise the construction of a large scale model of the Burra Mine at the height of its operation.

A detailed display outlining the development of the merino stud industry was also suggested.

The retention of the manual switchboard at its present site and the addition of materials that would highlight the history of the manual telephone system.
