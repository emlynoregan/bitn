Burra Burra Show Inc.

At the AGM on Friday in Pearce’s Building Glen Finch Jnr was elected President in place of A.B. Riggs.  The show date was set for 8 October.  Various routine matters were discussed.

There was no profit or loss last year.  Receipts had been £1,150-13-11 and surplus assets are worth £4,300.  Elected were: Patron, A.G. Owen-Smyth; President, Glen Finch Jnr; Vice-Presidents, F.H. Reed & J.M. Jacka.  The President reported on the last show of 9 October 1948.

When materials become available sheep pens will be the first priority.  Entries in 1948 were up to standard and flowers were exceptional and there are moves to provide more space in pavilion number 2.  Dairy products were low.  Ring events were very good.  School work was very pleasing.  Outside industrial exhibits were disappointing.  Sheep shearing display was much appreciated.  During the year we disposed of the balance of the galvanised iron fence for a little over £200, which reduced the overdraft by that amount.  Income matched expenditure so that overall the society was £200 better off.  The new secretary R.E. Angel began work on 1 July.  The old show office changed hands and we have moved to Pearce’s Building at a higher rent.
