Burra Town Council, 5 January.

Crs Sampson, Symons & Coglin voted against accepting the minute of the last special council meeting.  Cr Sampson said the minute did not record what objections he had to the report. [Apparently a report of the Salaries Committee.]  The Mayor said he had invited Cr Sampson to add his protest at the foot of the report, but it had not been done.  Cr Sampson pleaded lack of time to do so.  The Mayor accused Cr Sampson of childish behaviour. (‘It was like child’s play to act in this fashion.’)  Cr Sampson threatened ‘an unhappy year’ if he was not accommodated.

Cr Ridgway said something inaudible.

Cr Sampson complained that Ridgway had said he was no gentleman.  [The reporter says that Ridgway had not said that.]
