‘Federation’ writes questioning some proposals to reduce tariff protection.  It would certainly throw even more men out of work and the benefits to consumers would be limited.  [Despite this he goes on to cite a string of problems that are really attributable to the way in which Australian industry was protected.]  The problems as he saw them owed their origins not to the tariff, but to abuse of the tariff.
