Obituary.  Frederick C. Custance died 3 or 4 June near Olary.  He was the manager for Vrai Ltd of Torrensville and was returning from demonstrating a tractor on Teleeche Station when his car broke down six or seven miles from Olary.  Trevor Hawker stayed with the car and Mr Custance went for help.  He seems to have been taken suddenly ill about 1Â½ miles from Olary and Mr Hawker found his body on the roadside the next morning.  He had served with the air force abroad in the Great War and was one of the first to fly in SA about 15 years ago.  He had been manager of Vrai Ltd for several years and before that had been the Burra Branch manager for Vivian Lewis Ltd.  He is survived by a widow and one child.

[Frederic Cyril Custance died 3 June 1923 aged 33.]
