Sir Henry Ayers had twice been written to about ground for the cemetery and a favourable reply might be anticipated. 
He was not sure they could get a Town Clerk, Inspector and Surveyor all for £100 p.a.  A ratepayer complained that he could have done much better and saved a lot of money, but in fact the ratepayer was one of those who had cost the Corporation so much money in the first 18 month’s of the Corporation’s existence. 
He then gave some figures relevant to the Corporation’s first 18 month’s. 
Rates Received 	£602- 5- 6 
Returned through the action of ‘these men’ 	£164-13- 2 
Balance 	£437-12-3 
Licences 1877 	£174- 3-6 
Licences 1878 	£97-18- 0 
Court Fees 1877 	£21-18- 6 
Court Fees 1878 	£11- 5-0 
Slaughterhouse 	£55- 6-4 
Grant-in-Aid 	£178-13- 1 
Private Subscriptions 1877 	£53- 5- 6 
Private Subscriptions 1878 	£31- 1- 6 
Fine on Contract 	£5- 0- 0 
[Total] 	£1828- 14-0 	* 
[*This figure doesn’t seem to me either to add up or to make any sense. The total 
approximates what you get if you add up the whole list of the numbers above including the 
balance in line 3 — which is also a penny out.] 
Due to Cemetery 	£222- 3-10 
Expended on Public Works 1876 & 1877 	£337-11- 8 
Expended on Public Works 1878 	£226-16- 9 
Legal Expenses (Caused by ‘these same men’) 	£107- 2-10 
General Expenses 1876-77 (18 months) 	£614-19- 0 
General Expenses 1878 	£316- 5- 4 
Slaughterhouse 	£45- 6- 9 
Purchase of Slaughterhouse 	£35-18- 3 
[Total] 	£1854- 0- 7 	* 
[*This figure also doesn’t seem to add up to me either.] 
This shows the ‘loss to the town through these Robinites’ 
They had stopped the town undertaking public works in 1876 of £123-19-1 and in legal costs had used £107-3-10, which if devoted to public works would have attracted a similar sum in Govt. subsidy and so in all had cost the Corporation £214-7-8. They had prevented £160 from being collected in rates which doubled is £320. [i.e. if it had attracted the Govt. subsidy.]  In total these men had cost the Corporation a total of £658-6-9, all due to spite the Ex-Mayor and 2 or 3 councillors. He then addressed a ticket which called on voters ‘don’t vote for Nesbitt because he has said that though the working men would vote for Lipsett all the respectable people were on his side.’ 
‘Dr Nesbitt had said he did not say so but he did. Then he had tried to soft soap them by telling them they were all respectable but they would not swallow all he said they new [sic] that if he were not in his present position he would pass them like dirt in the street.’ (He then attacked the Nesbitt claim that all thought and acted as Lane — i.e. that Bath = Lane & Lipsett = Lane.) Nesbitt, he said, was brought there by a party.
