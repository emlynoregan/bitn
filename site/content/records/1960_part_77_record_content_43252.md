Burra Primary School.  With Progress Certificates dropped this year, the Year 7 students will have no Passing Out Ceremony, but have been spending half an hour a day for some days at the High School.  There will be a Grade 7 social tonight.  Inter-school sports were played on Monday.  Some students have been acquiring swimming certificates and the Primary School Swimming Carnival was held today.  On 18 December a Christmas service will be conducted and class parties will follow that.  The last day of school on 19 December will be busy generally tidying up the place.
