Last Sunday the anniversary of the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel was celebrated.  Preachers were Rev. H. Cole of Strathalbyn and resident minister Rev. J.D. Whittaker.  There was a full attendance on each occasion.  On Monday the usual tea meeting drew so many that four sittings were needed.  About 400 were catered for.  At the public meeting many were compelled to stand.  Rev. Whittaker announced that this would be his last anniversary here as he was leaving the colony for New Zealand in about eight weeks.  The amount raised during the services was £55-17-11½, reducing the debt to £210.
