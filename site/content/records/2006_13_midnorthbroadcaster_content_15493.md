Inspirational Speaker Michael Crossland held students from year 7 to 12 spellbound last Tuesday morning at BCS.  He explained his lifelong battle with cancer.  He was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer of the central nervous system before he was 12 months old, but has battled the odds to become a successful baseball player and to create a business career in finance.  He has been an ambassador for Camp Quality and the Cancer Council and in 2002 was nominated for Young Australian of the Year.
