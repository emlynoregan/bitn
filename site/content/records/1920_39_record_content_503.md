The Burra Cup was run on 7 February.  The report extends for 2⅓ columns.  This year it was decided to increase the stakes from £150 in 1919 to £350.  The course was improved with a rail all round it costing £80 (mostly paid for by donations).  Everything was painted and the grass made to grow as never before.  Nominations totalled 130 or an average of 26 per race plus 20 for the Welter and 30 for the Trials, or 184 in all.  There were 144 acceptances.  Thirty-five new stalls were erected.  The prize money was increased to £375.  The day’s weather was excellent and all was spick and span.  At least 120 cars arrived.  The Hon. J. Lewis had been attending Burra Races since 1858 and had never seen such a crowd, which was estimated at 4-5,000.  The only unfortunate incident for the day was the fall of Third Degree in the Hurdles, resulting in a broken leg and he had to be shot.  Over £4,000 was placed with the totalizator, but not nearly enough men were there to cope with the crowd and probably £1,000 was not placed as a consequence.  The huge crowd created some shortages and inconveniences, but the meeting was a huge success.  Excellent music was provided by the Burra Brass Band under Bandmaster Meadowcroft.  Total gate money was £277-6-4.  Entry fees and nominations made £165.  The booth run by Mr C. Lee brought in £30, Race cards raised c. £20 and the Totalizator commission c. £300.  A good profit should therefore result.  The Burra Cup was run over 1¼ miles and was won by N. Krogdahl’s Dimitol ridden by Dally with W.A. Tennant’s Sheichen second and J. Cumming’s Malt Lass came third.
