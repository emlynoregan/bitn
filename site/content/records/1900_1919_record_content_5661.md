The hymns being learnt for the occasion by the choir, led by Mr N.J. Tiddy, are:

All people that on earth do dwell.

Blow ye the trumpet, blow.

The Churchâ€™s one foundation.

How charming is the place.

For the beauty of the earth.

Jesu, lover of my soul.

Was there ever kindest shepherd

Onward Christian soldiers.

Rejoice the Lord is King.

Through the night of doubt and sorrow.

See how great a flame aspires.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me.

Give me the faith which can remove

Forward! Be our watchword.
