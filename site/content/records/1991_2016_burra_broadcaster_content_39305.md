North Booborowie School Reunion was held on 4 May.  About 60 people attended the event in the Booborowie Bowling Clubhouse.  The school was opened on 29 April 1914 and closed in August 1965.  It was built to cater for 50 students, but had only 5 when it closed.  They were transferred to Willalo Primary School.  [3 photos.]
