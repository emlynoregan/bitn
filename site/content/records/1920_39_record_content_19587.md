Kangarooing.  There is a â…” column article explaining why the irresponsible shooters have caused pastoralists to ban kangaroo shoots on their properties.  Bullets have been flying recklessly past workers on properties; vehicles are driven at dangerous speed through sheep with lambs and in rough country.  Sheep are dying from stress and lambs are separated from ewes.  Fences are cut and knocked down and dead kangaroos left anywhere, sometimes within 300 yards of houses with resultant stench and blowfly breeding.  Permission can still be sought and obtained for responsible hunting.
