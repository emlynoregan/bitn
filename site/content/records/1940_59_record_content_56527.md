Burra Burra DC, 6 October

The Secretary of the Gum Creek School Committee thanks the Council for assistance in improving the schoolyard.

H.L. Foote advises he has arranged a working bee for the new roadway on the eastern side of the railway line at Mt Bryan for 22 October.

N.A. Mickel requested conveniences at Porter Lagoon, given its popularity in the summer months.  Council considered this was a matter for a sporting club as they had no one who could be responsible for maintaining conveniences in this locality.

The Highways & Local Government Department advised it was policy to refuse permission for any hoardings on main roads and requested the removal of any in position.

Burra Rifle Club.  On Saturday the 2nd Match No. 4 District Union Shoot took place.  Burra riflemen had a bye and shot on their home range.  Best results were from D.H. Field, T. Heinrich & T. Lynch.
