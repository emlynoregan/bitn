Salvation Army.  There was tea and supper and ‘a big go’ 22 & 23 July.  Major Dean, in charge of the Northern Division, and Divisional Accountant Capt. Bull visited.  Despite rain there was an afternoon open-air service and then a meeting at the barracks.  Monday was more conducive to open-air meetings after which there was tea at the barracks.  £18 profit resulted.
