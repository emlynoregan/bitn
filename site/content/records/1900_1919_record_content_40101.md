The overseer said he had not given anyone authority to raise over their allocated quantity, but it was common practice by tenderers on the off-chance that it would be taken over by Council.

Cr Killicoat asked if the metal from the big Aberdeen Quarry was worth the extra money paid for it.

The overseer said it was worth an extra 1/- [a yard?] for its wearing qualities.

Cr McBride said the street lights were unsatisfactory and it was decided that the overseer would overhaul each lamp and then supervise their lighting for one month.
