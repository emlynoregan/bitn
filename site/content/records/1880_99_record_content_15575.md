R.Z. Jones replies to Mr Cave with some re-workings of the figures, which purport to show that the town would be better off with his slightly lower assessment than with Mr Cave’s.  He does it by calculating the amount the fees charged by each would represent in the assessment and by deducting that from the assessment, where as Cave deducted their respective fees from the revenue raised.  Since he charged £12 and Cave charged £35 he comes out on top in his calculations.
