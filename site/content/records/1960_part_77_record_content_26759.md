Theft.  Entry was gained to the Burra Primary School through an open window and then a window in the headmaster’s office was forced on Friday night.  The contents of the cash tin of the cool drinks stand were taken.  In the High School two bottles of mercury weighing about four pounds and valued at £5 were stolen along with some magnesium ribbon.
