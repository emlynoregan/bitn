Supplements were not frequent, but overflow was often accommodated by printing in the gutters.  This was usually in the 306 gutter, but sometimes in 4-5 gutters and occasionally in the 207 gutter and sometimes in more than one of them.

The supplement on 26 November was larger than a full-sized page and was an advertisement celebrating Sargasso’s 10th birthday – the Burra Agent was Guy Dollman’s Burra Motor Co.  It featured four colour printing and was folded into quarters.
