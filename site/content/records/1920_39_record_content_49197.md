Frank Treloar writes commending the erection of ‘Johnny Green’.  He recounts again some salient points of the Mine’s history and given the need to control water goes over the massive effort needed to sink Morphett’s Shaft and then build the pump house etc.  He also tells of the huge effort to get the jinker etc. and load to Burra.  He believes, though he cites no real evidence, that Johnny Green would have been put in place when the work at equipping Morphett’s Shaft was completed on 1 April 1860.
