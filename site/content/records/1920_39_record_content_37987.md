Sheep Dog Field Trials were held 14 & 15 April on the showgrounds.  Entries were down due to the depression.  Fortunately A.B. Kemp of Victoria still managed to attend as did Frank Whittington from Bordertown.  Messrs J.H. & R.L. Steele of Ayers Forest and Messrs R. Reed & Son of Kookaburra supplied the sheep.  Winners were:

Local Class	T. Turner’s Redleaf & Donald

Maiden Stakes	F. Whittington’s Amy

Flock Dog Competition	A.B. Kemp’s Bounce

Puppy Stakes	F. Whittington’s Amy

Open Class	A.B. Kemp’s Bounce

The horse events on the 15th gave much enjoyment and excitement.
