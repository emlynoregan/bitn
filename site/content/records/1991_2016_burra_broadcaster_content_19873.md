Fire.  A house fire in Burra North on Friday 3 September started when heat from the flue of a slow combustion heater ignited birdsâ€™ nests and other material in the chimney.  The fire spread to the roof and although the fire damage was restricted to one ceiling at the front of the house, smoke and water damage affected the other front room.  Estimated damage was $15,000.
