Mr R. Fuss of Burra North has constructed and presented to the town a full scale working model of gear used by tributors who worked at the mine after it closed.  They are being set up at the end of the jinker shed and comprise a Cousin Jack wheelbarrow, a windlass, an ore dressing table with a peculiar shaped hammer and an ore washing plant.
