Goyder Council & the Galah Problem

Council has set out first to gauge the level of public concern before taking any action to reduce galah numbers.

Ian Falkenberg, district Ranger for the Department of Environment and Heritage suggests a working party to examine the issue of large numbers in Burra.  Council will then discuss the matter further.
