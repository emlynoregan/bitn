Kooringa News, 27 June

Saturday, Sunday and Monday were celebrated as Midsummer’s Day by the Cornishmen in Kooringa.  On Saturday a half-holiday was observed and a feu de joie was fired in the mine, albeit the artillery comprised but logs of timber in which were inserted numerous charges of gunpowder, serving in place of howitzers, field-pieces etc.

The new Kooringa Bible Christian Church was opened on Sunday and despite inclement weather the spacious building was filled to overflowing at each of the services.  There was also a good attendance at the service on Monday as well as at the tea-feast and public meeting.

The holiday on Monday saw a procession and dinner associated with the Miners & Tradesmen’s Club at the Court House Hotel.  In the afternoon a band led a procession from Redruth to the Wesleyan Chapel in Kooringa where they were addressed by Red. T. Lloyd.  They then returned to the Court House Hotel for a sumptuous feast provided by Host Nankervis.  Dr Meredith, the Club Surgeon occupied the chair with Mr Oliver in the Vice-Chair.

The pump at the Bon Accord Mine has suffered some damage and operation has had to be suspended for some time.
