New Burra-Hanson Road

The Highways Inspector has suggested to the Burra Burra DC that a new road to Hanson be built to meet the Kapunda Main Road about two miles south of Black Springs.  It would pass along the eastern side of the railway line instead of going past G. Finch’s residence, which would obviate a number of bends and two railway crossings, as well as being much shorter.  South of Hanson the road would continue past the Whyalla Water Scheme tanks, along the western side of Porter’s Lagoon and thence to the Kapunda Road as stated above.
