Burra Town Council, 21 March

Only one application has so far been received for trees.

Cr Fisher said it had been said to him that it was not worth planting trees due to straying stock.

It was resolved to apply to the Commissioner to close the road Mr K. Drew wished to rent as land.

Council workers will tar the floor under the racecourse grandstand in their own time.

Aberdeen tennis courts will be top-dressed with the Council supplying the colas and the club the sawdust.
