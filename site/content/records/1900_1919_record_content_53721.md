Edward Wall (15½) & Alfred Jones (12) and Harold Arthur Harrison (14 yr 9 months) were charged with maliciously damaging property at Burra Showgrounds on 13 January to the value of £1.  Jones and Harrison were also charged with writing an indecent word on the grandstand, totalizator room & refreshment room.

George Hann, Secretary of the Burra Racing Club reported it.  The words were fortunately in whitewash and relatively easily removed.

M-C McCarthy said these three were merely imitating the actions of older lads of whom he was on the track.

Mrs Jones pleaded she was the mother of 14 and this was the first offender and he would promise not to re-offend.  She had one son at the front and one had given his life.

Mr Harrison also undertook to closely supervise his son in future – he had been working for his father for six months.
