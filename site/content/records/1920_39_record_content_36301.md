Cr Kellaway [for Mayor] said he was indifferent to the question of legality in Cr Woollacott’s nomination, which seemed to bother Cr Woollacott so much.  He would not be appealing on those grounds if Cr Woollacott won.  He believed that the rates paid could be reduced by lowering the assessment.  As for why Linkson St had not been repaired with the £15 in North Ward funds – the chairman on the Public Works Committee said it would cost £30-£40.  He had 9 years of service and that experience would be available to the Council.  He believed that something could be done with the Burra Mine.  If rations were allowed he thought men could earn on tribute sufficient for clothes for themselves and their children.  Though the Town Clerk’s salary was fixed by the Arbitration Court it would fall by £50-£70 if rates fell.

Mr Jennison [for North Ward] wanted rates reduced, but realised that if it meant lowering the standard of the town he would not be in favour.  At present roads should only be maintained and new works postponed.  He had not been nominated by the RSA to restore the guns.  Though he favoured the original scheme, he did not see how it could be done in the present circumstances.  He hoped the Town Band would succeed.  He hoped the ration scheme would go and that the Council would get the money to distribute instead.  The council needed motor transport; it would save much time and cleaning the town with motor transport was also needed.

Mr Kuchenmeister [for East Ward] is merely reported as saying he would do his best for the town and not for any ward in particular.

The Mayor said it was the new Council that finally had to adopt the assessment.

Cr Pearce said that in relation to Cr Woollacott’s assertion that Burnside was reducing its assessment by a % that it was possible for a DC, but not for a Corporation.

Cr Woollacott & Mr Bevan were in favour of reducing rates.

Mr Jennison said he needed more information and Cr Kellaway was in favour if it were possible.
