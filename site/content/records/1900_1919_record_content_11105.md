Burra Mine.  An open day at the mine on Sunday afternoon drew a constant stream of visitors, young and old and of both sexes.  Captain Prior was present to explain matters to the uninformed.  The old cry is want of money for development work.  Nevertheless a shaft will be sunk on a spot close to Burra Hospital in the ruins of the old brewery cellar, where it is said copper was found when sinking for foundations.  The progress will be watched with unusual interest.
