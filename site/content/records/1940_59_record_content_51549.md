Football

It was a rough game on Saturday when Burra played Booborowie.  After about five minutes of play Dean Bernhardt sustained a broken leg.  Time-keeper, Jim Watson, had a nausea attack and had to be replaced.  Ron Chambers had a head-on collision and was rendered momentarily unconscious, but was roused and finished the game.  On Sunday he had two ‘shiners,’ one eye was almost closed and needed three stitches and a large plaster.
