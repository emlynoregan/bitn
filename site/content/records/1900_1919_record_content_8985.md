Salvation Army.  The Annual Salvation Army demonstration was held last Sunday and Monday.  Services were held by Adjutant Small and congregations were large with representatives from other religious bodies in the town.  Monday tea in the Barracks saw a large number of children doing justice to the food provided.  Then there was a grand march headed by the band through the principal streets followed by a short meeting at the pump before they went back to the Barracks for recitations etc. by the children.  Every child received a prize.
