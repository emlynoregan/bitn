Burra Hospital Board, 18 December

The septic tank was ordered to be put in order.

Dr Ashton had initially refused to assist Dr Steele with an anaesthetic recently (though he later relented) on the grounds his status at the hospital was still unclear.  Dr Ashton wrote that in the past when the Hospital had been strictly a Government Charitable Hospital the nursing staff had sometimes assisted the medical officer in private work contrary to custom and Government regulation.  What was now the situation?

Dr Steele said this had occurred in rare cases of life threatening emergency.

Dr Ashton thought the hospital now being practically private should hire out nurses.

The Chairman said they had trouble keeping sufficient for their own needs.  It was resolved that nurses be available only in cases of dire emergency.

Dr Ashton also wrote questioning the policy concerning administering anaesthetics, as he felt he had been called on to do so unnecessarily of late and clearly this had not been the case for the previous five years.  He had also written a letter going over the old grounds for not taking a position at the hospital while it was a charitable institution.  Dr Ashton then entered into a rather heated exchange with the Chairman W.G. Hawkes and Mr Melrose on the question of anaesthetics.  The Board clearly wanted this to be a matter of professional courtesy between the two doctors.  Dr Ashton wanted the boundaries of his privileges and responsibilities spelled out.  Others on the Board continued to wish to leave it to the courtesy of the doctors.  Mr Warnes pointed out that that had just recently failed to work!

Dr Steele said he was quite willing to consult with or administer an anaesthetic for Dr Ashton at any time.  Eventually it was resolved that either doctor shall administer an anaesthetic if called upon by the other at any time.

Seniority or responsibility of the medical officers had then to be resolved.  One suggestion was they take it month about.  Ashton kept harking back to the past.  Steele said the effect of the responsibility was only for the indigent patients, not any others.  The chair read out the other responsibilities, such as lecturing to the nurses and seeing to the state of cleanliness of the hospital etc.  Eventually both doctors agreed.  Dr Steele will continue with the nursesâ€™ lectures until the exams.

[The position concerning monthly rotation is not clear from the report, but it seems to imply that the doctors would rotate monthly starting with Ashton, except for the lectures as stated.]
