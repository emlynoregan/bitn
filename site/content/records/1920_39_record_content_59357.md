Mt Bryan East School.  The end of year concert and Christmas tree was held on 18 December.  Banbury School, which is a correspondence school with five scholars, and their teacher Miss Marjorie Sandland, also attended and contributed two items.  [Details of the concert in ½ column.]

The Head Teacher Mr Yeates reported a year of good attendance and that the school had won the ‘B’ Section of the Hallett & District Schools Athletic and Exhibition Assoc. event.  Twenty-two lucerne trees had been planted on Arbor Day.  Three candidates sat for the Qualifying Examination and all were successful: Aileen Hughes, Ken Emerson and May Hughes.  May & Ken will now leave school.  [Prize lis is printed.]
