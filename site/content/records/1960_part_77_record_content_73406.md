Burra Apex Club will induct six new members on Thursday 28 November.  John Madigan, Zone Representative of the Association of Apex Clubs will come to Burra for the occasion and so will Roger Dixon of the Barossa Valley Apex Club.  The six new members will be Carey Noack, Geoff Schwier, Mike & Andrew Scholz, Jeff Thomas and Andrew Anderson.  Burra President Trevor Blatchford said Burra now had 22 members.

The Australia-wide project for 1973-74 had been Foundation 41; a project organised by Dr William McBride for research into birth deformities.  Burra Apex had raised $300 for this.  The 1974-75 project focuses on Multiple Sclerosis.  Locally Apex had assisted the Copper festival with the production of ‘Copper Crunch’ Burra’s answer to ‘Mad’ Magazine.  Members had also manned the Information Booth.  They also staged a Gymkhana on 15 September.  Apex will erect new tourist signs when they arrive.  A gas barbecue for visitors is a project being considered.  Burning excess grass within the town is another project.  A restored hay wagon for the kindergarten is also being installed – donated by Ron Pearse of Koonoona.  Apex runs the films at the Town Hall.  Despite all these activities some people are not satisfied.
