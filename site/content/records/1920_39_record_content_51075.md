M.W. Bednall writes a carefully worded attack that belittles Cr Bevan.

He is responding to Cr Bevan’s comments surrounding the Tennis Club’s bid to buy the courts.  He says Cr. Bevan ‘has definitely stated as facts matters which he either knew to be untrue or concerning which he has negligently made no attempt to obtain information from the proper quarter.  For instance regarding Club guarantors, but this is hardly sufficiently noteworthy to comment upon.’  Bednall also quite wittily explains that he has decided to take no legal action against Cr Bevan for some of his statements concerning Bednall’s actions and motives because he views those statements as vulgar abuse rather than as defamatory remarks and as such would not be actionable.
