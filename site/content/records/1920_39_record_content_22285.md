Frank Treloar writes a 1½ column article on the Gold Rush of 1851-52.  He tells the familiar story of the Burra Mine being virtually deserted as men sailed, walked or went by dray to Victoria.  Two bullock teams bringing a small boiler to Burra abandoned it at Riverton where it stayed for over two years.  He also tells of the Gold Escort under Inspector Tolmer, before taking up a more personal account from his father’s diary.  He and J. Lovely sailed from Pt Adelaide to Melbourne on the Anney on 9 March 1852 and reached the diggings after some troubles on 24 March.  They struck a claim on Donkey Creek, but moved several times with little to show.  There was a run of fair results in June with over 21oz of gold.  In August the writer of the diary sent 2lb 8½oz of gold back to Adelaide and in September he sent home 5lb of gold and in November 28oz.  Over all he made good money that became the capital for a more permanent venture on his return to Adelaide.
