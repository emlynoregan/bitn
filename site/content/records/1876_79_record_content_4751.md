The first Institute in Burra was erected on the site of the present building — it was small and incomplete and had a prison-like appearance. To Mr David Wells goes much of the credit for the present arrangements. Other early supporters were Rev. D.J. Ibbetson, Messrs Oldham, A. McCulloch & Challoner and some of the present trustees like Capt. Killicoat, Messrs Gare, Bath and others. The present Institute is one of the best outside Adelaide with a large lecture hail, lodge room, reading room and three other meeting rooms, Corporation Office, etc. The cost of all to be noted as: - 
Land (Given by SAMA) 	£500-  0-  0 
Original building cost 	£954-18-  0 
Large hall & reading room (1874) 	£1384-13-10 
Masonic Lodge room & librarian’s cottage 	£663-13-  2 
Minor alterations 	£15-  1-  4 
Total 	£3518- 6- 4 
Costs have been met by: - 
Govt. Grants 	£1245- l0- 4 
Raised 	£1382- 2-11 
Land donated 	£500-  0- 0 
Balance still owed 	£390-13- 1 
There is now a library of c.2,000 books with about 3,700 circulating annually and 30-40 visitors to the reading room per day. The library costs subscribers 3/- a quarter or 5/- for double borrowing rights. 
There are reference books, newspapers and journals. Entrance to the reading room is free. Various Friendly Societies meet in the smaller rooms. The lecture room is not used as much as it might be for that purpose, but a large income is obtained from travelling companies and others. It is planned to establish a collection of mineral specimens, especially copper ore, but also various items of interest from other parts of the colony. A small start has been made. Much is due to the painstaking and obliging librarian, Mr A. Dearlove.
