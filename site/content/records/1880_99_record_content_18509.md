Burra Football Club made a presentation to E.F. Brady of a photo, in a handsome gilt frame, of the 22 players associated with him as Captain last year.  Mr J. Blott, the present Captain, said it was an expression of their high esteem and in memory of the valuable service he had given in forming the club and bringing it ti its present efficient state.

Football by ‘Drop Kick’

Practice is kept up and some good work done, but in the absence of real matches it is apt to get a bit monotonous.  Hothams are coming out top of the Junior Association, so Burra can be proud of drawing with such a team.

The ground, as a place of resort and amusement is a disgrace.  In one place there is long dry rank grass and in another nothing at all, while gravel appears elsewhere.  The Corporation cannot expect much revenue from such a ground.  What is needed is a northern Areas Association or a Country Football Association to end the dearth of matches.

Next season, I hope.
