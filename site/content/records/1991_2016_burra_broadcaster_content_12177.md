Letter.  Anthony Thorogood writes re the S.T. Gill paintings and James Elder.  He was left with the impression that James Elder thought the people of Burra were morons, who couldnâ€™t possibly know, value or understand the Gill paintings.  He thinks the Council was quite correct to have no intentions of selling them and that we must hold them to it.  The paintings are part of the infrastructure of the tourist industry.
