W.H. Hardy writes again on the Waterworks.  [He had been criticised in Council for his previous letter: it being deemed discourteous to write it while the Council was awaiting a reply from the Government.]  He affirms his former stand and complains that Cr McLaren moved ‘That the members of this Council having with regret noticed that a member of it has in the public press, discussed a matter between this Council and the government, whilst the Council was awaiting the reply from the Government to their letter, hereby pass their censure on Cr Hardy for his unbusiness-like and discourteous action’.  Hardy writes ‘to show ratepayers how a section of the Council jumps, and secondly to ensure this unique proposition being handed down to posterity’.
