Policing in Burra.

Some Burra residents have been concerned about how the district has been policed recently and on Monday night this concern surfaced on the Channel 7 news.  Matt Reilly was one of those who spoke to the press, but says there were a number of inaccuracies in the item that just made them sound like a bunch of whingers.  As a result there will be a public meeting on the issues raised.  Tonight those who feel they would rather a spokesperson took their concerns to the public meeting will meet together at the Civic Centre.  The public meeting will be held in the Burra Town Hall at 8 p.m. on 18 December.  Guests will be the Chief Inspector Jim Langmead, Officer in charge of North East Division and Senior Sergeant Dean Harris of Peterborough Police.
