Red Cross Day

On Friday 6 September the Red Cross under Mrs C.J. Pearce as Secretary held a most successful Button Day to raise funds to provide food and other necessities for POWs in Germany.  The business places and streets were well decorated and stalls arranged in Market Square.  Luncheon & afternoon tea was provided in Drew & Crewes new shops.  A Union Jack donated by Mrs John Tennant was auctioned and raised £160.  The Ladies’ band played during the day and the Dinkum Concert Party performed in the Institute at night.  About £500 was raised.
