Obituary.  Mrs William Arthur Langsford, nee Miss Valerie Jean Phillips, daughter of Mr & Mrs Horace Phillips of Booborowie, was electrocuted in the kitchen of her home in Railway Town Broken Hill on Tuesday last week.  She seems to have been trying to fix a fault in the iron with a steel meat skewer when she received the fatal shock.  An inquest will be held.  She was born at Burra and recently turned 24 [26].  Her funeral at Booborowie was the largest for many years with over 80 cars in attendance and over 100 wreaths.  [Born 21February 1924 Kooringa: died 28 February 1950.]
