Safe-blowers attempted to open the strong room at Drew & Crewes on 4 April.  Almost every department was disturbed and theft and damage amounts to c. Â£200, but the safe was not opened, with only the handle blown off.  The amount of gelignite found in the room was amazing.  P.J. Pickering, manager of the Bank of Australasia, was roused and in switching on the bank lights seems to have scared off the intruders.
