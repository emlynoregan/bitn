On Sunday the third and final section of the floor was laid – an area 22 ft x 32 ft wide 6-8 inches thick.  Altogether there is about 1,800 cubic feet of concrete in the floor.  The next job is the walls and preparations are in hand.  It is hoped the next pour will be on 28 July.  Contributions of money in lieu of labour would be welcomed.
