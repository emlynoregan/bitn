The Kingston Street Bridge is to be strengthened with steel beams under the existing superstructure, sitting on new concrete columns and footings.  These columns will be at each bank and either side of the existing central piers.  The Council is seeking funding for the project, but if this is unsuccessful the matter will be referred to the 2003-04 budget.  Transport SA will be asked to impose a load limit of 4 tonnes and a speed limit of 40 km/hr from Market Square to Bridge Terrace to avoid any immediate liability problem.  The 35 m wide bowstring bridge was constructed in 1879 to replace the Bridge Street Bridge, carried away by a flood in 1877.  The central piers are sunk 12 feet into the ground.  The concrete deck was added in 1935.  [Photo]
