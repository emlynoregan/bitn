The Register Newspaper

The South Australian Register was originated in London, where its first number was published 18 June 1836, previous to the departure of the first Governor from England.  The second number was published in Adelaide 3 June 1837.  In its early days it was a semi-official journal.  The Government Gazette was incorporated with the independent portion of the paper; the whole being issued under two distinct titles and the non-official portion being acknowledged as entirely free from Government influence or control.  On 15 June 1839 the Gazette was published in a separate sheet and the Register was wholly devoted to the interests of the community.  The publisher of the Register continued, however, to print the Gazette as a distinct and official organ.  In the early days producing a paper was fraught with difficulties.  There were acute mechanical and financial difficulties as well as a severe shortage of writers.  Printers were even scarcer.    It was initially impossible to publish the paper at regular intervals, but from 10 June 1838 it was published once a week in six pages of demy.  In early 1840 it was enlarged to 8 pages and on 29 August 1840 it became a broadsheet.    In February 1843 it became a bi-weekly; and on 1 January 1850 it was first published as a daily paper.  Although passing through the hands of several proprietors, the Register has always advocated the same basic principles.  It has always stood for civil and religious freedom; always denounced abuses and supported measures of public utility and approached its relationship with Government with impartiality.  On the occasion of our removal to the premises now occupied we made reference to our having the first steam printing press in the colony.  Our expectations of its capabilities were fully answered.   Now even more machinery is on its way hither, including a magnificent double-cylinder printing machine.
