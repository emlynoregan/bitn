Burra Mine.  Reports from recent geological and geophysical surveys have failed to find new ore prospects at the mine.  [The article then repeats data on old production 1845-77.]

Reports from examinations made soon after the mine closed and in previous managers’ reports showed three main lines of lode: Kingston’s, Sanders’ and Trinline’s [sic: for Tinline’s.]  The richest part of the mine was where the open cut is.  Here small veins and the lodes intersected and were rich in copper, chiefly carbo nates.  This ground was worked to 60 fathoms (360 ft.)

Recent investigations found:

No new ore prospects.

Drilling beneath the old workings has been suggested to find the grade of primary mineralisation at depth.

Discovery of payable ore at depth is not rated as very promising.

This information and all other available has been supplied to an overseas company keen to develop mines in Australia.

Uranium is often associated with copper, but there are no signs of it in Burra.
