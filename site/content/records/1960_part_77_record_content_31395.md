Accidents

A car was involved in an accident at the Farrell Flat crossing when it failed to take the bend and hit a fence and the warning lights.  The driver Mr K.L. Gum was uninjured, but F.J. Leonhardt and D.N. Jones of Burra were transferred to the Burra Hospital in a car driven by Mr T. Vesz.  This car in turn left the road and struck a fence at Brown’s Corner.  Mr Vesz was slightly injured and so the three injured men were transferred to hospital in a third car.
