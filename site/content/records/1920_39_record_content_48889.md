Obituary.  Mrs Charles Drew Wilkinson died at her residence 14 December after a severe illness.  She was born at Angaston the third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Nettell who later moved to Blackwood.  She was a prominent member of the Women’s Branch of the Liberal Federation and for many years Vice-President and Acting-President in Mrs Warnes’ absence.  She was also Vice-President of Burra Red Cross Circle and of Burra CWA.  Her influence with Mr Wilkinson gave the CWA here a wonderful start with the use of a room at the rear of the pharmacy as a rest room.  Gardening was also a keen interest.  She married Charles D. Wilkinson in November 1899 (second son of the late T.W. Wilkinson) who survives.  Her eldest child, a daughter, died in infancy and a son Mr Tom L. Wilkinson MSc, BScF is Senior District Forest Officer of Rhodesia who visited his parents with his wife, son and daughter in the past year.

[Born Adelaide Maria Frances Nettell 14 April 1871.]

[The reference to a daughter who died in infancy seems to be an error for a son, Charles Ronald who lived for three days in 1901.]
