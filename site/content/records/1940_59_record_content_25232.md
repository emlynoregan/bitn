Phil Rule writes concerning bread deliveries:

Some years ago when the population was similar there were five bakers: Harry Goodwin, Charlie Lowe, Charlie Parks, Alf Gebhardt and Charlie Morgan.  Each ran at least one cart and delivered bread at 3d per loaf.  There were four butchers: Dickie Austin, Harry Rabbich, Walter Truscott and Dan O’Leary and each had two carts on the road.  They made deliveries for half the price that the present owners say they can’t make pay with just one or two motors.
