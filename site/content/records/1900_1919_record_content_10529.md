Burra Town Council

Mrs M.A. Develaing wrote claiming £10 compensation after falling through the bridge at the Pig & Whistle crossing and as a result being unable to attend to household duties.

Other matters were of a routine nature.

A Bazaar organised by about 17 girls in the auction mart on Friday raised £13-14-1 for the Benevolent Society.  (Hilda, Nellie, Trixy, Millie & Annie Pearce, May & Marjorie McLaren, Una Brooks, Dorothy Steele, Eugene Walker, Jean & Renie Scott, Dorothy, Jubilee, Amy, Myra & Renie Crewes.)

[The ‘girls’ ranged in age between 10 and 21.]
