  The revolving whims and ceaseless stroke of the immense pump excited at once a dread and uneasy desire to visit the workings underground.  Introduced by Captain Roach to the Captain’s Changing Room, I was equipped with a candle in one hand and a piece of tempered clay in the other.  I followed the guide to whose care Captain Roach assigned me.  We went under a shed near a whim and the top of a ladder protruded from a hole just large enough to allow a man to descend.  My guide lit the candle and surrounded it with tempered clay, which he stuck against my hat and told me to follow him.  We descended about 16 feet to a landing and then took another ladder and so on until we had reached 30 fathoms.  My guide said we were in Peacock’s level and introduced me to several chambers where vast deposits of malachite and other rich ores had been found.  In some places the level had been excavated through solid rock and in other parts the earth was soft and damp and there the passage was strongly timbered and boarded.  No expense seemed to be spared in securing the comfort and safety of the workers.  In places several inches of water, apparently pure and clear, flowed along the level, but above it was a boarded floor, along which the miners walked dry shod.  I frequently came to men at work.  Some said the ore they were getting was poor, but would be called very rich in England.  Others were operating on large fronts of malachite.  They said the mineral was richer and more abundant at the 40 fathom level, but as there was some feet of water in the level and the footway was wet, I had no desire to go deeper.  In the 30 fathom level I met Captain Matthews, who greeted me courteously and led me to several most remarkable places.  On emerging into the light of day I returned to the Captain’s Change Room, where the kindness of Captain Roach allowed me to make a very needful toilet.

  After taking leave of Captain Roach I walked towards the works of the Patent Copper Co., but the sight of the flowing furnaces on such a hot day quite evaporated my curiosity and I returned to the Burra Hotel just in time to be present at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Kooringa and the surrounding townships.

  The meeting had been called to consider the propriety of demanding municipal institutions for the united townships, but in fact the propositions put did not mention this at all.  I afterwards found that the words intimating this cause were inserted into the requisition calling the meeting to please the few who think with the Resident Magistrate that such is desirable, but the majority fear the expense of a corporation would more than outweigh its advantages and so avoided the subject.

  Other matters observed:

  There is a flourishing Oddfellows’ Lodge there of the Manchester Unity and it meets in a splendid room recently added to the Burra Hotel.  It possesses a library of 1,000 volumes from which it lends books at a cheap rate to all who wish to avail themselves of such a service.

  The people generally think residence in the creek unhealthy, and it is certain that fever prevails there occasionally.  To me, however, the women and children appeared both numerous and healthy and on the Sunday I was in Kooringa it turned out a vast concourse of well-dressed persons who wound their way to different houses of worship.  It is thought there is a population in the creek of about 1,000 and there are at least 200 houses there.  The approaching census will give the correct numbers.  The people complain of the want of a local court of full jurisdiction and are ashamed of the hovel in which their respected Magistrate disposes justice.  There are fears that the engine pump of the mine will exhaust all the wells in the town – several having gone dry since it has been at work.

  The return to Adelaide presented the same dust and delays for want of horses.

  Note [Again presumably by Ian Auhl]: this three day journey to Burra in 1880 cost $2 plus overnight expenses at Gawler and Kapunda.  The trip by Mail Cart went via Gawler, Sheoak Log, Kapunda, Tothill’s Creek, Apoinga, Emu Springs and Sod Hut.  Hornsby’s hotel still stands at Apoinga.  The Burra Hotel was later the Burra Hospital and the last of the old building was demolished in 1967.
