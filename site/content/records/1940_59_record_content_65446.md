Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd Annual Report by M.W. Bednall, Chairman.

Revenue had risen slightly, but rising cost of wages, fuel and maintenance saw profit fall substantially.  The company had to employ at least five men over a 24-hour period, with holidays and sickness occasioning overtime rates.  The ageing machinery made parts hard to get and very expensive.  Line repairs were hard to attend to because of the constant attendance needed at the powerhouse.  ETSA has made no approach in the past year on the question of supplying power to Burra.  Nett profit for the year was £40 on which income tax of about £20 will be payable.  There will be no dividend and consumers cannot expect any reduction in tariff. The Directors are attending to the completion of a new line as far as the hospital.

The Chairman was re-elected as a director, as was Mr F.H. Reed.
