Pages 2 & 3.

A mixture of small and large advertisements, but large advertisements were common.  Stock firms often occupy much of page 2.  Some news appears on page 3 in some issues, but often it is all advertising and notices.

Pages 4 5 & 6.

Generally dominated by large advertisements with less than 1 column of news.

Page 7.

Often this carries little or no news and the ‘Cash Column’ occupies much of the space.  This, however, migrated to other pages at times depending on size.

Page 8.

Similar to pages 4-6.
