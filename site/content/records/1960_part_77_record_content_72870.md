Osmar White, the author who visited Burra recently researching the history of Bezaliel Gollin, considers that Burra has by far the best collection of mid-Victorian buildings in the whole of Australia.  He cannot understand why they are not being exploited.  There should, he says, be hundreds of thousands of tourists annually.  A tumbledown stone cottage could produce more wealth for the community than any modern shop or service station that could be erected on its site.  People may consider that history is bunt – ‘but these days it’s gilt edged bunt and it brings the money into communities with the common sense to cash in on an historical heritage.’

[Check this use of ‘bunt’.  If it is noted correctly, it is probably an incorrect reference to Henry Ford’s famous comment ‘History is more or less bunk.’  This was said in an interview with Charles N. Wheeler and reported in the Chicago Tribune 25 May 1916.]
