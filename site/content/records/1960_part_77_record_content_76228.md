Father Burke of Sevenhill writes to say that the centenary of their church occurs on 12 October 1975.  He recently received a letter about Fr Pallhuber, who came from Austria in 1856 and journeyed extensively in the north from 1860-1880.  Despite a rather severe look in a photograph, he is described as being kindly, witty, interesting and entertaining and was well regarded by those of other faiths.  He spent a lot of time visiting remote shepherds, prospectors, miners etc. and often had to sleep out in winter in wet clothes.  His horse sometimes headed for home without him â€“ once leaving him to return 15 miles and on another occasion 100 miles.
