Gold is rumoured to have been discovered in the Barrier Ranges, but a telegram from Kooringa denies this and a mercantile firm has a letter from their Outalpa Station dated 26 February, which fails to mention it.  The area involved is large and so the discovery might be unknown to these sources.  Reports from the Darling Stations say some men have been heading to the area of the reports.

A letter to a city gentleman from Burra says several men have gone from there to the new diggings and Mr Dawson is going up to open a road on behalf of Cobb & Co., whose fare to the Barrier Ranges is to be fixed at Â£6-6-0.

[The editor goes on to develop the idea of the desirability of a Government report on the existence and/or the extent of the field because it could save many people from much wasted effort and waste of money.  The route to the area is a difficult one and not without danger.]
