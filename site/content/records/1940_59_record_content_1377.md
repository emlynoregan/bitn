Burra Town Council, 15 April.

Council accepted on trust for the Aberdeen Croquet Club, a piece of land adjacent to the club, presently owned by Mrs Gare.

The Burra Swimming Pool Committee has handed over £110-9-5.

The Mayor said Mr R. Fairchild had recently left the town and he was surprised there had been no farewell.  Mr Fairchild had done a lot of work for the good of the town.  The Mayor had not been notified of the departure.  He suggested a minute of appreciation be recorded and Cr Robinson so moved.  A letter of appreciation will also be sent to Mr Fairchild.

Cr Samuel asked if a letter had been sent inviting the Premier & the Minister of Mines to visit, as agreed at the last meeting, and if not, why not?

The Mayor said it had not, because he didn’t want too many cooks to spoil the broth.  An important announcement on the mine was expected in a few days and a monster public meeting could be held later to help things along.

Cr Samuel thought that if they did not ask for help they would not get it.  He did not think the Progress Association or any other body should be taking the lead.  He moved the letter be sent.

Cr Robinson understood the letter was to be sent and had since heard there was a good prospect of the mine’s reopening through a company to be formed.  He did not know what the Council could tell the Premier and Minister when they arrived, but thought they should push their own barrow.

Cr Reed said if the report was correct a party held a three-month option on the mine so nothing could be done at present.

Cr Samuel said interest had to be stirred up.

Discussion continued and Cr Robinson said it was best to rescind the motion concerning a letter and then call a public meeting to go into the matter and then ask the Premier and Minister later.

Cr Terry wanted to drop the matter till the present option was either exercised or let drop.

The report does not indicate that any decision was reached, or any action taken.
