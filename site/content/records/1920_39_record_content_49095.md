Burra Christmas Tree was organised by Mrs S. Dowling and was very successful.  The depression having precluded on for 1932.  The public appeal made it possible to entertain c. 470 children from Burra & District at the Institute on 21 December.  Admittance was by ticket only.  The Mayor opened the proceedings and thanked the organisers.
