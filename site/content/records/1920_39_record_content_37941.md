Citizens League: an outline of its principles and objectives.  It is strongly supportive of Nationalism above party politics and individuals.  It wanted to encourage primary production and for Government to follow rigid economies and to have no role in trade and commerce.  Railways should be sold off.  State Parliaments should have their numbers halved as a first step towards their elimination.
