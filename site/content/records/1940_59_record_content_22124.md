Leighton Hall will be free of debt this year thanks to the generosity of the late Mr I.J. Warnes and the wholehearted support of the people of the district.  The people first came into possession of the hall in 1909 and since then have raised over Â£1,600 to pay for the original building, to improve it and to furnish it.  The Hall President, Mr A.D. McDonald is the only original committeeman still on the committee and he and his brother J.M. McDonald the only two originals still living.  His son Mr Colin McDonald is the present Secretary.
