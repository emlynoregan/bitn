The Burra Burra DC has recently acquired the Ian Auhl Burra History Collection.  The collection, which will be kept in the custody of the Burra Community Library, consists of an indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships covering the period from the discovery of copper in 1845 to the closure of the Burra Burra Mine in 1877.

It also includes a biographical index of names of people mentioned in the references, a collection of maps relating to Burra and district, a collection of photographs and negatives relating to Burra and district, a library of books relating to Burra and an extensive collection of miscellaneous references to the Mine and its townships and various other indexes.

The collection was begun in 1965 when Ian Auhl was principal of Burra Primary School.  It finished in 1985 with the submission to the publishers of the author’s book The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77.  It began with items researched from copies of the SA Register dating from 1852 and held by the Burra Institute Library.  When Mr Auhl was transferred to Adelaide in 1969 arrangements were made for the State Library to photocopy each newspaper item.  Subsequently each item researched and submitted was photocopied and all newspaper items were microfilmed and negatives made of all photographs.  The collection was begun when the author was preparing tourist pamphlets and realised that Burra had no local paper till 1876.  No books on the history of the mine and its townships existed apart from some centenary publications.

The intended use of the material was to prepare tourist pamphlets and then a short history of the mine and its townships.  This resulted in the publication in 1969 of the Burra Sketchbook with drawings by Maurice Perry, which has been reprinted five times.  It was subsequently used in the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and in various Burra histories and to make submissions to the District Council and in making submissions for heritage listing for Burra Buildings and of course for Ian Auhl’s major history as mentioned, to be published in 1986.  It has supplied authors, organisations, families and individuals with information on the history of Burra and its people.  Mr Auhl has said that he considers the Conservation Study of 1978 to be the most valuable result of the collection.

Originally the collection was to be housed in the Copper Museum and Interpretation Centre.  The author’s ill health and doubts about the funding for that centre have made it necessary for the author to agree to the housing of the collection in the Burra Community Library, in the care of the Library Board of Management in accordance with an agreed management policy drawn up by the Librarian Colin Fidock.  A complete copy of all but the photographic material has been made by the librarian of the Mortlock Library.  Both the Burra Community Library and the State Library are processing the material to make it available for public access in 1986.  The author and librarians envisage the collection as growing in the future as there is still the period after the closure of the mine in 1877 to be researched and written about.

The microfilm of the Burra Record for 1876 to 1977 is available.  Challenges to Burra’s role as a historic town can only be met by substantiated facts, properly documented.  Mr Auhl considers that the future security and growth of the collection is assured and has expressed his gratitude to Colin Fidock and the staff and to Roger Henderson, Principal of Burra Community School for their co-operation and understanding.

Mr Auhl has expressed a hope that the collection ‘will attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.’
