Cr Thomas (Mt Bryan) endorsed what had been said and Cr Scholz (Hanson) also agreed and mentioned the construction of the Adelaide-Pt Augusta Road that competed with rail.

Cr Cousins (Booborowie) was sympathetic, but they had generally been well treated and favoured acting only through the Northern District Councils’ Association.

Mr Hogan, Booborowie District Clerk, supported Cr Cousins.

Cr Scholz thought Booborowie was so well treated because they were so far from a railway.

Eventually Cr Pearse (Burra DC) moved ‘That the District Councils’ Association and other bodies be written to suggesting that it would be wise for a convention to be called consisting of at least one representative from each Corporation and District Council outside the Metropolitan Area to confer as to some concerted method of obtaining moneys for the improvement of main roads and railway feeders.  Carried.
