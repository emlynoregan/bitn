Teetulpa Goldfield.  ‘A Digger’ writes at length from Teetulpa.  1,000 have come in recent days, faster than they go.  Quite a lot of gold has been found in some gullies, but development is hampered by lack of water.  During the week ‘several of the almond eyed individuals have arrived on the field’ causing a large meeting of miners.  1,000 petitioned the Government to prohibit Chinese on the field.  Some wells are now going in.  Many are still leaving.  Sanitary conditions are deteriorating.  The Teetulpa News is due to publish its first issue this week.  Of Burra men only Pascoe and his mates seem to be doing well.  The others are hardly making tucker at best.  If no water comes soon the exodus will be a rush.
