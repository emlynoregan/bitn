Burra Institute AGM was held on 27 January.  The year ended with a credit balance in the bank of £47-15-4.  The death of Mr J.S.R. Oborn was a loss to the committee this year.

Again free tickets have been given to the most eligible scholars at Burra Public School and to the best boy and girl at Copperhouse School.  Membership has fallen slightly.

The Chess Club had a successful year and won both contests with Clare.

Elected were President, G.E. Dane; Vice-President, F.T. Sara; Treasurer, M.W. Bednall & Hon. Secretary, L.S. Penrose.
