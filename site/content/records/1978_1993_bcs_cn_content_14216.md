Burra Burra Hospital Board is concerned at budget cuts due to lack of funding by the SA Health Commission.  The Commission has warned:

The projected budget over-run of $20,000 will not be assisted by Central Office Funds.

It will become the first charge against next yearâ€™s fund.

A 100% penalty may be imposed on any over-run.

A further 1 to 2% cut may be applied next financial year.

Anyone (or more) of the above would spell disaster for the retention of services.  Please write to health authorities or Government representatives to support the hospital.
