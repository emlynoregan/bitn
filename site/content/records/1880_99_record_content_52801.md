In cross examination he got rather tangled up about just when he looked for the train first and when he looked later.

Dr Brummitt gave evidence of severe bruising of the ribcage and shoulders and of small scalp wounds.

Harriet Camp and Edward Finch from the crossing site did not hear a whistle, but Finch could not swear it had not blown as trains came so constantly.

The Crown Solicitor asked for a non-suit on the grounds of failure to establish negligence.

Mr Gall, for Mann, said the evidence did show that the driver should have seen the two carts and if attentive could have prevented the accident; it was certainly, he said, a matter for the jury and not for the judge to dismiss.

The Driver:

Swore he blew the whistle at 600 yards.  He thought the two were continuing on parallel to the line as the road does that, but when he saw they were going to cross he blew again at 80 yards and braked hard.  The train was doing 25-30 m.p.h. and pulled up in 200 yards.

Others on the train verified his statement about the whistles.

The resident engineer gave evidence that the embankment there is only about 6â€™ high and a person on a cart could see a train coming for a mile or more.

The jury took 15 minutes to find for the defendants and Mann ended up having to pay the costs of both parties.
