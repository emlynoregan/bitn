Byles’ Mongolata.  Work is being extended at 50 & 92 ft levels.  No workable values have so far been found in this work.  The main crosscut west at 92 ft has been driven to a point c. 50 ft beyond the ventilating shaft.  From this crosscut a drive 30 ft long connects with the shaft, making a passage for air.  25 ft west of the airway a formation was cut in the crosscut with traces of gold.  A drive started a little east, and put out 30 ft from the crosscut, met the same formation pinched down to 6 inches wide and a winze, now 10 ft deep, has been started near the face.

Some patches of ore have been broken between the 50 & 92 ft levels south of the crosscut and two men are engaged in prospecting in that section.

136¼ tons of ore were treated at the battery for 103 oz 6 dwt of gold by amalgamation.  Only 25 tons of the tailings from this parcel were treated by cyanide for 8 dwt 18 gr per ton.  The rest assayed at 20 gr and was not treated.

Total tonnage treated from this mine is 1862 tons for a return of 2918 oz.  23 men are engaged in mining operations.
