In 1887 the DC of Mt Bryan tried to amalgamate with Hallett and the Hundreds of Ayers & Anne.  Booborowie DC Chairman at a meeting on 3 September 1887 opposed the move and instead managed to get the Hundred of Anne placed under the Booborowie DC and on 4 February 1888 the dept. of Lands requested that three Councillors be appointed for Anne Ward.
