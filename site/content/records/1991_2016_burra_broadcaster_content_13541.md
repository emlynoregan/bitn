Advertorial.  Richard Holbrook came to Burra five years ago.  He is a clockmaker by trade and still services the Adelaide Town Hall clock, visiting it every three months to oil it, adjust the timing and keep an eye on wear and tear.  He also keeps an eye on the scoreboard clock at the Adelaide Oval.  Richard and his wife Jenny recently renovated their clock shop cum tea rooms and transformed an old storeroom at the rear into Griffiths’ Cottage B & B.
