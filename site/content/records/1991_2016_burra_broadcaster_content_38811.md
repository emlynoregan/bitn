Burra & Districts Christmas Fair was emceed by Darryl Venning and began with the traditional parade of children on their decorated bikes, followed by a fleet of imaginative floats.  Afterwards a giant ‘Tigger’ bouncy castle entertained the young ones and the Burra Cricket Club’s barbecue and Belinda Simpson’s famous spring rolls drew a line of customers.

The threat of an afternoon thunderstorm sent Father Christmas into the Bullrush Store instead of his usual place in the rotunda.  The popular Santa’s Trail had kids of all ages collecting goodies from participating businesses, while Kerry Davy and young friends entertained with a variety of songs.  Prize winners in the pageant and house lights competitions were announced at the end of the evening.

Kids on Bikes winner was Chloe Mirtschin.

Elders won the best pageant float.

The house lights competition was won by Vicki & Wayne Van Gasteren of Mitchell Flat.

Mid North Accounting won Burra Traders’ Best Window Display.
