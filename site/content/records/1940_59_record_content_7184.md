Pte Scroop

He writes to T.H. Woollacott about being stuck in the same old place for five months, speaking of sand storms and 1,200 raids by dive bombers.  He says canteen goods are getting through generally, but Comforts Fund stuff is not.  He mentions there being 16,000 Italian POWs when they first came to the unnamed place.  Since being in action the Australians have lost all respect for the Italians.
