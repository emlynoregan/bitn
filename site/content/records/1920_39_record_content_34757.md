Unemployment.  A petition to the Town Council on Monday was signed by 52 married men and 30 single men who were unemployed and on rations.  While these prevent starvation they do nothing for the clothes and boots for them and their children.  They respectfully ask that some work be provided.

Cr Woollacott pointed out this petition involved 104 parents, 150 children and 30 single men.

The petition was forwarded to the Government via the District MPs.

Council resolved if possible to borrow Â£500 that the Government is offering for three years interest free and then at 3%.
