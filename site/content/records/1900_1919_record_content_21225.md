World’s End Races.  The annual event took place last Wednesday in Mr Schmidt’s paddock, just on the other side of the creek.  The field was as flat as a billiard table, with shade and the backdrop of the ranges.  A good attendance saw £14 taken at the gate and people came from as far as Petersburg and Morgan and some £26 was collected.  Most of the prize money went to J.C. O’Dea of Booborowie and J. Quinn of World’s End.  There was a ball in the evening at C. Green’s residence.
