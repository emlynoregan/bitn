The Burra Bus is about to start in the township and district.  Clare Coach Lines directors Bob & Heather Bradley of Farrell Flat are pleased to start the service in Burra as they see a need.  The bus is accredited by PTB and endorsed by the Goyder Council.  Heather worked in Beinke’s Shoe Store before her marriage and they operate a family farm at Farrell Flat with one of their sons, Aaron.  Assisting the Bradleys will be accredited relief drivers Jenny Coatupe and Wayne Crump.  The bus holds 13 passengers.  The Passenger Transport Board does not allow them to operate regular route services, but the bus will be available for charter.
