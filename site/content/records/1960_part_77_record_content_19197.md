Obituary.  Dr D. McDonald Steele died recently aged 78.  He was the first President of the Burra High School Council.  He came to Burra after graduating in 1909 and practised here for over 30 years.  He took great interest in the welfare of Burra High School and was President of the High School Council for 26 years.  He was also interested in golf, tennis and bowls in Burra.  Since retiring to Adelaide he often visited the district in connection with his Koo-owie Stud and it was only last year that he finally relinquished his interest in that property, when it was sold to Barton Hill Proprietors.  In 1962 he was to have been a guest speaker at a High School Jubilee function, but was prevented by illness from attending.  He did attend the High School speech night in 1962 in December and gave an interesting address.  At the recent High School swimming Carnival, at which Steele House won the cup, a minute’s silence was observed.  He is survived by a widow and two sons, Dr D.M. Steele of Strathalbyn and Mr J.R. Steele and also by one daughter Mrs George Mollard-Humphrys.  He was cremated at Centennial Park after a service at St Matthew’s Church.
