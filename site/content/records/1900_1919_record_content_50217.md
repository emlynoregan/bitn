Patriotic Films.  Why Britain Went to War was shown last Wednesday at the Institute to a crowded house.  Mr Sinclair was to have spoken, but was ill and could make only a few brief remarks.  He denied the accuracy of the advertisement in the Record that claimed arrangements had been made between him and the ULP, which was meeting in the Institute on the same night.
