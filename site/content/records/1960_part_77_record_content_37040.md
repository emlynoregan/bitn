Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal.  Sufficient funds were raised in 1963 to open the new administration block and private rooms etc. in Phase I of the plan.  Phase II saw the remodelling of the wards, kitchen etc. and this was completed from the Hospitalâ€™s own funds.  Phase III has been in the processing stage for some time.
