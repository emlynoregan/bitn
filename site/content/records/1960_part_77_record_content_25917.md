Quality Shearing Coaching Course will be offered at Burra 6-15 September.  It has been arranged by Mrs M.R. Ashton of ‘Hillside’ and her shearing contractor Mr J. Ryan.  The shearing instructor will demonstrate ‘Tally-Hi’ shearing technique.  A visiting afternoon will be held on Tuesday 14 September from 2 p.m. in Mrs Ashton’s shearing shed about two miles north of the Burra Racecourse – just east of the railway line.  It is essential that young men given the courses have follow-on sheds immediately to consolidate the coaching given.
