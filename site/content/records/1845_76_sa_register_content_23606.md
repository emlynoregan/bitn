Inquest/Obituary.  (Courtesy of the Editor of the Gawler Times)

On Tuesday an inquest was held at the Criterion Hotel, Gawler West by Mr T.O. Jones enquiring into the death of Thomas Attenborough who died that morning, having met with an accident the previous day on the Northern Extension Railway.  The widow was present.

Washington Mather said he was driving the train as it left Farrell’s Flat and saw a man waving a white flag at the second level crossing.  This was a signal that all was well.  Sounded the whistle and then glanced down at something on the footplate.  When I looked around the deceased was lying about 100 yards from the engine with his head upon the rail.  Reversed the engine, put on steam and whistled for the brake.  We were travelling down slope at c. 20 m.p.h. and pulled up in about 300-400 yards.  Got out and found the deceased lying on the road, off the rails.  Believe the guard of the engine struck his head.  Fancied he must have fallen in a fit.  The Governor, Mr Mais and some others got down.  Covered deceased with a bag, got him lifter onto the train and continued the journey.  He had been placed at a level crossing to prevent accident to persons crossing.  He was not in a dangerous position.  It was about 10.05 p.m. and quite light.

Hannibal Orchard, Superintendent of the Permanent Way, Gawler, saw nothing of the accident, but confirmed the steps taken after it.  Had known the deceased for about 11 years.  Deceased was a steady man, and had never been seen the worse for liquor.  The position was not dangerous, with a clear view of the train for half a mile and the train was stopped as soon as possible.  The stoker was not present, but evidence was given that he had been on the other side of the engine.  Mr Orchard said the stoker had confirmed that he had seen nothing.  [This was hardly satisfactory as evidence and some of the jury wanted the stoker called.  Although they were a minority the Coroner offered to call the stoker to an adjourned sitting after the other witnesses had been heard.]

Dr W.H. Popham saw the deceased at the station when the train arrived.  He knew immediately from the damage to the frontal bone that there was no hope of recovery.  He died soon after 9 a.m. the following morning.  He could not determine if a fit had occurred.  Thought the guard-iron of the engine rather than the cow-catcher had caused the fatal injury.

Mary Attenborough said they had been married about 12 years.  Her husband had been good, kind and of sober habits.  He was in good health and never took roo much liquor.  She never knew him to have a fit.

William Clark, ganger, corroborated the deceased’s sobriety.

Mr Orchard said there was no public house at Farrell’s Flat, but could not say what other means there may have been of obtaining liquor.  Inquest was then adjourned to 7 p.m.

Aaron Solly, head porter, Adelaide, had been acting as guard on the train. His evidence did not add to the above.

The foreman Mr Matthew Henderson asked a Mr Frankel to be called, but he had seen nothing of the accident.  Mr Grundy of the Bunyip said Frankel might shed some light on the matter.  Frankel had been on the second train and he said he saw, as they came into Farrell’s Flat two railway men near the line very drunk and one had said ‘Our poor ganger is killed.’  Henderson said he believed that settled the matter, but Mr Orchard said the two were nowhere near the accident and if they had heard about it, it must have been from others who returned to the station afterwards.  The coroner reminded the jury of the doctor’s evidence that there had been no indication of drink on the deceased.  After some jurymen expressed dissatisfaction with the evidence the coroner asked them to consider their verdict.  Eventually they decided death was the result of a blow from the engine, but there was no evidence to show how he came to be on the rail.  They attached no blame to the driver and considering the 12 years’ service of the deceased recommended the Government make some provision for his wife and family.
