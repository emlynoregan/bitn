Municipal Election.  There is a humorous column of comments likening the candidates to racehorses:

Draper: A popular gelding and in the pink of condition.  [Watt]

Squatter: A heavy gelding, too heavy I think, but his owner is very confident.  I do not expect him to win as he is too heavily handicapped.  He did not attend the preliminary gallop on 22 November at Redruth and I’m afraid he has lost a lot of admirers on this account. [Killicoat]

Butcher: His rider, though clumsy and decidedly unpopular, is doing all he can to land him first past the judges post.  ‘If Butcher should happen to win it will be through the bad judgement of the other riders.’  Since winning the North Ward Stakes two years ago ‘he has not done any harm, neither has he done any good.’

‘For several reasons I cannot admire him.’ [Rabbich]

[The descriptions of the contenders for Councillors have much less bite.  Was the reference to Rabbich’s rider intended to represent Cr Hardy?]
