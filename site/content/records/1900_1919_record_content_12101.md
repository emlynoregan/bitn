The Ward accounts are then printed.

Income for the year from all sources was £520-18-2 and from rates was £312-6-10½.

Salaries: Town Clerk £49-3-4, Inspector £33-6-8, Mayor’s allowance £15.

Unusual expenditure this year was £40-12-3 on lighting, but this included capital cost of the ‘Best Lights’ which when well maintained will not exceed the cost of the antiquated kerosene lamps and give a much better light.

There is still room here for extension.

The main road grant was £273, of which £269-19-5 has been expended and the main roads are now in good order.

The cemetery has been improved and more can be done given that the present balance is £53-2-11.

Three small reserves adjacent have been granted to the Corporation by SAMA and while obtaining title to these steps have been made to bring it all under the RPA.

Health.

Apart from a small outbreak of scarlatina the town’s health has been good this year.  The question of a public slaughterhouse has been discussed, but was again passed over this year.

The Waterworks.

It is to be hoped that this will be its last appearance in a Mayor’s Report.  Early in the year Council realised the appalling state of the Waterworks and that continuation of existing arrangements necessitated very great expenditure to be borne by the ratepayers.  A deputation asked for such concessions from the Commissioner of Public Works as would enable the Council to carry on without imposing an undue burden.  The Commissioner refused such concessions in any way.  Council than considered handing over the works as soon as possible to the Government.  The Government’s terms for a handover were obtained and Council was unanimous in accepting the same.  A ratepayers’ meeting received this recommendation and adopted it without dissent.  After further clarification of some points of detail the transfer to the Government was effected.  The amount of work done since to the whole system should convince anyone that it was the correct move and that we are much more likely to obtain a good supply of better water than was probable under Council control.

Thanks were expressed to the whole of Council and to the town Clerk, Mr Bartholomaeus and sympathy expressed for the latter’s recent bereavement.

Dr Sangster asked if the meat slaughtered outside the Corporation was inspected previous to being sold.  The answer was ‘No’.

Mr Lott enquired about arrangements between the District Council and the Corporation.

[Though the paper says between the Corporation and Burra Town Council which was the same thing.]

The Mayor said arrangements had been discussed, but nothing definite agreed.

At present two butchers killed within the corporation and two outside it.

The Act relating to butchering and meat inspection would soon be amended and he hoped the difficulties would then be overcome.  It was ridiculous to expect the District Council to spend their money inspecting meat to be sold in the town.

The Mayor was glad to see the tar-dressing of footpaths had proceeded.

Cr Snell thanked those ratepayers in East Ward who had placed him at the head of the poll.

Candidates then addressed the meeting.

Cr Snell was glad that the Waterworks had gone.  He desired and was hopeful of seeing a better quality water supply as a result.  He favoured the Government spending £24,000 at Black Waterholes for a supply from a holding dam.  He was in favour of the ‘Best Lights’.  From 1 December the Council would find the oil and the contractor would merely attend to the lighting.  He advocated more tar-dressing of footpaths with some more kerbing and tree planting.

Mr Hardy claimed he had come forward because Cr Snell had told him he was sick and tired of the job.  He thought the rubbish depot needed to be shifted as windy days brought papers and germs down around the hospital.  He was not in favour of the ‘Best Lamps’, bur preferred acetylene gas lights and he favoured them on Henderson’s Bridge, Market Square, and the Mine Bridge.  The three Wards should share the cost of any work on the Cemetery Rd.  All meat should be inspected and they should agitate for better water.

Cr West favoured tar-dressing, kerbing and tree planting.

Dr Sangster asked Mr Snell if he was sick and tired of Council and Cr Snell assured them that he had never said any such thing.

Hardy re-asserted his original statement.
