Burra Town Council, 2 February

Apart from routine matters, the main concern was the unsatisfactory speed with which the armed services were notifying relatives of lost or wounded men.  Cr Harvey said one man was notified by wire on 2 February that his son had been wounded on 29 November â€“ a fact already known to him through letters received.  In another case it was known in the town that one Burra boy had been killed when a letter with the information arrived 18 days before the wire.  Senator McBride will be asked to make enquiries.
