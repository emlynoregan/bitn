Mr H. Wilson said he was on duty and there were five mobs of larrikins around.  There was no paint evident when he had been around Sara’s Corner at 3 a.m.

Cr Killicoat thought the special constables’ appointment was a slur on the soldiers present in the town.

Cr Lane said they had been appointed before it was known that any soldiers would be around.

Cr Killicoat wondered what they could do to help Pte Ockenden to get a job – it would help recruiting to show the town caring for returned wounded soldiers – perhaps he could be trained for the telephone exchange.

The Mayor said the Government had made provisions and wounded men needed to apply.

It was decided that the Mayor interview Mr Ockenden to ascertain his wishes.
