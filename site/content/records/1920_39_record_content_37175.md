Soldier Settlers Deputation to the Government is reported.

The core of their problem could be seen in the figures cited.

The average holding of soldier settlers in the district was 400 acres.

Their average liability to the Crown was £3,500.

The average annual instalment was £185.

Assume 180 acres was cropped and allow 40 for hay and reap 140 at an average of 7 bags per acre.  Deduct seed wheat and the farmer will have fewer than 1,000 bags for sale.

The present pool advance would be £150 with a probable final return of under £250.

Even without the Crown instalment proceeds do not meet accounts for super, bags, stores, machinery, rates, taxes, repairs etc.

Give the land free and the farmer would not earn the basic wage.
