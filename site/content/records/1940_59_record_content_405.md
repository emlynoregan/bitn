Burra Institute AGM 30 January.  Vice-President F.L. Worth in the chair.  Books in the library rose from 5,097 to 5,518 during the year.  The decision of the Council not to renew its grant of 1d in the £ on the rate is regretted.  About £40 of the Council’s grant in 1939 went to pulling down the old fence and repairing the wall in front of the Institute.  Election: President, F.L. Worth; Vice-President, R.J. Bowles; Treasurer, A.B. Riggs; Hon. Sec., W. Richards.
