Telephone.  Since the telegraph business has been done away with at the railway station telephones have been installed at the Aberdeen post office and the Kooringa post office.  Anyone can chat for 3d for 3 minutes.  [The main use of this line may have been to deliver telegraphic information to the Kooringa telegraph office since virtually no one had a private telephone and there was no line to Adelaide.]
