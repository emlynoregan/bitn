Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.

The announcement of the proposed stoppage of the boring operations means there is now no hope of the Burra Mine being tested and certainly not while copper is at its present low price.  We still believe that with sufficient capital the mine would make a handsome profit.

Some 4-5 years ago, when the Burra Burra Copper Co. took over the mine property it was thought that mining would be revived.  The old SAMA now has no mineral rights in the Burra Mine.  The Copper Co. began well, but it was soon apparent that progress was not being made.

A few months ago Mr Horn, a well-known mining mad from Great Britain, came out and paid, it is said, a substantial deposit to hold an option over the mine for nine months, during which £15,000 was to be expended.

After many rumours, a couple of boring plants arrived and were erected.  There was much trouble with them, but eventually they got going to look for the sulphide lode, said to lie at the bottom of the open cut.  Time has revealed that nothing has been found to induce the Kooringa Prospecting Syndicate to proceed further.  The men are busy taking down the plants, which will be done in a few days, and the mine will again present a desolate appearance.

Four bores have been put down and considerable development below the surface in close proximity to the old workings.  The mine was partially unwatered, but only to a depth of some 10 to 12 feet.  The advantage this offered was lost and after a while pumping operations ceased.  The retimbering of Morphett’s Shaft is work that will last forever.  When this shaft was cleared out a few months ago hopes were high that the mine would be completely unwatered and driving at depth undertaken, but copper prices fell suddenly from £105 to £90 and then to the present £61 per ton.  This caused orders for machinery to be cancelled and since then things have gone from bad to worse.  The few men have been paid off and the chance of mining at Burra is more unlikely than any time since the old mine whistle ceased to blow.
