Burra Football Assoc. held its wind-up meeting at Burra Institute 11 October.  It ended the year in credit £36.  The report here finally explains the sequence of events leading up to the cancelled joint match between Kooringa-Aberdeen and North Booborowie-South Booborowie – at least from Mr Willshire’s point of view.  The matter then dissolved into an argument over which club or clubs should pay the umpire’s 50/- fee.  In the end Kooringa and Aberdeen each paid 25/-.  The secretary was voted an honorarium of £10-10-0 + £2-2-0 for the use of his rooms for meetings.  [J. Allen.]

The medal for the most unselfish player went to O. Brogan of South Booborowie and the Shield was presented to South Booborowie.
