‘Where are we?’ writes asserting some illegal goings-on in Council.

Some weeks ago a Waterworks Commission was held and a certain business was decided upon, but when it got to the general meeting of Council for confirmation the Council decided not to do so.

At the following meeting one of the ruling powers from his place in the chair, finding one Councillor absent, presented these minutes again, put them again and declaring them duly carried, demanded the business be transacted.  Though brought forward illegally and passed as confirmed, even then the business was not adopted by the meeting as law demands.  This is but one instance of the muddle things are in and it is time ratepayers met and made some attempt to get the town’s business legally transacted before it is too late.
