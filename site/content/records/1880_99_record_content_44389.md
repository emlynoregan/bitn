Vandalism.  Two boys have been charged with breaking the windows of the Burra Public School.  Nearly every window at the side of the building had been perforated.  Several boys were implicated, but only three were captured.  One turned Queen’s evidence and so got off.  They were dealt with very lightly considering the way the group has annoyed several residents of late by throwing stones rather freely.

Redruth Court, 10 February.

Richard Moore, [15?] a young lad, was fined 10/- & 10/6 damages (or 7 days) for breaking windows at the Burra School.

John Martin, [13?] for the same offence was ordered locked up for six hours.

Arthur Dearlove, aged 9 on his [next?] birthday was charged with driving an unlit vehicle through Market Square on 21 November.  The case was dismissed as he was deemed too young to know that he required a light.
