Pigeons.  The large flock of pigeons making their home on the roof of the Salvation Army Hall has practically been wiped out.  Mr Harry Swinson of Burra has killed 58 with his shanghai, made especially for the purpose.  He operated at night and shot the heads off the birds as they appeared above the gutter in the light of a torch held by a young lad who accompanied him.
