Visit to Sturt Vale.  I.J. Warnes invited the Burra Show Committee to visit Sturt Vale Station Monday of last week.  [Members attending are listed]

Departure was set for 7.00 a.m.  On descending the Baldina Hills the effects of recent rains could be seen in the water in the distance in Hodge’s Lagoon.  Baldina Creek still had a good flow and at Thistlebeds the evidence of recent flow was clear following the 360 points recorded there.  At Chalk Cliffs the signs of flood were even stronger.  King’s Well looked well washed.  At Murkaby water was lying about.  By Woolgangi dust began to rise, but there was still water about.  The land was becoming green and at Bazentin there were green patches, but not much water about.  It had a good rain in December.  At Lagoon it was noted that the Lagoon itself did not contain much water.  At Sturt Vale there were still signs of rain.  Mr Warnes’ two lorries with four trailers loaded with wool were an interesting sight.

At Sturt Vale the party met up with Mr A.H. Codrington, Chief Instructor of the Wool Classes at the School of Mines.  It was said that 1,000 kangaroos had been shot there in two months last year and that was only a fraction of the flock, which for a time had turned the plain into a dust heap.

The group then entered the shed where School of Mines students were sorting, packing and branding bales of wool as the shearers worked hard at their quota.  Mr Codrington said it was the best clip for years in quality if not in quantity.  From this country about 1,200 bales will be sent away.  The shed is about 120ft long and broad in proportion.  There were 20 shearers.

[Half a column of detail deals with the nature of the fleeces and how handling and sorting had been improved over the years.]

After inspecting the shed the visitors enjoyed an excellent dinner, after which A.B. Riggs gave a short speech of thanks to their host and to Mr Parks for providing the meal.  Mr Warnes replied.

Last year from Koomooloo and Sturt Vale 1,408 bales of wool were sent away.
