Burra Hospital Board, 23 August

Mr Hawkes was elected Chairman for 12 months.  The late Annie Howell had left the residue of her estate to the Hospital after certain other legacies had been paid, but it is considered there will be none left over after the legacies and legal costs.

After discussion it was decided to return the hospital to its old standing as a full-time training school.

The secretary reported the Department had sent Â£787 being the balance of the subsidy to 30 June.  The Chairman remarked that it was the first time the subsidy had been paid in full.
