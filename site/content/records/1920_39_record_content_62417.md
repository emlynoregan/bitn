Burra Town Council, 20 July

The Highways Department wrote saying they did not consider it necessary to widen the Mine Bridge, but a super elevation would be made to the adjacent curve.

The Mayor was dissatisfied with this and he felt the matter should be followed up.  Council agreed.

The Hydraulic Engineer offered water for the proposed swimming pool at 6d per 1,000 gallons.

(To be taken between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.)

The Director of Fine Arts advises that the cost of renovating the painting of Dr Brummitt at 2½ to 5 guineas.  The Mayor said the painting had been done by one of England’s finest artists for £50 and it was resolved to go ahead with the work.

Cr Dow returned to the topic of tree planting (or the lack of it) in West Ward.

[A rather lengthy and at times slightly heated debate ensued.]

It was resolved to cease planting for the time being until a statement of expenditure in each ward was produced.
