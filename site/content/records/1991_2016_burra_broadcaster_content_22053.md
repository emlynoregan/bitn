Meredith Satchell writes at length about her project of recording Burra families on a database.  Her work to this point has some 14,000 people recorded.  Most of the data is drawn from the Index of SA Births 1841-1906, supplemented by records of Births Marriages and deaths for the district, baptismal records, cemetery records and family histories.  From this data family history charts can be produced.  The database will be of great assistance to both locals and visitors compiling their family trees, and it is available from the Community Library.  Along with this basic data come many other stories and family information of interest to researchers.  This is very much a work in progress and Meredith encourages people to contact her whether they are seeking information or they are able to add to her ever expanding data.
