Sheep Stealing has been going on in the Eastern Pastoral Area and station owners are offering a reward of £500 for information leading to a conviction.

M.T. Kellock of Thistlebeds reports the loss of 21 Merino lambs worth £73 between 22 September and 1 October.

E.I. McWaters of neighbouring Drysdale lost 31 Merino weaners worth £116 in the same period.

Many others suspect serious losses from their flocks.  The modern transport, the density of scrub, the isolation of the homesteads and the numerous outlets to Eudunda, Mt Morgan, Renmark, etc. make the police job very difficult.  It is suspected that a shady butcher may be linked to the thieves, but kangaroo shooters could also be involved.
