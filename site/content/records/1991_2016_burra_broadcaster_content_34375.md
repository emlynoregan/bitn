Goyder Council & Doug Wiltshire

Doug Wiltshire threatened legal action against Goyder Councillors in November 2002.  He accused them of negligence, misrepresentation, misleading and deceiving ratepayers and failing to act honestly.  In 2003 he also invoiced the Council for $5,995 for his professional time investigating the O’Connor’s Shed matter, including publishing details in the print media.  Council believes the issue to be without foundation and after legal opinion has invited Mr Wiltshire to proceed with his legal action.  Council CEO Steve Kerrigan says no legal action has been taken so far.
