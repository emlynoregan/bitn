Obituary.  Percy Lionel Rosman died at Burra Hospital on Saturday evening last.  He was born and educated in Adelaide, coming to Burra about 25 years ago and was for a number of years, in charge of the Burra Roller Flour Mills for Messrs W. Thomas & Co.  He arrived in Burra during the 1914-18 War as a rejected volunteer and immediately joined in the many patriotic movements then going on in the town.  He was especially active in the cheer-Up Society.  He was gifted musically and a great humourist, so that no concert program was complete without him.  He took an active role in the civic, sporting, educational and church life of the town.  He was very active in the life of St Mary’s Church, holding a number of offices over the years and being choirmaster for many.  He was for some years the organist, a role held by his elder son Geoffrey, until he was obliged to resign the role on entering the RAAF.  In sport, he was particularly interested in football and bowls and had been secretary and president of the Bowling Club over time.  He had been a member of the Burra Primary School Committee and on the Burra High School Council.  He was also a respected JP.

Twenty years ago he married Hilda, second daughter of Mr & Mrs Alfred Hunt of Kooringa, who is left with two sons to mourn a great loss.  The elder son, Geoffrey, was on the staff of the Savings Bank in Burra and only left last Friday to join the RAAF at Victor Harbor, being recalled before he reached his destination.  The younger son, Rex, is at home and is in the employ of Mr C.L. Phillips, dentist.  The funeral was largely attended on Monday with members of the IOOF, Buffalo and Masonic Lodges forming a guard of honour at the entrance to the cemetery and later at the graveside.

[Percy Lionel Rosman was born 1 April 1886 at Norwood and died 6 December 1941 at Burra.]
