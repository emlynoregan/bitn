The works were in a ragged state and at present they could not undertake any definite supply.  Things would be thrown out of gear in a couple of months by the installation of the new engine.

Cr Sampson thought 2/- would be better as you could always reduce the price, but not raise it.

Cr Ridgway thought his motion would allow sales to the public at 3/- per 1,000 gallons.

Cr Coglin would 2nd the motion at 2/- and Cr Ridgway agreed to this.  Carried.

The Council has received details of the capital cost of the Waterworks and a statement that the land they want is available at Â£50 if they want it to go on the Capital Account - Council agreed to accept the land.
