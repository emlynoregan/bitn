Burra Town Council, 16 November

Cr Cummins asked if work had started on the new Town Hall Supper Room.  The Town Clerk said Mr Clode was waiting on his co-contractor, but expected to commence Monday week.

The Town Clerk had been notified that the new sealed road would be entering Burra from Brown’s Corner and not by-passing through Burra North.
