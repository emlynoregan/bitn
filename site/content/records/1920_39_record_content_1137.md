Burra Cheer-up Society: Report from 5 May 1919 to 3 March 1920.

Though not 12 months, our work has practically ceased with the return of our boys.

There were few socials in this period, as our soldiers have been returning in large batches very frequently.  We felt the welcome at the station more important than socials.  Since May 1919 we have met at the station on 55 occasions to welcome returning heroes and we regret that a few were not met due to relatives or friends not informing us.

On 4 July 1919 a big effort was made on Violet Day to raise money for gold brooches for nurses and medals for soldiers who enlisted from Burra and District and the day was a great success.  Special buttons were designed and sold and other attractions arranged.  The memorial service was held at the Rotunda, which was decorated with wreathes by relatives and friends of our fallen heroes.  E.W. Crewes and W.G. Hawkes spoke and the Ladies Band provided music – being able this time to parade with a large number of returned soldiers.  A beautiful bunch of Violets was successfully auctioned.  In July also a donation of £25 was made to the Local Memorial Fund.

On 29 August a button day was held with the Red Cross in aid of the State Boys’ Memorial Hall appeal.

On 3 October we assisted the Salvation Army with afternoon tea and supper and on 29 October we were instrumental in arranging what proved to be a most successful banquet at the Institute in honour of our returned nurses, soldiers and sailors and all visiting soldiers were invited.  Over 100 of our men marched into the hall and took their places at the various tables arranged for them.  It was estimated 400-500 were entertained that day.  In the evening the very pretty Cheer-up medals designed and made by Messrs Stevenson Bros. of Adelaide were presented by the President, E.W. Crewes assisted by Vice-President J. Drew.  Where possible medals for absent and deceased soldiers were presented to relatives.

Navy Day was celebrated on 14 November and afternoon tea was provided in the Cheer-up Room.

In the last few months we have presented cheques to the value of £20 each to 14 of our heroes who have been wounded or disabled through sickness and have quietly assisted others.

In December we asked the Institute to take charge of our collection of photographs to be hung in that building.  We have presented the local RSL with the Cheer-up piano and also with a framed enlargement of the Cheer-up Ladies Band.  The cheer-up Room is now abandoned and we thank J. Pearce for the free use of it for nearly five years.

The Band has found it impossible to accept the invitations to perform in many places this year.  It did visit Adelaide on 20 June for Violet Day there.  At the last minute they filled in for the Military & Naval Bands, which were to perform at the Memorial service, but were unable to attend.  In the afternoon girls of the Ladies Band were invested with their service stripes by Brig.-Gen. C.B. Antill.  G.E. Dane from the Committee of the Society responded on behalf of the girls.  Hundreds of interstate soldiers were present to hear the Band, which the majority had read about.  The girls with hard-working bandmaster J. Bentley have Mrs Seager to thank for the numerous kindnesses received at the Hut on every occasion they have visited Adelaide.

On 28 August the Band played at the wonderful reception accorded the Prime Minister the Hon. W. Hughes at the Burra Railway Station and Mr Crewes presented the PM with a framed photo of the Band.  The PM expressed his appreciation of the Band; feelings echoed by Sir Joseph Cook.

The Band appeared at all the station welcomes and patriotic gatherings, not forgetting Peace Day celebrations on 19 July.  Their work as the Burra Cheer-up Ladies Band is practically finished.  As far as we can ascertain it was the only Ladies Band in Australasia until their example was copied in different towns.  Now the boys are home it will no longer be known as a patriotic band, though a Ladies Band may continue.  Mr Bentley is to be congratulated for his unflagging work with the band.

We thank James Reed for driving the large number of returning men to their homes.

Thanks also go to E.J. Harris for granting the free use of his crockery all these years.

Also special thanks are due to our President E.W. Crewes, Vice-President J. Drew, Treasurer F. Harris and to G.E. Dane who has kept the piano tuned free of charge and to my assistant Miss Ethel James.

Trix Pearce, Secretary.
