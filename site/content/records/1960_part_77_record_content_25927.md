RSL Ball drew about 180 people to the Burra Town Hall on Friday despite the inclement weather.  Electricity failures reduced lighting to candles in bottles, but this did not curb the gaiety of the atmosphere at the pre-ball sherry party.  Guests adjourned to the hall at 9.20 p.m. after lights returned.  Supper was lavish with two sittings and quite a bit left over, which was sold.
