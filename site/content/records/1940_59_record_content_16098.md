SAR has refused to allow a crossing at the south end of the station.  Such a crossing would shorten the station yard which was already too short for shunting purposes.  A suggestion that it be placed 4/5 of a mile towards the creek would make it the responsibility of the District Council.  While Mr Roberts of the SAR was inspecting the site he was asked to get the station road repaired.  He said he would try, but advised the Council also to send a written request to the department.
