The Burra Show was held last Wednesday in glorious weather.  Gate takings were 30% up on 1934.  The special train from Adelaide was well patronised.  Noted visitors included: G.F. Jenkins, A.D. McDonald and A.J. Melrose, the MPs for the district, also Mr H. Shannon MP, the Anglican Lord Bishop of Adelaide, Rt Rev. Dr N. Thomas, Sir John Melrose and Mr John McLaren.

The grounds were in good condition and entries were 100 up on the previous year.  Luncheon was provided by Mrs J.B. Rowe and the show was opened by Dr D.M .Steele.

Results are printed on pages 1 and 4.
