Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM on 2 March.

The headmaster Mr Ian Auhl asked that the objectives for 1965 should include reference books for the new library.  The Department will furnish the room, but reference books will be the town and districtâ€™s responsibility.  A subsidy was available for preparing the lunch room for use as an art room as well as the addition of heaters to another room, the renovating of school drums and the grassing of the oval.  Elected were: President, Mrs J.R. Carpenter; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames R. Thamm & D. Bannister; Secretary, Mrs J. Taylor; Assistant Secretary, Mrs D. Broderick and Treasurer, Mrs Benger.  The retiring President Mrs Edith Carpenter reported that they had 54 financial members and an average attendance of 24 for 1964.  In the year they had financed the preparation of a cricket pitch and purchase of sand for the sand pit and also library books, pin-up boards, maps, paint brushes, pitch pipes, a motor mower and sports equipment.  The staff room had been improved.  At Burra Sports Day they had run cool drinks, ice cream, sweets and afternoon tea stalls.  New uniform material had been chosen.
