Football.  Saturday at Victoria Park.

Aberdeen			5.4	7.5	8.6	11.8	(74)

Combined Kooringa & Ramblers	0.1	0.6	1.10	4.14	(38)

The game was played in good spirit, but the contest was marred by dispute within the combined team about who was picked which resulted in some refusing to play to the detriment of team quality.
