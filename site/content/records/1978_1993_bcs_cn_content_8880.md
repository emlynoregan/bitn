Citizen of the Year Award: Colin Fidock

Colin Fidock was presented with the award for 1984 at a ceremony on Australia Day at Burra Bowling Club.

Colin (39) has made an outstanding contribution to the district in the six years he has been here.  He has been the Community Librarian and displayed fastidious attention to any detail of its operation.  His input into this successful library has resulted in his being a key figure as the Community Libraries representative on the Education Department’s Library Advisory Committee.  Colin is also an active member of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council where he has played an important part in voicing the concern on the Arts on relevant issues.  His religious endeavours are a model to all Christians.  Colin has been a member of St Mary’s Church Burra Advisory Council.  He is one of the Church’s Lay Readers and is licensed by the Bishop to administer the sacrament.

For four years he has been the curator of the National Trust properties and in that time their upgrading has been a major aim.  The Market Square Museum under his guidance has been transformed from an ad hoc collection of artefacts to an excellent recreation of a general store-post office and attached residence of the turn of the century.  The Paxton Square cottage he created for the opening of the cottages was a real indication of his talents and desire to serve the community.  Colin is also a dedicated family man and his skill in promoting the family image upon which our society relies so much is to be admired.  Burr Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker presented Colin with the inscribed medallion.
