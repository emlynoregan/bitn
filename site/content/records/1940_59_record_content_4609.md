A.B. Seamen Will & Leslie Stewart were welcomed home with a social at the Institute on Tuesday 14 January, after 18 months active service.  At the same time Transport Driver Ken White was also welcomed.  He is the only son of Mrs H. White of Burra Primary School.  The event was organised by Secretary Mr Alf. Riggs.  Messrs H.E. Fuss & H.J. Jennison represented the RSL and also on the platform was Envoy Winfield with P.L. Rosman at the piano.  The Mayor, who had been in Adelaide, arrived just as apologies were being read.  Items were interspersed with speeches by H.E. Fuss, Mr Jennison, Envoy Winfield and the Mayor, which are reported at some length.  The Mayor presented each of the men with a wrist watch.

Les Stewart said he had joined the Navy before the war and left Australia about a month before war was declared.  The ship had gone to Singapore, after which he had returned to Australia before going to Colombo, Aden and Suez on convoy duty.  He had travelled some 9,000 miles before returning to Australia.  His cousin Will Stewart referred to being attacked by Italian planes and spoke of the evacuation of soldiers from Red Sea ports.  They had spent some seven months in the Red Sea.
