MNRDB sponsored a workshop on climate change at the Burra Town Hall on 7 March.  Some students from BCS were among those attending.  There was discussion on steps that could reduce a person’s or a business’s carbon footprint, such as using less water, less power, converting to solar power for heating water and drying and installing insulation etc.  How businesses can construct an Environmental Management System was another topic.
