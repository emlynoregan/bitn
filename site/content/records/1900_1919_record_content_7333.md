Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co. was floated some time ago under what was thought to be favourable circumstances, but since then almost nothing has been done, though a plant to treat the dumps on the surface has been erected.  Difficulty in drying the stuff on the surface has resulted in considerable alterations and so delayed the start of operations.  Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler have made certain proposals.  They propose to take over the mine and work it on tribute, but negotiations are not finalised.
