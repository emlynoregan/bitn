Burra Town Council.

The rates for the Aberdeen Reserve have been calculated at £13-6-9.  Resolved they be applied for.

Cr Ridgway suggested that the Police Paddock be turned into a forest reserve.  About 10 acres of it was attached to the gaol and he thought the sheriff was about to plant olive trees there.  At present it was growing some wattles, which could be valuable, and if proclaimed a forest reserve it could become the nursery for the district.

There was a further debate on the inspectorship.  Cr Sampson moved to rescind the notice of salary for the inspector of £110 p.a. in favour of one for £50 p.a. as an overseer would not be wanted for the rest of the year and the rates are in.  They had an overdraft of £186-8-2 and they had to save money in all judicious ways.  They could save five months salary at £110 p.a.

Cr Ridgway contended that if all the work for which the salary had been offered at the beginning of the year had been done, then the whole £110 had been earned and was due.  The arrangements as made were legally and morally binding.  He did not like to offer anyone £25 for six months’ work.  £2 a week was little enough.  He believed there was c. £100 of rates to collect.

Cr Tiver also opposed the motion.

Cr Anderson thought the savings would only be £16 and moved an amendment to make the new salary £80 p.a.  The amendment was carried on the Mayor’s casting vote, but the motion as amended when put was then lost, so it stays at £110 p.a.
