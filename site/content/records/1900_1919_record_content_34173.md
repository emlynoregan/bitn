E.A. Ridgway writes re ‘that’ parkland.  He says the Mayor’s comments about parklands etc. do not fit this case.  About 30 years ago the parkland in question was fenced by the Burra Corporation and handed over to my late father for 7 years.  He planted all the trees and otherwise beautified it, but all he ever got was ‘abuse’.  The Council have never improved it, though they have got close to £20 rent for it.  Cr Lane believes the insulting letter was deserved and the Council to have been ‘scandalously abused’ in allowing horses and cattle there.  I have never depastured cattle there – though three or four previous tenants of it have done so.  There have been clotheslines in the park since its inception and only the ‘present ascetic Council’ has likened it to a backyard.  I have one horse and a few of a friend were there briefly until I received the Council’s demand for their removal.

[I wonder if ‘aesthetic’ fits the requirements better than ‘ascetic’?]
