Letter.  Elizabeth Barratt writes of a worse problem than Paxton Square.  Directly opposite Burra North’s only butcher shop are disgusting open pits used for lavatories over many years, where holes have been dug over and over and covered with tumbled down closets – a breeding place for blow flies and mosquitoes right on a main street.
