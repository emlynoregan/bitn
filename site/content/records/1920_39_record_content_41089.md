Morgan makes a couple of other points and asks how many of the claims worked by Parson’s companies were developed in the mining sense.  They seem not to have employed any more men than absolutely necessary to legally hold the claims.  Do Mr Parsons’ companies expect people who were on the field eight months before their arrival to pull up their pegs and let them choose a block?  It seems [says Mr Morgan] really a case of sour grapes.
