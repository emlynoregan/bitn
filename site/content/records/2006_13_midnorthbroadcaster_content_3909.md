Evan B. Hawker [sic: for Hawke] writes to express concern over the move to sell the Guide Hall at Burra North.

Because the Regional Art Group has lost a home and its replacement could be outside Burra.

Because the Guides and Brownies have gone to sleep because the leader wanted a rest after 13 years.

Because the head office managers in Adelaide have decided to cash in on the ‘hot’ property market and dispose of the building.

He says he was under the impression that the now defunct Burra Lions Club had donated the building to the local children.  (It was previously the Roche Bros Hall and before that the Oddfellows' Lodge Hall.)

The Burra Guides and their Hall

The Board of Guides SA has decided to sell the Burra Guides Hall and has informed the local District Leader and Leader in Charge Sharon O’Connor that the decision was made because there were no active Guides in Burra and expenses were ongoing.  When guides began 13 years ago* there were 30 or more.  Over the years numbers dropped and Sharon said she and Deb Spackman decided to close for 2007 and relaunch in 2008 to get numbers back up.  Sharon would like to hear from anyone in the community with ideas on how to reverse the situation and keep the hall open.  For the last 13 years the Guides in Burra have been totally self-funding except for an annual insurance bill met by the Board.  Burra Guides have funded rates, electricity, water, fire protection etc.  [*That is to say in their most recent incarnation.  Guides operated in Burra from 1937 to 1943 and were reformed in 1947 and are mentioned in the paper until at least 1953.]
