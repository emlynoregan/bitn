Visit of the Governor Sir Winston Dugan and Lady Dugan

The Governor arrived by train at 1.36 p.m. on the 28 May.  He was greeted by the Mayor and Mayoress (Mr & Mrs T.H. Woollacott) and the Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey.  A procession was formed to the Institute, headed by the No. 1 troop A squadron 18/23 Light Horse under Lt H.S.T. Warnes.  At the Institute the Burra District Band, led by J.H. Murison waited on the footpath just below the Guard of Honour comprising returned soldiers led by Burra RSL President, W.F. Pickering, and the Boy Scouts.  The Governor met Councillors and their wives, (except Cr & Mrs Simpson, who were unavoidably absent) before proceeding to the Hall for the civic reception.  Here the Mayor formally welcomed the distinguished visitors to the town and the Town Clerk read the official address, to which the Governor responded.

The Governor then went to Mongolata.  It was bitterly cold.  I.J. Warnes and E.J. Harris representing the Byles’ GM Co. were presented to the Governor and an inspection of the battery was followed by one of Byles’ Mine.  A meal was then taken at W. Carpenter’s boarding house.  Mr Warnes gave a speech about Mongolata.  He said some £50,000 worth of gold had been through the battery and Byles’ Mine had produced about £20,000 worth of gold in two years and Curlew Mine was also doing well.  He criticised the lack of Government support for Mongolata, especially since Byles’ was the only gold mine in SA that was paying a dividend.  Wages and other expenses for the year had totalled £5,000.  The owners of Curlew had prepared a fine display of gold in Mr Frank Harris’s shop window, which he was sure would delight His Excellency.  The Governor responded.

On returning to Burra, the cars stopped outside F. Harris’s shop where the party viewed Curlew’s display, which included ore, pan wash, nuggets and a gold ingot of over 97 oz – arranged by Mr Arthur Harris.  In the opposite window Mr Arthur Harris had arranged a display of polished specimens of Burra malachite.  Mr Harris valued the collection at £200-£300.  The Governor was introduced to Messrs F. & A. Harris and Mrs Arthur Harris and then to Messrs T.H. Villis & E. Finch, representing Curlew Mine.  Two specimens of malachite, suitable for a tie pin and a brooch, were presented to the Governor.

A visit was next paid to Mr R.D. Pascoe’s collection of stud sheep photographs, where His Excellency met Messrs Richard, Joe & Claude Pascoe.

Dinner was taken at the Burra Hotel under the direction of Mr & Mrs Harry Mumme.

[Speeches from this occasion are printed.]

After the meal an adjournment was made to the RSL rooms where the Governor met returned men at an informal gathering.

Lady Dugan did not travel with her husband in the afternoon, but instead visited the CWA Rest Room in Pearce’s Building, where she met with members of the CWA, Red Cross and the Burra Benevolent Society.  She was greeted by Mrs I.J. Warnes, President of Burra CWA; Mrs John Tennant, President of Burra Red Cross Branch and Mesdames W.H. Field, A.B. Riggs & G.C. Hutchinson representing the Benevolent Society.  [Speeches from this occasion are printed.]

On Wednesday morning the Vice-Regal visitors went to the Burra Schools where scholars from the Church of England Day School, St Joseph’s Convent School and Copperhouse Primary School had also gathered to form a guard of honour with the Primary School Fife & Drum Band.  Again it was bitterly cold with a piercing wind.  While the students marched around to the yard for an assembly, the visitors inspected the classrooms.  Many parents and friends also attended the assembly, which celebrated Empire Day as well as the Vice-Regal Visit.  The Governor said he was so impressed with the school that he granted an extra day’s holiday.  [Again speeches are reported, but they were short on account of the bleak conditions.]

This visit was followed by an informal one to Burra Hospital.  This started with morning tea, after which there was an inspection of the buildings.  The Governor met members of the Board, which included Sir John Melrose.

In the afternoon Lady Dugan visited the Girl Guides and Brownies at Hallett Hall where the girls entertained her with items and afternoon tea.  At 5.15 she went to Ulooloo as the guest of Sir John and Miss Melrose.
