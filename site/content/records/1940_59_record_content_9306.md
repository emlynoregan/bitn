Trial Black-Out at Burra

The trial was sprung on the town at 9.15 p.m. last Tuesday and lasted till 9.40 p.m.  It was classed as highly successful.  Street lights were turned off and residences were darkened.  About a dozen delinquents were reported â€“ in each case not having heard the bells.

Burra Town Council, 2 March

Highways Department advises that to conserve manpower only main roadworks of urgent necessity would be done.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. was ordered to brow-out all streetlights and to reduce their number to that stipulated in the agreement with Council.

Figures showed that a truck was much cheaper to operate than a horse and dray, but there is the issue of conserving petrol and this question will be further considered.
