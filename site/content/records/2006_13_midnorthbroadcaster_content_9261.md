About 34 Scouts from Burra & Clare were camping at the Burra Gorge last weekend.  After the previous week’s tremendous heat, they were not anticipating the torrential rain on their first night.  They were forced to retreat to the Burra Showgrounds for some more substantial shelter.

Burra Preschool Children visited Market Square and surrounding businesses, singing Christmas songs and spreading Christmas cheer yesterday.

Burra Community School Formal was held at Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The decorations followed a black and white them, with splashes of bold colour.  The girls were stunningly dressed and the boys looked dapper in their departure from the customary school uniform.
