Terowie Show.  The second annual show was a great success last Wednesday and attracted c. 1,500, including a fair number from Burra who went up on the midday train and returned on the special.  The accommodation for the show was not good.  The evening concert featured the operetta: Dick Whittington and His Cat.  A ball followed.
