Burglaries.  Last weekend the shops of Miss R. Bentley, fruiterer and confectioner and of A.S. Richards in Young St, were entered by breaking the window and stock was disturbed and stolen.  No arrests have yet been made.

[R. Bentley was Rosetta, later Mrs Alfred James Wallis.  Her younger spinster sisters Alison & a Maria known as Tot ran the store for many years.]
