RSL AGM was held on 5 October with ten members present.

Dr Steele reported on a year he said had seen retrogression.  The branch needed re-organisation and energy if it were to survive.  Some efforts had been made.  A smoke social for 24 April was arranged with a musical program and supper and four members turned up.  At the annual dinner only about 40 members attended which was a poor acknowledgement of the efforts of the Soldiers’ Aid Society.  With 205 members on the roll only 40 are financial.  Last September (1922) there was a sports day which was spoiled by rain, but was followed by a very successful ball to which we owe our fairly satisfactory financial position.  The club room had been used for gambling and notices banning it had been torn down.  Non-members were utilising the room.

The year ended with a credit balance of £25 and liabilities of £19-18-4.  Elected were

President, Dr Steele; Vice-Presidents, S.M. Lane, D. Van Senden, V.B. Wheare.  G. Dow refused to carry on as Secretary and Mr Carthew will be approached.  A plain and fancy dress ball is planned for 19 October.
