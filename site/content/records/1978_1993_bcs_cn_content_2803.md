Burra Community Aid Association held its AGM Wednesday 30 July and elected: Chairman, Rev. David Thiem; Secretary, Mrs Reta Jennison; Treasurer, Rev. Brian Polkinghorne.

The Association was previously known as the Burra [Jubilee] Benevolent Society and has been operating for almost 100 years.  One of the things done this year was to obtain large print books for the library for those having difficulty with their vision.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society was formed at a meeting last Thursday with Dr Brummitt as President, Miss Coglin as Secretary and J.F. Moore as Treasurer.  The reference to the society being nearly 100 suggests they thought it started with the jubilee of 1887, rather than that of 1897.]
