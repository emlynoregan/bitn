Burra Sheep Show.  Representatives of the industry met on Friday last and resolved on recommending the holding of a sheep show this year.  Mr Warnes and Mr Hawkes were also on the Royal [Show] Society in Adelaide and had there supported an Adelaide Show, but Mr Warnes also supported a Burra Show.  The smaller breeders would miss out if only an Adelaide Show were held.  Mr E.W. Hawker, Mr W.S. Murray, Mr T. Sandland, Mr W. Duncan & Mr R. Hawker spoke in favour of a local show.  Mr M. Radford was equivocal and thought Warnes and Hawkes had sold out.  Mr Melrose was for Adelaide.
