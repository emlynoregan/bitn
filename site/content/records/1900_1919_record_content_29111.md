Fire.  Last Wednesday it is believed that fire broke out on Mr E.N. Finch’s land, but soon spread to the land of Josiah Thomas near Firewood Creek on the Mt Bryan Road.  Mr Thomas sustained most loss when some 200 acres of good feed and a lucerne patch were destroyed.  The flames licked the verandah posts of Mr Thomas’s home and several times the roof of the machine shed caught alight.  A telephone call to the Kooringa Post Office brought some help from Aberdeen and Redruth.
