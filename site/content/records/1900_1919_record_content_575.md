Boer War.  SA’s third offering for the Boer War saw the Bushmen’s Corps leave Adelaide for South Africa on Wednesday.  A large patriotic demonstration was held in the city on Tuesday with thousands of people in the streets.  Burra is represented by Mr Treloar and Mr Knapman and Nurse Bidmead who is head of the nurses who have gone to tend the wounded.  This colony is intending to send another 200 men in the next few weeks.
