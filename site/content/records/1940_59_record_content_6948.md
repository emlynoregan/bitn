Pte Don Halliday was given a social on Sunday evening at Miss D. Warner’s café.  Though there had been little notice of this short visit both ends of the town were well represented.  Pte Halliday wished to spend his leave with family in Adelaide, so his visit to Burra was brief.  He had been a good captain of the Kooringa Football Club and had a long residence in Burra.
