Local Board of Health.

The Skating Rink proprietors have consented to its use as a hospital in an emergency influenza outbreak, at £2 a week.

They are to be informed it will not now be required as the danger seems to have passed.

Cr McBride moved a new regulation that all meat sold in Burra must be killed in a slaughterhouse approved by the Local or Central Board of Health.  Carried.

The next move would be to get the Central Board to apply Clause 100 of the Act to the District, making private slaughterhouses subject to inspection.

Cr McBride objected to the Board paying for nursing at Thamm’s, claiming the family should have been sent to the hospital.

Mr Crewes pointed out that was against the Central Board of Health’s advice.

There followed a long discussion, but in the end the accounts were passed.
