Kooringa News, 2 June

H.J. Hall has visited and given three of his clever and amusing entertainments, but to indifferent houses.

Our worthy Member Mr Cole has placed his resignation in the hands of his supporters.

Lambing has been good in the district.  Many sheep farmers are reporting a rate of 90% or more.
