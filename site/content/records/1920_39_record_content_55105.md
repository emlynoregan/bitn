Mongolata Goldfield

Vigorous development continues on all claims.  A lot of ore that has been lying about Terry’s Reward for several years has been put through with satisfactory results.

A reprint from The Australian Worker of 6 June

Byles’ Mongolata in its latest report says it has discovered a new lode 5ft wide and averaging rather less than 5oz per ton: a promising find.

The formation in the hills to the west of Byles’ original show is of an enormous extent, running into hundreds of feet, but with values of only 1 or 2dwt per ton.  Byles’ Co. is the only show of any kind which can claim to be a mine.  From appearances it will develop into a really big show and it appears more than possible it alone will employ the thousand men which years ago Mr M.J. Murphy (President of the AWU) claimed the field would employ.  Just at present all with an interest in the field are waiting to hear if Byles’ Mongolata will come to terms with the English Co.
