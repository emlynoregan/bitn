Uniting Church Women’s Fellowship celebrated its 75th Anniversary on 18 June at a special Fellowship Service.  The Fellowship had its origins as a Guild in 1925.  For many years it raised money by holding fetes, but as numbers declined it was decided to hold trading tables in the street once or twice a year instead.  It used to use the rooms now occupied by the Op Shop, but in 1989 they moved out for the shop to be set up.  Over the years the Fellowship has helped bereaved families by providing luncheons or afternoon teas after funerals.  Past Presidents have included: Rev. Secombe, Mrs Barrett, Mrs Potter, Mrs Baulderstone, Mrs C. Pearce, Mrs Atkin, Mrs Hobbs, Mrs Ashdown, Mrs V. Fennell, Mrs Martin, Mrs I. Nankivell and Mrs R. Tregilgas.  The present President is Margaret Alderson, who has held the position for the past nine years.  Jean Edwards has been secretary for eighteen years.
