Burra Harvest Festival.  Rev. L.W. Stanton and friends decorated the Anglican Church.  [The wording of the report suggests that all the churches held services of thanksgiving at 10.30 a.m.]  The afternoon celebrations were arranged by a committee and took place about one mile north of Aberdeen.  Two large parallel booths about 50 ft feet long had been erected, with two smaller tents at the end for the supply of mild refreshments.  No alcohol was admitted to the event. Schrader’s Band was given a place in front of the chief marquee.  Sports included foot races and a cricket match between Single and Married.  Mr Bird (the runner) was engaged for the occasion.  He was engaged to do 42 laps, but completed only 41, but did so with 1½ minutes to spare and could easily have done the agreed distance within the time allowed.  What he did was well-done and to the satisfaction of the public and the person who engaged him.    Mr W.H. Rosman captained the married men and W. Young the single man for the cricket game.  Stumps were drawn to enable Mr Bird to run at 5 p.m. and the position then was: Singles all out for 75 and Married 5 for 19.  About 2,000 people attended the event.  The event was a great success and was organised by Rev. Stanton and Rev. J.B. Stephenson, assisted by a number of tradesmen and other inhabitants, though ‘some people having talked a great deal, evidently considered that they should not also be expected to work’.
