Letter.  Jane & Peter Strawbridge write questioning the Council’s investment in tourism ventures in Burra, without apparent positive results:

Paxton Square Cottages – profits are predicted to drop from $58,000 last year to $17,000 this year.

Tourist Office lost $35,400 last year and with $99,645 extra paid to them this year will lose $35,900.

The Mine Museum lost $22,000 last year and by spending an extra $18,000 this year is expected to lose $18,100.

The Caravan Park expected to lose $3,200 last year and with extra spending of $5,780 we can increase this loss by $6,180.
