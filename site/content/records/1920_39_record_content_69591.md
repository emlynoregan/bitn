Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM for fortnight to 15 January.

Golden Harp.  Work resumed 5 January.  No. 2 tunnel rise completed and holed through about 20ft from the face of south drive.  South drive has improved in the last few feet.

Work has begun in No. 1 tunnel and expect to drive 15ft to quartzite.  The last crushing assayed at 7dwt 8gr.  Total return on 5 tons 11cwt was 46oz 13dwt.

Max Pearce was remembered in a tribute at the sales on 21 January.  The present local manager Hugh Whitford spoke of Max Pearce who had been manager from 1925, having joined the company in 1915.  He paid tribute to Mr Pearce’s outstanding ability and engaging disposition and popularity with the staff.  He expressed sympathy for the family and also referred to the death of Mr J.L. Cleary of Halbury who also lost his life in the same accident. A minute’s silence in respect of the two men was observed.

Roma Clode is beginning to take a few steps a day after 18 months in bed and is recovering splendidly from her illness.
