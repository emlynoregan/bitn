Cr Symons also endorsed it.

Cr West then read an address to the Mayor thanking him for his year’s work.

Cr Sampson reverted to the North Ward Memorial.  At the last meeting the Mayor had told him the work had been ordered, but it did not appear in the minutes.  He questioned the right of the Council to do any work in the bed of the creek and certainly those who questioned the work had a right to do so, for in the event of a flood they would suffer.  Several jobs done in Aberdeen were not ordered by Council.  He did not think any Councillor should order such work and it should be discontinued.

Cr Tiver said Cr Sampson reminded him of a storm in a teacup, and a dog in a manger.  He thought the work had been properly ordered.  The work in question* should be done.

[* The minute authorising the work was belatedly found.  See VII, 495, 24 Nov. 1885, page 2, where it says the work was on the ford to the south ‘end of the new plantation’, which would indicate the ford in St Just St.]
