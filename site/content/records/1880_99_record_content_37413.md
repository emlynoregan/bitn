Obituary.  William J. O’Leary, who for some time has been keeping the Hanson Hotel at Farrell’s Flat, dropped dead shortly after midnight last Saturday night in the bar.  [William James O’Leary died 20 July 1890 aged 32.]

[Deceased was probably a close relation of Cr O’Leary of Burra as the Councillor was absent from Council on Monday 21 July due to a family bereavement.]
