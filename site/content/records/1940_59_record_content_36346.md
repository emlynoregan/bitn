The Season.  Only 27 points of rain have been recorded at Burra since 1 January.  This is the equal second driest quarter on record (since 1880).  1893 had 13 points and 1930 also recorded 27.

Despite a dry start 1893 ended up with 21 inches and 1930 with 13.98 inches – most of it between April and October.  Many dams are dry and pastoralists are often carting water long distances.  Roads to the east are inches deep in fine dust.

The Special Train ordered for the Burra Races has been cancelled by the SAR due to coal shortages.  Arrangements for a bus have been made.

Burra Wheat Stacks this year received approximately 51,500 bags of wheat.  This is 6,000 more than for 1947.

St Patrick’s Day Concert at the Burra Town Hall on Friday evening was fairly well attended.  The company came from Adelaide.  [Each item is reviewed.]

Burra Rifle Club fired the 18th stage of the E.C. Collins Trophy over 800 and 900 yards on Saturday.

Best on the day with handicap were C.N. Bushell, J. Lloyd, F.T. Marston, and B. Scholz.

Best off the rifle were: J. Lloyd, C.N. Bushell, F.T. Marston and R.J. Kellock.
