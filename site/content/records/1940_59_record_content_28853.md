RSL Clubrooms

The transformation of the rooms is almost done.  Alterations, plumbing, lighting, painting, floor surfacing, etc. will all be completed within two or three weeks.  Most furnishings have been obtained – 162 chairs and 23 supper tables, a piano, large refrigerator, stove, copper, wireless set and so on – in all some £1,000 worth of equipment for an expenditure of a little over £300.

It has been decided to make the official opening on Saturday 7 December.  The rooms will be available to the people of Burra and District and every woman is eligible to join the Ladies Auxiliary.  The building is vested in the Town of Burra.  The final appeal had the object of opening the premises free from debt, but owing to insufficient support the Diggers and the Auxiliary will have to battle for between £300 and £400 more.

Total donations received to date are £143-7-6.

Burra Town Council, 21 October

The cost for making the new road from the railway station to the station gates is estimated at £300.

It was reported that after inspection the Councillors were satisfied that the Cemetery Curator was doing his duty.

Council was responsible for keeping paths etc. clean, but weeds on graves were not included – the graves were private property.  Certain shrubs needed to be pulled out, seats painted and three holes in the wall needed repairing.

The Under Treasurer would be advised that genuine efforts would be made to build a swimming pool with the £400 borrowed from the Government.

Cr Lee moved that the Brass Band equipment be stored in a shed at the rear of the Institute instead of in the Ambulance shed, where it is now.  This would make room for storing the trailer pump and its fittings.  Carried.

Mr A.B. Aldam submitted plans for an asbestos or iron and wood building on the vacant land adjacent to the Billiard Saloon and utilising one wall of the saloon.  Not approved.

Kooringa Masonic Lodge installed Bro W.H. Lloyd as Worshipful Master on 23 October, followed by a Ball in the Burra Town Hall.  [Details in ¾ column.]
