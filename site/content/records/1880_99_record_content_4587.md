Burra Town Council, 11 July

Mr Gray has agreed to sell the land wanted to widen Fore St at 30/- per foot.  (61’ is wanted)

Mr Pearse, contractor seeks an extra £70 on account of the footpath being kept higher than he had contemplated from the specifications.  This was not entertained.

Over £32 has bee subscribed towards the tree planting east of the new road in Market St.

Messrs Rayner, Preece and Goss asked the Council to fence the ground along Ellen Terrace, on the bank of the creek, and they would then plant and attend to suitable trees.  The Council said they couldn’t afford to do so, but the Mayor advised the same approach as for the tree planting in Market St.

Sir Henry Ayers replied that nothing could be done re a recreation ground for Kooringa until it was known whether the mine property had been sold.

It was resolved to pay the balance due to F. Clark & Sons for the Market Square well and the Govt. subsidy to be applied for.  Any balance is to go for fixing pumps, troughs, etc.

The old bridge in Chapel St is to be removed.  [Presumably a footbridge since a new one had just been constructed.]

Work is needed on the Prince’s Town Road.
