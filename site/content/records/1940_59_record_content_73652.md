The grasshopper plague was reduced to minor proportions by the use of insecticide, especially for Eastern station owners.  Some landowners suffered unfortunate damage, but generally damage was kept to a minimum.

Fire fighters under the supervision of Mr Frank Reed have had a busy season with seven outbreaks.  Burning off along the railway line again contributed to a big reduction in the fire hazard.  Five cases of poliomyelitis were reported and one of infectious hepatitis.  Early in the financial year the office assistant Miss C.B. Murphy resigned and was replaced by Miss M. Hopkins.
