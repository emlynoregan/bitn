Burra Sheep Market

Record prices continue to be realised for sheep sold locally.  On Friday Elders sold 43 full woolled two-year wethers for S.F. & P.F. Heaslip of Hanson at £8-10-3 each.  This record was almost immediately broken by 5 woolly three-year wethers of R.W. Humphrys of ‘Blink Bonnie,’ which sold for £8-11-6 each.  2,708 sheep were yarded and all sold and even with 2,000 being off shears the average price was £4-12-1.
