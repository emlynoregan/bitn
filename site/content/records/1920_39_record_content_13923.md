Barwell Boys.  ‘Burra Burra Elector’ writes re H. C. Atkins and the Barwell Boys and after a waffly opening asks five very pertinent questions which suggest that he knows Atkins and his operation quite well and implies Atkins has worked the lad hard and saved a lot of money by not hiring labour since his arrival.
