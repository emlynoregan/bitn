Copperhouse School. The School Board of Advice has now measured the distance to Copperhouse by chain (i.e. Mr Lipsett & Mr Lane). They went from the school around the brow of the hill through the creek at the back of Mrs Lawlor's, past Mr Dunstan's private residence and the Court House, over the little footbridge and past the Wesleyan Chapel and straight on to the Railway Gate. Then to the Bon Accord Hotel and past the Carrying Co. Office and thence the ordinary road to the front of Mr Diplock's house: a distance of 2 miles 71 chains 14 feet. It will be remembered that Mr Rees and others stated it to be 4½ miles.
