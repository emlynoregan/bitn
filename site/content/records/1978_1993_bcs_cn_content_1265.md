An important public meeting will be held at the BCS on 21 September.  It will try to get a consensus of opinion on the possible re-siting of the Burra Kindergarten near the school.  General feedback so far has been enthusiastic because of a number of advantages‚Äù

Proximity to other school facilities and library

Ease of transition from Kindergarten to school

The management Committee of the Kindergarten are anxious for as many as possible to attend and after the meeting an inspection of the proposed site will be made.
