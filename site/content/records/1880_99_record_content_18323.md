Central Board of Health inspected Hallett and reports that the water supply there is largely from wells of 50-60â€™ depth plus underground and other tanks.  Many of the wells are unprotected from contamination from the large amount of rubbish in the town and from foul cesspits.  By-laws are not being enforced.  (Population of town c. 160)
