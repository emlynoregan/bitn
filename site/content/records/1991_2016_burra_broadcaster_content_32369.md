Burra Swimming Pool

Following a letter from the Minister for Education guaranteeing that the land surrounding the Burra Community Swimming Pool would be transferred to the Goyder Council, the Council has let a contract for the tiling of the pool.  It is anticipated the pool will be repaired, tiled and open by Christmas.  The Council has received the draft joint-use agreement and returned it to DECS and also the proposed land division plan for the site.  Vacswim will proceed as usual and the Burra Swimming Club will be able to operate much as usual, despite a late start.
