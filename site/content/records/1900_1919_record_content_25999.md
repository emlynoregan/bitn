Lightning.  On 2 January at World’s End the family of Mr M. Quinn and Miss Martha Hill (Burra) and J. O’Dea (Booborowie) were having supper during a thunderstorm when a terrific noise as of falling trees was heard outside.  This was followed by a flash of lightning which apparently entered the house and struck Miss Hill, Mr Len Quinn and Mr O’Dea.  Miss Hill was rendered unconscious for two hours, but the others suffered only severe pains in the head.  For a moment the whole room seemed to be enveloped in flame.  All have since recovered.
