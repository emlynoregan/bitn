Letter from Pilarna Pty Ltd expressing concern over the neglected state of the Peterborough-Orroroo railway.  Pilarna, it says, intends to construct the Eastern Plains Railway and in the process restore Peterborough as an important railway centre.  They would also offer support to heritage railways in the area â€“ specifically the Peterborough Steamtown System.
