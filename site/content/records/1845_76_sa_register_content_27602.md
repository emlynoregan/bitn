The holidays have passed off quietly.  The main recreations have been tea meetings associated with the various chapels.

Tea and Public meetings were held at the Primitive Methodist Chapel on Good Friday to welcome Rev. W. Jenkin.  On Sunday and Monday he conducted the Anniversary Services.

The Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary Services were conducted on Easter Sunday and Monday.  Mr Minns from Adelaide preached on Sunday morning and evening.  In the afternoon a Service of Song The Life of Elijah was held.  On Monday afternoon the children had tea and cake and a public tea followed.  Proceeds in all were £50.

The Church of England Sunday School children enjoyed their annual picnic at Mr McCulloch’s Princess Royal.

Thiodon’s Exhibition is at the Institute Hall.  Attendances have been fair and the views have given general satisfaction.
