Season 1970-71 was opened by a past-president Mr H. Binks-Williams.  Charles Dare the greens manager did a great job, but had to retire during the year.  This year the clubrooms were extended and the extensions were declared open on 31 January 1971 by the President of RSABA, Les. Luke.  The Easter Tournament was a great success.  On 20 March the Mid North Champion of Champions Day was held on the Burra Greens.  Club Champion this season was Bill Corner.  [Various people are then thanked for their help in the past season.
