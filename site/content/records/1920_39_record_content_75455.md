W.J. Bown writes about the recent Travelling Stock case.  He says that since Mr Pearse was Chairman of the Burra District Council for so long he surely should not have admitted that in his time the TSRs were ‘infested with a tribe of parasitically inclined habitual loafers’.  Nowadays we stop that kind of thing.  He also seems to know little of stock travelling.  Eustice did not break a by-law, but a law of the land and the fine imposed was a minimum not a maximum.  As for having a go at me for having horses on the stock road at the same time, those that know me will realise I have an absolute answer, but now is not the time or place.
