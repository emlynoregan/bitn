Rosemary Ros, Burra History Website designer from Raleigh, NC, USA, writes also expressing concern over the false impression created by the article about Burra’s online presence.  She is an Australian living in North Carolina and she says that in July 2004 she began researching her husband’s family history.  From the US she found the Burra Visitor Information Centre’s website and a very helpful information office (Rowena Wilson), who put her in touch with Meredith Satchell, who provided a great deal of information and assistance.  In thanks Rosemary says she established a website for Meredith’s B & B operation (www.birhccottageburra.com).  Some information on Burra was added and by October 2004 the site was attracting interest.  In the first year it averaged 2,000 hits per month and in the last four months the figure was 8,500 per month.  This led to the establishment of a website for Burra history (www.burrahistory.info), which was available in January 2005 and moved to its present domain in March 2005.  This site has expanded beyond local history to become an avenue for people pursuing their own family history.  In January 2006 a section was added to give the Burra Town Hall online visibility.  This site now averages over 44,000 hits per month, with an average 50,780 per month in the last four months, compared with over 19,000 per month in 2005.

This might serve to educate on the true history of Burra’s online presence, which had most assuredly commenced long before the introduction of the Burra Burra Heritage website of 19 July 2007.
