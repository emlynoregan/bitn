The CWA celebrated its 75th anniversary in Burra last Wednesday.  More than 100 members from across the state attended.  The CWA was started in Burra several years before the state organisation was formed – Mary Warnes started a ‘cup of tea’ room in Burra in 1926.  [3 photos of members at the meeting.]

Kingston St Bridge.  The work to strengthen the bridge has now been completed.  Council staff will now begin to reinstate the adjacent gardens and the bicycle track, which will need to be realigned because the new support beams have reduced the clearance under the bridge.
