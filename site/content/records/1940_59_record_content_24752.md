The Morgan-Burra Road

Proposals to bituminise the road to Morgan are being discussed.  Three routes have been considered:

Morgan – Robertstown – Burra

Morgan – Eudunda – Burra

Morgan – ‘The Gums’ – Burra

The Government seems likely to favour the first of these, while locals in Burra favour the third, which is some six miles shorter.  The Government would favour the first because it would follow the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline, would feed Robertstown and passes through more occupied country.  The Eudunda choice has little support.
