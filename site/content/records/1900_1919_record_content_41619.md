Leighton Hall AGM, 24 April, for the year ending 20 April 1915.

Membership has increased from 37 to 53.  Early last year a new supper room was added for £109 and then the hall was rebuilt larger and opened again on 8 July by the hon. J.G. Bice.  The annual dinner was held in August.  We started the year in deficit £0-6-6, have spent £399-3-11 in improvements. We have paid £80 off our liabilities and sent £115-9-0 to the Belgian and other patriotic funds.
