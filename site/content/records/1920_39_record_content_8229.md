Burra Hospital.  Four of the five DCs involved: Burra, Hallett, Apoinga, Mt Bryan & Hanson, together with the Town Council met at the Institute on Friday to discuss the present rate of assessment for the hospital.  [Booborowie DC was not represented.]  The Hanson Council thought the assessment and hence the rate was too high, especially for young returned men just starting out as farmers.  It was felt the assessment was on area and not on population, which was unfair.  A motion was carried to take the matter up with the Inspector General of Hospitals.
