Court.

There is a long account of the case of William Edgar Truscott and Oliver May who were charged with common assault and larceny.  [See paper of 30 Dec. 1903, page 2.]  The proceedings, which started on 30 December at 3 p.m. and went till 10.30 p.m. and then continued on 31 December from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., are reported in c. 4½ columns.  Kelly lost over £6, but to allow the matter to be dealt with locally under the Minor Offences Act, they were charged with the larceny of £3-11-3.  The two were apparently drunk at the time and the evidence was all about the larceny as the assault was admitted.  Truscott, a butcher living in Kooringa and working for his brother, gave an account of playing dice with Kelly that had led to the fight.  May corroborated his evidence.  The account of the money trail is intricate, but in the end the Bench found the prisoners guilty and fined them each £5 or 6 months and on the assault charge they were fined £4-4-0 in all.
