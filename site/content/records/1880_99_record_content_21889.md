Obituary & Inquest into the death of Mr Jansen who was thrown from his trap while driving into Burra on 22 March.

The inquest on Jacob Jansen was chaired by P. Lane JP with T. Edwards as foreman of the jury.

Matron Cameron said that when admitted the deceased was unconscious and appeared to be suffering from drink.  When he awoke on 23 March he said he had come from Messrs Cudmore’s property on the Darling and had called at Mr Midwinter’s Hotel on Saturday.  He had died about 3 p.m. on the 30 March.

Dr Robert Brummitt said he had been called to the man found in the creek near the smelting works.  He had several broken ribs and was obviously severely injured.  The lung had been lacerated and this led to inflammation and ultimately to his death.

A.C. Fryer said he saw the decease driving the trap towards Mr Killicoat’s in an uncontrolled way.  He had unsuccessfully tried to stop the horse.  The trap and horse went over the bridge and then a little girl said that the trap and horse were in the creek.  He had stayed with the deceased, who was insensible, while Mr Oppermann went to the police.  After a minute or so the deceased came round.

A. Oppermann said he saw the deceased coming in from Baldina: he let a man out of his trap at the top of the hill near Killicoat’s and then drove on past Mr Cave’s and across the bridge.  He turned off into the creek on crossing the bridge.  [His other evidence confirms that of Fryer.]

Police evidence from M-C Williams adds details of the accident scene.  Williams believed the deceased to be a Swede aged c. 60, unmarried and a heavy drinker.

William Midwinter gave evidence that Jacob Jansen had stayed at his hotel from 19 to 22 March and had left with a quiet horse in the company of a German who was sober.  Jansen had had no more than a few glasses before he left.  [Registration of death gives the date as 30 March and his age as 60.]

The jury found that death was due to the horse bolting while going down hill and no blame attaches to anyone.
