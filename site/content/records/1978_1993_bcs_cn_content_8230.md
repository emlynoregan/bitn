Burra Railway Station turntable has been restored through the efforts of the Burra Copper Festival Committee.  It is planned to have a steam train come to Burra for the Copper Festival.  It will leave Adelaide at 8.45 a.m. and arrive at the Burra Show at 12.45 p.m.  There will be a return trip to Hallett for locals in the afternoon.  The locomotive will then be turned on the turntable for the return trip to Adelaide.  The restoration was done with the permission of ANR and the Department of Tourism provided a subsidy of $1,000.  Timber had to be purchased from WA as the size required was not available in SA.
