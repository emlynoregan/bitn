Proposed Railway to the Murray.  A letter to the Editor from Charles Simeon Hare.

[Hare continues with an extremely long letter in which he develops arguments for building the railway.

He begins with a long account of how the railway traffic will develop.  He begins by introducing live animal traffic.  He also envisages feeding a lot of surplus hay to cattle to establish a dairy industry, which will forward its produce to the Victorian diggings.

He then turns his attention to the line’s working expenses, which he estimates at £50,000 per anum.

On turning his attention to the security for the loans needed, he discusses the value of the colony’s lands and improvements.  He concludes that the colony is worth some £15 million against which there will be a need to borrow £1.2 million.

The next item he addresses is the consequent developments in the colony as a result of this investment.  He also discusses how Victoria will have very great rouble and expense in getting a railway to the goldfields because of the terrain to be traversed.]
