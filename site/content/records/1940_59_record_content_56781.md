Railway Accident.  At about 5 a.m. yesterday one of the most spectacular railway accidents for many years occurred four miles north of Mt Bryan.  A goods train from Terowie was travelling at about 40 m.p.h. when apparently a bogey wheel on one of the steel vans came loose, left the axle and ran into the following vans.  There was a big crash and the train came to a staggering stop.  Three steel vans completely left the tracks and two had their wheels torn from the undercarriages.  One van telescoped into another with such force that it ended up with on end about ten feet in the air, resting on the top of another van.  Large holes were torn in the vans, but the goods, comprising bales of wool, were not damaged.  The accident, at Ron Murrayâ€™s crossing, blocked all north and south bound rail and road traffic.  Passengers from Burra, Mt Bryan and Hallett were transferred to Riverton by motor bus.
