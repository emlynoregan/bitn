Burra Swimming Pool has undergone some major maintenance.  Filters were overhauled and a hole in the concrete surface was patched.  Vandalism has hindered progress through the winter, but the pool is now slowly filling and it is hoped it will be filled and the water quality stable in time for an opening next Saturday.  Its season will run to Sunday 2 March 2003 and longer if the weather is favourable.  Hours of operation will be 3.00 to 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 to 9.00 p.m.  (Temperature dependent.)  During school holidays and at weekends it will open at 2.00 p.m.  Session charges are $3 and for children and students under 18, $2.  Family tickets are $180 per season or $70 per month.  The pool only opens if the advertised temperature for Pt Pirie is 28°C or higher and for night sessions 32°C or higher.  [Further details are printed.]
