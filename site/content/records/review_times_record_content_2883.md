The Ian Auhl Collection is now open to the public.  The collection has been compiled by Mr Auhl over the last 20 years.  It includes an index of historical newspaper references, which he used in writing his book The Monster Mine.  There is also a biographical index of people mentioned in those references, together with collections of local maps, photos and negatives.  The Community Librarian, Mr Colin Fidock, said researchers could use the collection once they had filled out an application form, stating the purpose of their research.  He said it was hoped that the collection would eventually be located on the mezzanine floor of the library, though funding for that was still being negotiated.  The collection began when Mr Auhl was preparing a tourist pamphlet for the Burra DC and realised that the town had now newspaper of its own until 1876 and no history books about it except for centenary publications.  References to the town’s history could only be found in a collection of the Adelaide newspaper The Register, kept in the Burra Institute.  Mr Auhl began collecting the references to Burra from that source and miscellaneous references from other books.  The collection was used in the production of the Burra Sketchbook in 1969, which was illustrated by Maurice Perry.  It has since been used in preparing the Burra Conservation Study in 1978.  It has since been used in writing other historical accounts, in tourist pamphlets, for Council submissions and submissions for heritage listings.  Originally it had been intended to house the collection in the Copper Interpretive Centre, but when funding for this was diverted, it was decided to place it at the Burra Community Library.  Mr Auhl said there was still a century of Burra’s history to write, but he could not do it.  Burra’s future as one of Australia’s great historic towns depended on the depth and accuracy of its research he said.  He hoped that in the course of time the collection would ‘attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.’
