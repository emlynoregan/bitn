Burra Town Hall.  The Burra Branch of the CWA has helped considerably with the finances and now has a spacious and handsome set of rooms in the Town Hall for its Rest Rooms and recently suggested the walls of the supper room be painted cream.  They now suggest the old stage scenery be covered with cane-ite and the resulting panels be used to block off part of the stage as a supper room when occasion arose.  This will do away with the old curtain now used for the purpose.  It is possible slides may be installed to lessen the work of shifting the panels.
