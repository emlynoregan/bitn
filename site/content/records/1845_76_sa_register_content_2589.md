The Burra Burra Strike

We can confirm that the strike is over and that at the usual hour on Wednesday morning all the men were at work.  Inspector Tolmer and the police force, which accompanied him to Kooringa left that day for Adelaide. While there Commissioner Dashwood, with the Resident Magistrate, sat in judgement on a miner named William Sprague, charged with addressing threatening language to Captain Roach, and on James Heywood and William Stephens for using threatening language towards Henry Ayers.  They were each ordered to pay 30/- for costs and to enter into recognisances themselves in £20 each, and two sureties in £10, for the preservation of the peace.

[The main part of the report again comes from the same ‘Eye-Witness’ as before.]

[The miners’ petition of 12 August is then printed again.]

The miners had complained that no acknowledgement of this had been given or received.
