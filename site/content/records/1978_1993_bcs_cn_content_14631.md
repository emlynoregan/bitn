Higher density is encouraged in urban areas, making more efficient use of land.

Disadvantages of Site Value

It reinforces the regressiveness of rating and results in even less regard for the owner’s ability to pay.

Residential properties tend to pay an excessive proportion of rates compared to the residential uses. [Sic: should this not be ‘to the non-residential uses’?]

Determination of site values tends to be hypothetical, based on an analysis of improved sales less an estimate for improvements.  In turn assessments on site values are thus more expensive and less accurate.

Advantages of Capital Value

Allows a closer relationship to the owner’s ability to pay, to the extent that property assets reflect taxable capacity.

Commercial, industrial and higher density properties tend to contribute a higher proportion of rate income.

Capital values are based on sales evidence of comparable properties, reducing the need to resort to hypothesis.
