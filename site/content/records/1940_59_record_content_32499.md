Basketball, Saturday

Kooringa Methodists 22 defeated Royals 19

Burra High School 32 defeated St Mary’s 11

Victoria Park Improvement Committee met on Friday to convert itself to the Burra & District War Memorial Committee following Monday’s meeting.  Elected were: President, L. Hawke; Secretary, C. Morrison & Treasurer, E.R. Davey.  The Mayor pointed out that any action would need Council approval.  The first move would be to grade and grass the oval.  The Committee so far has c. £50 in hand and £400 will come from the Council.  To raise more there will be a subscription list and at least one stall in the year.  A.B. Riggs has offered £20 if others will match it.  Burra & District raised about £3,000 for a memorial after World War I so surely this Committee should experience no difficulty in raising the necessary funds.  Waikerie, a much smaller centre, has recently raised £1,500 for a sports ground.
