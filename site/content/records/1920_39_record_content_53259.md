The Duke of Gloucester has given mementos of his visit to a number of people closely associated with its organisation, including two old Burra boys in Detective Hilton Grow and Superintendent Giles.  Inspector J.R. Johns, formerly Police Sergeant at Burra, was also prominent during the royal visit.  [A further reference in 55, 44, 31 Oct. 1939, page 2 reveals that Grow & Giles were in charge of the royal train, while at Tarlee Sgt T.M. Rowe, son of the late Rev. T.M. Rowe who served a term at Redruth Methodist Church, took charge of the train.]
