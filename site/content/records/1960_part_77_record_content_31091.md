St Mary’s Church, Burra, Sunday 21 August

Almost 400 people attended special services.  At 10 a.m. a procession entered the church for the dedication of the sanctuary lamp.  Among those entering were the designer of the lamp, Neville Rohlach, the Sub-Deacon for the service the Rector Rev. Geoffrey Dean Sibly and the Bishop the Rt Rev. Donald Redding.  The lamp had been hung and wired by Messrs B. & M. Beinke and was dedicated by Bishop Redding in memory of John Robert Field.

The lamp was then switched on and will glow all the year except for Good Friday and Holy Saturday.

A service of the Sacrament of Confirmation followed.  [Those received into the church are listed.]

The solemn Eucharist followed with almost 200 communicants.  After that the Historic Room was opened by Mrs John Jacka of ‘Myola’ Gum Creek.  Bishop Redding dedicated the room, which is intended as a memorial to former parish priests of Burra Parish.  A plaque above the doorway records main events.  Among other historic items are photographs of all the former priests and details of the church buildings and of that proposed for Burra North (but never built).

The church grounds have recently been renovated and the toilets rebuilt.

A luncheon followed.

A hand-woven scarf made by Mr Jack Clemson in Burra Hospital was presented to Bishop Redding.  Special thanks were expressed to Dr J.V. Peters who came to play the organ and to the choir of Hillcrest and their choirmaster John Symons and to Mr & Mrs Frank Reed for hosting the choir.  In all over 70 people had contributed to making the day a success and a remarkable occasion in St Mary’s history.
