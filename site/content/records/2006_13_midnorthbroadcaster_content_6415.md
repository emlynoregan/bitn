The Season.  The outlook is grim after a promising start.  Six weeks ago it grew dry and now there is no subsoil moisture.  Canola has also been adversely affected by high winds.  Many crops are being cut for hay, although it is really too early, but there is no chance now of further improvement.  In addition fertilizer costs have at least trebled.
