Hallett Institute.  President Mr B.H. Richards spoke at the AGM on 17 February of problems associated with a lack of interest and support and of financial woes.  The closure of the National and ANZ Bank branches has reduced income for the Institute and the M&BHA has also closed its fortnightly clinic.  Only essential maintenance could be carried out.  The committee recommended joining the Burra Community Library, but a public meeting pressed for the retention of the Institute Library.

Burra Library AGM elected President, Mr R.J. Steele, Vice-Presidents, Mrs Ben Kotz and Mrs I. Hirschausen; Secretary, Mr Ben Kotz & Treasurer, Mrs E. Carpenter.  Support this year was appreciated from the Burra Burra DC and from a raffle.  A special meeting in December resolved to join the Burra Community Library, but the present arrangements will continue until the new library is established.
