Goyder Council is considering the balance of fire services and possible savings.  This comes after Cr Quinn asked that the Minister for Emergency Services be asked to look at the feasibility of withdrawing the Metropolitan Fire service (MFS) and transferring the responsibility to the CFS from 1 July.  Naracoorte lost its MFS unit ten years ago and Eudunda three years ago.  Burra MFS is staffed by 9 personnel and has responsibility primarily for the town area and has equipment specifically designed for urban fires.  The MFS acquires surplus trucks from the Metropolitan Area at no cost.  The Council is looking at ways of reducing the estimated $52,000 cost of fire protection in a financial year.
