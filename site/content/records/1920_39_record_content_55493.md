At the Town Council meeting on Monday Cr Kellaway moved to rescind the motion permitting the club to form a saucer track at Victoria Park.  From 1926 he sais Â£150 and much labour had been spent on the playing surface and grading it to form the track would be detrimental to the playing area.  Cr Jennison seconded the motion.  Cr Jeffery said he understood if there was not enough soil available on the oval the club would get it from elsewhere.  Cr Dow thought they had too few details from the club and all would be well if adequately supervised.  In this respect Cr Jeffery thought that they were adequately protected given that Cr Sampson was doing the work.  The motion was carried.
