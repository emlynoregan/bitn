Burra Town Council.  5 October.

P.J. Rule asked for the North Ward lamp-lighting contract to be cancelled.  Granted.

An enlargement of the Burra Volunteers for the front is to be got and framed for £3-3-0.

Cr Parks thought the garden in Chapel St should be named.  He suggested it should be the Holder Garden, after Sir Frederick Holder.  A decision was postponed.

It is estimated the surveying and fencing of the new part of the cemetery will cost

£35-14-2.
