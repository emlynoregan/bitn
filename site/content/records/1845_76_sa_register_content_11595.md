The 13th AGM of the SA Mining Association was held last Wednesday at the Company’s office in Adelaide.  One of the largest shareholders, J.B. Graham was in attendance.  He is presently visiting the colony from Frankfurt, where he has taken up residence.  The report gives a glowing account of prospects and of the increased production over the last six months.  In the sic months to 31 March 6,304 tons was raised.  This is an increase of 940 tons on the same period a year earlier and 580 tons more than for the immediately previous six months.  The average produce has been 23-24%.  For the year ending 31 March 1857 the ore raised was 10,961 tons.  This was raised at a cost of £128,780-6-3 or £11-15-0 per ton.  It realised £171,403-3-8 or £15-12-9 per ton.  This yielded a profit of £42,622-17-5 or £3-17-9 per ton.  The total nett profit for the year was £44,226-9-4.  The balance for credit in the profits and loss account to 30 September last was £40,894-12-1 however; out of this the last two dividends were paid, amounting to £24,640.  The residue, with the profits of the year brings the balance of profit to £60,481-1-5.  The estimated value of produce on hand is based on the latest figures from England, which show a fall in copper prices to £9-10-0 per ton.  The Directors expect that copper prices will rally and estimate the profit will therefore rise by £20,937-19-4, making altogether a divisible balance of £81,419-0-9.

[Note: The Register printed a correction to this last sentence on 23 April, page 2:

‘We ought to have said the sum of £20,937-19-4 was the expected profit receivable on the realization of the ore and copper on hand, if sold at the present reduced prices, which, with the £60,481-1-5 of profit already obtained, make a divisible balance of £81,419-0-9.  But should the Directors’ anticipations prove correct, and the price of copper return to the former rate, then £15,000 additional would be obtained for the produce now unsold; and the balance of £81,419-0-9 would be increased to £96,419-0-9.] 

It is intended to pay the usual dividends of £5 per share (i.e. 100%) on 2 June and 1 September.

Ore raised and on hand totalled 12,056 tons.  Of this 7,336 tons have been delivered to the English & Australian Copper Co., 5 tons have been exported and 4,715 tons remain on hand.  Copper on hand and delivered from the Copper Co. amounts to 1,180 tons 5 cwt and of this 505 tons have been exported for sale, 499 tons 9 cwt have been sold in the colony and 175 tons 16 cwt remain on hand.

Expenditure for the year, including wages, cartage etc. has amounted to 147,193-12-5.  Employed at the Mine are:
