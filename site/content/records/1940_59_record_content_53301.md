The 1950 results were excellent.  Nine of eleven candidates gained Intermediate certificates and the only Leaving candidate gained four subjects.  In craft subjects eight from eight passed Needlework and two gained credits.  Seven from eight passed Home science.  We are unfortunate to be losing Miss Blesing after three years of excellent service.

The bus service has continued to function this year, but the buses could be much improved.  One is very cold in winter and dusty in summer and the other so small that two trips are needed morning and night.

The High School Council has been instrumental in the Department’s purchase of two houses for members of staff.

The new septic system has been completed and the old lavatories demolished.

The school yard is still in a deplorable state.

The Parents & Friends’ Association continues to flourish, though we lost their President, Mrs Miels, during the year.  Her place has been filled by Mrs A.C. Ford.

This year they have provided over £50 worth of library books and hurdles for school sports, which also cost over £50.  As well as providing other needed items for the school, they helped the School Council and scholars pay for a strip film and slide projector.

The School Ball was easily the best we have had.

A ‘Back to School’ day was held very successfully as part of the Jubilee Celebrations and the school contributed a float in the procession and helped with the children’s sports.  This year saw the introduction of typewriter instruction to musical records.

Sports have not been neglected.

Senior Cup winners were Joy Bourman and Gary Voumard.

Junior Cups went to Bruce Stockman and Enid Mitchell.

At the inter-high school sports Burra came third.

(Bruce Stockman bettered the junior shot putt record by almost 6 ft.)

The school visited a shearing shed at the invitation of Mr E. Finch and many students had not seen shearing in full swing.
