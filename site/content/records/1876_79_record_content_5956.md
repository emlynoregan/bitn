Inquest at the Miners' Arms 15 Feb. on the body of James Cummins who was found dead on the property of Mr H.J. Riggs in the H. of Mongolata on 14 Feb. E. Lipsett, coroner. Joseph Ford had employed Cummins for some 17 weeks and saw him alive a week before. He had been on the spree and complained of ill health, but seemed in good health at this time. His wages were paid up and he told Ford to pay the landlord of the Courthouse Hotel all that was coming to him.

The police revealed that the body was reclining with no sign of a struggle. He seems to have tried to shelter himself as the body was covered with a sheet. Walter Walpole of the Courthouse Hotel said the deceased had owed him £7-10-0, having been there 10 days, for board, lodging and refreshments. He had not been very drunk while there and was not drunk when he left.

Medical evidence from Dr John Ikin Sangster supported the finding that death was due to heart disease.
