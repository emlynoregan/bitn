‘Old Resident’ writes to say the fine old Burra Public School was built to accommodate 1,000 children at a cost of £14,000.  Contractors were the late George and William Sara and Dunstan.  Mr J.G .Sara, son of George, helped as a boy with the outside plaster bands.  This firm were also the contractors for the Anglican Church.  The original part of the Institute was built by the late James Tiver and Cole.

[Note that the above is not entirely accurate.  See Ian Auhl, The Burra Model School 1878-1978, Lynton Publications, Blackwood SA, 1977.  The building was intended for 800-900 children and the final cost was £6,996-8-0.  When the writer says the original part of the Institute he is referring to the structure of 1857 when the tender of Messrs Tiver, Cole and Sinnegear was accepted for £446-16-0 for the masonry work and that of Mr Bruse to do the woodwork for £473.]
