Deputation to Council.  At least twelve ratepayers attended the February meeting of Goyder Council, to object to the expiation process as a consequence of not clearing up properties to prevent fire.  The objections were to the processes involved, rather than to the demands to clear up properties.  Many claimed they had not received the original notice.  The fire prevention officer pointed out the anomaly in that they had not failed to receive the expiation notice, sent to the same addresses.  Council has agreed to waive expiation of the $160 fine if the properties complied with the notice as of 15 February â€“ and to make refunds if the expiation had been paid.
