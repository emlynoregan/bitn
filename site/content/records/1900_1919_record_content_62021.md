Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.

Ten applications for particulars have been received in response to the advertisement for a design.  The Mayor reported the Council had inspected the site, but the absence of the Overseer (with influenza) meant the exact site could not be determined.  The east boundary to be in line with the present fence.  The south boundary to be taken back 12-14’.  The other fence to form a sort of ‘bull-nose’ in a line with the corner of Lord’s Hotel building.  The town Clerk is to draw a plan.

A proposal to have the memorial at the northern end of the enclosure would mean moving the Rotunda to bring it into line.  Also it is proposed to flank the memorial with captured German guns, which had been promised.  There was also a proposal to enlarge the Rotunda with a verandah.
