Motor Accidents

On Thursday in Commercial St a boy cyclist with head down rode straight into Mr L. Gallagher’s car despite the driver’s sounding the horn.  The cyclist shot into the air and landed on his head in the back.  The bike was impaled on the hood.  The boy was little hurt, but the same cannot be said of the bike.

On Tuesday evening Mrs R.A. Lynch and her two daughters were returning from a dance at Booborowie when the lights fused at a sharp corner and the car dropped five feet into a creek bed, landing on its four wheels.  Apart from Mrs Lynch bumping her head on the steering wheel no one was much hurt.  One wheel of the car was smashed and other minor damage done and the car was driven to Burra by Mr Murison.  The creek at the point is right next to the road and is totally unprotected by either posts or a fence.
