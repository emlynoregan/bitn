The SA Mining Association

The Directors will submit an important question to the shareholders next Wednesday.  They believe the Association should be dissolved and a new company established with a capital of £300,000 in 60,000 shares of £5 each.  Into this company it is proposed to take present shareholders who are to have the first offer of new shares.

But since this proposition was put in writing the Directors have received an offer from Messrs Beck, Elder, Graham, Stirling and McLaren, who are now in England, to purchase the property outright for £150,000 and to raise fresh capital by the issue of new shares.

They say the object of the new company will be to remodel the undertaking by exploring the mine more fully, adopting the most approved dressing and other machinery and endeavouring to turn the creek ores to profit.

If necessary for the carrying out of these objectives capital will be increased by the issue of new shares. They say that from 30 September next under this proposal the property would be managed and worked by the present management in the usual manner, but at their risk as regards profit and loss.

Which scheme the shareholders will adopt is to be considered at the next meeting.
