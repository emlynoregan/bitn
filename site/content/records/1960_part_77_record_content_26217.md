Kooringa Methodist Church celebrates its Anniversary next Sunday.  The first Methodist service in Burra was probably conducted in the home of John Chapman, a dugout in the Burra Creek.  Services continued there till the first chapel was built in 1847.  The people were given permission to build provided it was opened free of debt.  It cost Â£250.  The present building is only 51 years old.  Rev. Vivian Secombe will be guest preacher on Sunday.  He was appointed to the Kooringa Circuit in 1939 and served for two years.
