Sergeant J.K. Weston was the 6th South Australian man to be chosen to participate in the Victory March in London and a newspaper report in the Advertiser said he was believed to be the only South Australian from WWII who holds both the DCM and MM and while not wishing to detract from his achievements we wish to point out that Pte Jim Kotz of Burra also won both.
