Burra Town Council, 9 April

SAR responded to the letter of 25 January that the timetable for the Adelaide Quorn train had been examined and would not be altered.

The Highways & Local Government Dept. suggested transferring unspent balance for Smelts Road and Ayers Street to Railway Terrace.  Resolved that application be made for this to be done.
