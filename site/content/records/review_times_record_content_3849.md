The Burra Cycling Classic is making a remarkable return to its rightful position on the SA road cycling calendar.  This is largely due to astute promotion over the last three years as a direct result of an offer by Burra identity Mr Peter Reilly to assist in this field.  He has seen the event restored to the top five; a position it seems likely to retain.  Originally a 100 miles race to Adelaide, increasing traffic has made it virtually impossible to either start or finish in Adelaide and so a decision was made in 1985 to start and finish in Burra.  In that year the SA Brewing Co. was approached by the promoters and it offered sponsorship on a modest scale initially.  The Jubilee 150 resulted in SA Brewing Co. and The Seaton Tyre Store (which had provided generous support for several years) as co-sponsors of the race with prize money in excess of $1,000.  This arrangement has been continued for this year.  Organisers have successfully applied for Pro-Am status, which should see an increase in nominations.  On 1 August competitors will  depart from Burra and go to Mt Bryan, return to Burra and then to Hanson, Farrell Flat, Clare, Sevenhill, Penwortham, Watervale, Auburn, Saddleworth, Manoora and Hanson before the final sprint to the finish line opposite the Commercial Hotel in Burra at about 3.30 p.m.
