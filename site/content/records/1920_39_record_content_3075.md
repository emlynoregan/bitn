Improvements:

After some years of considering improvements tenders were called early in 1920 for the plans submitted by Messrs Bruce & Harral and on 30 June 1920 the tender of Jos. King & Son of Adelaide was accepted for the sum of £1,199, financed by a £1,500 mortgage on the property.  Messrs James Marshall & Co. of Adelaide supplied the seating for the portion under the gallery and in the gallery itself with tip-up theatre chairs upholstered in leather in the gallery and folding blackwood chairs below.  D. Jones & Son are doing the redecorating.  The lighting plant has worked out at 7d per night running cost, which proves it was the right decision.

Mr Arthur Davey was commended as Librarian.
