Burra Town Council, 8 October

J.D. Cave is to make a new assessment of the town.

Burra Waterworks: Ratepayers Meeting at the Institute, Monday evening.

c. 70 attended.  The mayor took the chair.

The Town Clerk stated that the Government had undertaken to construct a scheme for £3,400 to £3,800 depending on the shaft used and then to hand over the works to the Council to run, charging them 3% on the capital cost the 1st year, 4% the 2nd year and 5% p.a. thereafter.  The costs including this interest would be c. £400 p.a.  Guarantees for £332 have been obtained.  It is believed that the Kooringa standpipe will earn at least £70 p.a. for supply to water carts.

Cr Rayner moved that the Council be authorised (upon obtaining the completed guarantees) to accept the agreement offered by the Government.  Dr Brummitt 2nd.  He would not support a scheme where those who neither wanted nor used it would pay, but was pleased with this scheme.  He was confident revenue and consumption would increase once water was laid on.  The benefits in case of a fire were obvious.

J.D. Cave said his house was so located he could not possible benefit, yet of there were a deficiency he would be called on to pay as a ratepayer.  Nevertheless he thought it a public good, especially if public baths followed.

Mr Lane asked the estimated cost of deepening and timbering the shaft on Corporation property.  The Government put it at £400, but Council members thought that excessive.  If the mine started working the reservoir could be filled by the mine operator.  F. Simpson said the railways used 30,000 gallons a day last summer.  Mr Lane queried the sum of £70 from the standpipe in Kooringa.  Cr Geake said two carts operated and if charged 3d or 4d a load at their present rate of usage it would reach £70 and by saving time and the labour of pumping they could sell their water more cheaply.  Mr Lane then said he would support the motion.

The town Clerk then read the list of guarantees.  P. Murphy moved the matter stand over for 77 years - he was worried what would happen when guarantors died, became insolvent, or left the town.  There was no seconder.  The vote was then taken: 31 for and 29 against.  A poll was then demanded by a group of ratepayers and one will be held on 12 October.
