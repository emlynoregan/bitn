Booborowie Primary School celebrated the opening of its recently renovated buildings on Friday 11 August.  The upgrade took place through term 2.  Over 50 guests assembled on the lawn for the official opening by Mrs Liz Brooks.  She began her teaching career at the school 38 years ago when her father was headmaster.  She recalled with great satisfaction her association with the school.  Chairperson of the Governing Council, Stewart Catt, also addresses the crowd, saying this was only the beginning of continuing improvements.  Principal June Harrison spoke of the proud history of the school and thanked staff for coping with the disturbance during the renovations and the wider community for their support as well.
