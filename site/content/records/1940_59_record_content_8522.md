Robert Seymour presents Tom, Dick and Harry second instalment.

Characteristics of the 1941 paper.

The format was a broadsheet 8 columns wide.

Page 1.

There were three or four large local advertisements, but most space was occupied by news and often the news is heavily weighted toward patriotic efforts and increasingly presentations to departing soldiers take considerable space.

Page 2.

Advertisements are mostly of sales, entertainment, patriotic events and public notices.  There are three or four large local advertisements.  News quantity varies, but about half the page is common.  Reports of the activities of patriotic organisations occupy much space here and on page 3.

Page 3.

Three or so large local advertisements.  Both here and on other pages the ‘news’ is mixed with other articles that are often war related.  They include actual stories from the war and propaganda against the Germans, Italians or Japanese, but also articles on war production, weapons, equipment and advice on what to do for greater car efficiency, use of gas producers, and on matters like air raid precautions and blackout requirements etc.

Page 4.

About three of the columns are advertising and it frequently carries the rainfall figures from 1880-1941.  It regularly carries the Local District Honour Roll.  A serial story is a regular feature.  Local news is rare, but war-related articles are the rule.

In general it seems to give a good coverage of activities in the district for the year, with a heavy dose of syndicated war-related items, advice from the authorities that is also war-related and often humorous snippets ridiculing the enemy.

Sports reporting is minimal.
