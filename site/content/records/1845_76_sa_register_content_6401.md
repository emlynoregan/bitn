James Pearce, timber-merchant, stated that Mark Allen had assisted Aldene to carry the box, subsequently seized by the police, into Joe Pickering’s house.

Aldene said Allen had helped carry the box because he was not strong enough to carry it himself.

All the prisoners were remanded to Monday for further evidence.

Charles Ware of the Miners’ Arms said he was prepared to become bail for Allen.

PC Rogers swore to the correspondence between the chisel in evidence and marks on various places broken into and on a writing desk of John Higgs, which was produced in court and the marks shown to correspond precisely.
