Patrick La Vagueresse writes re Mining in Burra.

Matt Reilly may be criticised, but he has one thing in mind; the future of Burra.

He has invested and risked a lot and done so before anyone cared to see where Burra would go.  I watch Burra kids decide to leave Burra for Clare or somewhere else once they get to Year 11 or 12, to get a better education.  You cannot rely on tourism to keep money flowing into local businesses.  Mr Reilly spoke to me before this debate started and encouraged me to keep promoting baseball, even if there are not many members.  He said all sporting clubs need to continue their hard work, as kids are the town’s future.  We need jobs to keep youth in Burra.  Matt was criticised for not saying two of the three closed hotels have reopened.  True, but notice of one reopening was in the same paper as his letter.  The Royal exchange only reopened because Matt and his son were prepared to reinvest in it.

[The writer concludes with a dismissal of wind farms as employment and the problems of Adchem in finding forklift drivers and rounds off with the sentence: ‘Stop complaining and look for other options instead of criticising others.’

Stuart Norris writes on the same issue. He was at first enraged by the attack on one of the town’s leading citizens.

He makes a series of points.

Burra exists because of mining.

Many tourists come because of our mining heritage.

The Monster Mine saved the state from bankruptcy.

As for the Waihi evidence.  Statistics can be manipulated at will.  Many hippies moved there in the 1970s and 1980s and this may skew unemployment.  A large number of old age pensioners can also skew income figures.

Mines can co-exist with successful towns as in Mt Isa, Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie, Ballarat and Bendigo.

Phoenix Copper welcomed submissions to the Minister about any concerns and welcomes anyone to speak to them about concerns.

Phoenix wished to explore around the old mine area.

Jobs for locals would be created.

No historic building would be demolished.

If a sizeable deposit was discovered they would have to apply for permission to mine that deposit.
