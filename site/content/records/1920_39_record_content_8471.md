Les Clarke of Springbank Estate had a lucky escape from death on Friday when his horse fell in Commercial St and then got up and bolted with the rider’s left foot caught in the stirrup.  He collided with a car parked at Pederson’s and the strap broke, freeing him.  He suffered a broken leg, shock, bruising and was unconscious for a time.
