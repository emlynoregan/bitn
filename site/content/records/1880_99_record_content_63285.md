Numbering of issues in 1897

Volume XV continued from its start on 7 December 1892 and ran for the whole of 1897.

The series began with Volume XV Number 257 on 6 January 1897

and continued to

Volume XV Number 298 on 29 December 1897.

Numbering was more coherent than for the previous couple of years, but still had a number of irregularities.  Since this series of numbers repeats from 1893, in this sequence the number in round brackets indicates the number of times it was used in Volume XV to the 29 December 1897 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.
