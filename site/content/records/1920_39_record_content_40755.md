Mongolata Goldfield: Water Supply & Battery

Hon. J. McInnes the Commissioner of Public Works, Messrs McHugh & George District MPs, Mr Eaton the Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Green Engineer for Water Supply & Mr Butfield District Engineer for Water Supply visited on Monday.

A stop at J. Barker’s Baldina homestead considered water from Mr Barker’s bore and Baldina creek.  The creek water is not really suitable for drinking.  Mr Morgan’s bore some 1½ miles away is thought ‘not too good’ for drinking.  Black Waterholes have good water, but are 7 miles away.  Hawker’s bore is for stock only.

At Mongolata Byles’ Claim was visited.

The Chief-Engineer said an on-site bore was being considered to supply a battery.  I.J. Warnes thought they would get water at not more than 350ft.

A battery would need 10,000 gallons a day.  It was intended that a battery be put on the field.

A record of recent temperatures on the field:	16th Jan.	107°

18th Jan. 	113°

19th Jan.	117°

20th Jan.	112°

21st Jan.	117°

In the evening the Mayor entertained the visitors at the Burra Hotel.

A deputation also placed before the Minister the problem of corroded town pipes and the resulting lack of water pressure and supply in the town.
