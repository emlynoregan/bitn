Redruth Reformatory.

Observations on the Reformatory.  On entering the gate we noticed the grounds are laid out with fruit and olive trees and on the southern side a vegetable garden is cultivated where a large number of cabbages etc. are grown.  Flowers are also conspicuous so the approach to the building is pleasing.  We entered through the small ‘cut-out door’.  Inside all was scrupulously clean and tidy.  The rooms are commodious and well ventilated and all goes to show the inmates are zealous and industrious.
