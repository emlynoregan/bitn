Burra Town Council, 13 June

The Market St contract was finally passed though payment will be withheld till the watertable is finally cleared up.

A culvert is to be put in opposite the Catholic Church to replace the entrance cut away by the Council.

The footpath from Hunn’s to Drew & Co.’s is to be gravelled and also from Bath’s to F.R. White’s property.

Enquiries will be made re the Council getting control of the Aberdeen Reserve.

Mr Shakes offered £10 and Mr Lewis £5 towards tree planting.  The Town Clerk said it would require 40 trees for the eastern side from White’s to Wade’s and the 40 guards needed would cost £40.  The trees and planting would not be costly.  Subscriptions would be sought.

An attempt will be made to buy 61’ of allotment 39 of Redruth to widen Fore St and the Road Board will be asked to allow the N-W wing of the bridge to be shifted.

The Waterworks Department asked for a cheque for their account for lowering the Aberdeen main as the Corporation did not have the excavation ready there was a charge for extra time.

The Council said that the delay was on account of the men arriving without tools and it was not their fault.
