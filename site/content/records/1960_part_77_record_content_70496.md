Redruth Methodist Trust Committee is planning to use their property as a conference centre and they have been successful in their application for a grant from Community Welfare Grants.  The Minister of Community Welfare advises that they have a grant of $5,000 for building and $500 for equipment.  They will need to erect two ablution blocks and provide additional facilities for cooking, eating and sleeping.  The property has already been used by groups for accommodation and further bookings have been made.  There is considerable tourist potential for school and church groups.  Rev. C. Hore, Chairman of the Committee, says they are much encouraged by the grant.  Mr Brian Thamm is the Trust Committee Secretary.
