Burra Town Council, 3 December

The First meeting of the new council extended congratulations to the Council’s new Councillor Morgan and expressed regret at the ill health of Cr Harris and his family trouble.

Aberdeen Tennis Club applied for permission to erect a shed 24ft x 8ft x 9ft high adjacent to the courts.  Granted.

The mayoral allowance was set at £20.

It was resolved not to sell land at Aberdeen for which Mr Villis offered £16 per acre because it was used by sheep on sales days, though they had leased it for three years at £1 per acre to Mr Villis and as Cr Pearce observed, if it were fenced as a result they might well have sold it.
