Copper Prices.  An overestimation of stocks has led to a jump in copper prices.  Its scarcity has seen the price increase by Â£1 a day without any sign of a decrease in the buyers.

A correspondent says that stocks of copper in Chile have been overestimated by some 3,000 tons and this has been the caused of the sudden increase in prices, it having been thought Chile had stocks that could flood the market and so reduce prices.  The recent low prices have seen mines there operating at a serious loss.  This has seen them concentrate on higher yielding ores and a lack of investment in exploration and development.  This means the mines are not in a position to immediately respond to higher prices and it will be some time before large supplies can again be reached.  A continuance of high prices will be needed to induce proprietors to put the mines in full working order.  In the meantime a real scarcity of the metal can be expected and high prices are not unlikely to continue.

[The article then goes into further details and explanations and includes a report from Captain Osborne, manager of the Kapunda Mine.]
