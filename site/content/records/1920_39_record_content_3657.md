Burra Institute.

The considerably enlarged Institute was finally re-opened on Tuesday evening when the Theatregraph Picture Co. presented a first class program.  The audience was large and the takings of c. £32 were given to the Institute.  The entire cost of the enlargement with extra lighting and seating etc. amounted to c. £2,000.  The money was borrowed from the State Bank and is repayable over 30 years in six-monthly instalments.  The hall now seats c. 600.
