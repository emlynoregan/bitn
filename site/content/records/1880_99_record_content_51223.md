Mr Dawes Sen. was driving from Burra on Friday night when the harness broke near Princess Royal Station causing the shafts to fall.  The occupants were thrown out.  A boy aged 12 was severely injured when he hit his head on the step detaching a large section of scalp and his ear.  He was taken to Mr McCullochâ€™s house and is progressing as well as can be expected.
