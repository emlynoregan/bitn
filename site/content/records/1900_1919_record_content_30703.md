South Booborowie Estate.  A portion of the estate was sold in the Institute last Friday.  All on offer was disposed of at an average price of £5-12-0 an acre.  The buyers, areas and prices are printed.  The £17-4-0 admission to the hall will be matched by the proprietors and the total of £38-8-0 will be given to the Coronation Band Fund.  [Check the figures in the paper, since twice £17-4 should be £34-8-0!]
