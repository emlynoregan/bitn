Burra Town Council.  The inspection of the town on Wednesday showed it to be in good order, requiring only a little attention around the Reformatory.  It was resolved that a new bridge be erected across the creek near the Bible Christian Church.

Two posts and rails to be put in the footbridge at the rear of the Burra Hotel and repairs to the footbridge near the Public School.
