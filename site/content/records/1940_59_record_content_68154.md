Jim Richards severely injured the palm of one hand when it was caught in the cogs of a winch while he was trying to move a car bogged in Gordon’s Lagoon on Thursday.  He is making progress and seems likely to recover full use of it.  The driver of the bogged car must have had a bad time, having been bogged for three days.  He became bogged about midday Tuesday and tried all Wednesday to extricate the car, but the rain continued and the Government dam burst completely submerging the road through the lagoon.  He got a lift into Burra on Thursday and returned with Burra Motor Co.’s breakdown truck, when the accident occurred.  The breakdown truck in turn became bogged crossing Paine Creek and Mr Maurice Williams brought the men into Burra.  The car was eventually freed on Friday morning.
