[Unemployment] Burra Relief Fund

The News and The Mail in Adelaide have forwarded £50 to the Mayor’s Relief Fund.  It was left to the Mayor to distribute and he advised the Council that he would spend half in Burra and half at Mongolata.

Cr Dow thought none should go to Mongolata: it being outside the Council area.  Cr Jennison seemed to agree.

The Mayor thought there were a number of Burra people out there and it was the business people of Burra that would benefit.

The Council decided to send a letter of thanks, leaving it to be a personal response of the Mayor.
