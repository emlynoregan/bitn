Miska Hauser at the Burra.  This justly celebrated violinist made his first appearance in Burra on Wednesday at the large room at the Burra Burra Hotel before a most respectable audience.  His performance greatly exceeded expectations and every piece was followed by deafening applause.  Mr Bial was also warmly applauded in the several solos played by him on the piano.  The services of a German lady had been secured before the arrival of Miska Hauser and she sang twice during the evening, but owing to its being the first time she had appeared in public, she appeared rather timid and so was not heard to as great an advantage as she otherwise would.  Miska Hauser gave a second concert on Thursday, assisted by Mr Bial and a lady.  This concert was also very well attended and his wonderful performance on the violin appeared truly magical.
