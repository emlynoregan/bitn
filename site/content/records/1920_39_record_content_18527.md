‘Spectator’ writes defending the right of letter writers to be anonymous in cases of general argument, but not when accusations are made and the accusations of ‘Returned Soldier’ are ‘absolutely untrue and dirty’.  Does he really think the Councillors could forget the sacrifices of the soldiers when:

Cr Harris’s only two sons were at the front

Cr Riggs had three brothers who fought: one of whom died and the other lost a leg

Cr Kellaway had two brothers who served

Cr Woollacott lost one brother on active service

Cr Allen had brothers who served

The Mayor’s family was well represented at the front

E.W. Crewes writes re the guns.  There are, he says, three reasons given for moving the guns:

They are dangerous to the general public

They are unsightly

They are insecure and children interfere with them to their own danger

These three accusations are frivolous.

They are out of the way of traffic.

The idea they are unsightly is simply ridiculous.

He accuses those involved of forgetting what the capture of the guns meant and therefore their symbolic value.

He is opposed to putting them in a position where they would be almost hidden – and where children could interfere with them without hindrance.

The original idea was to enclose both the rotunda and the memorial in either a fence or better with concrete or granite posts with chains and then to grass the enclosure.

He says the guns are vested in three residents of the town and he believes the Council cannot act without the approval of the trustees.

He believes the majority of returned men are opposed to moving the guns and a majority of the general public too.

The Record office window is showing a plan of the original concept for the monument.
