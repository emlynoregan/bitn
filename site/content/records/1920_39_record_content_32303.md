Obituary.  Mr Alex Kellock died 4 October after a severe illness.  He was the only surviving child of Mrs F.E. Kellock and the late George Kellock of Kooringa and was born at ‘Thistlebeds’ in December 1884 and after leaving school he carried on grazing pursuits with his father and later acquired Woolamba Station.  He came to live in Kooringa in the last two years due to failing health.  He was an enthusiastic member of the Bowling Club.  Unfortunately he caught influenza a few weeks ago and pneumonia supervened with complications.  In 1910 he married Miss Florence Atkinson of Yacka who survives with one daughter, Miss Gladys Kellock and twin sons Masters Archie & George.
