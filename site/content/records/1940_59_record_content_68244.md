Weather & the Mail

The mail run from Hallett to Eastern Stations was delayed the week before last from Thursday to Friday, but even then Bill Hopkins only got as far a Bendigo Creek at 4.30 p.m. Friday.  Stations to the east had to come in to meet the mail and he struggled back to Hallett at 3 p.m. on Saturday.  Last Thursday Mr Terry Hopkins set out for Braemar in rain and was not hopeful of negotiating the roads, which are in a shocking state.  Hallett recorded 61 points over last Thursday and Friday.
