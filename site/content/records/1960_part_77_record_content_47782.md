Princess Royal Homestead is featured in Octoberâ€™s Walkabout Magazine, with an article and cover photo. Ian Auhl wrote the text.  The article is based on the forthcoming book Historic Homesteads of Australia in which five SA homesteads appear.  Mt & Mrs Andrew Tennant have agreed to open their house and grounds for inspection on Sunday 16 November.  Proceeds will aid the National Trust branch in Burra.
