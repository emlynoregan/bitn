‘A Lady Passenger’ writes that some ladies took the ‘Popular Cab’ to the races on Wednesday and were charged 2/-.  Halfway there the horses got knocked up and on looking at them she wonders how they got that far!  The ‘popular driver’ did not offer however, to refund half the money when they had to walk from there, though she believes some of the ladies got away without paying at all!
