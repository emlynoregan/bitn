Mice.  At present mice are around in large numbers and the Local Board of Health says many are carrying a mite that can cause skin irritations in humans.  Apart from itchiness it has no other serious side effects, though scratching could create greater discomfort.  Apply calamine lotion or alcohol and do not scratch.
