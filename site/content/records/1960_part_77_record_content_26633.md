Burra Mine

In response to a question from the Hon. R.A. Geddes, the Minister of Mines Hon. S.C. Bevan has assured him that if a lease is let on the Burra Mine ‘a condition of the lease will be that the company will not merely hold the lease without performing work for some specific reason.  It will be a condition that the company works the mine to the best of its ability.’
