The Record reports on attitudes of the day:

‘Divorce are [sic] becoming far too sadly frequent in SA.’

‘Home life is losing its attractions in this age of feverish speculation, gambling and loose living.’

‘This climate of ours which entices people to spend so much of their time out of door [sic] is destroying the domestic hearth.’

‘The young people get out to [sic] much of evenings, and the old fashioned dictum of spending evening indoors with the family circle is getting to be regarded as an eccentricity.’
