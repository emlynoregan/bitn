Rabbit Bill. 30 people met at the Miners’ Arms on Saturday to discuss the Rabbit Bill. The general consensus was that compulsion was needed. Mr Rogers reported that despite much work and cost on his land and at Baldina his wheat field was as bare as the table. In the last 5 weeks he had killed 1,300 rabbits — all from large holdings near his. H. Dawson did not agree with blaming the graziers who were as damaged by the rabbits as the farmer and the remedy was Bi-sulphide of Carbon. The Govt. should assist with its production. A bit of rag on a stick 1 or 2 feet long is wet with c. 1tsp of the liquid and thrust deep into the hole which is immediately sealed. Digging rabbits out was a failure. A rabbit rate or a preserving works only kept them on. A meeting on the same subject at Mt Bryan East also strongly supported the compulsory clauses of the Rabbit Bill.
