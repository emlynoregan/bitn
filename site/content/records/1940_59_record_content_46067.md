Local Board of Health

The report of the visit to Burra Hospital by representatives of the Central Board of Health and the Department of Health has not yet been received.  A request for a copy will be made.

The house in Bridge St that Mr R. Harris proposes to demolish was inspected and was found totally unfit for habitation, with crumbling walls, kitchen not waterproof and conditions primitive.  Permission to demolish was granted.

The menâ€™s convenience opposite the Town Hall needs a new pan and other repairs.
