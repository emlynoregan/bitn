Victorian Gold.  Extract from the Geelong Advertiser

Gold mania has now been raging in Geelong for three weeks and enthusiasm has only been slightly dampened by the bad weather and the appalling roads, which have been virtually impassable.  In the last three days the streets have been thronged with people starting for the diggings or preparing to do so.  Those unable to leave their commitments to work seem unable to attend to their duties.  People having premises built continually have to find replacement labour as workers leave after a week or so.  Carpenters will not continue making mining cradles, despite it being more profitable than mining.  Some suburban villages are almost without males.  Load of wood and water are fetching fabulous sums.  General shops are closed and ships are delivering 70 men a day.  How long we will have the men to bring out the Daily Advertiser and the weekly Intelligencer it is hard to say.  A petition has prayed for an escort between the Buninyong Goldfield and Geelong.  Although parcels of gold arrive here daily, it must be only a small fraction of that remaining in the hands of diggers.

Gold digging is now a regular occupation in the Province of Victoria.
