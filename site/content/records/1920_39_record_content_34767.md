General Aid Society met at Redruth Memorial Hall on the afternoon of 3 July to farewell Miss E.R. Bubb.  Members of the Benevolent Society and RSL also attended.  Rev. E. Lawson presided and after his speech of appreciation for Miss Bubb’s work others also spoke.  Mr James Thomas spoke for the General Aid Society and Rev. J.S.W. Coles.  Mrs Brown an old member of the society spoke of Miss Bubb’s fine efforts and then presented a handsome gold-mounted malachite brooch.  Miss Coglin presented a beautiful bedroom clock from the Benevolent Society and Mrs James Thomas presented a sea-grass chair from the Royal Institution for the Blind in appreciation of the work Miss Bubb had done for them.  On behalf of the RSL Mr H. Oates spoke of her work for returned men and especially for the TB funds and the annual reunion.  He presented Miss Bubb with a handbag.  Guy Tiddy thanked Miss Bubb for the annual dinners she had organised.

Miss Bubb thanked them all and hoped the work of the General Aid Society would go on.  She referred to her work over 14 years in Burra as Matron of the Reformatory and since.  She had also been Matron in various Girls’ Industrial Schools in Victoria and SA.  She asked that the society, if it continued as she had heard it would, keep the sea-grass chair in memory of her office as President.
