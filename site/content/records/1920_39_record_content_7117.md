Aberdeen Football Club AGM was held at Fuss’s shop last Tuesday and was very poorly attended.  The club was in credit £3-2-5.  It was decided to affiliate with the Burra Association for 1922.  Chairman Willshire reported on the meeting with the Gymnasium committee, but it would mean eliminating boundaries for the three Burra teams.  Aberdeen delegates are to have a free hand about the three team question at the Association.
