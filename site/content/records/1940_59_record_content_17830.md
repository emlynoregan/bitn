Red Cross FFCF Drive Meeting was held at the Institute Library on Wednesday.  Mrs A. Tennant in opening the meeting hoped to do as well as last year, but said the idea was not to hold too many functions because of transport and catering difficulties.  A.B. Riggs then took the chair.  It was resolved to split the proceeds 40% to FFCF and 60% to Red Cross.  The meeting decided on a target sum of Â£1,000.  There would be a big drive for direct giving and a gala event to wind up affairs and other functions as the committee saw fit.  The town will not be divided into sections for the direct giving which will end on 23 September with a gala day.
