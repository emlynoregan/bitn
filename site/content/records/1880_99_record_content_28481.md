Election Meeting at the Burra Institute.  The candidates: Sir Henry Ayers, Dr J.R. Stephens, J. Harvey, W. Lewis, J. Warren, & J. White, were each given 20 minutes.  Since the last election the SA Constitution has been altered to create four Legislative Council Districts.

Sir Henry Ayers:

He has represented the colony for 32 years.  He did not favour a property tax in place of the present land and income taxes.  He seems to have had little to offer by way of general policy.  He urged people to respect the Chinese already here, but favoured stopping further arrivals.

Dr Stephens:

He blamed the depression on bad land laws and favoured a land tax to break up very large holdings.  On the Chinese question he agreed with Sir Henry Ayers.  Other than that he had little to saw on new policies.

J. Warren:

He thought land resumption a great evil.  Taxing land too severely was unjust and the £1 duty on signing a lease was wrong.  He did not favour last session’s tariff.  He was in favour of Chinese settlement in the NT on condition they came with wives and did not return to China with all the money they made.  He did not think a new Parliament House was necessary.

J. White:

He thought the central issue was the amount of land lying idle.  If elected he would advocate a system to settle the land.  He favoured leasing land at 1d per acre and was against protection.  He accused SAMA of being a dog-in-the-manger with respect to the Burra Mine.  He was for the female franchise.

J. Harvey:

He favoured the abolition of land auctions.  The Chinese who had been here for 40 years were quiet and useful ‘if they were kept in their place’, but he would not like to see the land overrun.  They were needed to develop the NT

W. Lewis:

He favoured a smaller House of Parliament, simpler land laws, thought land should be sold by tender, that large estates were a curse to the country and that land should be let on lease.  A man should not be allowed to own 10,000 acres and leave it idle.  Mining ought to be encouraged.  He would tax all single Chinamen £10.
