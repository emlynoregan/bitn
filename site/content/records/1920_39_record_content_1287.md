Mr Hawkes reported his interview with the noted architect Guy Makin who said architectural supervision would cost £150 and be quite unnecessary.  He reviewed Tillett’s plans and found the price to be fair.  He recommended several improvements which would reduce the cost by c. £200, though he suggested the column be two feet higher and a little broader at an extra cost of £30 and that both the pedestal and column should be in grey rather than grey and red granite.  Mr Makin’s recommendations were adopted.
