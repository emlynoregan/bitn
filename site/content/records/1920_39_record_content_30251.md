Ernest Lawson Hon. Sec. of Burra YMCA writes to explain the changed circumstances of the Association.  Methodists at Aberdeen [Redruth] were on the point of starting physical culture classes in May 1927 when the YMCA representatives from Peterborough visited and they decided to affiliate with that body and for two years things have worked well.  In the first year the Burra Committee paid the Association for actual services rendered only, but last year they agreed to pay two fifths of the cost of this department, leaving two fifths to be paid by Peterborough and one fifth by Jamestown.  At the end of the year the Peterborough Committee was unable to continue on this basis.  The breakdown is entirely due to the financial position of the Peterborough Committee.  The scheme is now continuing locally under the direction of the [Redruth] Sunday School Department with Miss Jones of Burra High School as instructress.
