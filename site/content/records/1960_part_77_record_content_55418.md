Back to Leighton Weekend

Rex Warnes opened the Ball at 9.30 p.m. and the hall was crowded.  Numerous pre-ball parties were held.  There were four sittings for supper and door takings were $380.  Open Day at the school attracted many on Saturday morning and $120 was taken for the light luncheon provided.  Following the afternoon tour of the Mine a barbecue began at 4.30 p.m.  Profits will improve ticket [sic] facilities at Leighton Hall.  [Perhaps toilet facilities?]
