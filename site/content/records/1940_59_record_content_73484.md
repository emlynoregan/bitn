Questions.

Mr Jennison was concerned about damage to trees in Fairchild Park, caused by straying horses.  He also asked if the Burra North Swing Bridge was soon to be repaired, as the Red Cross meetings at the Croquet Hall were suffering in winter as women could not cross the creek.  Mr Baulderstone said most of the material was now on hand and work should soon start.

In answer to another question he said that ATSA power was expected within two years.
