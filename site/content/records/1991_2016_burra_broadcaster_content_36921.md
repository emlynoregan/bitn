Goyder Council has been discussing an industrial estate site and a location for a Council Depot for a considerable time, without any real progress.  The Council Depot is non-compliant with occupational health and safety legislation.  Investigations have indicated that a suitable site, currently owned by Adchem, would provide both a vacant allotment for a new depot and a small industrial subdivision.  It is located at the end of Linkson Street.  Neither the transfer of the land nor the size of the parcel has yet been negotiated with Adchem.
