Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, last Friday at the Institute.

At 8 p.m. only three ratepayers and four Councillors had turned up, but others gradually trickled in and the meeting opened.

John Snell took the chair.  The Mayor’s report was taken as read as it had been published in the Record.

Cr Winnall who is retiring from the West Ward said that the retirement of the bonded debt meant that the incoming Councillors should not be concerned about a small deficit.  The rates had been reduced to 1d for the Parklands, 11d General and 3½d for Health.  If income from the Parklands was placed in the Parklands account then the Parkland Rate could be abolished.  The change to the scavenging arrangements to see the watertables cleaned regularly improved the health and appearance of the town.  Waterworks would be the big issue for 1898.  He would stand for re-election.

Cr Lockyer said Cr Winnall had said most of what he had wanted to raise and he agreed that the Parklands should pay for themselves.  And that the Waterworks would be a major question for 1898.

Cr Sampson said the Council had worked amicably and had accomplished much in 1897 – more than in the previous 8 years.  He was a member when the bonded debt had been incurred and was glad to have been there when it was paid off.  It was 17 years since he was first elected.  A number of old wooden footbridges had been replaced by culverts.  The dayman and curator were on halftime, with the curator doing much of his work away from of the cemetery to lessen expenses.  He disagreed with the lowering of the rate for this year as the old rate would have removed the present deficit.  He had never agreed with the need for the Waterworks and believed it to be a white elephant.

A vote of thanks to the Mayor was passed.

Mr Snell asked if there was a possibility of employing 2 daymen and was told 1 was enough.

Intending candidates were invited to speak and Messrs Crewes and McLaren responded.

Cr Sampson said after 17 years apprenticeship he would stand for Mayor.  He would maintain good discipline on Council and knew every standing order.  He would act conscientiously and had the time at his disposal for the job.  It would never do to allow the Government to take over the Waterworks as rates would then double.  The Council was paying 5% interest on the £8,000 capital value of the works and he thought that was extortionate and 4% would be fairer – no other town in the colony was paying such a high rate of interest.  Moreover the age of the works meant that considerable maintenance and repairs would soon arise.  The 1898 rate would remain the same, but after that the General Rate could probably be reduced to 8d in the £ and the Parklands to ½d, but the Health Rate would have to rise from 3½d to 4d to maintain the high level of service.  The current small deficit was not a problem.  He felt the present dayman was fine in the past, but was now getting too old and his eyesight was very poor and this would have to be considered by the new Council.  He (Sampson) had arrived in Burra on 2 September 1847 and been there ever since and if long residence carried any rights he was head and shoulders above anyone else for Mayor.

Cr Lockyer also said he would stand for Mayor.  Though not so old a resident as Cr Sampson, he had lived there a good many years, was comparatively young and was the town’s senior magistrate and felt well able to satisfy the role.

Cr Winnall would stand for West Ward.  He said that he had devoted his time to finance.  The present Council was too unanimous which resulted in too little discussion of issues.  Some better debate would result in better work being done.  He was born in the town and was proud of it and hoped to see many improvements yet.  He felt the Council should purchase the Waterworks – of course at a greatly reduced rate.  [Presumably he meant a reduced capital value?]  Money could be borrowed from the State Bank at 4%and the Waterworks would eventually become Council property.  If a new lease were taken out the Council would still have to find all repairs and money would continually be spent.

Mr McLaren would contest East Ward, replacing Cr Sampson.  He had resided in Burra for 20 years.  He thought the Waterworks should probably be bought or the interest rate cut to 4%.  He didn’t want to cut rates too fine as emergencies always occurred.  He was for trees and kerbing and wanted to see the inlets and outlets of the town planted.

Mr Crewes was to stand for North Ward, but little is reported about his policies.

Questions showed that the tank on the hill was too small and when filled in the evening was empty by morning.  Mr Davis asked that the Council move to prevent the spread of the several ‘irrigation colonies’ now being worked in the town.
