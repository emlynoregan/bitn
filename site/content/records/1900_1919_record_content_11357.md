Short & Sharp

There will be a Continental in Father Redden’s garden on 29 September.

It is said Billy Barkley intends to start in business on his own in Kooringa.

Mr W. Pryor’s thumb is likely to be useful again.

Notice.  Owing to Mr R.M. Harvey’s leaving for Victoria he is disposing of his collection of ferns through F. Harris at whose shop they will be on view.
