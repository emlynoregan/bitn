Burra Hospital

Two plans for enlarging the present Hospital by Mr Dean Berry, Adelaide architect, went to the Board on Friday.

The old building is modified and renovated and additions made with an estimated cost of £73,000.  The result is a complex with several levels and resulting inconveniences.

A T-shaped addition to the Maternity Wing is built with a front facing east and the present Hospital becomes the Nurses Quarters.  The estimated cost is £78,000, but all the building would be conveniently located.

Both plans are much costlier than anticipated.  The question now is whether the district can build additions valued at £73-78,000.  It is also doubtful if the Government would subsidise a plan to that figure, while it seems likely to subsidise one to £50,000.  If the Government limited its contribution to £25,000, the District would have to find £53,000.  Perhaps with wool selling at 1/- an ounce it is, after all, not impossible.
