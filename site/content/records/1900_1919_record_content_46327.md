Hospital Board & Local Board of Health.

During the late epidemic of enteric (typhoid) fever the Burra Hospital sent accounts totalling over £300 to the Local Board of Health.  The Local Board of Health received them, but took no action, holding that it had not authorised the admission of the patients, nor had it made any agreement to pay.  Eventually they asked for a conference with the Hospital Board for last Thursday.

Also present were the Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey & Burra Hospital Secretary, Mr F. Treloar.

Mr Crewes said an attempt at an agreement had been made years before, but had failed.  He believed the Local Board should be responsible only for the debts of the destitute.

Mr Winnall said:

The Local Board was responsible for isolation cases of infectious disease.

They could make arrangements with anybody to that end and would be responsible for such payments as agreed upon.

There were two doctors in town: one was health officer.

The Hospital held that the Local Board was responsible for all cases admitted by the health officer even without an agreement: a view endorsed by Dr Morrison, the Inspector General of Hospitals.

The Hospital Board could stand by the law and refuse to admit cases without authority.

The Local board would have either to provide authority or find another place of isolation.

As for those already admitted it was a question of whether the Local Board would stand behind the law or treat the matter in a fairer spirit and accept responsibility.

They could collect the fees from the patients and hand them on to the Hospital.

If the Local Board attempted to evade payment the Hospital could refuse all infectious cases.

Something had to be done, as the Hospital could not meet its liabilities.

[Mr Winnall then said that in Adelaide they paid 30/- per week for infectious cases and he thought that would serve, BUT as typhoid cases were not dearer to treat than non-infectious diseases the hospital should waive its claim in that respect.  This seems odd since the whole issue of the £300 liability arose over a typhoid outbreak and if the hospital waived its claim for that against the Local Board presumably much of the £300 would remain their problem.  Presumably all that Mr Winnall was prepared to waive was the gap between normal charges and infectious disease charges because typhoid treatment actually involved no greater cost.]

Mr Winnall said at Kapunda the Local Board paid a flat £40 p.a. and at Jamestown it was £30 – as a sort of insurance premium.
