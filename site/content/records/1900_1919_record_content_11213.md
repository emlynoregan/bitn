Editorial on: The Embezzlement Case

The editor expresses the view in light of the evidence that Mr Jordan acted precipitously and without discretion and that while Barkley may have acted without authority and indiscreetly, he did not act dishonestly and did not personally profit from his actions.  The matter had much better been dealt with quietly with an explanation and a reprimand if necessary.
