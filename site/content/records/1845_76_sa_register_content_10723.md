Kapunda Railway

The Chief Secretary has moved in Parliament for a Select Committee to report on the plans, estimates and probable traffic of the Gawler-Kapunda railway line.  He said it was Government policy to extend the means of communication in the colony and they had decided on extending the Gawler railway to Kapunda.  They had in mind serving the Burra Burra Mine and opening up agricultural land in the north.  Although there were plans for extensions to Burra and the Murray, it was not at present intended to go beyond Kapunda.  The manager of the Copper Co. assured them that when the line reached Gawler their traffic would be diverted from the Gulf Road.  This traffic of 25,000 tons would soon wear out a main line of common road and north of Gawler the Bay of Biscay soil would greatly increase the costs of road construction.  Time was money and this applied to the farmer seeking to get his produce to market regardless of the season and also to the labourer going for a job.

[The Chief Secretary gives a lengthy speech in which he outlines the benefits of railways generally and of the Kapunda line in particular.  He goes into costs and profits.  For example he cites figures to show that a railway line from Port Adelaide to Burra, of 105 miles, could be run at a profit on the basis of the Copper Companyâ€™s traffic alone.  He also speaks of tramways and dismisses them as not cost effective.]
