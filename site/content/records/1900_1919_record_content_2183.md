Boer War.  Last Saturday the city of Adelaide was blazing with bunting and mad with rejoicing as troops returned from Africa.  There was a great crowd that waited long and with good humour.  At the Exhibition Building the audience was most enthusiastic with every patriotic remark bringing cheers.  The troops then marched to the Parade Ground to be dismissed.  Rejoicing went on far into the night.
