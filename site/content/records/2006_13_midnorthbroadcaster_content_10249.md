Phoenix Copper has bought the privately owned Leigh Creek Copper Mining and its copper producing Mountain of Light mine.  This will move the company from being an exploration company to a copper producer within months of the deals completion.  This move complements the current exploration success at their Princess Royal tenement, the potential around the Burra open pit and the recent acquisition of the contiguous line of tenements from Burra to Kapunda, according to Mr Paul Dowd, Managing Director.
