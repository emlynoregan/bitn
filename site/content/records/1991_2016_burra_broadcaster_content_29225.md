The Pens Family have given a wooden doll to the Burra National Trust.  The doll named Sam, is said to have been carved by a soldier in a WWI army camp and was given to the Pens children Neta, Nell, Tom and Bill by Jack Winchester, who lived on a station near Bendigo Station.  The Pens family (Vida, Jack and children) lived at Bendigo, where Jack Pens was the manager.  Sam was much loved and had a rather hard life, which included several changes of clothes over the years.
