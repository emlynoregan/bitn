Editorial which calls for the damming of Burra Creek.  A dam somewhere near the bridge by the bowling green would create a reservoir stretching back beyond the old flour mill.  Perhaps the wings of the old bridge could be used as part of the dam.  The dam would contain a small flood gate to allow surplus water to get away.  This would create a swimming pool, a body of water sufficient for small regattas and the banks would become really good memorial gardens.  The necessary knowledge and machinery is readily available.  Finance could come from the swimming pool fund and the Burra Seaside Picnic Committee.  Burra Town Council should take the initiative.
