Four unnumbered pages marking the 25th anniversary of the Burra Community School

Page 1 carried advertisements from the Burra Record – Matthews Emporium 1968 & 1976 & Bence’s 1968.

And a collage of clippings from 1976.

Page 2 was a reprint from the Northern Argus 4 April 1978 and three photos of BCS in 1978.

Page 3 carried the program of the celebrations.

Page 4 carried reminiscences of Burra School & Community News

Some of the points:

BSCN began in 1978, the year the school opened with 456 students compared with this year’s 270.

Ron Thamm was the School Council Chairman.

BSCN was printed on an offset press purchased for $6,000 by the School Council.

It began as a solo effort by Cynthia Burnett, but soon became community based with a group of volunteers.

At first it was supported by Burra Apex and later, when it was commercially printed, by them and a series of sponsors and individual donors.
