Rabobank SuperCycle comes to Burra today.  This is SAâ€™s most demanding cycling fundraiser.  24 cyclists and support crews arrive today.  They are raising funds for vital family-style accommodation in Adelaide for country cancer patients and their families while receiving treatment in the city.  They will cover 1,000 km.
