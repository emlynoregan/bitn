Burra & Districts Tennis Club has received a state government grant of $50,000, which will enable a complete overhaul of the Burra North tennis courts.  The plan is to install synthetic grass courts.  These are expected to have a life of 20 years, compared with the attention needed to hard surfaces every five years.
