Burra Mine.  Boring was to have ceased on 11 November, but owing to the discovery of a magnificent lode of high grade ore the directors have decided to continue the work to prove the find.  There is nothing to prevent the property from being worked – ‘unless it is expected to scoop up moulded pence as well as maleable [sic] copper’
