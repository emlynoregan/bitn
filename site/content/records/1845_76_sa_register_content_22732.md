The Bushmen’s Home.  ‘A Subscriber’ writes as a bushman suggesting that the intention to locate such an institution in Burra is a mistake and the city is a far more useful location.  He goes on to ask why anyone would choose Burra if they had endured one to three years of living in remote areas and then wanted a bit of a spell.  ‘Who would choose such a hole as the Bon Accord Mine or the Burra to enjoy themselves?  I am sure I would not, and I am also sure that very few will.’

‘The generality of bushmen are a shade above the natives, some of them being well-educated and intelligent men, and know full well the enjoyments of a civilized life, and at intervals will have them, cost what it will.’

Sailor’s Homes have been a success precisely because they are in or close to the principal cities and so the inmates could go and enjoy themselves according to their different inclinations.

‘The idea of a Bushmen’s Home is a splendid proposition, and I should like to see it prove a success.’
