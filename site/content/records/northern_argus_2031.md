Burra National Trust.  President Maureen Wright reported on the year in a Christmas letter to members.

1986 had been a very busy year:

The Bon Accord Mine site and Museum had been restored and the displays established.

Enamel interpretive signs had been erected at most of the Trust sites with brown routed wood digns at entrances.

1987 would also see much activity:

Attention will focus on Redruth Gaol using a $50,000 grant from the Commonwealth Bank.

A photographic record of all Burra buildings is planned.

A home for Burraâ€™s three retired fire engines is planned.

Kotz Cotage is to be transferred to the National Trust.
