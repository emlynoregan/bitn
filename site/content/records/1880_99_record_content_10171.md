Editorial on the ratepayers’ meeting.

£400 had been borrowed for a town survey, but the survey would cost £1,000 to £1,200 and this, even if available, could not be justified.  To what purpose then should this sum be applied?  All money, including previous loans have now been spent and unless all work is to cease this £400 must be employed or another overdraft secured.
