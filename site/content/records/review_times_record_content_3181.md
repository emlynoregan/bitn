Heritage Adviser

At the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC a visiting officer with the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley, suggested that Burra appoint an expert heritage adviser.  The Council recently proposed to for a Heritage Committee.  Mr Womersley said a professional expert might prove more useful, as committees did not usually cone to unanimous decisions, leaving the Council in the same sort of dilemma that they had recently faced over the changes to Market Square.  An adviser could assess and integrate community ideas, could advise Council directly on heritage matters and could help inform citizens on what conservation needed to be done and how that could be achieved.  If Burra currently had 30,000 visitors this could be 100,000 by 1996.  He said an adviser could be appointed for two years and a grant would probably be available for two-thirds of his or her salary.  He said that part of the problem with Market Square was that a series of people did not understand all the implications.  ‘More discussions earlier in the piece would have been better.’

Cr Kellock thought that the committee would get a cross-section of views, whereas an adviser was back to a single opinion.  Cr Woolley thought that even with two-thirds of the salary coming from a grant they would have to find some $8,000, which was a concern.  The Chairman said the idea was a new concept and needed a lot more thought before any action was taken.

‘He asked that Mr Womersley’s staff prepare a report into the proposal for the July meeting of council so council would have the option of calling a public meeting before grant applications were due.
