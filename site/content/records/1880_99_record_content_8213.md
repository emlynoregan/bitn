South Ward Election Meeting.

Few attended.

P. Lane asked for a summary of work done in the ward.

Cr Ward said they had spent £744-17-6 leaving the ward £111-13-6 in debt and with that and the £100 owing to Middle Ward there would be about £64 to spend in the coming year.

Mr J. Jenkin asked about the town survey and was told it required about another £200 or £300.

Cr Ward said the whole subsidy had been obtained this year.

Candidates for 1883:

W. Pearce Sen. had nothing to say to the purpose.

A. Harris also had nothing to say.

There was considerable, but inconsequential chatter about the town survey.

Cr Sampson in answer to a question said he had voted for the new footbridge in Chapel Street, which had since been removed.

He accused Crs Geake and Ward of being in collusion which would have led to acrimony had the chair not ruled both Cr Sampson and Geake out of order and brought to an end ‘a most tedious and unprofitable meeting.’
