Editorial on The Waterworks.

The whole affair seems quite mysterious.  Presumably the Government is considering what concessions it will make re the new lease – if it doesn’t make concessions the Corporation might as well hand the works over to the Government at least for a time.  Pipes similar to those used in Burra have been tested and found to have a life of about 14 years.  The Mayor is thus of the opinion that in 1899 the pipes will have to be re-laid in the town.  The procrastination of the Government may be to the advantage of the ratepayers. Supposing the cost of pipes in 1899 to be only small, during the next year a large sum will have to be expended in both the pumping plant and the reservoir or as it is better known ‘the tank on the hill’.  New connections are continually being made, including a recent 1½” service to the Reformatory.  The mains in town are only 4”.  If half the ratepayers used the water to the extent for which they pay rates the system would not cope.  A revolution in the whole concern is needed.  Under even the most favourable circumstances the Council will do well to look before they leap.  Even with a reduction in the capital account and the interest the whole matter is one of dubious speculation.
