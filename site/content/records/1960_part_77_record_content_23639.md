Fire.  The large fire on Sunday 21 February gave Farrell Flat an uneasy time.  Strong southwest winds and a temperature in excess of 100Â°F blew the flames from Mintaro towards Farrell Flat.  Several times men fighting the fire were in danger of being trapped in pockets of fire.  Units managed to check the fire three miles south of the town and a wind change swept it northeast* until it was checked at the stone wall on the Clare-Farrell Flat Road.  There were heavy losses of sheep, fodder and fencing.

[* The description suggests it was swept northwest rather than northeast.]
