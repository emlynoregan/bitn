Burra Town Council

Having collected over £800 in rates the Council has paid off the bank overdraft of over £300 together with bonds and coupons of about £350 and is still in credit in the general account by £93 and hopes to end the year with a clean sheet.

Burra Hospital.  The number of patients has fallen to 32.  [Typhoid outbreak over.]

Mr W. Bentley will offer a drawing class at the Institute beginning on Wednesday 3 July.
