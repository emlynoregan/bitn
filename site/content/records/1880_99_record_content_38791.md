Accidents.  On Monday Harry Vivian of the Commercial Hotel was driving Mr Simpson of Hamley Bridge to the railway station when the trap collided with that of Mr Thomas of Copperhouse.  Both men were thrown out and rather bruised and shaken.

On Monday afternoon a man fell from a cart near the Kooringa Hotel when the horse plunged and he was taken to hospital senseless, but is now recovering.

Ratepayers’ Meeting.  15November at the Institute with P. Lane in the chair.

The Mayor, T.W. Wilkinson, presented his report.

The year began with the general account in credit £77-16-6.  Rates brought in £556-16-3 which other income increased to £752-19-9.  [Though the actual figures cited do not add up to this.]

Expenditure included salaries etc., £75-15-3, redemption of bonds £200, coupons £75, public works £266-16-6 and other items to a total of £740-12-5.  This leaves the account in credit £12-7-4, with £125 expected soon as Government subsidy.

The Local Board of Health began in debt £52-15-8.  Income was £164-3-4 and the year will end in debt an estimated £42-10-6.

The Parklands account began with a debit of £24-9-7.  A bond of £100 fell due and other expenditure brought expenses to £155-13-0.  With an income of £140-1-2 the account ends in debit £40-1-5.

The Cemetery began with a credit of £40-14-0, received £40-7-0, spent £15-17-1 and so ends in credit £65-3-11.

The Bonded Debt is presently £1,700, with £300 paid off in the last year.
