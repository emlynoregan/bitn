31 December 1918 the Institute was in credit £14-6-2.

31 December 1919 it was in debit £8.

Considering the purchase of a new piano for £134-11-6 this is a good outcome.

The Choral Classes have done good work, though restricted by the demands of patriotic work, but a first class concert was given on 10 December by Institute Classes assisted by Adelaide artists.

The Delco lighting system installed in August 1918 has been a boon to all concerned.  The cost of running at 7d a night or 3/6 a week plus 10/- a week for oversight is most economical.  We hope to take up the question of alterations and enlargement of the hall in the coming year.
