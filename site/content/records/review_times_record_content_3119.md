Drama at Redruth Gaol

A feature of the Copper festival will be a drama at Redruth Gaol.  It will bring to life the old days of the gaol and reformatory and will be staged 11 & 12 October, with a special schools presentation on 10 October.  It will cost $20,000 and will be exciting and challenging.  Drama students from Flinders University have been researching the mining, church, pastoralists, pastimes, education and architecture of early Burra.  Twenty residents have already provided oral histories of the gaol and what they can remember of its folklore.  There will also be a serious study of the nature of crime in this area in the nineteenth century.  The differences between life in the gaol and the reformatory will be explained.  Parts of the performance may involve folk dancing, bush and choral music, pyrotechnics, giant puppets, kites, readings and re-enactments, film, video and street pageants as well as more conventional scripted theatre.  The aim is to celebrate and record links with the townâ€™s past.  The audience is likely to move through different parts of the gaol as the performance goes on.  As well as the drama students, the performance is being organised by the Burra branches of the Arts Council, the Copper Festival Committee, the National Trust and Senior Citizens as well as involving the District Council and the school.
