Burra Town Council, 1 March

The Local Government Department asks Council to adopt new model by-laws 1-26 to replace old by-laws 1-29.  Referred to solicitor for attention.

Permanent Survey marks have been made near Justice Lane and William Road.  [William Road?]

Messrs Halls & Bevan ask for cab licences at the same fees as last year.

Cr Dow said Council had no power to reduce the fees and moved they be granted at ordinary fees and Cr Worth seconded.

Cr Kellaway said they had reduced fees for 5 or 10 years and moved that a refund of fees be made as heretofore.

Cr Jennison would not second an illegal move and the original motion was carried.

Cr Dow asked if the ranger had resigned: because cows and dogs were becoming a problem.

Contractors renewing the Mine Bridge are to be asked to erect signs.

Local Board of Health

There was a discussion over the fouling of creeks.  One place was near Lewis’s Bridge and another behind the Burra Hotel.

It was decided to have a general inspection of the town on 9 March.

There was also discussion of dog and mosquito nuisance.

Redruth Christian Endeavour held its annual rally on 20 & 21 February.  There was a song service at 7.30 and a general rally at 8 p.m. when about 150 were present.  Visitors came from Adelaide, Hallett and Jamestown.
