Local Board of Health

Odour from the drainage pit at the bacon factory was very offensive and the owner, Mr Davies, will be asked to discuss the matter with the Board.

The Chairman, Mr Woollacott, said Mr Davies had spent about £80 sinking the pit on the site chosen by Council.  He could not be asked to go on spending money.

Cr Carpenter said the pit posed a health danger to the community – he feared malaria if infected soldiers returned and mosquitoes could spread the infection.
