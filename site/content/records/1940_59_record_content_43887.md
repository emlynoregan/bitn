Characteristics of the 1949 paper

Page 1

This carries most of the news items, well set out and with suitable headlines.

There are a couple of larger advertisements.

Page 2

Smaller Advertisements dominate, especially local sales, Burra Talkies, public notices and a ‘Cash Column’ of brief advertisements, though this often migrates to other pages.

Page 3

Further news is mixed with advertisements and sometimes page 2 type material spills over.

Pages 4-8

Advertising dominates with perhaps 1 or 2 major items of interest including the sports results, or a small group of shorter items.  Total non-advertising rarely exceeds 1 of the 5 columns.

Numbering of issues in 1949

The issues are numbered consistently from 1 on 11 January to 50 on 20 December.

The volume numbers are however, chaotic.

The year starts with Volume 72 which runs from No. 1 on 11 January to No. 4 on 1 February.

Volume 73 then runs from No. 5 on 8 February to No. 38 on 27 September.

Volume 74 then runs from No. 39 on 4 October to No. 41 on 18 October.

Volume 75 then runs from No. 42 on 25 October to No. 50 on 20 December.

Numbering of pages is also incoherent in many hard copy issues of the paper.  Where there is an issue with the page numbering, the notes follow the page numbering used in TROVE.
