The chairman discussed the agreement with the Government to sink the main shaft to 40ft below water level, but presently the main work was in opening up the Golden Harp – the consequence of which should become apparent in three months.

South drive No. 2 tunnel is breaking good ore.

Face drive in the south end looks promising.
