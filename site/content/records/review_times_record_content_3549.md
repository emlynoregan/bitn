The Burra Show was described by the Show Society’s President Mr J.G. Duncan as probably the best for ten years.  Attendance was between 3,000 and 4,000 and gate takings were about $4,000, which the secretary Mrs J. Jamieson said would have been a record.  The central theme for the show was wool and the blade shearing demonstrations created a lot of interest.  One display that drew a lot of interest was the fleece from the ram that sold for $102,000 at the Royal Adelaide Show recently.  The Grand Parade included Jim Kelly’s bullock team, which was a grand sight.  [A few results are printed.]
