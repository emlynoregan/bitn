Sale.  The former Smelters’ Home Hotel, also known as Opie’s Flats, will be auctioned by elders on 2 May.  It began as a hotel in 1849 when Mr J. Robins was licensee.  It was then newly built, standing at the extreme northern end of section 1 – the original section taken by the SA Mining Association.  After changing hands several times, the licence passed to W. Woollacott in 1861 (famous for hauling the giant boiler from Pt Adelaide to Burra on the jinker now housed adjacent to Market Square).  The Opie family acquired it in 1863 and it became known as Opie’s Hotel.  It was de-licensed about 19221.  Ian Auhl says it is believed to be the oldest hotel in SA still in its original condition, having been converted into flats just by closing doors along a passageway leading from the bar to the rear of the building.  It retains its shingle roof under the galvanised iron.  The walls are eighteen inches thick and there is a large dry cellar under the bar.  The building has casement windows throughout2.  The building has eighteen rooms and is of about 40 squares set on an acre of land with more than 200 foot frontage to the Barrier Highway.  There is a large underground tank and the remains of a stone stable.  It is on the recorded list of the National Trust.  The current owners are Gerry & Carmel O’Connor.

[1It closed in 1917 and the licence was transferred to the Booborowie Hotel.

2This is nearly true, but there are a couple of double hung sash windows.]
