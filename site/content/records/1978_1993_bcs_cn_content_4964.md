Burra Yacht Club Regatta

The Yacht Club owes its origins to an incident a bit over a year ago when ‘Tracker’ James became stranded in his car while attempting to cross a tributary of the Burra Creek.  He was rescued by the combined efforts of the customers from the nearby Bon Accord Hotel.  One of the rescuers made a joke about a yacht club and from this random remark sprang the Burra Yacht Club.  Last Sunday under perfect conditions a crowd of over 1,000 attended the club’s second regatta.  Three races were held in a carnival atmosphere.
