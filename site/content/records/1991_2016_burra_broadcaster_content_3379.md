Des Woolley writes asserting that the position of failed and partly failed business ventures in the district is due to the Council â€“ expansion plans have been denied or restricted or smothered in red tape and conditions.  It was a sad day when the town came under the Heritage Act and made worse by the insidious Main Street Program.  Recently a circus was denied (so I am told) the right to set up in Burra.  The Council imposes restrictive practices and over regulation to the detriment of the town.

[The editor comments that the circus was given permission to use the oval, but decided against going ahead with the fixture.]
