Obituary.  Mr William Geake died at Burra Hospital on 21 October.  He was born in Queen Street, Kooringa on 13 July 1861 and was the only son of Mr & Mrs W. Geake, whose first connection with Burra dates back to the late 1840s.  After leaving school he was first associated with his father in business as a greengrocer and then on his own accord.  He was later employed by Mr E.J. Harris.  He took a keen interesting sport, particularly in football, cycling and pedestrian events and prior to his failing health he was a member of various committees.  He was a member of the Rechabite Lodge for over 60 years and held all offices, including being a Past Chief Ruler.  From infancy he was connected with the Wesleyan and later the Kooringa Methodist Church and was a former secretary of the Wesleyan Sunday School.  In his later years he bore the burden of many illnesses with stoicism.  The late Mr Geake married Miss Elizabeth Jenkin in 1887 and she died in 1936.  Miss Doris Geake of Burra and Mr Wilfred Geake of North Adelaide survive their parents, as do two granddaughters and one sister, Miss Elizabeth Geake (who still resides in the old home), also a sister-in-law, Miss Edith Jenkin.

[William John Geake.]
