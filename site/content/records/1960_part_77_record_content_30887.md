Burra Mine

The Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan, in response to a question in Parliament said that exploration work at Burra Mine was continuing.  At present there were two percussion drills operating in and around the open cut and a diamond drill south of the open cut.  A fourth (diamond) drill is on a site about a mile south and is awaiting a crew to continue.  Metallurgical work is also continuing on the problem of extracting the copper from the oxidised leavings.

The Minister also assured the Hon. R.A. Geddes that not only was the company exploring to ascertain whether copper in commercial quantities could be found, but under the terms of the lease the company will be finally treating the proven low grade ore and extracting copper from the mullock that will be left.

Members of the Gem & Mineral Section of the Weapons Research Establishment Institute will hold a field day at the Burra Mine.  Extensive notes have been prepared for the group on the history of the area â€“ much of the material from Rev. Harry Alvey now living in Payneham.  About 100 people are expected to participate in the inspection of the mine area.
