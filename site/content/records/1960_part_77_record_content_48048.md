T.G. Perry writes.  [He is responding to an assertion apparently made on a Channel 9 Newsbeat program on 14 October that NOTHING was being done about developing Burra’s tourist potential.]

In 1959-60 the Corporation of Burra purchased the Burra Mine Paddock.  With the drive of the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and the then Town Clerk Mr R. W. Fullgrabe and the co-operation of the District Council the area was provided with access roads and the mine workings were fenced for safety.  On Friday 17 November the area was opened as a tourist attraction by the Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau Mr P.F. Pollnitz.  At the same time a souvenir brochure was produced giving historical details.  This was followed by investigation of the ore at the site by the Department of Mines and Mines Exploration Ltd.  In the time in question the Corporation developed a Caravan Park and a swimming pool.  Burra Creek has been improved by the Council and a picnic ground developed on the bank opposite the Caravan Park.  A brochure outlining the town’s items of interest is in its second printing.  Rev. G.D. Sibly developed a Historical Room at St Mary’s Church.  The National Trust has assisted with historical matters in the town and maintains a Museum in the town.  It has also helped to restore Redruth Gaol with a subsidy from the Tourist Bureau.  Colour slides and gift cards of historic buildings have been made available.  The National Trust and Mr Ian Auhl produced one of the National Heritage films presented on ABC TV, dealing with Burra and its historic buildings.  Work is presently being done to preserve Burra Miners’ Dugout Homes.  With much work from Mr S.J. Woollacott Paxton’s Cottages have begun to be restored.  The RAA has improved signage.  Improvements have been made to the golf course, bowling green etc.  To say nothing is being done is a wild statement born from a lack of investigation.  Requirements for the preservation of historic sites and buildings in the re-opening of the mine are being supported.
