Handel’s Messiah was produced on Wednesday in the Burra Institute.  Since 1902 the Institute Orchestral & Choral Classes have given portions of Messiah and this time there were over 100 performers trained by Mr G.E. Dane and aided by about 40 singers from Hallett.  On the 16 instrumentalists all but two came from Burra (Misses A. Miller & Tiver came from Hallett).  This time the soloists were also local.

Mrs Max Pearce	Miss Norma Rabbich

Miss Mavis Gare	Mr E.A.W. Haese

Miss Ethel Greenwood	Mr W.H. Spier

Miss Ellie Fitzgerald	Mr J.M. Tiddy

The performance was acclaimed and is reviewed in an article of over 1¾ columns.
