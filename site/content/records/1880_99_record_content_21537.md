Letter.  There is a very irate letter from a North Ward ratepayer complaining that more money was being spent on the road to Mr Dunstan’s house, which was not even in North Ward, yet he feared that North Ward would be footing the bill.  There were also complaints about other roads in the North Ward.  [Much of the letter is somewhat incoherent, but Mr Dunstan appears to have lived in a house on the south side of St Just Street, which would place the street in North Ward, but his house in East Ward.  The Council assessment book gives his location as Swansea Vale, which was apparently an unofficial designation for houses located on either side of Welsh Creek on land leased by the English & Australian Copper Co.]
