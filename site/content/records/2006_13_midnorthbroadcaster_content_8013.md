Burra Chef, Stammy Overell impressed 65 diners at the Blake Room of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Adelaide on Friday night, with a range of dishes prepared from Clare Valley produce.  She had been delighted to be invited to work with Hyatt’s head chef, Laurent Pommey from France.  She said she felt honoured to be chosen to represent the region by Clare valley Cuisine of which she and the Burra Hotel are members.  Stammy’s menu on the night included Burra’s saltbush lamb, Unicorn Brewery Beer, and Clare Valley wines.  Diners paid $95 a head and gave Stammy a standing ovation at the meal’s end.
