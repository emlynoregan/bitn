Mr Marshall of Currie Street has just completed for the smelting house at the Burra Burra Mine, a blowing apparatus capable of producing a continuous and powerful blast.  We were well aware of his capabilities as an organ builder and now he has undertaken to construct smithsâ€™ bellows and blowing apparatus of all kinds.
