Barker of Baldina Cottage Homes

Brickwork commenced this week and application forms are available from the secretary-manager Mr L.H. Packer at the Hospital.  The units are expected to be available for occupancy early in April.  If there are sufficient applications they will be decided on 16 November at the next meeting of the committee.  If applications exceed units preference will be given to people with local residence or association with the district.  The double and single rooms will be air conditioned with standard built-in furniture, floor coverings, beds, bedspreads, mattresses and pillows and with refrigerator, washing machine, electric range and wall heater.  Double units will cost $12 per week and single units $8.  The board pays rates, taxes and insurance and keeps the homes in reasonable repair.  Occupants are responsible for telephones, TV and electrical costs.
