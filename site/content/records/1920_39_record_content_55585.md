Obituary.  Mr Hugh Bell who died 16 April was born in Glasgow in 1854 and arrived at Pt Adelaide in the City of Benares in 1874.  He worked for several years on stations in NSW before purchasing a bullock team and wagons and commenced wheat carting in the northern districts of SA.  From 1881-86 he carted merchandise to the far north of NSW and into Queensland, purchasing his goods from Drew & Crewes of Kooringa.  In 1884 he married Jane Develaing of Aberdeen and for several years he lived in Warri-Warri* NSW before settling in 1893 at Yalpunga* where he had a general store for nearly 30 years.  In 1918 he was involved in an accident which partially crippled him for the rest of his life.  In 1922 he settled in Kooringa.  His five sons are all in Queensland and he has two daughters: Mrs J. Kellaway of Kooringa and Captain F. Bell of Bayswater in Victoria.  There are 6 grandchildren.  [* Neither of these places is readily traceable on maps, but the Warri Gate on the Queensland-NSW border lies north of Tibooburra.]
