Barrier Traffic Public Meeting Burra Institute 15 July.

Cr Pinch took the chair.

Cr W.T. Rabbich was sorry to see trade going to Sydney merchants - it was a mistake to have built a narrow gauge railway in the first place.  Without a break of gauge the bullion would have gone to Pt Adelaide.

Cr John Sampson agreed that the narrow gauge line was a mistake.  If a broad gauge line were to be built it must have Burra as its starting point.  It was ridiculous to suggest it start from Eudunda when it would go through barren country and scrub.  He moved the meeting favour a broad gauge line from Burra.

Thomas Kitchen supported his views.

Cr W.H. Hardy thought they were premature.  It was going to be a very long time before the SA Government would build a second line to Broken Hill, though no doubt one was needed.  The Railway Commissioners thought they could triple the traffic on the.present line.  He would move a committee of six be appointed as a vigilance committee to watch developments.  Supported by J.D. Cave and carried.

[Other proposals were for a third rail to make a dual gauge track from Terowie to Adelaide.  A new broad gauge line would have had the problem of the NSW Government being unlikely to approve its being carried beyond the SA-NSW border.]
