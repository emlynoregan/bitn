District School Enrolments

Burra High School enrolments remain steady at approximately 170, but the Leaving Class of 21 is the biggest in its history.  Miss c. Hodges has joined the staff as teacher of Girls’ Craft Subjects and she replaces Miss L. Briggs who has gone to Elizabeth West HS.  [New students are listed.]

Prefects elected for 1967:

James Braendler (Head), Stewart Catt (Deputy), Donald Griffen, Andrew Pearce & Roger Przibilla.

Angela Ryan (Head), Bronwyn Disher (Deputy), Beverley Collins, Rosemary Field, Lorraine Hyde & Heather Riggs.

House Captains etc. were also elected.

Leighton School.  Enrolments this year at 26 are two less than last year.  [New enrolments are listed.]

St Joseph’s, Burra.  At 29 enrolments are four more than in 1966.  [New enrolments are listed.]

Burra Primary School.  Enrolments at 257 are up 10.  There are 127 boys and 130 girls.  New enrolments of 36 in Grade I bring the total in that grade to 41.  [New enrolments are listed.]

Miss Raelene Poticary is in charge of Grade I.  She has come from Pt Augusta.  Miss Brenda Richards has returned to the staff as Mrs Don Villis.  Mrs Perry remains Senior Assistant.  With most classes at or near 40, it is hoped an extra classroom will be granted to relieve the very heavy loading in Grades I & II.

Painters have nearly completed their long job of painting the school.  They have been around for the last six months.
