Characteristics if the 1885 paper.

Page 1.  Larger advertisements, some local, some out of town.

Pages 2 & 3.  Stock auction notices and a few classified advertisements with notices from District Councils and Burra Corporation.  Commercial news, stock prices etc.

Usually an editorial and often one or more other leading articles, which are generally on events or situations beyond the local area.  Often they feature colonial politics or overseas crises.

These are followed by short items of local news, sporting news, and correspondents’ reports from other towns or districts.  Also letters to the editor.

Town Council reports and those from the Midland Road Board meetings are generally given in considerable detail.

The ‘Items’ column gives very brief and often cryptic snippets of news, most of which is not local.  Mostly it is Australian, but may include overseas items too.

This is followed by a major item or two of lengthier information on science, the world, farming, etc.

Some serial fiction.

Advertisements barely intrude into this, at least until late on page three and even then not usually mixed with the news or articles.

The dividing line between pages two and three is flexible depending on the quantity of notices and classified advertising.

Page 4.  Larger advertisements, especially for patent medicines, but also other items like farm machinery.

Sometimes a part column of ‘wit and humour’. 

On April 24 the paper announced arrangements to get Reuter’s Agency telegrams sent on to them.  For £1 a year they would communicate them to subscribers as soon as they arrived.  How this was done is unclear as is how long this offer lasted and how many subscribers, if any, took up the offer.  From 1 May the telegrams appeared in the paper regularly under the heading ‘Reuter’s Telegrams’.  They usually ran to about a column.

The editorials were often concerned with the political situation in Adelaide and what was going on in the SA Parliament.  Holder was particularly interested in the financial arrangements and policies of the SA Government.  Although they are written in quite a readable style, much of this must have been of quite marginal interest and comprehensibility to most of the readers.

In the latter part of the year the burlesque ‘The City of Big-Big’ was a lengthy serial piece, which had entertaining moments, but in general it was overly verbose and can have been appreciated by very few subscribers.  Perhaps the ability of readers at the time to identify the objects of the satirical comment sustained interest more than I can imagine.

The sporting reports seem to be somewhat inconsistent and clearly relied upon interested club members writing in on their organisation’s activities.

Overall the paper remained at this stage a good record of the day-to-day activities of the town and district.
