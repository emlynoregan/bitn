Accident.  Mr J. Murphy of Booborowie suffered burns to his face and right arm when petrol exploded while he was refuelling his tractor from a drum of petrol.  The flames spread into the drum and blew the small bung out, scorching the back of the car standing in the shed and slightly burning the shed.  The force tipped the drum over, but fortunately it fell out of and away from the shed.  The fire was quickly extinguished.
