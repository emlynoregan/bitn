Burra Town Council, Monday.

Council has refused to guarantee the sum requested for the visit of Captain Butler, as patriotic days have practically ceased to be held.

Cr Broderick moved that the Town Clerk write to Peterborough Council re the cost of tar-dressing roads and what tar is being used.

E.J. Davey has been appointed an Inspector under the Lights on Vehicles Act of 1919.

Burra Boy Scouts held their 5th Annual Camp at the Gorge from 26 to 28 December.  It was a success despite the rain.  I.J. Warnes provided a lorry and trailer for transport.  [Details extend for c. Â½ column.]
