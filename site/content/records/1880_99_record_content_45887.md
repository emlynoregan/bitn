Obituary.  Henry Hicks, one of the oldest residents of Burra died on 28 June.  He arrived in Burra about 36 years ago from the old country.  He found work in the mine and erected a two-roomed house in The Paddock.  These two rooms were described as the prettiest in SA.  His wife died there about 20 years ago.  When the first suspension of work in the mine took place he began to ramble.  He tried the southern mine for a while and then went to Sydney, but soon returned to Burra and until a fortnight before his death supplied residents with tea.  He has one son in NSW.  [Died 28 June 1892 aged 75.]
