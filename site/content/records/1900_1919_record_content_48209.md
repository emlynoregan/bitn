Obituary.  Will Pederson was killed in action at Pozieres, France, on 21 August aged 29.  He was the 2nd son of Martin Pederson.  Letters to hand from other Burra boys confirm the death and Pte F. Wheatley returned Will’s diary.  Pte Pederson was born in Burra 14 August 1887 and educated at Burra Public School.  He later entered his father’s business.  He enlisted in December 1915*[sic] and left for the front in April 1916 [sic], landing in Egypt in May.  He went through the Gallipoli campaign and was among the first batch to land in France.  He was very popular.  Pte Hartley Harris writes to say that he was killed by a shell.

[*Actually December 1914, which is clearly also indicated by his presence in the Gallipoli campaign.]

[William Pederson born 14 August 1887 Kooringa: died 21 August 1916 Pozieres France.]
