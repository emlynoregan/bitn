The Council will agree to pay to the Government the proportion of cost which would be fairly charged to maintenance.

It is understood that Mr Bee has disabused your mind of the impression that the works which were originally estimated to have cost £3,800 have actually cost over £8,000.

If the Council wishes to have the Government resume control at once the proposal is:

Present lease to be cancelled at once or at an early date to be determined by the Council.

The Government to assume control and management.

The Government to provide new and efficient pumping machinery and if found necessary an additional storage tank.

The government to rate the district on a scale not exceeding what is known as the ‘original scale’ and which is now in force at Gawler, Pt Pirie and Pt Augusta, the Peninsular Towns and other town water districts.

Scale: at or less than an assessed annual value of £8		£1 p.a.

£8-£40	12½% p.a.

£40-£100	5% p.a.

Vacant land to be charged on assessed annual value	5%

Charges for water up to the amount of rebate for rates 2/- per 1,000 gallons

Excess water to be charged at 1/6 per 1,000 gallons.

The Mayor said at the start of the year the account was £86 in credit and up to present over £100 was in hand, but the half-yearly rent due last February had not been paid.  Mr Bee’s report was that the boilers were unsafe.  [This was corrected in XV, 624, 4 May page 2 to say that the boilers had been condemned by Mr Dazel, Government boiler tester.]  The boiler now in use was passed for three months use at 60 lb pressure which would work only three pumps which would not keep the supply up.  Quality of water was not good.  A chance to get better water should be taken.  A new plant was needed and a great alteration for the better was needed.  Six ¾” taps could run off as much water as could be pumped and the tank was too small.  It was impossible for the engineer, Mr Sedgman, to maintain supply under such circumstances.  If the works were handed over to the Government we would get a better supply, a larger tank, a better plant and be free of all risk.  If problems arose later, the Government would have to pay the cost while it would not cost the Corporation or the ratepayers one penny.  F the Corporation kept the works the minimum rate would have to rise from 17/6 to 25/- and a sinking fund would have to be established.  It had been said that the Government control would see payments rise, but the Government proposal would see the town get water cheaper.

Cr Roach favoured giving up the Waterworks.

Cr Drew thought the sooner they were rid of the Waterworks the better.  The question had been a difficult one for years, but he thought at last they had a solution.  The offer was fair and should be accepted.

Cr Snell had been opposed to the Waterworks from their inception.  The mains had doubled from 4 to 8 miles and the same small boiler was expected to cope.  The sooner they were given up the better.

Mr J. Sampson moved and Mr West 2nd: ‘That we impress upon the Government that the water now being used in Burra is unfit for domestic purposes.’  Carried.

The same moved and seconded: ‘That the Council be requested to hand over the Waterworks to the Government as suggested by the Commissioner.’  Carried.

The Burra Mine is still working with the drive at water level having met the lode which was found at the 40’ level.
