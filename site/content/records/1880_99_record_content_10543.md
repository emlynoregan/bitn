Thomas Richardson, landlord of the Burra Hotel was charged with not closing the doors of his bar at 11.00 p.m. on 25 August and keeping them closed till 5.00 a.m. the next day.  He was fined £2.  In his defence Richardson claimed that Inspector Saunders had suggested it would be all right if the bar was cleared by 11.15 p.m.  The Court replied that Inspector Saunders, even if he had made such an incredible statement, had no power to over-ride the Act.  The editor comments that it was for a similar act that Constable Johnson was transferred.  It remains to be seen whether Constable Radford’s action will have the same result.
