The Kooringa Auction Mart premises of Messrs Reid & Co. are to be extensively remodelled to make a very convenient motor garage for Messrs Murray Aunger Ltd of Adelaide.  Mr Fuss of this town has the job.  [Perhaps R. Fuss, but possibly C. &. A. Fuss.]  Mr Lloyd Higginbottom will be the local manager.  The garage will have a workshop equipped with all necessary tools, a stock of spare parts and accessories.  The opening date is expected to be in ten days to a fortnight.
