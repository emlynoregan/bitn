The Hon. John Lewis has received a letter from the Council stating the cottages are in a bad state of repair and although Mr Lewis’s generosity is acknowledged it will not be possible to put them into repair and maintain them from the rents.  He writes to the Council pointing out that before buying them he spoke to the Council and asked if he bought them would they be prepared to take them and the answer was yes.  Having no wish to burden the Council if the Council is prepared to transfer them back to him, Mr Lewis will make other arrangements.

The Town Clerk said the property had never been transferred to the Council.

Cr McBride said as Mr Lewis didn’t want to discuss the matter a re-transfer of deeds would be the simplest solution.

Cr Lane said that the members of the late Council had met with Mr Lewis.  He had offered the property and said he would spend £500 in repairs and on that condition it had been accepted at the meeting, but the acceptance had never been formally ratified by Council.

A letter is to be sent to Mr Lewis explaining that Council had never officially accepted the property and that members who were present at the conference with him stated their willingness to accept on the understanding that it was to be put in repair and consequently the present Council considered the proposition now before it to be entirely different from the original one.

The mayor thought that Council should seek a further conference with Mr Lewis.

Cr Radford thought that if the buildings were condemned the Lewis trust would be liable and personally he would not like to be a member of the trust.

Cr McBride said the deeds would be in the Council’s name.
