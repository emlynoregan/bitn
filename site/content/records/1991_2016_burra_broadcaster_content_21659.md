Artistic Director of the Adelaide festival, Robyn Archer, brought along the incoming director, Peter Sellars.  Burra Community School students led a procession from the school grounds to the stables.  Celebrated chef, Gay Bilson, produced a special meal concentrating on local produce and served in special souvenir bowls.
