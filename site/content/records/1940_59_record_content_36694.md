Burra CWA.  No tenders have been received for the renovation of the rooms at the Town Hall and the matter will be discussed at the next Town Council meeting.  The CWA lease on the room [in Pearce’s Buildings] does not expire until June, so it was deemed inadvisable to move to the Town Hall at this time.
