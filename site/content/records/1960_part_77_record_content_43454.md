Burra National Trust held its AGM recently and elected: President, L. Moore; Vice-President, S.J. Woollacott; Secretary, Mrs C .O’Connor and Treasurer, R. Broad.

The retiring President S.J .Woollacott reported on a year when the Museum had been a success.  Thanks go to Ian Auhl for bringing Burra to the fore with his pen and the Mayor Mr Baulderstone, who has done so much to bring Burra’s tourist possibilities to the notice of those in authority.  The drive down Commercial Street to Market Square and thence to Burra North reveals a town that has more attractions than any other of a similar size.  Now we need to make the rest of the town as attractive.  Here the Council can assist in keeping the place tidy and in properly caring for the trees.  Success requires money and that requires an income from customers.  During the year the Museum had over 1,000 paying adults and received over $100.  We note with regret the passing of Mr Robert Fuss who was a good and practical citizen and we are grateful for the services he rendered the Trust.

After the business section of the meeting Mr Hans Mincham gave an illustrated lecture on the Flinders Ranges.
