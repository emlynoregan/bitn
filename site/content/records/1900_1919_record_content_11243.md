Burra Town Council

The Railway Commissioner has declined to place a lamp at the Bon Accord crossing.  He says there are only two trains after dark; there has been no light there for many years and no approach to an accident for the past 15 years.

The Mayor has been instructed to wait on the Commissioner of Public Works on the matter.

Mrs Develaingâ€™s claim for damages for falling over a footbridge in Kooringa was not entertained.

The contractor for lighting the Kooringa lamps is to be informed that they go out too soon.

Mr Ridgway offered to rent Helen Terrace for 18/- a year.  Offer accepted.
