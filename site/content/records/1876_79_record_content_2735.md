Offences. The court again had a number of cases of illegal depasturing of stock on crown land.

Isaac Lambert and Charles Smyth were fined 10/- for carting timber without a licence, but R. Austin was able to prove he had employed a shepherd and his charge of allowing 200 sheep to stray in Redruth was dismissed. Others were not so lucky and there were cases of straying pigs and horses and another one of infringing the provisions of the Width of Tires Act.

Samuel Davis was fined 40/- for failing to display clauses 66 & 67 of the Licensed Victualler's Act.
