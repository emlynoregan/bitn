St Mary’s Church.  The fancy fair in connection with the church was opened on Wednesday by the incumbent, Rev. J.S. Wayland.  The whole was very well arranged.  The fair opened with a stock valued at £600-£800, some of which was specially imported from England and Japan by J. Lewis.  On the opening day sales reached over £120.  The second day was also busy and the fair continued today and this evening.
