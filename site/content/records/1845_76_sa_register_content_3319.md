A Public Meeting in Support of John Stephens

[This is a very lengthy report on a public meeting held on the previous Tuesday evening, 28 November, in the New Queen’s Theatre in Adelaide.  The building was crammed with some 1,000 people to hear the meeting discuss the freedom of the press and the threat to it posed by the nine actions brought against Mr Stephens, editor of the Register, by the Burra Burra Directors.

C.S. Hare took the chair.

Rev. E. Baker moved a motion expressing the importance of a free press and claiming it as the right of Englishmen.

Like Broadbent moved a resolution condemning any attempt to restrict discussion through the medium of the press, and stating these actions by the Directors of the SA Mining Association were a covert blow aimed at the liberty of the press and at the advocates of truth, freedom and independence.

The third resolution put to the meeting by Mr Bryan called for all who valued a free press to come forward in defence of one who has ‘unflinchingly asserted [the rights of the productive classes] against the combined machinations of a property class’.
