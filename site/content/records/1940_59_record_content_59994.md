CWA Report for Burra 1953

The Secretary reported a membership of 87 and an average attendance of c. 20.  They had a successful year under the presidency of Mrs Jennison.  A roster system has seen attendance at the hospital for mending.  Parcels continue to be sent to England and mixed fruits at Christmastime were particularly welcome.

We convened a ball at the request of nurses, to aid the new hospital building.  We catered for the Burra Races in October 1952 and April 1953.  Miss Lois Riggs was guest speaker for International Day and spoke about Sweden.

Our first Hospital Fete, which we shared with other organisations in December, was successful in raising £290 for that institution.  We transferred £50 earmarked for the hospital and a further £35, being half the proceeds from the April Races luncheon.  The other half went to the Town Hall kitchen improvement fund.  [A number of smaller disbursements are listed.]

The Women’s Fire Fighting Group was recently combined with the CWA.

The Group Conference in April was at Farrell Flat and next year will be in Burra.

Two staunch supporters died during the year in Mrs J.R. Barker and Miss M. Rogers.  The former was a Vice-President and the latter a former President.
