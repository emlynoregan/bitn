Characteristics of the paper for 1963

This year was something of a mixed bag.  Sometimes it seems reasonably comprehensive, but at other times it is rather thin on local news.  Almost all the news is carried on page 1 except for sports results, which dominate the rest of the paper.  Pictures appear regularly, but as the blocks were not made locally, the pictures are at least a week later than the events.

Page 1

News: ranging from Hallett-Terowie to Tiverton-Tarlee.

Pages 2 & 3

Smaller advertisements dominate – sales, public notices, coming events, entertainment, films, tenders and smaller business advertisements.

Pages 4-8

Dominated by larger advertisements – mostly local.

News is dominated by sports and occupies perhaps two of the seven columns.

Somewhere in the mix, but wandering from page to page, is a ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements similar to classified ads.

Note: The volume numbers are chaotic.

Volume 86 runs from 8 January to 26 February

The issue on 5 March is Volume 37

Volume 86 then continues from 12 March to 23 July

It is followed by Volume 80 from 30 July to 1 October

Volume 85 runs from 8 October to the end of the year.

This in turn creates chaos with the numbering of issues.
