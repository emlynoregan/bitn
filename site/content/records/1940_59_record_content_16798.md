SA Government Initiative.  A half-column article extolling the virtues of the SA Government in building the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline is acknowledged at the end by a small ‘Avt’ as being a Government paid advertisement.  The previous week’s article in a very similar style lacked this acknowledgement, but is suspiciously like this one.
