Obituary.  William Pitt Barker of Baldina died on 17 February.  Mr Barker lived all his life in the district.  As a youth he spent some time in the Bank of Australasia in Kooringa before going to manage Baldina Station with his father.  He subsequently inherited the property.  He also was partner in Barker & McLean, owners of Nor’-West Bend Station at Morgan and had large interests in stations in Queensland (Cormornigan) and in NSW.  He was a member of the Burra District Council for over 25 years and was for a similar time on the Board of the Burra Hospital.  He was interested in sport and was one of the syndicate which gave us the Aberdeen sports grounds.  He was also a generous supporter of St Mary’s church and a generous, but quiet philanthropist.  He was a brother of R.J. Barker of Barker Bros and of A.J. Barker (Mt Bryan) and Mrs H. Von Rieben (Payneham).  He leaves a widow, four daughters (including Mrs Hooper) and one son.  [Born 30 January 1845 Yankalilla.]
