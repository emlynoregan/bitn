A smoke social followed in the luncheon hall at the new showgrounds with almost 100 guests present.  Catering by W. Carpenter.  The toasts and speeches take a further 2½ columns.  Mr Warnes spoke justifying the move to the new grounds and stating among other things that the contract to floor the building they were in had been let and a ring the size of the Victoria Park oval had been pegged out and work on it was about to begin.  He spoke of Mr A.J. McBride’s development of Braemar, Teetulpa, Faraway Hill, Yardea, Wooltana & now Wilgena.
