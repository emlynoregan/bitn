Kooringa Methodist Church: Closing Addresses on 6 January.

T.W. Wilkinson was in the chair.

T.W. Wilkinson’s address.

He had come to Burra with his parents and sister when most people there were Cornish.  The church was then much as it was now, despite several alterations and additions, but he believed it could then hold c. 100 more people because the seats were then all straight-backed and could be put closer together.  It was Rev. Stevenson’s time and the pulpit was very high.  It was at this time that collections were instituted.  There was no organ, but music of flutes, clarinets and other wind instruments, including a serpent.

Dr Brummitt’s address.

I entered this church 36 years ago next Monday, having arrived the previous day at Pt Adelaide and travelled to Burra on the afternoon train.  I travelled up with a tall slender young man and we talked all the way without exchanging names.  On Sunday he was the preacher, Mr Holder.  That was in January 1877.  Rev. G.W. Patchell was minister, but was soon succeeded by Rev. R.W. Campbell who was strong and perhaps rather stern and came to Burra from the great Moonta Revival.  He had many admirers, but two of his children died here from diphtheria.  Then came Rev. James Bickford, but the most striking ministry was that of the Rev. Samuel Knight who came in 1882.  He was a zealous evangelist and a great and interesting preacher.  His ministry led to many conversions and to the spiritual growth and uplifting of many more.  Though 79 the Rev. Knight is still active in Melbourne and has recently celebrated his Golden Wedding.  The Rev. George E. Rowe was Mr Knight’s colleague one year and he remained two years with Rev. S.F. Prior.  He was genial, Kindly and a popular preacher, often giving special addresses to children.  He has gone on to important positions in WA and Queensland.  Rev. Prior’s great strength was his preaching.  He took small texts and placed them under a microscope, where Rev. Rowe had taken whole epistles as texts.

In 1887 Rev. H.T. Burgess came when a reaction to Rev. Knight’s time required a renewal of the church again.  His sermons were always scholarly and instructive.

Rev. R.M. Hunter came in 1890.  His services were always attractive and successful and he had a strong musical voice.  He always ‘put the best construction on the actions of others.  He was charitable, thinking no evil and speaking none!’

Rev. R.S. Casely came in 1893; a kindly, courteous Christian who preached well.

Rev. J.Y. Simpson followed ably on until he dropped dead in my arms in Sept. 1898. (In fact four ministers died suddenly: Revs Patchell, Campbell, Casely and Simpson.)

Finally came Rev. W.G. Clarke whom you know well.  I have not even named Messrs Bainger, J.C. Hill, Hodge and Hadley.

Memorable too were the visits of Rev. Dr T.B. Stephenson, founder of the Children’s Homes in London and Mark Guy Pearse.  Of the lay workers I mention Father Sleep who travelled often to Canowie, Yarcowie, Muryibbar etc. and Dr J.R. Stephens.

F.W. Holder was a welcome preacher, an emergency organist, a good listener and invaluable in the Sunday school.  Other tireless workers were Richard Snell, John Harris and Aleck Harris.  Mr Charles Drew was ever interested and liberal and a great Sunday school teacher and class leader.  T. Drew was a great conductor.  There were too many Pearces to name, there must have been about fifty – William, John, & Miss Pearce.  Mr Harry.  Of the ladies Mrs Knight, the Casely family, Lady Holder, several Drews and Mrs W.S.H. Bruse.
