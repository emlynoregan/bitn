Mid North Football League held its AGM 7 March.

The President B.A. Kench reported on a year of successful football competition, at times of a very high standard of play.  Auburn Club built fine dressing rooms.  Plans are in hand to resurface the Saddleworth Oval.  The Premiership went to Saddleworth-Marrabel United in the ‘A’ Grade, to Auburn in the ‘B’ Grade, and to Riverton in the Colts and also in the unofficial Junior Colts.  Permit and clearance concerns between Mid North and North Eastern were resolved, but discussions about affiliation with SANFL have a gain lapsed.  The introduction of a function for the counting of the Mail Medal Voting was a success.  Elected were: President, B.A. Kench; Vice-President, S. Noske & Patron, W.E. Blatchford.  Manoora and Mintaro Clubs are in the process of merging with Manoora agreeing and Mintaro to meet next Tuesday to confirm the decision.  Clubs nominated teams as below:

It was resolved that Junior Colts become official with an age limit of 12 years on 1 January.

It was proposed that Mintaro-Manoora United have colours red & white.
