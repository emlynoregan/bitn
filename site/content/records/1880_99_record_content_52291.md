Burra Town Council

The Mayor had reports of loose horses drinking at the Aberdeen trough.  To be attended to.

Cr Walsh considered it unfair that ratepayers who had not the water laid on to their premises should water stock at the trough.  The Water Committee should look into it.

Council accepts the invitation to attend the Christmas Morning Service at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church.

Cr Linkson read the accounts as follows:

General account	in credit	£97-7-11

Board of Health	in credit	£12-13-3

Waterworks account	in credit	£186-1-1	(with £147-2-1 to be collected)

Cemetery account	in credit	£16-9-10

Parkland account	in debit	£108-9-11

Main Roads account		£21-12-4	[Debit or credit is not stated.]

The Waterworks should have £333, but collection of all the debt was impossible.

The coming Waterworks costs were £209 interest to the Government for the half-year and £150 for incidentals before the rates could come in.

The old boiler needs to be repaired for emergency use.

There was debate over whether it was better to join the Municipal Assoc. or to retain Mr Packard for legal advice.  Cr Parks moved to continue membership and this was passed with Cr Linkson opposed.
