Obituary.  Mr Richard Reed, a respected pastoralist of the district died on 3 April aged 82.  He was born at Burra, the son of the late Mr & Mrs Richard Reed Sen. who were among the districtâ€™s oldest pastoral pioneers.  In 1995 [sic: actually the registration says 15 August 1894 at the home of Mr Richard Reed] he married Mary Williams in the Redruth Methodist Church.  He spent all his life on pastoral holdings in the Burra District, having been taken into partnership by his father in early manhood.  They owned the stations of Wandillah, Mongolata, Hogback and Loch Winnoch and also rented other large areas.  The partnership was dissolved in 1902 and the late Mr Reed then launched out on his own account, acquiring freehold land near Burra.  In 1921 he took his son Mr Frank Reed into partnership.  The interest in Hogback was sold and the firm then purchased Kookaburra.  Mr Reed was a quiet and unassuming philanthropist who helped many young men get on their feet and gave freely to various institutions.  The Redruth Sunday School was built due to the generosity of the late Mr Richard Reed and the late Mr James Reed.  He was also a generous donor to patriotic bodies.  He was not very active in public life, but retired to Burra after building a house at Burra North.  He was in good health until his final brief illness.  He is survived by his widow, one daughter, Mrs H.E. Pearce of Adelaide and one son, Mr Frank H. Reed of Burra.  Mr J. Reed of Spalding is a brother and Mrs W.H. Gare of Burra North a sister.

[Born 9 October 1864 at Lostwithiel (near Burra).]
