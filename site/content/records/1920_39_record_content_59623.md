Burra Baby Clinic & Mothercraft Centre

[Miss Truby King recently outlined the reasons for her father’s development of Mothercraft Centres and this explanation is reported here in about ½ column before an outline of the Burra Clinic.]

In the local Baby Clinic there is an indoor and an outdoor clinic.  [The description suggests these would better be described as in-patient and out-patient clinics.]  The outdoor clinic is for out-patients only.  Babies born at the hospital attend only the indoor clinic for the first two weeks and will not come into contact with children from outside.  After mothers leave the hospital they have the right to attend the outside clinic if advice is required and this service is also available to mothers whose children were not born at the hospital.

On entering the building one is struck by the purity of the white walls and the up-to-date equipment.  The large ward is fitted with all the modern requirements of light and ventilation.  The nursery is delightful, with a suitable frieze lending a dash of colour and some suitable pictures.  Each little bassinette is covered with a little white cot spread daintily worked, with a pillowslip to match.  Each baby has a locker where each article of the numbered layette used by the baby during its residence is kept strictly for that child alone.  No outside babies are allowed to enter the nursery and the clinic room is quite separate.  The ward and private rooms all lead onto the balcony, where partitions secure privacy and from which there are beautiful views of the town and hospital gardens.  The drapings in the room are in delicate pastel shades with matching tea sets, whilst in the bathroom, sterilising rooms, etc. a cool shade of green predominates.  The outside clinic is conducted in a room arranged for simplicity and perfect cleanliness.  It is open for consultations Tuesdays and Fridays, when Matron Siegele, who is a thoroughly trained Plunket Nurse, can be consulted.  A careful card system records each child’s visits.  On a table is set out the various foods necessary with a chart defining food values and the treatment necessary to build up the infant frame.  A cri with a doll lying in it shows the correct arrangement of the covering for an infant.  The crib is of a simple type; such as almost any father would be capable of making.  A large mosquito net, held in place by an elastic band, goes right round the crib.  The stress is on simplicity and providing the necessaries with minimal outlay.

Baby’s wardrobe was found to be a neat arrangement of three kerosene cases; one on end and the other two sideways, with little shelves fixed therein.  These will easily hold all necessary linen, towels, washers etc.  Next was the basket for weighing, with its sanitary equipment of changing cloths for each child weighed.  Many charts offer advice – notable was the one headed ‘Beware of the Dummy.’  This showed how unnecessary these unhygienic ‘silencers’ are for properly handled infants.  Ills caused by the dummy include colic, (wind), indigestion, adenoids, nervous ailments, diarrhoea, mouth breathing and thrush, to say nothing of the germs gathered from picking the dummy up from the floor etc. and placing it in the mouth.

[The article goes on to mention other useful baby care items such as a ‘kicking box,’ and ‘a home-made refrigerator for keeping baby’s food cool’ (though this is not described.)  Also described is a device for restraining an infant from sitting up in the cot whilst allowing freedom of movement.]
