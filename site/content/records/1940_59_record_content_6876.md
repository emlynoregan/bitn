Burra VSD.  The Voluntary Service Detachment held its AGM in the CWA Rest Room on Tuesday evening 29 July.  As well as raising funds during the year they had held several small mock air raids to practise first aid skills and took part in the Town Mock Air Raid.  Lectures had been given in First Aid, Home Nursing and Transport.  Physical training and drills had been held fortnightly.  Parcels of clothing for refugees had been collected and books sent to troops overseas.

[Detailed results of the recent First Aid Competition are printed, which show that out of a possible 200 points, Burra 1 had scored 178, Mt Bryan 177, Leighton 175Â½ and Burra 2 scored 167.]
