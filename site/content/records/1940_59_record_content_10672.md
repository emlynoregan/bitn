Obituary.  Friedrich Duldig died at Eudunda on 7 June.  He is almost the last of the old pioneer farmers and graziers of World’s End.  He was born on 22 March 1851 at Tauer near Cottbus in Germany and migrated to Australia with his parents Johann & Ann Duldig when five years old, arriving at Pt Adelaide 28 January 1856.  After a few months they came to live on a friend’s farm at Peter’s Hill [near Riverton] where they lived in a dugout.  Later Mr Duldig Senior bought 50 acres and built a house.  Mr Duldig went to the local Evangelical Church School and was confirmed on 11 November 1866 in the Peter’s Hill Church.  He later went shearing in the far north and on 17 February 1876 married Louise Schuppan of Emu Downs.  They had fourteen children; seven boys and seven girls.  After his marriage the deceased bought a block of land in the Hundred of Baldina, previously part of the World’s End Run.  He lived there for 46 years.  For the first ten years the family belonged to the Emu Downs congregation, but then Mr Duldig and six other families formed the Upper Bright congregation.  He helped to build the Upper Bright Church, which was dedicated on 28 December 1907.  He was also active in public life.  He was a member of the Burra Show Society for 43 years.  He lost one son in the 1914-18 War and was a member of the Committee for the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial in Burra.  He was the first chairman of the Committee for the Robertstown Railway Movement.  In July 1922 he retired to Eudunda and his wife died on 11 June 1923, after which his son Mr L.T. Duldig and his family came to live with him.  In Eudunda he joined the Emmaus Evangelical Lutheran Church where he was the treasurer for three years and an elder for fourteen.  He remained healthy and active until very recently.  On 6 February 1942 he moved to the farm of his son-in-law Mr H. Schwarz and there he died on 7 June while the family was at church.  He was 91 years 2 months and 15 days old.
