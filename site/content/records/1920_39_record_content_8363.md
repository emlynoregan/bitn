Football.  The planned combined match between the two Burra teams and the two Booborowie teams on Saturday did not take place: apparently Kooringa failed to finalise its transport arrangements.  The Booborowie teams write in considerable disgust as no notification was given and the roads were in excellent condition for travel.
