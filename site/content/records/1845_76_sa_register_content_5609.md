28 December 1850.  I visited the Patent Copper Company Works; a mass of buildings with nineteen furnaces at work.  I saw the process of casting.  A row of iron moulds are placed around the furnace; one or two men fill them with the smelted ore; no all at once, but at six different times, each time with an iron ladle holding fourteen pounds; this is poured in, cools immediately; another is supplied and so on, until the six are completed.  They are then turned out, separated, and their edges cleaned by boys and men.  There is a sawmill attached for cutting the firewood to the required lengths.  In the large yard adjacent the ore is mixed before smelting with the proper proportions of coal, iron ore and limestone; the whole being reduced to the size of pigeonsâ€™ eggs.  From thence it is conveyed to a large funnel over each furnace.

We then visited one of the holes in the creek and found it very neat and clean and in one part an attempt at finery.  It was very cool, but I was informed, very close at night, there being no ventilation.  They are whitewashed inside and sometimes outside and most have paling verandahs, lean-tos etc.  The chimneys are mere holes opening from the footpath above, with a tub or two and a few clods put round.  As you pass you always know what is being cooked and there are many tales of fish or fowl disappearing up a chimney, having been hooked by a practical joker.  The secret of selecting such a place is that it is rent free.  Sickness prevails much and it is no wonder; the refuse is cast before the door.  Pigs and children were numerous.
