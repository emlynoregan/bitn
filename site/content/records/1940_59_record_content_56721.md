The Guy Fawkes celebration last Wednesday drew the largest crowd ever and all went very well.  S.T. Miller won the competition.  [This seems to have been for best fancy dress as a Guy rather than for best Guy because the winners for best Guy are listed as: Boys, Robin Rosewall & Don McBride and for Girls, Mary Aspin.]  Â£37 was raised for the Primary School.
