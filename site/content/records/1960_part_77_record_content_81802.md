Obituary.  Jack Bown died recently at Coburg in Victoria aged 75.  He was formerly of World’s End and a brother to Mrs Perc Thomas.  [The only brother to Daphne Thomas nee Bown who would seem to fit this scenario was born General Milton Bown 22 January 1902 at Baldina. ‘General’ could, I suppose, be known as Jack.]
