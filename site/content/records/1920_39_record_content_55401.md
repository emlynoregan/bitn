Letter from Mr Bednall re the reserve at Hampton sold to Mr Turner for £5, since when a portion had to be resumed for a road.  A refund of £3 was applied for and granted.

J. Allen Secretary of the Burra Football Assoc. wanted the Council to inspect the oval, as he says that if the Cycle Club acts as proposed to grade the surface it would leave only a very thin layer of soil.  K.W. Kennedy as Secretary of the Kooringa Football Club lodged a similar request and objection.

The Mayor said the Cycling Club proposal would add soil if anything.

Cr Kellaway was strongly opposed to any grading scheme, believing it would be detrimental to football.  Later he moved to rescind the motion giving the Cycling Club permission to form a saucer track, but he was not seconded.

He then moved that the action of the Cycling Club by stayed until the Council had inspected the site and after some discussion this was carried.

The Unemployment Relief Committee offered money for work for the unemployed if Council would give a 25% subsidy.

The Town Clerk said they had £40 from a similar grant from last year, but could not afford to subsidise it.

A by-law was adopted for the issue of trading licences in the town for non-resident firms for £2-2-0.

[A move aimed at hawkers and door-to-door salesmen.]

Kooringa Tennis Club wrote it had no objections to Good Friday being withdrawn from their agreement with the Council, but would also like to be allowed to play on Sundays.

Cr Dow said a special meeting of Council would be needed under the circumstances.

Cr Kellaway said if the club was not willing to carry out the agreement it could be cancelled.

Council must adhere to the resolution or have the agreement cancelled.

Cr Riggs moved that Council was not in favour of deleting the clause prohibiting Sunday playing.  He was seconded by Cr Jennison.  Carried.
