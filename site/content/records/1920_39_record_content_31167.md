Woollacott delivered wood at 17/- a ton.  He had a series of contracts, one for 2,000 tons at 16/9.  (At the rate of 300 tons per month.)  A year later James Pascoe and W. Holmes got contracts at 16/9 a ton for 700 tons and W. Woollacott for 10,000 tons at 17/3 a ton.  In July 1860 there was a contract for 400 tons at 17/6.
