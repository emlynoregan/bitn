Best Place & Market Square Concept Plan

Community responses from three workshops and the questionnaire have been incorporated into a report from Flightpath Architects and James Hayter & Associates.  The Burra Heritage Advisory Committee discussed and commented on the draft at its last meeting.  The plans and draft reports are available to the public at the Burra Office of Goyder Council and the Heritage Committee is calling for written comment.
