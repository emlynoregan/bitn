‘Cr Harris, at the last meeting of the Burra Town Council, said he hoped the newly elected member would prove a better man than his predecessor.  Dirty work!  Fancy saying that when he is hundreds of miles away.  He wouldn’t dare say it to his face, but its [sic] only Alex. Harris, you know.  He is a professional at that sort of business.’
