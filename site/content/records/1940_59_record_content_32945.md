Weekly Street Appeals are annoying some visitors and locals.  Burra Hospital wished to have one about once a fortnight, but there were applications too from the Salvation Army and the Air Force Assoc. and Youth Week.  The Hospital, said the Mayor, could not have more than one a month.  The matter was discussed and left in the hands of the Mayor.
