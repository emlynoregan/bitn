Redruth Police Court, 23 August

Resumption of the case against A.H. Harrison for breaking and entering.  The accused was returned to Burra on Monday by train by Constable Tom Rosewall.

Evidence about the items stolen etc. was given by Albert S.A. Kenny, Lieut. Of the Australian Instruction Corps Adelaide and by Melville Thomas Fuller (Lieut. & Officer-in Charge of the local Military Depot) who discovered the breakin during his weekly inspection on 18 April.  Sgt J.R. Johns gave evidence of the discovery of the articles at the accused’s camp at Hogback Station on 8 August.

The accused said he had bought the rifle in Broken Hill for £1 seven weeks before from a swagman.  He admitted knowing it was stolen from information in the Record, but did not wish to lose his money.  He did not notice the offer of £5 reward.  He claimed the coat belonged to George Kakoschke.  He was remanded for sentence.

Harrison was placed in a cell preparatory for removal to Adelaide by Tuesday morning’s train.  The prisoner was seen sleeping at 12.15 a.m. but at 5.10 a.m. the lock had been sprung and the prisoner was gone.  During Monday night a 6-cylinder car was stolen from Burra Hotel Garage (Reg. No. 018).  There is no doubt the prisoner’s release was the work of a confederate.  The police are said to have good information of the escapee and his mate’s whereabouts.  Six cases of petrol were also taken from the Burra Railway Station.  A speeding car passed through Braemar Station at 5 a.m. Tuesday.
