Ian Auhl OAM, BA writes an apologetic letter to BCS concerning his previous statements about History teaching at the school and also to Cr Colleen Woodgate.

‘Evidently I misheard or misinterpreted a chance remark the Councillor made in reply to a query of mine.’

‘I don’t think that Mr Swann can, however, accuse me of a lack of support for Burra’s history teachers.’

‘If, over the past eight years or so, just one of Burra’s teachers of history had thought to contact me to say whether they found by Burra books (and likewise my Burra research collection) useful in teaching their subject, when [sic: for then] perhaps I might not have made such an old fool of myself.’

‘Likewise there has been no response to the recent ABC TV Video ‘Living Australia, Burra’ in which both my research and myself were involved.’
