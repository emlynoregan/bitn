Burra Hospital is seeking land it can plant with crops to raise money for needed improvements.  The electrical wiring in the hospital is out of date and condemned by ETSA.  A completely new switchboard is also needed.  An air-conditioning plant for the Nursery in the Midwifery Block is also a project on hand.  It is also proposed to plant a garden at the entrance to the Nurses’ Home.
