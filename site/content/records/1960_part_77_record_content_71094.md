Church Union

The Methodist General Conference and the Presbyterian General Assembly agreed last week to join in a new Uniting Church with the Congregational Church.  The amalgamation is expected to come into effect on 2 June 1976.  The Methodist vote was 160 for and 11 against.

The Presbyterian vote was 230 for and 143 against and this passed the 60% majority needed by only 7 votes.
