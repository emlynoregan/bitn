BCS will hold 120/20 celebrations on 24 September to mark the 120th anniversary of the school and the 20th birthday of the Burra Community Library.  An effort is being made to locate the time capsule buried when the schoolâ€™s foundation stone was laid and a new time capsule will be buried.  An effort is also being made to find the oldest Burra student to plant a tree on the day.  The library will have a display of historical photographs.  A concert in late November will also celebrate these events.
