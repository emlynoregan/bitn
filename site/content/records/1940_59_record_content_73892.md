Robertstown

A 1⅓ column article deals with what community effort has been able to achieve in a small town.  Recently they have erected a War Memorial Community Centre which comprises:

A Woman’s Rest Room & kitchenette

A Doctor’s Consulting Room and Waiting Room

A District Council Office.

A lavatory block for both sexes.

The cost is estimated at £6,000.

Recently also the local hall has been extended with a new supper room and kitchen costing about £2,000 and a similar amount went into the new Club House at the Bowling Green.

The Star Maker Show of 1956 recently played to a capacity house.  Its twenty-three item program raised £97, which lifts Community Centre Funds.
