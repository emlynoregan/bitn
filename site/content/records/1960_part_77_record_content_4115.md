Burra & District War Memorial Committee held its AGM on 26 September.

D. Halliday gave the President’s Report.

Last year in conjunction with the Burra Football Club the Committee decided to build new dressing rooms with better amenities.  The first stage has been completed.  This year the second stage was completed.  The first step was the erection of the verandah by F.M .Pearce & Sons and Don Halliday at a cost of c. £88.  The Football Club financed the concrete floors, repairs to walls and the installation of an 80 gallon hot water unit, showers and seating.  Work was carried out by Messrs James, Parker, Halliday and Hirschausen to the extent of £219.  During the year frames were made and fitted as protection for the lower windows.  E. Finch donated the required bird netting and R. Fuss carried out the work gratis.  Water pressure improved when E & WS laid a new main from Paxton Street [sic: for Terrace] to the corner of the oval.  A one inch polythene water pipe was laid across the oval to connect with this, so making provision for the watering of the oval.  Mr E. Baulderstone experimented with watering and showed that two or more sprinklers can now be used successfully.  A new scoreboard was erected.

[Of which details are given.]

Elected were: President, D.A. Halliday; Senior Vice-President, P.J. Byrnes [sic: for Byrne]; Secretary, H.E. Kowald and Treasurer, M.W. Scriven.

[Financial statement printed.]
