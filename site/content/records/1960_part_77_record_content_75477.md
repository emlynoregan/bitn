Burra High School

In a reply to a question from Mr Allen the Deputy Premier said that delays to the plans for the new Burra Community School have occurred due to the need to redesign certain aspects of the Primary School.  New plans have now been prepared and work will commence immediately on preparing to call a tender.  No firm date is available at present.
