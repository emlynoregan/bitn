Mt Bryan Centenary of Federation Celebrations

Many former residents returned for the occasion.  A big logo of Mt Bryan was unveiled by designer Kaylene Jaensch – a logo that was first used on school tee-shirts.

Local identities Norma & John Ryan highlighted the effort put in to have the mosaic pictures finished in time.  Margaret DeGill wrote a song about Mt Bryan just for the occasion, which was well received.

In the evening there was an old style dance in the Hall and a combined church service was held in the Uniting Church on Sunday morning.  John Ryan’s efforts as chief organiser did not pass un-noticed.
