Mr Crewes spoke in warm appreciation of Mr Gallagher’s input and great enthusiasm.  He regretted the absence of Mr Dane, the secretary of the company, especially because of the cause of it.  [Mr Dane’s broken leg as earlier reported.]  When Mr McLaren was Mayor there had been a proposal that would have lit the south end of town only.  He had opposed that and was glad as they would not now have this scheme had the earlier one gone ahead.  When he proposed the present scheme as a municipal enterprise he was very disappointed that it was rejected practically without consideration or comment.  It was then that the company was formed and much hard work followed to get the scheme established.

All hoped there would be a profit, but in view of other experiences in SA the main motive had to be the benefit of the town.  They were prepared to take applications for from 5 shares upwards and hoped all would remain in the town so that control would always be local.  There were 1,000 shares.  So far they had connected about 100 houses with about the same number awaiting connection.
