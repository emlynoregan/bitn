Phoenix Copper hosted a dinner and presentation at the Burra Hotel last week to update residents of the companyâ€™s plans.  Most of the thirty locals invited were landholders, Councillors and business people.  Managing Director Paul Dowd gave a brief overview before handing over to Chief Geologist Mark Manly to explain the geological work to begin within a few weeks.  He explained that by using the Niton handheld XRF analyser the footprint on the land will be minimal.  While the main focus will be on the Burra district, operations will also be carried out at Spalding, Mongolata and Minlaton.  Even if all went well it could be several years before any unearthing and processing of copper or gold would be seen.
