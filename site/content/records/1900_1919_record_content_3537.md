Marriage.  At Stony Gap Methodist Church on 15 May.

George Escott Stevens, son of the late George Stevens of Emu Downs and Sarah Annie Jane Jeffrey, 2nd and youngest daughter of William Jeffrey of Porter’s Lagoon and late of Burra.  [There is an extended description of the dress which I think was the first of this style of reporting in the Record.]

The bridesmaid was Mary Flowers and Alfred Jeffrey the Best Man.  Rev. W.F. James officiated.  60 attended the wedding breakfast at Mr Jeffrey’s and dancing continued to the early hours.
