27 May

George Madden did not appear when called to defend himself against a charge of using abusive language to Mrs Hotchin.  He was fined £1 plus 22/- court costs and ordered confined in the common gaol at Adelaide until the costs were paid.

After hearing evidence from both sides in the case of Agnes Dunn v. Dr Bull, the case was adjourned to Thursday.

Benjamin Aldene was called again and his solicitor, Mr Fitzgerald questioned Mr Warne who said he had known the accused for some time and trusted him with the keys to his place where upwards of £100 worth of goods were kept.  He had every confidence in his honesty and had given him boots and shoes to sell on commission and lent him money to buy other goods.  He identified the boots and shoes produced in evidence.  Mr Fitzgerald asked for his client’s freedom and the return of the boots and shoes.  His Worship refused saying he would keep them in the custody of the police.  Mr Fitzgerald accused Mr Lang of acting contrary to law.

[Mr Lang and Mr Fitzgerald then had a major row with Fitzgerald calling Lang’s actions biased and lacking in judgement as well as unlawful.  Lang accused Fitzgerald of being incompetent as a solicitor.]

Mr Fitzgerald insisted on identifying each item that was found with Aldene.

Robert Melville, shoemaker identified several pairs of boots and shoes he had given to be sold on commission.

Fitzgerald asked that they be handed over to Mr Melville.  Lang refused and he committed Aldene to Adelaide for trial.  He said he would hear any other evidence that might come to hand before Aldene’s removal to the city.
