Kooringa News

Last Saturday a large crowd went to a spot on the Adelaide Road to witness a prize fight between Johnny Paull and Sydney Tom.  After they had fought for some time Corporal Bolus and two troopers arrived.  The Corporal immediately went into the ring and seized Johnny Paull, and gave him in charge to the troopers.  Tom escaped.

The Redruth Gaol is completed.  It has a substantial appearance.  It is well built and reflects credit on all involved in its construction.

The Wesleyan Chapel is progressing slowly.

The Primitive Methodist Chapel is nearly finished and is a neat place of worship.

A mail leaves every Saturday at 9.30 a.m. for Mintaro and Watervale.  It leaves Watervale for Port Wakefield on Wednesday and returns on Thursday to Watervale, where it arrives in time to be forwarded to Kooringa where it arrives 11 a.m. Friday.
