Female Franchise.  Mr Robert Caldwell MP has moved in the Assembly for the extension of the franchise to women.  The editor says he thought that when Dr Stirling introduced such a measure on a former occasion:

‘women best adorned private life, and that in their own homes they found their happiest sphere’

‘We are now, however, inclined to think that the experiment is worth the making.’

‘We imagine that it is chiefly in respect of social questions that women would make their power felt in the ballot box, and it is exactly here that some further power needs to be exercised.  Perhaps our greatest weakness is a want of due regard in public matter to questions of social and moral weight.’

He favoured the age of 25 rather than 21.
