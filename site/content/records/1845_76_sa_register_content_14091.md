Kooringa News, 27 February

There has of late been a great mortality among the infants in the district lately from some cause or other.  There have been many deaths and illness has afflicted many of the adult population as well.  While the changeableness of the weather is considered a factor, the poor sanitation of the town, a matter the inhabitants neglect lamentably, is undoubtedly a major cause.

[Note: the following information from the SA Deaths CD lists deaths in the Burra District for the first two months of 1861 and bears out the above statement:

While this figure of 25 infant deaths in two months is an appalling statistic, it should be noted that for the equivalent period in 1860 the figure was 20 and in 1862 was 21.]

A memorial is being prepared asking the Government to reconsider its decision to amalgamate the post and telegraph offices and asking to continue the employment of the present postmaster on his removal to his new premises.  I suspect the request is too late and that Mr Todd is already making arrangements for the contemplated change.

We now have among us a police-trooper who was lately employed as a drill instructor, so one of the Governmentâ€™s objections to having a volunteer corps here is removed.
