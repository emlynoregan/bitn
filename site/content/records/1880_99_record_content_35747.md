Editorial expressing dissatisfaction with an article in the Adelaide Lantern.  The article said that about 9 years ago a poll in the South Ward of the Kooringa Corporation resulted in a vote in favour of closing hotels in the Ward on Sunday.  But no action was taken to enforce this by either the police or the Corporation.  Since then boundaries have been changed so a portion of South Ward is now in East Ward.  The present Mayor is trying to enforce Sunday closing by sending notices to publicans.  He has not consulted his Councillors.

The Lantern also prints the letter sent by W. Davey as Town Clerk to the publicans drawing their attention to clause 100 of the Licensed Victuallers Act 1880 re Sunday closing.  The Lantern denounces this ‘unprecedented attempt to inconvenience the general public, and encroach upon the liberties of trade.’

The editor goes on the correct the above.

The poll was not just in South Ward, but was of the whole town.

The ban was in fact enforced for a considerable time until eventually a laxity of supervision crept in.

[He might also have pointed out there was no ‘Kooringa Corporation’.]

As for an insidious attempt to strike a blow at the liberties of the licensed victuallers: this is all nonsense.  The Mayor could not override the law and there is nothing to show he tried to do so.  We are sorry to see the Lantern rail at an event it evidently knows nothing about.
