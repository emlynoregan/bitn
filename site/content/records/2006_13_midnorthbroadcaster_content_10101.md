Country Health SA Hospital Inc released last week a draft copy of its 10 year Local Health Service Plan for the Lower North.  Respondents to surveys clearly said they did not want to lose facilities they had and that an emergency service was identified by 65% or respondents as a basic and minimum service required locally.  A delegation of concerned citizens met with the CEO of Goyder Council on Tuesday and it is hoped some answers and an understanding of the issues involved will follow.
