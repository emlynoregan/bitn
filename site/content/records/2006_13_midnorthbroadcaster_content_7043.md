Burra Community School.  The Liberal member for Stuart visited the school last Friday to investigate the lack of air conditioning in the heritage Kooringa Building.  This follows a flood of letters etc.  after the recent heatwave.  The building houses the primary classes and the heat resulted in some health problems for students.  It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth Governmentâ€™s Building the Education Revolution stimulus package can only be spent on buildings and refurbishment and does not cover air conditioning.  [Page 6 includes comments from Paul Williams who is pictured with his wife Tanya and son, Lucas.]
