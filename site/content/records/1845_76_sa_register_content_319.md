Mining Companies

[The article reports the formation in England of the ‘Australian Mining Company,’ with a local committee of management comprising G.A. Anstey, John Baker, Jacob Hagan and John Hart.  It aims to produce copper.  A second company called ‘The Australasian Mines Royal Company’ is mentioned and it is thought they might merge.

SA Mining Assoc. announces ten miners have raised 200 tons of ore worth over £400 in twelve days and the principle lode has been found to be ‘of enormous dimensions’.  Sixteen of the £5 shares this week brought a 150% premium.]
