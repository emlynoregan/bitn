Kooringa News, 20 April

Business is very quiet.

The mining mania has subsided somewhat.  Although good specimens have come in, only the Wheal Sarah has produced an appreciable amount of ore; about 30 tons of good ore coming from there.

A meeting of shareholders of the River Broughton Mining Co. is scheduled for tonight, when the first report of the agent will be presented.

A meeting of shareholders in a mining sett on the southwest boundary of the Burra Survey is to take place tonight.  Parties have been sinking there for some time, in soft ground, but so far there are no signs of ore.

A meeting of the creditors of Mr A. Motley was held at the Burra Hotel on 18 April to hear a statement of his affairs.  It is feared the estate will realize little, if anything.

The weather continues fine and the lack of rain has meant no visible grass on local stations and lambing has commenced.  Losses are expected to be very high from lack of feed and rain.  Only odd showers have fallen since the January flood.
