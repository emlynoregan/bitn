13619â†’BankSA Charitable Fund celebrated its 70th anniversary last Friday with a display at the local branch.  It started in 1941 when a group of bank staff decided to send parcels to enlisted colleagues fighting in WWII.  It continued after the war and has now raised almost $8 million for charities and organisations across SA and the NT.
