Redruth Reformatory Fires.  Fire broke out in the reformatory laundry last Wednesday morning and destroyed the wood and iron building.  In the afternoon a second fire started in ‘Hope Dormitory’ which burned all the girls’ clothes and the contents of five or six kerosene boxes used as a sort of cupboard.  There is no doubt the first fire started accidentally from the old German Ironing Box [i.e. a box-iron].  The iron was left on the floor with the coals black and apparently dead.  Hettie Garrad had been using it and said she had known fire to fall out of the box onto the clothes while ironing.  The wind had opened the door several times on the morning in question.  The fire in the dormitory in the afternoon is more mysterious.  The girls eventually put it out by removing a ventilator and sheet of iron from the roof and using a hose.

The inquest as reported says strangely little about the second fire and seems to assume it was from a spark of the first fire, though about five hours later in appearing.

The full report runs to a little over 1 column.
