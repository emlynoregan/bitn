Burra Mine.  In answer to a question from Mr A.D. McDonald the Premier said that upon the lapse of the option held by a party with respect to the mine the Government had secured the services of two competent miners from the Moonta district and they were now opening up the show to see whether it was worthwhile going on with.  If the lode is found to persist it is possible a worthwhile proposition will be opened up there.
