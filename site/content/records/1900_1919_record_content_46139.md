Deteriorating Mail Service.

Until about two years ago mails for the morning train closed c. 5 a.m.  Then they closed at 10.15 p.m.  This practically prevented mails received by the evening train being answered by return.  Now there is a move to close at 6 or 8 p.m.  A letter written Monday evening would not be delivered in Adelaide till Wednesday morning and the same applies to Broken Hill.  It was also promised that with sufficient subscribers the phone service would be continuous, yet on Sundays it is available for only a few minutes at a time.
