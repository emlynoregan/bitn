Burra Town Council, 18 July

Burra Electric Supply Co. says it has been having difficulty in getting replacement globes for streetlights.

There was considerable discussion of the problems of making good roads.  The Mayor contended that it was done well when he kept an eye on it, but not otherwise.  Cr Kellaway thought this was insulting to other Councillors.  The Mayor said the results were there for any unbiased Councillor to see.

Cr Kellaway: ‘All Councillors are unbiased.’

Mayor: ‘That’s a matter of opinion.’

Cr Kellaway: ‘My opinion is as good as yours.’

Mayor: ‘That is also a matter of opinion.’

A committee was appointed to consider traffic in the town.

After considerable to-ing and fro-ing Council decided not to sell the land to Mr A.J. McBride that would perhaps have allowed him to build a replacement house on the site of the late Mrs Howell’s cottage.

Burra Rifle Club held a practice shoot on Saturday and best scores were by H.G. Oates & W.V. Bass.
