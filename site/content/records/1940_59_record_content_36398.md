Obituary.  Miss Janet Orr Inglis Craig died at Burra Hospital on Thursday last week, aged 91.  She was the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs J.J. Craig, who came from England and settled on the land near Spalding in the 1850s.  Miss Craig was the last surviving member of the family, which comprised three sons and three daughters.  She was born at Spalding 8 September 1857 and lived there during her early life.  Later she moved to Hallett with her father and spent the greater part of her life there.  During her younger years, she took a particular interest in the local Methodist Church and was a keen worker for the Red Cross and other patriotic efforts during WWI.  In 1923 she came to live in Burra and led a quiet retired life until falling ill about seven years ago, after which she was unable to leave Burra Hospital.  Until a few weeks ago she retained an excellent memory and could relate many stories of the early days of the district and of the blackfellows who wandered through and lived in this area.

[SA Deaths CD says she died as Janet Orr Englis Craig 1 April 1948 at Burra.  The most likely birth registration would seem to be Janet Hore Craig 15 September 1856 at Booborowie.]
