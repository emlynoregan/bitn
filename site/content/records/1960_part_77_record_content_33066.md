Burra National Trust, 25 January

The branch conceded temporary wardenship of the Gaol to the Town Council to take care of and maintain the building when it is released by the Lands Department.  On 3 January Messrs Game & Cooper of Adelaide National Trust inspected places of historical interest in Burra and were impressed by the town’s tourist potential.  Rev. Maurice Lind has produced a brochure concerning the history and places of interest in Burra District, which will be sold in Burra.  It is the result of painstaking research.  It is hoped to open the Museum more regularly, but it is not easy to roster an attendant.  Mr R. Fuss has done a fine job in opening it twice a week through the holidays and often more than that.  Recent gifts to the Museum are a ‘tumbling tommy’ plough and a sheep bell.
