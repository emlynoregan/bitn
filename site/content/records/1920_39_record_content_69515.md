At Koo-owie a small buckboard just made it through a flooded creek and K.C. Sandland waded after it when a sudden wall of water came along and swept him away.  After some distance he was able to grab a tree.  One unsuccessful rescue attempt resulted in the need to rescue a would-be rescuer.  A second attempt saw a rope attached to Mr Sandland, but the water and Mr Sandlandâ€™s 16 stone sent the rescuer hurtling into the water too, but he managed to get caught on a tree and eventually all were saved, but it was a close call.
