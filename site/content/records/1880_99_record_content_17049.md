Burra Town Council 21 March, Special Meeting.

This was convened to consider Cr West’s proposal for a loan of £500.  He said he hoped he would have support since every £ of the general rate used to reduce outstanding debts was the loss of another pound which could have attracted subsidy.  The proposal is very simple.  The probable curtailment or abolition of the Government Grant-in-Aid is Government policy and we would be foolish to lose any portion of it while it remains available.

Cr Ridgway pointed out that the borrowing of £500 secured by the Parklands rates would enable the paying off of the debt in about seven instead of nine years, due to the reduced rate of interest and would allow the Council to spend about £500 more this year than would otherwise be possible and so if Cr West would accept a loan against the Parklands rates he would have Ridgway’s support - but not if it were against the general rate.

Cr West readily agreed and so did the Mayor.

[There then follows a printed report on the Recreation Ground Account, which demonstrates how the application of the Parklands rate to reducing the debt would see it vanish in seven years. Note though this assumes that all the said rates go to reduce debt and the Parklands rate must have been levied because there were Parkland expenses!]

The loan would not increase indebtedness, but would enable them to get money at lower interest.

Cr Coglin had been convinced by the argument and so was Cr Symons.  Carried unanimously.

Ratepayers’ approval is to be sought at a meeting on 31 March.
