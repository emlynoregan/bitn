Burra Show

The show was a winner with more than 1,400 people attending.  Many positive comments were heard and Show President Tim Stockman said this yearâ€™s show saw a good run of entries, particularly in floral art.  There were some great entries in all divisions and it was especially pleasing to see the junior involvement in the floral section.  Tracking entries had been made easier by the new computerised system in use.  The weather of the preceding week had been wet, but Show Day had been sunny before rain returned on the Sunday.  The recent outbreak of pigeon disease in Victoria meant there was no pigeon or poultry section this year.  The merino shearing competition continues to be the premier shearing competition on the SA Shows circuit.  The ute and car competition saw a good turn-out.  The wool pavilion with its newly featured wool packs above the exhibits drew favourable comment.  The named wool packs were an initiative of convenor Andrew Butler Rural Services and allowed each exhibitor to pay a fee for their named wool pack to be displayed, which went towards a generous $1,000 donation to the Burra Show Society.  The support of the local community in putting the event together is to be commended.  President John Oates thanked sponsors for their continuing support and also the judges, convenors, stewards and all those who contributed to the local event.

Results are printed.
