Clare Correspondent replies to ‘A Looker On’ denying any vindictiveness and also upset by the implication of drunkenness on the part of some players.  ‘Looker on’ needs to ‘cultivate a little more regard for the truth’.  He maintains his report was both truthful and fair, but that the Mintaro players were unfair and rough.
