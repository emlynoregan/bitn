Burra Town Hall

The renovations to the CWA Room are complete except for floor coverings.

The proposed new supper room for the Town Hall will, when completed, give much more room for the purpose than the section of stage currently used.  The room will occupy the space previously used by the remaining two rooms of the Library.  The proposal is to erect a kitchen on the western side of the new supper room.

Burra Swimming Pool Donations have reached Â£817-17-7.  For the next six months the Rural Youth have undertaken to concentrate money raising efforts on the pool.
