The Drought Breaks

The rainfall for 1914 was a total of 7.17”.  In the first three months of 1915 the drought continued with 0.33” in January, 0.02” on February and 0.14” in March.

Then from Easter Monday we were teased with 0.13” and 0.02” on Tuesday and 0.06” on Wednesday.  On Thursday there was 0.30” to 3 p.m. after which it began to pour down.  Premises were flooded and all the creeks were running bankers.  The flood began to be compared with the great flood of 1874 and was generally reckoned bigger.  About 1.70” fell in the day and by 9 a.m. the next day 1.95” had been recorded.  The flood swept away footbridges at the Burra Hotel and at the Pig and Whistle.  The Commercial Hotel cellar was filling up and water was pouring through S. Burns’ shop, through Bagot, Shakes and Lewis’s Office and at E.J. Harris’s they were fending it off with brooms.  A number of private bridges also went and Mrs Howell had to be carried out of her cottage.

In Aberdeen there was a lake from the railway line to the Racecourse.  W.B. Page took a great photo from the railway line near the Bon Accord Hotel, with Mr Robertson’s house in the foreground and Drew & Crewes’ bulk store surrounded and a great mass of swirling water under the Bon Accord Bridge.
