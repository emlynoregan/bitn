Accident.  A road train driver pulled over for a rest stop last Friday morning about 8 km south of Burra and became heavily bogged.  It took a crane and about six CFS members to extricate the truck, which had to return to Burra to drop off a trailer as the road train route ends at Burra.  The driver was issued with an infringement notice for being off route.
