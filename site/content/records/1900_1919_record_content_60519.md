‘Esperanto’ writes pouring scorn on the idea of a monument in Market Square and rather vaguely talking of ‘a living monument to Internationalism’ and complaining too of the attitude of the press.  [The last point puzzled the Editor and certainly a free flow of letters seems to have been published as well as lengthy reports on all meetings.]
