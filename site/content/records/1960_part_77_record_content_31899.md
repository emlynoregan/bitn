Burra Primary School

The visit of the Director of Education on 28 October marks the completion of a complete overhaul of the Library following a public appeal.  Books to the value of $2,000 have been added, new furniture has been supplied, the room has been painted and new curtains were supplied by the Parents & Friends’ Association.  Proper cataloguing of books has been undertaken.  After the opening ceremony the Director visited the other rooms in the school and also addressed the High School students briefly.  [His speech is printed.]
