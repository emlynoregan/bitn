Burra Swimming Pool is in need of extensive and costly upgrading.  The Pool Management Committee is liaising with the Burra Burra DC and BCS ways of seeking funding for a new pool on BCS grounds.  The idea is to place it abutting the east end of the school gymnasium and so use the existing change rooms, showers and canteen.  Areas under the gymnasium would provide space for the pools filters etc.  The education Department will make a capital contribution towards the project.  The new pool would be or rubberized cement and be fenced with cyclone mesh.  It would be half Olympic size and the area would be landscaped and incorporate extra parking.  It would complement other sporting facilities in the area.
