‘A Voice from Hallett’ writes protesting against the editor’s encouragement of Chinese migration.  The writer would [even] prefer to see more Aboriginals because the Chinese:

Are idolaters

Contribute only £3 p.a. to general revenue compared to the average of £16.

Will cause, through their increased presence, a need to double police numbers.

They will be welcome, he says, when they are Christianised.

[The editor protests it is not fair to interpret his plea for common justice to Chinamen as encouraging further Chinese settlement.]
