Hallett Institute.   Contractors are busy at work building the Institute.

A Bachelors & Spinsters Ball was successfully staged at the Institute on Wednesday.  The stage was turned into a drawing room for non-dancers, where cards and other games were played.  The main entrance was also made into a smaller drawing room.  The whole hall was dazzlingly decorated with poppies and ears of wheat and red and pink ribbons.  Dancing continued till c. 2 a.m.  Setaro’s Band from Adelaide played.  [Details of dresses are printed.]
