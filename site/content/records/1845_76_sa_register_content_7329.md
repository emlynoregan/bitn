Gold at Melbourne

The mail from Melbourne confirms the ongoing flow of gold to that city, though amounts are not specified.  As a result wages for labourers have risen there.  The rise is considerable, but so far the greatest amount reported would double the wage rate.  On the other hand the news from Sydney Diggings is that the diggings in NSW are said to be terrible.  Hospitals and public institutions are said to be crowded with the sick and infirm.

We have seen a further example of gold found within twelve miles of Adelaide.
