Dr Sangster, candidate for Mayor, thought a rate increase was desirable.  Scavenging is costing more and so is lighting and yet better lighting is needed.  More trees are still needed.  Market Square needed improving and Victoria Park had had money spent on it to little avail.  He wondered why land had been bought in Kooringa.  It could hardly be for a Council building as the arrangement with the Institute could not be bettered for 7.9 a week.

Cr Walker could not endorse the remarks of the Doctor with respect to market Square because he could not see his way clear of supporting anything done in Kooringa.

The present site of the oval was ridiculous and needed quite £200 to level it.

Cr Ockenden was more concerned with sanitation than with beautifying the town.  There were places where water closets were shared and these problems came before beautification.  The problem at the Hospital needed to be fixed.  He favoured a public abattoir, so that meat might be inspected before being consumed in the town.  At present only O’Leary Bros had their meat inspected and he recommended one and all to buy their meat there.  He believed £40 would make a big improvement to the oval. He was not keen on seeing an oval developed at the northern end and he believed if the show went there businesses in Kooringa would suffer.  The mayor’s allowance should be abolished.  Rates should not be increased.

Cr Wise was also against any increase in rates.  The land bought was merely for a depot for Council tools.  The old Baptist Church met that need.  A pound at the back of the property would be useful.  He was not satisfied about the small rent reduction the Council had won from the Institute committee.

Mr Winnall did not agree with Cr Walker that all the work should be done in North Ward: an entirely too narrow view.  He was for improvements in Market Square with a band rotunda.  A pound in Kooringa would do away with what the Record calls facetiously the Inspector’s levee.  More streetlights were desirable, but cost money.

E.W. Crewes favoured improvements with fencing and plantings in Market Square and was in favour of increasing rates to achieve good outcomes.  He thought they needed a new post office and that footpaths needed attention and tar-dressing extended on them.  He thought the Mayor’s allowance should be increased.
