Burra Hospital Board.

The Board told Matron to discharge a man admitted on a note from Mr Crewes, but without a doctor’s authority.

Water was penetrating one of the walls of the new ward.

Tenders will be called to remove part of the old building if the Chief Secretary permits.

Mr Dane reported on the state of the Hospital piano.  It would cost £20 to repair and was not worth it.  If they sold it for £10 he would run a couple of concerts and raise money for a decent one.  His offer was refused with thanks.

Mr Hawkes moved that a suggestion be made to the Chief Secretary that he consult the Board before making appointments to vacancies thereon.  Carried unanimously by the 8 present.

Fees were suggested by Mr Hawkes:	Ward Patients £2 a week

Private Rooms £3-3-0 a week.

Mr Warnes brought up the idea of assessing patients’ ability to pay again.  The others wanted to reduce charges when people couldn’t pay.

Mr Hawkes then suggested:	Ward Patients 5/- a day, (£1-15-0 a week).

Private Rooms 10/- a day, (£3-10-0 a week).

Special nurses to be extra, but medicine & bandages included.  Carried.
