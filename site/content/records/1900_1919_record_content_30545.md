Fred Jordan had a very lucky escape on 8-Hour Day (Wednesday) when a snake got around his legs while he was out shooting rabbits with friends.  He tried to dislodge it with the butt of his gun, but it went off and the bullet grazed the skin on the left side of his head and went through his hat.  The snake was disposed of without harm, but he was much shaken.
