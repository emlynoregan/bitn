Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. directors are in town today and hopes are expressed that something will evolve from their visit.

‘Aequo Animo’ writes deploring the state of the cemetery road and agreeing with Cr Lott that work is urgently needed and that all wards should pay.  The writer says it carries heavy lorry traffic and at times as many as 150 vehicles to a funeral.  Bitumen or tar dressing is the only solution for a lasting job.
