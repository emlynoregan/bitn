Influenza.

The Mayor sought the advice of the Central Board of Health on the holding of the Burra Races and it was suggested cancelling them if influenza was feared, but this advice came too late.  Mr E. Thamm attended the races and in the evening was taken ill with pains in the head and vomiting.  Dr Ashton diagnosed serious gastric influenza.  The patient’s temperature was 103°F.  A short time later one of the boys had similar symptoms.  The cases were reported to the Central Board of Health.  On Monday evening as the Thamm children had gone to school it was decided to close the town’s schools (Burra, St Joseph’s and Copperhouse).  Two of the Thamm’s little girls fell ill Monday evening and yesterday three more of the family: leaving only Mrs Thamm unaffected.

The performance of The Bing Boys was cancelled on the Mayor’s order.  The schools were ordered disinfected and the Institute hall was ordered disinfected on account of its possible use as an isolation hospital.

At Mt Bryan Mr A.G. Gebhardt of Mackerode seems to have caught the disease: he was at the Burra sales on Friday.
