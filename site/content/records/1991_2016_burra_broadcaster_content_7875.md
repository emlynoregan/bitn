Burra Girl Guides have held their first birthday.  They started with 58 girls from the three guiding sections, with a District Leader, many helpers and six leaders.  Much of the fundraising has gone into hall maintenance.  About $6,000 was raised for the year.  Salt damp in the walls remains to be treated.  Hall hire has helped with users including Line Dancers, the Calisthenics Club and the Regional Art Group.
