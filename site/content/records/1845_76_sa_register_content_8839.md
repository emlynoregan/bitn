Education Report [Editorial]

The account considers Education in SA to be generally satisfactory.  There has been a light increase in schools and in numbers of scholars.  Teachers are becoming more competent.  There are now 121 schools; an increase of 18 on 1853.  32 are in the city, 25 are suburban and 64 are in the country.   Average attendance has been 5,648 of which 3,136 were boys and 2,512 were girls.  This is an increase of 808 on the same quarter of 1853.  The average attendance at a school is 46 and the excess of boys over girls is nearly 25%.  In September 1,192 were aged <6, 1098 were between 11 & 14 and 126 were 15 and over.

[Further statistical details are printed, including costs.]

Licences have been withdrawn from some poorly performing schools in the city and suburbs, but they have to be tolerated in the country for the absence of anything better and because in those places well qualified teachers would find insufficient scope for their talents and inadequate remuneration.

In populous districts the greatest impediment to improved education is the want of rooms.

[There is quite a discussion on incompetent teachers.]

The Inspector visited 30 town [city] schools and 24 suburban ones and 24 country schools.  He reported the introduction of the principle of pupil-teachers (in two schools) with a fair degree of success.  This is to be encouraged because of the lack of efficient teachers.  This can only be addressed by importing them or training them.

The lack of school books has been addressed and a supply should arrive soon on the Albemarie.

The attendance of students has, as usual, been affected by their absence to take part in various kinds of labour and in a few schools by the presence of the epidemic, which has spread through the populated districts.

There is also a problem of the lack of teaching materials, long ordered from England, but not yet arrived.  The lack of school furniture is another problem.
