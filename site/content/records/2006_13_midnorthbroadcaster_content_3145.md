Gunter Leibenam of Booborowie attended the Anzac Day service in Burra for the first time for eight or nine years.  He came to Australia from Germany with his family when aged seven and on leaving school in Peterborough he joined the Australian Army.  He remained in it for 22 years, including in that time tours of Borneo, Malays and Vietnam in 1966 & 1970.  [Gunter goes on to speak of the after effects of combat.]
