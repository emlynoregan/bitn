William Barkely (22) was charged with embezzling various moneys up to the amount of 11/8½ from his employer, W.E. Jordan.  The accused worked for Jordan, operating a van in the Hanson district.  Jordan discovered discrepancies between sums in the customers’ books and those in the cart book.  The accused was bailed for a later hearing.
