Accident.  Tom Kallio was returning to Burra with his wife last week when at the intersection of Grand Junction and the Main North Road at Gepps Cross a bolting horse struck the near-side rear mudguard of the car, badly crumpling it.  Mrs Kallio had been seriously ill in the city for some time and with the other occupants of the car received a severe shock.  We believe the horse suffered a broken leg and had to be destroyed.
