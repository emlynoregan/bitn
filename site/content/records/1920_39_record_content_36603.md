In general the paper gave reasonable local coverage, but supplemented this with a lot of material in the form of syndicated articles and in particular a column headed ‘Advance Australia News Service’.  This is frequent, but not every week.  Its source is not acknowledged, but the content is remarkable.  It is ultra-patriotic and fosters a jingoistic Australianism.  It is fiercely against party politics and individualism and promotes unquestioning obedience to a unitary state.  There is considerable admiration expressed for Mussolini and a desire to see the emergence of a strong national and nationalistic leader.  In short it is supportive of Fascism.
