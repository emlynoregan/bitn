Adchem

The demand for copper oxide is at an unprecedented high level.  Adchem is confident of production in excess of 10,000 tonnes for this financial year.  Production in October was 984 tonnes – a record monthly production figure.  Increasing cost of gas and electricity has seen costs rise by $100,000 over the past year and the cost of raw materials has also increased sharply – both for imports and locally sourced scrap metal.  While new contracts are being negotiated to reflect these costs, old contracts are seeing a reduction in profit margins.  Plant operating days are being maximised to increase productivity and the plant will run through the Christmas and New Year period.
