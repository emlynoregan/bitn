Cricket.  A meeting of the Burra Cricket Club a few nights ago was presided over by Dr Sangster Jun.  There was so much trouble financially in 1907 that the club could not continue under the same conditions.  It was suggested that the Burra Automobile Club take over the clubâ€™s property: 1 bat and 2 or 3 stumps in various stages of dilapidation.  It was resolved to form a club to be called Burra automobile Cricket Club.  Journeys to matches in future will be by motorcar & cycle to give cricket a new impetus.
