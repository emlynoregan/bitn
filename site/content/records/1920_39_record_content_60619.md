Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its Anniversary last Sunday.  Three services were taken by Mr Steve Wickes of Prospect, who is a gifted chalk artist and whose exposition of his subject was made wonderfully effective by what are known as chalk talks.  This year there will not be a tea meeting and instead prizes will be distributed on Sunday afternoons 19 April.
