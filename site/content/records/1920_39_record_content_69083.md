Weather.  Since last Saturday great rains have fallen on the pastoral country.  They generally ranged from about 250 points to 300 with Koomooloo at 348, Chalk Cliffs 430, Mallee Dale 416.  But a few missed out.  Oakvale got only 50 and Loch Winnoch 158.  It is the best general rain since 1920 when similar falls were recorded.  Falls at Hallett caused local flooding.
