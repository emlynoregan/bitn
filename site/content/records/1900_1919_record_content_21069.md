Burra School Break-up last Friday is reported in 1 column.  The head teacher, Mr G. Scott gave his annual report.  The program of songs is printed. There were 329 on the roll and an average attendance of 230 (For the previous four years it had been 291, 269, 254 & 244.)  The new regulations requiring so many days a week instead of a quarter had led to many regularly missing one day a week.  The prize list is printed.  There were 21 boys in the Cadet Corps.
