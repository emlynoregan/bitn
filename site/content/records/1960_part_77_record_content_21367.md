Burra Cemetery

For many years the condition of the cemetery has caused the Council concern and has been the subject of much criticism.  Legal issues have hampered Council action.  There has been a long wait for approval to reclaim and level a portion of the area.  Much research had to be done into particulars of leases, dates of burials etc. and many letters were sent to the concerning authorities.  Moves for the central portion of the cemetery to be levelled commenced six years ago and approval to carry out the work has finally been given.  Tracing lessees of blocks or members of the family concerned, calling for objections and so on has taken all that time.  Last week the Council, with the use of District Council plant, commenced the levelling work.  Large shrubs, large trees, broken and crumbling mounds, have been removed and the area flattened.  There is a large heap of rubbish to be burnet and the headstones removed will be placed along the boundary wall.  A vast improvement is already evident.  The 99 year leases on the blocks in this area had already expired.  New laws grant the period of 50 years only for the lease of these blocks.
