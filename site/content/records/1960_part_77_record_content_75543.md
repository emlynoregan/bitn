Burra Community School

The Minister of Education Mr Hugh Hudson has released plans for SA’s first Community Complex School to be built at Burra.  This involves rebuilding the present Burra Primary and High Schools and integrating them into a community facility.  The original school building, which is a structure of historic interest classified by the national Trust, will be preserved.  The interior will be converted into modern open space, leaving areas for primary students.  There will be five additional buildings and a library will be built at the rear of the old building.  The separate building for secondary classes will include science and commercial studies facilities and a third will provide for art and craft activities.  A fourth building will house a drama workshop, activity hall and canteen, while an administrative block will house offices, staff accommodation and a sick room.  The area between the buildings will be developed into an amphitheatre.  The landscaping of the site will provide a new hockey field, an additional oval for primary students and an adventure playground.  The tennis courts in front of the building will remain, while those at the rear will be replaced.  The present impressive façade of the school will be preserved.
