A piece of malachite from the first load carted to Adelaide from the Burra Mine has been returned here to the museum.  It comes as a result of a letter sent by Len Roberts of Kybybolite and Ian Auhl to Mary Broughton of the now defunct Chronicle. The malachite came from the Misses Roberts; 86-year-old twins of Clapham, whose grandfather was Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of Burra Burra Mine.
