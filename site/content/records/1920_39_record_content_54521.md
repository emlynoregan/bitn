Obituary.  Mrs W.H. Hardy of Kooringa received news of the unexpected death of her eldest daughter Lily Mrs Bert Wise of Katanning WA.  She was born at Springbank near Burra and prior to marrying lived in Kooringa, being well known and highly esteemed.  She was educated first at Miss Josling’s Private School and later at Burra Public School.  On 21 September 1897 she married at Kooringa Mr Herbert Wise, second son of the late Mr & Mrs John Wise of Cartapoo, Hallett.  The minister was Rev. T.M. Flood of the Bible Christian Church of which the bride was a consistent member and worker.  The couple made their home first at Broken Hill where Mr Wise worked in the mines for some years.  They then moved to Katanning WA where Mr Wise secured a good farming property and made a permanent home.  It was virgin land and after working hard and winning through to prosperity they had retired to Katanning when death claimed Mrs Wise.  She is survived by a Husband and family of five: Herb. Wise (on his parent’s farm), Mrs L. Stead, Mr Roy Wise and the Misses Pearl & Elva Wise.  There are five grandchildren.  This is the first death among Mrs Hardy’s ten daughters and two sons.  [Two children died in infancy: a daughter in 1883 and a son in 1894, but this seems to be the first death among those who survived childhood.]
