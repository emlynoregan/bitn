Burra Town Council, 4 March

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to build a house for Miss Lott in Kooringa.

Burra Cycle & Athletic Club sent a deputation of President Sylvester Preiss & Secretary Alex Bevan to ask permission to lay a saucer track around Victoria Park.  Neither football nor cricket would be affected and there would be no cost to the Council.  C. Sampson had offered to grade the oval for the material needed for the changes, and this would also improve the oval.  Approval was given.

Cr Dow moved work be done to repair the road and pedestrian bridges known as Lewis’s and to repair the wheels of the guns in the enclosure.  Carried.

There was some discussion re damming of Burra Creek to create a pool below the mill as a state centenary celebration effort, but there was no decision.

Cr Dow move enforcement of the ban on playing tennis on the Kooringa tennis courts on Good Friday and Sundays.  [This was a tactical move because it becomes apparent that while he may have been prepared to go along with Sunday tennis, he was strongly of the view that Good Friday was the very basis of Christianity and no sport should be played on that day.  The general hypocrisy over this issue can be traced through the Council for many years.]

The Mayor pointed out that at the last meeting the Council had approved metal being used on the Aberdeen courts in preparation for the Easter Tournament [which would involve both the Aberdeen and Kooringa courts].  Cr Dow’s motion failed to attract a seconder.

Cr Dow then gave notice that he would move at the next meeting to rescind the agreement between the Council and the Kooringa Tennis Club.

The Mayor thought that the Jubilee Avenue drinking fountain should be put in order for the King’s Silver Jubilee to be celebrated on 6 May, but nothing was resolved.
