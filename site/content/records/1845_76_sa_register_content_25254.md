The Northern Railways.  The editor seems suspicious of the Commissioner’s undertaking to do all he can to improve the service.  He fears the promises all sound rather vague.  He doubted that the timetable could be so arranged to allow a business trip to Adelaide and back in a day, but that is a key ambition of the complainants.  If he reduces the travel time it will have to be by reducing time spent at stations because the light line between Roseworthy and Burra can hardly accommodate speeds greater than 25 m.p.h. with safety.  Major problems are the revelations by Mr Mais that there is a lack of locomotive power, that if one engine were to break down there is not another to replace it, and that the present stock of locomotives have almost been worked to pieces.  A couple of new engines and some rolling stock have been ordered, but this should have been fitted into last year’s estimates.
