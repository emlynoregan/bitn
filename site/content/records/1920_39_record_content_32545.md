The New Hallett Institute was opened Wednesday 20 November.  The foundation stone had been laid 28 November 1928 by Miss Lily Melrose, daughter of Sir John Melrose.  The old Institute was constructed 50 years ago and was too small for the needs of the town and district.  The building is of blue stone with brick facings and is a fine two-storey building.  One enters a fine doorway to a lofty entrance hall 35’ x 10’6” and to the right there is a committee room 18’ x 14’ and a ladies cloak room.  To the left is a reading room 16’ x 14’ and library 12’ x 14’.  The main hall beyond is 60’ x 40’ with a ceiling of fibrous plaster and seating 370 with a floor of jarrah.  The stage 22’ x 22’6” has dressing rooms on either side.  The supper room is downstairs (underground) and is 20’ x 43’ with a kitchen off it 12’ x 20’.  From the main entrance jarrah stairs with blackwood handrails lead to the second floor Council Chamber 14’ x 18’6” and an adjoining billiard room 25’ x 30’ and a fireproof cinema room.  Mr Peter Findlay was the mason and Mr H. Dunneman the carpenter.  The Honorary Treasurer Mr Statton said the approximate cost was £6,225 of which £5,718-3-2 had been paid.  Sir John Melrose performed the opening and his speech and those of others are reported in detail.  Takings for the day inclusive of Sir John Melrose’s gift of £200 were about £540.  F. Gaskell has been appointed librarian and caretaker.
