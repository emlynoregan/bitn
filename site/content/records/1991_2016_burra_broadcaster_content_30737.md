R.M. Williams.  A quest to find the oldest pair of R.M. Williams boots was launched in Sydney last year.  167 pairs of boots were submitted and the winner was deemed to be a pair submitted by Gillian Barnard of Burra, with a pair that belonged to her father, Jack Snell.  She said he bought them in 1936.  He was Australian buck-jumping and steer-riding champion in the 1930s and 1940s.  They were first worn at the 1936 Clare Rodeo.  She and son Charles will be flown to Sydney on 14 April for the Great Aussie Muster, where they will be provided with a new pair of R.M. Williams boots valued at $799.
