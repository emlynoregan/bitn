Belinda Fare writes about a planned horse ride from Gosford NSW to Kellerberrin in WA, starting 14 July and expecting to pass through Burra 25 August.  She seeks overnight accommodation en route for two horses and a dog.

Burra Primary School held its Arbor Day on 12 July.  Trees were donated by the Town Council.  Heavy rain delayed the planting for at least a week.  Tenders have been called for the new toilet block on the east side of the school and for fencing off the sports area.

Weather.  Burra recorded another 44 points to 9 a.m. yesterday.
