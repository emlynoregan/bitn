Alfred Lines: murder-suicide.

There is a two-column report on the details of the Alfred Lines murder-suicide.

It took place in a cottage in Stanley St, North Adelaide on Friday last, 12 June.  Lines left a letter for his parents, which is printed.  Alfred Lines, son of Joseph Lines, was born 27 July 1837 and is therefore 26 years of age. [sic]  [This is clearly nonsense.  He was born 27 July 1859 and was therefore 25.]  He was a drover.  On 3 September 1881 he married Elizabeth Jane Stephens, born 8 December 1863 and aged 22 at death.  [Actually aged 21 at death]  They had two children, one aged 2 and the other an infant.  Alfred was addicted to drink and had formed an illicit intercourse with his sister-in-law Amelia Grow, aged c. 16 and who, on Thursday last gave birth to a child, the paternity of which he acknowledged.  Alfred lived at Mitchell Flat.  [The daughter, Rose, died aged 4 weeks in July.]

Maurice William O’Connor, a labourer, had for some time an improper intimacy with Mrs Lines.  At the start of June, Lines went off saying he was droving to Cooper’s Creek and would be away six weeks.  On 5 June Mrs Lines and O’Connor went to Adelaide and wrote to Lines telling him that as he was struck after Amelia and she was putting all trust in him, he had best get her to come and look after all the children together.

Mrs Lines and O’Connor met members of his family in Adelaide and then set up house in north Adelaide.  Lines returned unexpectedly, read the letter and the rest followed.  In Mrs Lines’ purse was found a note:

‘I hereby give my handwriting stating that I am no longer the husband of Elizabeth Lines; she can go anywhere she likes, and can marry whoever she likes -

Alfred Lines.  This day, 17th of March, 1885.’
