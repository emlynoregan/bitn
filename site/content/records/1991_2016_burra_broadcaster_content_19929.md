The Republic Referendum

Martin Cameron, Chair of the Yes campaign for the 6 November referendum on Australia becoming a republic, was in Burra this week to urge a YES vote.

The 1999 Burra Open Cycling Handicap was raced over 125 km at the weekend.  80 riders registered for the event, which marked the 92nd anniversary of the first Burra to Adelaide race.  The race was held in good weather.  [The winner is not named.]
