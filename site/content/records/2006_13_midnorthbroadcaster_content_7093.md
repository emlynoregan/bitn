The Regional Council of Goyder has held three of four scheduled Ward Meetings with Electors.  More than 40 attended at Hallett, 47 at Burra and about 40 at Robertstown.  These figures were lower than expected, but it did not prevent the views of the wider community from being heard.  Both Hallett & Robertstown had a feeling of ‘Burra favour’, but local issues soon dominated the discussions.  The Eudunda meeting is scheduled for April.
