Letter.  Roger cross writes acknowledging the humour of recent galah recipes, but also recalling the experience of China in 1958 when Mao Tse-Tung ordered the entire population to kill birds on 15 January on the grounds that they ate the harvest.  The result was a vast upsurge in plant pests and disastrously reduced agricultural production.
