Obituary.  Charles B. Warnes, pastoralist of Woolgangi and Parcoola, has died at Glenelg.  He was born at Princess Royal on 6 May 1874, the fourth son of Mr & Mrs Thomas Warnes of Koomooloo.  He was educated at Burra School and at Christ Church School Adelaide and Roseworthy Agricultural College.  When his father died Charles B. Warnes acquired Woolgangi, Parcoola and Perrin Stations and lived at Woolgangi until a few years ago when he retired to Glenelg.  He was for some years a member of the Murkaby Vermin Board and a member of the Burra DC.  His health had been poor, but of late he had seemed to be improving.  He died from a cerebral haemorrhage, leaving a wife, but no children.

[Born Charles Back Warnes 6 May 1873.]
