Fire broke out in the plantation at the rear of Sara & Co. Saturday afternoon, but was put out before it could reach 200 tons of wood and the petrol store.  Another was then found in manure near the petrol store.  Mr F. Sara suspects that both fires were deliberately lit, but in such hot weather a carelessly lit cigarette could be the cause.
