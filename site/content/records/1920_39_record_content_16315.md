Burra Hospital Board met on 22 June

The new hot water system has been installed.

A new septic tank for 50 persons is to be obtained and installed and the present tank will be sold.

The Chairman said Dr Morris estimated an isolation ward could be erected for £1,400.  There is £600 in hand and the Government would contribute £500.

Mr Melrose was clearly sceptical, saying that nurses’ quarters would be needed.  The cost of the Maternity Wing and Isolation Ward was first put at £3,700 and the Maternity Wing had eventually cost £6,040.

The salary of the three charge-nurses is to rise from £110 to £130 p.a.
