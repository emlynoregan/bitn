Burra School.  Headmaster Hubert O. Pederick writes denying that any students were asked to clean out the tanks.  Several lads volunteered, but it was decided not to allow it.  He does not consider the solution to the problems to be simple and challenges anyone to produce a simple remedy.  The editor says his report was based on the Local Board of Health meeting and in any case was prefaced by the statement ‘It is also reported,’ removing it from being a dogmatic statement.  He also feels that any good suggestions are as likely to produce as rapid a response as the schoolyard problem got.
