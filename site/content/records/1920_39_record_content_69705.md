Burra Primary School [Concerning the polio epidemic.]

The position at present is that students do not return to school before the 1 March.  The News is publishing daily work assignments on the lines of the Correspondence School and we recommend that parents take advantage of these, especially for students in Grade VII.  Books and tests are available from the school.  Students with problems can discuss them individually with teachers in normal school hours â€“ as far as possible out of doors.
