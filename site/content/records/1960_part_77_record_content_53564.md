Burra Mine

Unfortunately the scenic drive was not open at the weekend because the fence was not quite finished.  It is hoped it will be ready this weekend.  Tourists must observe the signage at the Mine and severe penalties face anyone who enters forbidden areas.  Work is proceeding on the large leach tanks.  The first of the tank bases and tops arrived last week by road.  They are over 22 ft in diameter.  The remainder are due within weeks.  The 150,000 gallon storage tank for the Bon Accord water supply should be completed, tested and filled in the next 18 days.  Other site services are well advanced.  Tests on blasting noise and vibrations showed ‘the effect very negligent [sic] and will not effect [sic] people in the district.’  A siren will warn of blasting, which will normally be once a day.
