Stan Kellaway writes to correct some statements made about a football match on 29 June.  Though no official complaints about his umpiring were received the Association decided to dispense with his services.  But for the match of 29th he had been appointed and had received no notice that his services were not required.  He had not had the courtesy of being asked to the meeting despite 18 years service, neither was he given the opportunity of resigning.  Monday following the 29 June he tendered his resignation and has since heard nothing of either acceptance or any other notice.
