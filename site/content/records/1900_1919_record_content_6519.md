After worshipping in the Council Chamber for many years Methodists in Hanson have formed a trust to prepare for the building of a church on two allotments of land at the corner of West and South Terraces.  Two-thirds of the outlay is to be secured in cash, promised subscriptions, or labour and materials before tenders are let.  At present the fund stands at Â£25-11-0.  The first money raising venture will be on Wednesday at 4 p.m. with a dinner and lecture at 6.30 p.m. by Rev. T.B. Anguin The Triumphs of Methodism.  This will be followed by a supper at 8.30 p.m. and the Broken Hill express will make a special stop to enable Burra visitors to go down by the afternoon train and return after the lecture.
