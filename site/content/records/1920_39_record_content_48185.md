Mongolata Goldfield

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM took out a valuable pocket at 92ft level and 267oz 18dwt has been recovered.

On 4 November a further 322oz 16dwt was announced.  This is from a partial clean-up of 200 tons with another 100 tons to go through.

Another claim is rumoured to be doing well while many are pegging quietly along.
