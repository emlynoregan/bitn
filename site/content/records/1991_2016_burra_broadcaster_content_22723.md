National Parks & Wildlife is about to establish a new office in Burra.  Ian Falkenberg, previously District Ranger Riverland will take up his new position for Burra & Districts in July.  A second Ranger position is planned for the district later in the year.  The staff will be well positioned to deal with issues associated with the increasing number of parks in the area.  Mokota Conservation Park near Mt Cone will need special attention.  It has been set aside to protect important grassland ecosystems.  Administration of the Kangaroo Management Program for the Murraylands Region will be relocated from Lameroo to Burra.
