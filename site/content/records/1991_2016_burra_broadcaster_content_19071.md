Burra Golf Club

A crowd in excess of 150 attended the official opening of the redeveloped course on Sunday 16 May.  President Darryl Venning welcomed everyone and described the greening of the course as the most exciting event in the club’s history.  A huge amount of work had gone into excavating the dam and getting the water to the dam and greens and then the laying of the sprinklers and wiring for the computerisation of the scheme.  Then there was the development of the greens themselves.  He thanked the professionals involved:

Kym Traeger, the designer

Craig Wilson from the Mid North Regional Development Board

Peter Boaden from Goyder Council

Simon Kibble from Adchem

And the many sponsors.

Denis Keller, Chairman of the Regional Council of Goyder congratulated the club on the project, which had made the course a further attraction for Burra and added to its appeal as a visitor destination.  He outlined the project’s history:

In 1996 the Burra Burra DC was approached and it commended the project to the new Regional Council for consideration in 1997.

After further planning and fine tuning it was referred to the Regional Council in November 1997 and got unanimous support.

A loan of $175,000 was arranged with a donation of $50,000 to be given as $10,000 per annum for five years.

Guarantors of the loan were sought in August 1998 and the community strongly supported it.

In all the project came in at just over $200,000, with $30,000 being donated in volunteer work.

Other speakers congratulated the club:

President of WGSA Den Michelmore

Vice-President of SAGA Malcolm Jones

Warren Mosey of the Lower North Group

Di Day as Secretary of Burra Golf Club

The ribbon was then cut by Denis Keller and last year’s champions Lesley Gosse and Gus Wenzel hit the first balls off the first tee.
