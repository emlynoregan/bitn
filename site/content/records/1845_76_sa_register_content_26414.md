Kooringa, 23 June.

Excellent photographs of the Burra Mine taken by H.J. Thwaites deserve mention.

Wheat is beginning to appear and the hills are clad in a carpet of green.

Monday was not observed as a holiday in Burra; the tradesmen preferred to observe it on Thursday, the day of the annual mine holiday.
