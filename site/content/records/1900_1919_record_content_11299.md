R.M. Harvey, the popular manager of the Bank of Australasia in Burra, is leaving after 15 years here.  He has been transferred to Shepparton in Victoria.  He joined the bank in Victoria when only 16 and served as a clerk at Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Creswick & Kingston before being appointed manager of Cairns in Queensland after only 7 years.  He then went to Townsville and Pt Augusta before Burra.  Here he has worked up the branch to ‘voluminous dimensions’ and leaves ‘not a single enemy behind’.  He has been warden of St Mary’s Church for many years, Chairman of the Burra Hospital Board, Secretary of the Burra Branch of the Agricultural Bureau, President of the Burra Institute and has been associated with everything appertaining to the welfare of the town.  He leaves Burra on 27 September.
