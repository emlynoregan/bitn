There were only three hotels in Kooringa.  The present Burra Hospital was kept by Jimmy Lamb [1867-1876].  A man called Banks built the Unicorn Brewery just below the Burra School.  The present Burra Hotel was then called the Miners’ Arms.  Another, on the same side of the creek, burnt down.  It was in Lower Thames St, called the Pig & Whistle.  There was a wine store where Sara’s Kooringa shop is now.  The new Kooringa Bridge was built about 1877 or 1878 after the old one washed away in a flood.  [The new bridge opened for traffic in May 1879 after a flood on 23 March 1877 destroyed the old one.]  In this flood a circus was camped along the creek and there was a rush to get the elephants and tents away when the creek came down.
