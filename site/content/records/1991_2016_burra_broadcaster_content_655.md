A letter to the Editor takes the form of a poem ‘Town Folk of Burra’ (Anonymous)

[It seems to be a response to a recent spate of kids throwing rocks on roofs.  It calls for tolerance and a memory of what we did for fun when young.  The verses may be anonymous, but the style is reminiscent of Evan Hawke.]
