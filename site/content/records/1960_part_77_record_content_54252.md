The statement in Parliament that it is intended to have a new High School by 1974 means we may not be responsible for the care of these areas for much longer.

[The headmaster then goes on to praise and thank in the usual way the High School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Association.]

The Commonwealth grants are supplying some needed equipment, but other items need to be purchased; for example we have been supplied with a video-tape recorder, but tapes are needed for it and they cost over $27 each.

School assemblies this year included interesting talks by Miss Boona Ruhs, an Indian lady who has recently taught in Vietnam, Sally Valiente (a Rotary Exchange Student at Clare) and Mr Hope (Site Manager at the Burra Mine).

Through the sponsorship of the Methodist Church we have had a Rotary Exchange Student, Tom Eastman [from the USA].

There was a school trip in September to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra – accompanied by Mr West, Miss Pfitzner and Mr & Mrs Salt.  The Junior School had a camp at Woolshed Flat.

[There is then a section on internal sporting and House activities.]

In examinations the results were not disappointing.  Overall subject ‘passes’ i.e. Grade IV or better was 85.6% compared with a state average of 75%.  Outstanding results were achieved by Lynette Griffen and Angela Quinn.  John Lloyd has been awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship.

This year we have completely dispensed with school examinations and promotion has been on the results of continuing assessment.  Leaving has an increasing focus on research and the library and out extremely small library is another reason why we need a new school.  This new approach to learning is an evolving process for both staff and students.  French was introduced in 1st Year for the first time to be extended to 2nd Year in 1971 and Leaving Typewriting will be introduced in 1971.

Some staff changes are expected.

Mr Moyle will be promoted to Senior Master and moves to Strathmont Boys Technical High School.

Miss Kussadias and Miss Urlwin are expected to move on.

[The next section dealt with the roles of House Captains and Prefects and was followed by general thanks to cleaners, the Burra Record, Mrs Carpenter for training the choir, the Primary School for co-operation, donors of prizes and Judge Olsson.]
