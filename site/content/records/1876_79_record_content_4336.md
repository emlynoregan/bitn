Editor on Upper House reform. A clearly written outline of the present state of affairs in SA, Vic & NSW & need to do something to resolve problems when the two houses are at loggerheads. The Ed. advocates that at every Lower House election ⅓ of the Leg. Council go to the polls too, thus making the Upper House more responsive to changes in electoral feeling & yet preserving its desirable conservatism.
