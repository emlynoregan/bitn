Editor on Upper House reform. A clearly written outline of the present state of affairs in SA, Vic & NSW & need to do something to resolve problems when the two houses are at loggerheads. The Ed. advocates that at every Lower House election â…“ of the Leg. Council go to the polls too, thus making the Upper House more responsive to changes in electoral feeling & yet preserving its desirable conservatism.
