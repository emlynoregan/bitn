Fire. On 1 Jan. fire broke out on Booborowie Plain when a sheep trod on a match - it was luckily put out by an army of rabbit exterminators who were nearby. Another in the same afternoon on land of Mr Skews in the H. of Ayers burnt considerable wheat and also damaged the crop of Mr Hallett, just as it was ready for his reaper.
