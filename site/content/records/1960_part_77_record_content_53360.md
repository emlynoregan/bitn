The Burra Show will be opened by the Governor Sir James Harrison, who is on a three day tour of the area.  He will meet Councillors on Saturday morning at the Town Hall at 10 a.m. before going on to the showgrounds.  A shearing shed has been erected for this yearâ€™s show, which will feature a good range of sideshows and motor cycle trials as a new feature.
