Mr Sutherland, a candidate for the N-E District of the Legislative Council, addressed a small gathering of voters at the Institute last Thursday evening.

He said he was opposed by a strong coalition of squatters and landed proprietors.  One inequality of the election was the use of free travel passes by old members.  He was strongly opposed to the tariff bill.  He felt SA was seeing the rise of a landed aristocracy as holdings became consolidated.  A man like Jay Gould could buy the land around a town like Burra and turn it over to grazing and so ruin the town.  A French copper syndicate could buy the Burra Mine just to keep it closed.  He favoured a land tax, but not a property tax.  He disliked the private ownership of railways and water conservation schemes and ‘objected to the introduction of inferior races to the colony’. 

Like the other candidates, he favoured federation, but this would not come till tariffs in all colonies were equal.
