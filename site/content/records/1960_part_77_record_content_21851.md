Kooringa Methodist Church Golden Jubilee

Members past and present filled the church on Sunday 4 October for the Jubilee Service.  The Resident Minister Rev. M.A. Lind conducted the morning service.  In 1914 the late Rev. J.C .Jennison had read the Old Testament Lesson and at the Jubilee his grandson Mr Ray Jennison read the lesson in his stead.  Sir Philip McBride, who was the first bridegroom married in the present building, read the New Testament Lesson.  The guest preacher was the Rev. G.C. Hutchinson, ex-President of the Methodist Conference and Kooringa Minister from 1933-36.

Mr & Mrs Robert Broad acted as Host and Hostess at the luncheon.  Mr Broad is Trust Secretary.  The ladies of the church catered for 160 guests.  The afternoon was a great time for reunion.  Among the large congregation for the Evening Service were Rev. R. Jenner, the immediate past minister and his family and Rev. M.S. Martin and his family.  The Jubilee of the building was also the Kooringa Churchâ€™s 118th Anniversary.  The guest speaker again gave the address.  Supper followed in the hall.
