Flood Aftermath.  On Saturday a working bee set about clearing up after the flood at Robertson’s.  In places silt 3-4’ deep had been deposited.  The workers had 16 drays, 24 horses and 60 men.  The Mayor and some Councillors and ex-Councillors were among those pitching in.  By 6 o’clock over 200 loads had been removed from the yard around the house.  Monetary donations we believe total over £50.  We hear something is being done to aid Mr & Mrs Allen who also suffered very severely.
