Mongolata goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight ending 22 May.

Lean’s Shaft.  At 80ft level the western side wall drive going south has been extended to 50ft in increased values.  Drive going north advanced to 26ft with low values.

Main Drive North shows promising signs in the west wall of the drive where a cut to locate the western side wall lead has picked it up 5ft west of Main Drive and 60ft north of the shaft.

A crushing of 15tons 4cwt has yielded 33oz or 2oz 3dwt 10gr per ton with tailings to come.

Riggs Open Cut Shaft.  Advanced only 5ft to 51ft.  Lode material is becoming more confined and looking better.
