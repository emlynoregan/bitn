Burra Town Council, 15 October [reported as 15 September]

A petition against changing the name of Kooringa was presented signed by 229 persons, and giving as reasons:

The petitioners were quite satisfied with the name the town had as Kooringa for over 80 years.

Since the name Burra applies to the whole Corporation area it is not appropriate for Kooringa alone.

The petitioners resented the statement that they were anxious for change.  They were not.

A referendum is a needless expense, as your petitioners deem any change quite unnecessary.

After some fairly trivial technical arguments from Cr Riggs over whether the petition could be accepted and on the propriety of some Councillors having signed it, the petition was received.

Cr Riggs moved to withdraw his motion to rescind the motion asking for a change to North and South Burra Post Offices.

Cr Pearce then gave notice of a motion to rescind the motion calling for a poll.

George March wrote seeking to buy a piece of blind road that penetrated his property in Spring St Kooringa.  Granted for Â£10.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Mrs Boz Pearce.

Tenders are to be called for repairing the shelter-shed roofs at Victoria Park and to place a 200 gallon square tank there.

Various road, drainage and kerbing work was approved.
