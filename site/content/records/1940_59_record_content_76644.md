A.C.C. Lock, the Australian author of Destination Barrier Reef and Tropical Tapestry, visited Burra last week.  He is preparing for a book tentatively entitled Splendid Heritage, in which Burra would feature prominently.  He was much taken with the old swing bridge â€“ currently deemed unsafe for use.
