Betty Pens has compiled a brief history of the Burra Women’s Agricultural Bureau, which operated 1983-99.  It was instigated in March 1983 by Freda Pink of Basin Farm and the first President was Pat Brereton, with Betty Pens as Vice-President, and Janet Slade as Secretary-Treasurer.  In 1994 the Clare and Burra branches merged, but numbers were so low in 1999 that it was decided to close.  The minutes, banner and this history book were lodged in the Local History Room of the Burra Community Library.
