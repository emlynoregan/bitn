Kooringa News, 20 November

There have been numerous complaints recently, especially from the inhabitants of Redruth, about the closing of two or three cross roads north of the township.  This has diverted much traffic from Aberdeen and Redruth, as travellers from there are unable to get onto the Mount Remarkable Road without a considerable detour, thus depriving the two townships of the benefits of the North Road traffic.  It is time the Ranger or other responsible person enquired into the matter.

On Friday a little boy called Prior fell into a well and sustained a rather severe contusion to the head.  I have not heard how he is progressing.

We have had a foretaste of summer.  On Saturday it was close and sultry and on Sunday it rose to 94Â°F in the shade.  Sunday was also hot and sultry until relief came in the form of a thunderstorm with one or two sharp showers at about noon.  The afternoon and evening were cooler.
