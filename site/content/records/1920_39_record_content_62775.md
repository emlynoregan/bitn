Stockowners’ Association of SA, Burra Branch AGM was held in the Eastern Telephone Exchange Building on Friday 21 August.  President I.J. Warnes took the chair.  He was re-elected for the coming year.  The President reported on the year’s activities.  The main concern had been erosion of the pastoral country.  Mr Ratcliffe has been investigating the matter for the Federal Government, but they will have to keep applying pressure to see that action follows.  The attempt to get a nominal registration fee for primary producers’ motor vehicles was not successful – the Government claims it is too difficult to draft such legislation.  There is some hope that they may be able to get them classified as commercial vehicles, which would be of some help.  The AWU sought heavily increased rates for shearers and despite persuasive evident against it the Judge eventually awarded and increase in shearing rates from £3-14-0 to £4-0-6 per 100 and for shed hand an increase from £3-14-0 to £4-0-6 a week.  After years of discussion a levy of 6d a bale was introduced on wool to promote publicity and research.  A Wool Board was set up to see the money collected was not wasted and a Meat Board has also been established.  [Various other matters were referred to briefly.]

Mr Virgo, the General Secretary of the Association gave the main address.
