The Aberdeen Roadhouse at Burra North has re-opened with a fresh new look.  The new proprietors are Nerida and Graham Hillier.  They have carried out extensive renovations.  Original floorboards have been used for the counter and under the windows.  A new floor has been installed and the whole place repainted.  The kitchen is being refitted and should be operational in about two weeks.  Nerida, a retired administration manager, and Graham, a retired teacher, come from Mitchell Park.  The roadhouse re-opened on 23 December and will be open 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. except Thursday when it will close at 5 p.m.  [Photo of the proprietors.]
