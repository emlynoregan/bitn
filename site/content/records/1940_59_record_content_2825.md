Burra Progress Assoc. Committee Meeting, 30 July.

The Director of Mines advises that he would not favour the Govt. subsidising a company (if formed) to re-open the Burra Mine and as it would not be possible at present to obtain sufficient capital without Govt. assistance, the committee decided not to pursue the matter for the time being.

They decided to ask the Council to take action to prevent itinerant traders from occupying areas in town streets contrary to Corporation by-laws.

Town and District Councils will be asked to co-operate in compiling a list of all those who have enlisted to ensure an easy compilation of a Roll of Honour at the conclusion of the war.

The detailed reply from the Director of Mines is printed in c. 1½ columns:

The proposal suggests it is undesirable to have prospecting operations from Graves’ Shaft and a single pump was apparently contemplated by the proposers, because the Director’s reply says he is not confident that either of these steps is wise.

Driving from Morphett’s Shaft will only find payable ore if such ore exists and there is no definite proof that such is the case.

Allowance needs to be made for 3,000’ or more of cross-cutting, requiring at least £18,000.

The Director says further plant is needed above that suggested and the proposed scheme would need a second pump and second equipped shaft.  Capital of £100,000 would be needed.

The sum of £84,000 cited for main items of expenditure does not cover finding a new water supply for Kooringa.  [Presumably really for Burra.]

The cost for pumping and chlorination plant	£3,500

Annual running cost		£1,774

If Filtration is also needed		£17,450

With annual costs of		£2,582

If use of the proposed Morgan-Whyalla scheme is needed	£37,000

With annual costs of		£5,355

The lack of information on the underlying ores beneath the oxidised ores of the open cut makes the whole enterprise doubtful.

Given this and with no funds having been subscribed, the Govt. is being asked to undertake a primary part in the promotion scheme.

This, even though the matter has not got so far as to indicate to whom management or control of the mine would be entrusted.

The entirely speculative nature of the whole thing undoubtedly influenced BHP’s decision not to become involved.

As a result the Director found it impossible to recommend the proposal to the Govt. as one worthy of adoption.  The prospects of success are very doubtful and the cost of testing the possibilities is high.

Burra VSD meeting on Wednesday last on air raid precautions is reported in c. 2¼ columns.
