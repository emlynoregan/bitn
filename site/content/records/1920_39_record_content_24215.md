Kooringa Methodist Church.  A large congregation assembled on the afternoon of 18 September for the opening of the new organ donated by people of Burra and District to commemorate the service as organists of the late Mr John Pearce and his two daughters the late Misses Alice and Trix Pearce.  The dedication was performed by Rev. J.H. Nield late of Kooringa and now of Adelaide.  A memorial window erected by the family to the memory of their late parents, their brother Frank and the two sisters was unveiled by the eldest surviving son, Mr Edgar Pearce.  A marble baptismal font and hymn book were also dedicated.  They were given by Miss Rose Pearce in memory of her parents the late Mr & Mrs T.W. Pearce and her sister, Miss Sarah Pearce.

Five surviving daughters and four of the sons of John Pearce attended.

Mr John Pearce had been organist for 35 years and was succeeded by his daughter Alice for 10 years until forced to resign due to ill health.  Miss Trix Pearce had then held the post for over 17 years till her death last March.  The organ is a Sherlock-Manning Cathedral Organ containing 5 octaves, 12 sets of reeds and 21 stops.  Rev. Nield also preached at the evening service.
