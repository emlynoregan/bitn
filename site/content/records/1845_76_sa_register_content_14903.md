Kooringa News, 25 September

The season continues to be most promising for both the agriculturalist and the pastoralist.  Crops give rich promise and pasture is abundant.

Mr H. Dawson is the contractor for the new mail line to Duffield’s Woolshed, starting next Monday and running fortnightly.  The terminus is on the North-Eastern Plains, 150 miles from Kooringa.
