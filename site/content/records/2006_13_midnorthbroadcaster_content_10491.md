The Burra Mine Site

Goyder Council has sent a lengthy submission to PIRSA in response to Phoenix Copper’s application to lift the Burra Mine Reserve.  Council considered the reports prepared by Golder Associates on behalf of Phoenix Copper, by the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee and its own Heritage Advisor.  It took into account opinions expressed by key community groups in the district and at the Public Information Meeting by both Phoenix and the public.  Council’s discussion on 22 June 2010 proved to be inconclusive, with no resolution being reached.  The public meeting saw widely divergent views expressed, but about 60% of those present supported allowing the exploration in the reserve.  As a result the Council has adopted the view that exploration will determine the existence or otherwise of untapped mineral reserves, after which the potential for economic stimulus for the Burra community from mining can be determined.

However, in view of community concerns the Council has also asked that a series of strict criteria be met to protect heritage vales and structures:

The reserve be lifted only for the mine site [– not the smelts section of the reserve.]

That the lifting be for no more than two years and it then be reimposed.

That the Exploration Licence, once awarded not be transferable to any other party.

A Conservation Management Plan be prepared prior to exploration, by a suitable expert with recommendations for appropriate cartilage* [sic] to guide, inform and limit exploration and mining activities.  The plan to be adopted only after appropriate community consultation by the Department of Environment and Heritage.

[* The Council used the obscure word ‘curtilage’ – a mediaeval term for an enclosed area around a house etc.]

An Archaeological Investigation of the area to be explored to form fart of the Conservation Management Plan.

A detailed Hydrological Impact Study be prepared and its impacts understood before exploration commencing.

Details of locations of drill holes be provided to Council and approved before exploration commences.

Details of [the impact of ] noise and vibrations on residents, the stability of the open cut, the town and historical structures be provided, understood and approved by Council prior to exploration.

A Visual Impact Statement be provided and approved by Council prior to exploration.

Council provided the submission on behalf of the Goyder community generally and the Burra community in particular as well as in its capacity as the owner of the greater part of the reserve.
