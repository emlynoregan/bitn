Burra Town Council, 7 February

A building application from S.M. Lane was approved.

Cr Kellaway queried why the fountain on the Aberdeen road had not been repaired.  The overseer said Mr Greenwood had it in hand, but the bowl was cracked and it seemed impossible to mend it.  The matter was left in the hands of the Mayor and Cr Treloar.

The Governor is to visit the district for two or three days from 23 March, 30 March or 6 April.

The Mayor proposed he be given a civic reception and then the Fallen Soldiers’ Committee would take over.  It was resolved that a suitably worked piece of malachite be presented in place of an illuminated address.

The Mayor referred to the disturbance at the Reformatory.  He had attended on Friday and found eight girls on the roof pulling down the parapet and stacking stones in preparation for the police.  Their language was beyond description.  Windows and sashes had been broken and bricks [were] everywhere.  Two girls used a clothesline to escape over the wall.  The Secretary of the State Children’s Department was sent up.  He believed while in that state the girls were capable of taking life.  The whole trouble was the destruction of the Matron’s authority by the removal of the power of punishment.  This was the third mutiny.  The Mayor had asked the Chief Secretary to prosecute the offenders.
