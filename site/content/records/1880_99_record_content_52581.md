Holidays

Christmas and New Year saw beautiful sunshine.

Because 1 January fell on Monday the New Year’s Eve was kept up on Saturday night.  The Council had three special constables sworn in and they were largely successful in protecting property.  About 9 p.m. it was reported that a foot bridge in Chapel St had been lifted and it was found to be so placed as to tip up the first person who tried to use it.  The gentleman who tried to do so escaped uninjured, but his parcels were widely scattered.  Several other crossings were removed, making it dangerous for pedestrians on such a dark night.  They were replaced on Sunday, but torn up again on Sunday night.

The Burra Band played from the balcony of the Commercial Hotel at 11.30 on Sunday night.

Watch night services were held in the Kooringa Wesleyan Church & the Redruth Primitive Methodist Church and both were well attended.

New Year’s Day saw Kooringa Wesleyan Church hold its picnic at Mr Fradd’s [Sod Hut] and the Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Church had a public tea.
