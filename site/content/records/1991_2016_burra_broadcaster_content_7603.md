Anthony Thorogood – ‘The Rainforests of Burra’

An article on the question of whether Burra was ever forested.

Claims are made for the presence of river red gums, blue gums, peppermint gums and sheoaks in the area.  There is good evidence for red gums along the local creeks.  Old records make reference to sheoaks and Kooringa is said to mean a ‘place of sheoaks’ in the Ngadjuri language.  Records do not refer to blue gums in Burra, but there are good stands of blue gums to the south, north and west.  I have been told there are peppermint gums on Princess Royal Station.

S.T. Gill’s painting of a View of Burra in 1847 shows sheoaks and strands [sic] of gums.

Golden wattle is colonising part of the mine site and the district also has examples of the rare Acacia glandulicarpa and of Acacia rotundifolia on road verges.  Another native shrub is the Christmas bush, Bursaria spinosa.

Despite this all the old writings and paintings support the view that the area was dominated by savannah woodland – that is to say a grassland with scattered trees.  The recent discovery of the pygmy blue tongue lizard supports this, as it is a creature of grassland.
