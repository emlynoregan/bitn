Aberdeen Football Club Women’s Auxiliary held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs S. Scroop; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Wall & D. Robinson; Secretary, Mrs I. Hirschausen & Assistant Secretary, Mrs T. Rule.

Catering in the year gave a profit of $638-18 from a party and weddings, plus $499.24 from ‘at home’ matches.  The Auxiliary was thus able to give $650 to the Management Committee and $102 to the Basketball Club.  President Florrie Scroop was made a life member of the club at the opening of the new recreation room.  [Details in ⅔ column.]
