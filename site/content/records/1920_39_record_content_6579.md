The Case of John Rowe (16), who was recently sent to Magill Reformatory by Messrs E.W. Crewes and M.A. Radford for obtaining money by false pretences, has been taken on appeal to the State children’s Council and the order was overturned.  As the lad was half-witted and it was a first offence the Council deemed it called for clemency on the father undertaking to care for him and arranging employment.
