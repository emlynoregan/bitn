‘Jimmy’ writes in Cornish dialect.  He has a go at the situation of the Hospital Board and ‘poore ole Bryan’ and then turns to a reference concerning why the Council has warned people about the ford at Gully’s Wharf, which doesn’t seem to have been reported as news anywhere.

‘Ded i tel e aboute the Meyor getin stucke in that there crake, Counciller dane was with un.  Law twas funy, the motter car got in the big ole, by Gullie’s warf.  They ded un think their was one, but they foun un rite enuf.
