Mr Warnes asked if Mr Radford’s wool was stopped two years ago and Mr Radford seemed unclear.  Mr Warnes said the secretary would reply, but plenty of exhibitors had been stopped the year before last in certain sections and had Mr Radford made enquiries he would have got satisfaction.  Mr Edwards said the society had endeavoured to have exhibits bred, grown and reared by the exhibitor on the country it was from to show the different types of wool and sheep and not to have bought exhibits placed in these classes.  In sheep exhibits one exhibitor used to buy fat sheep in Adelaide and take them around the country shows collecting all the prizes.  They did not want a similar thing to happen with wool.  He stood by the rules of the society.  The rules had been altered and advertised in The Record and in the catalogue and if Mr Radford had not read the same it was not the fault of the society.

Mr Radford said if the officials had said they regretted the occurrence and were sorry about it he would have said no more.  He asked for the minutes of the meeting that made the decision.  Mr Warnes said none were kept for such hurriedly called meetings on the ground.

Mr Radford said he would have nothing more to do with the society and left.

The President said he was one of three members of the Technical Committee at the Royal Show and gave instances of similar decisions having to be made there.

I.J. Warnes was re-elected President with A.B. Riggs & S.H. Robinson as Vice-Presidents.  The next show is set for Saturday 29 October.
