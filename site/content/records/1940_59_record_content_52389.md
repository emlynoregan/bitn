D.S. Craig’s clearing sale on Wednesday 24 October was held despite driving wind, rain and hail.  Despite all the disadvantages good prices were bid for equipment.  By the end of the day a number of those who attended had to have their cars hauled out of boggy ground by a tractor.

[Prices for various items are printed.]
