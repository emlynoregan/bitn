Burra Town Council.

Cr Ridgway said, `The creek was the worst place in the town already. He would especially mention the pool full of living death under the Redruth Bridge.'

The Mayor thought not much could be done so long as slaughtering and keeping of pigs was allowed in the town.

Cr Geake thought that without a health rate rubbish would only be hidden and not removed. Cr Ridgeway objected and considered it a waste of money - a loss of £150 from the Govt. and a tax on large ratepayers for the benefit only of those who paid an inconsiderable sum. He moved for a public meeting to consider it. Cr Richardson 2nd This motion was, like the adoption of the health rate, carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

There was a long argument over tendering out of work versus giving it to the daymen. Crs Ridgway & Richardson being strongly in favour of tendering out.
