Local Board of Health.

Dr Steele has recommended getting Typhoid Serum and making it available to the public.  The doctor is to be allowed to charge his patients a fee for administering the serum and the public is to be advised via advertisement.  On bottle of 10cc is to be obtained as a trial.

A.J. McBride writes concerning Dr Ashton’s recent letter about the hospital.  He wonders if there is great dissatisfaction.  From the number of patients treated over recent months it would seem the management is satisfactory.  The average number of patients for some time is quite 30 and before the war it was only 20.  It is not true that patients can only be admitted by the Board – they can be admitted by any Qualified Medical Practitioner and have been for years.  It is intended to give Dr Ashton the same rights as Dr Steele in admitting patients, so as to give his patients the benefit of hospital treatment.    Mc Bride says he told Dr Steele he had no doubt an application from Dr Ashton to become a medical officer on equal terms with Dr Steele would be accepted, but Dr Ashton for reasons best known to himself would not give consent to Dr Steele’s contemplated action in asking for two medical officers.  Dr Steele has apparently not made any official request pending Dr Ashton’s consent.
