Races. The Burra Jockey Club race meeting was held at the Copperhouse track on 2 April with excellent weather and attendance of over 700.

The grandstand was well patronised and may have to be enlarged in the future. The richest event was the Burra Handicap over 2 miles, won by Mr J.E. Savill's Queen Consort ridden by D. Taylor. The accident to McGrath occurred when he rode Talk o' the Glen against a post in the Maidens.
