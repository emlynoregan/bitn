The Inspector reports  Burra Hospital is unsatisfactory, especially the Isolation Ward which ‘has evidently been in use as a home for cats, turkeys and other poultry, the rooms were in a filthy state with the droppings from the poultry and the beds, as in evidence, had been occupied by cats and were in a disgusting state.’  An order to get the ward into a fit state has been complied with.  The Inspector believed this ward was not a fit place to send patients and urged the Board to take action for a more suitable building.
