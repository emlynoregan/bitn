£900 p.a. was an excessive amount to raise.  The stated £8,500 capital cost claimed by the Government was enormous and the works were never worth it.  £8,500 at 4% is £220.  Allow £150 for wages, £60 for fuel and £20 for the collector and you get £450.  To meet that the Government seek £1,000 in rates.
