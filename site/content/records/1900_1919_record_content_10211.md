Redruth Court, 8 June

James Knevitt was charged with disturbing the peace at the Burra Hotel on 29 May.

C.C. Heinrich, licensee, gave evidence that Knevitt knew he was barred from the hotel on that day (a Sunday), but entered the back way about 10 a.m.  He left when told to but returned later at 9 p.m. the same day.  He refused to leave and argued with Heinrich who picked up a length of hose.  Heinrich prepared to fight him and Hall & Bewley tried to make him desist.  Heinrich said he only pretended to have a revolver in his back pocket.  When he sent for the police Knevitt left.  He denied hitting the defendant or using profane language.

Thomas Hall[s] Jun. said he had gone to the hotel to see if anyone there was going out on the morning train, but he claimed not to have heard the conversation between Heinrich & Knevitt.  (Or not clearly anyway.)

Knevitt gave evidence that he had been served before on a Sunday night, but denied the used of abusive language and said he had walked out when asked to leave.

Stanley Bewley also failed to either see much or hear much of what had occurred.

The Bench was clearly unsatisfied with the evidence of the two witnesses and imposed a fine of 5/- plus costs.
