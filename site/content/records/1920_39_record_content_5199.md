Rev. J.C. Jennison was on the ketch Aethmyst which sailed from Darwin on 21 June and on 1 July Rev. Jennison, Mr Fletcher (carrying his three-year-old son) and five natives left the boat at Port Bremer and walked 30 miles to Brown’s Camp in Bowen Strait expecting the boat to pick them up the next day.  It failed to arrive and they had to walk a further 100 miles to Ross Point.  Here it took them from Thursday afternoon to Monday morning before their signals were seen and a rescue party came to their aid.  They were reduced to surviving on native roots, foul water and shellfish.  In all it turned into an eleven day ordeal.  The Aethmyst was found wrecked only five miles from where they had left her.  Her anchor had dragged.  Fortunately no lives were lost.  [Detail takes ⅔ column.]

[Bowen Strait lies between the Cobourg Peninsula and Croker Island.]

[Rev. J.C. Jennison was the father of Horton J.B. Jennison of Burra.]
