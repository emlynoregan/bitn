NSW Gold from the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 August.

The richness of the Turon diggings is confirmed.  A large proportion of the entire population is earning high wages and there are very few not doing well.  [The report then details parcels of gold being despatched by individuals.]

The gold found by Dr Kerr had been purchased for Messrs Thacker & Co. for Â£4,160.  On Tuesday Mr Daniel took it out of the bank to transfer it to Sydney by the mail.  It was then taken possession of by Commissioner Hardy for the Government.  The position is unclear.  Dr Kerr at the time did not have a licence to dig for gold, but surely, having passed into the hands of a third party the payment of a small royalty should see it returned to its purchasers.

[The paper predicts that soon steamers will be bringing would be miners to Australia from England.]
