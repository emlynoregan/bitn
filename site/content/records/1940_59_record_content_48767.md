Burra Town Council, 18 December

The electricity petition has not been prepared because Mr A.R. Downer MP has advised that the claims should be discussed with the company’s General Manager and that an invitation should be extended for him to visit Burra.   Cr Bernhardt moved that the invitation be extended and it include the Chief Engineer, Mr R.H.M. Lea.  Carried.

The question of a petition was left in abeyance.

SAR advises its intention to resume part of the land leased to the Corporation, as from 28 February 1951.  (It was needed for housing opposite the Shell depot in Burra North.)

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the Fire Brigade’s swift action in quelling the recent fire that threatened the shopping area.  A letter of commendation was sent to Chief Officer Whyte.

Sir Hubert Wilkins has said submarine movements under ice in the Arctic Ocean could carry American troops to within striking distance of Russia.
