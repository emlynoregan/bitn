Elections.  Last Thursday at the Institute Hon. F.W. Holder addressed electors.

The Mayor, T.W. Wilkinson, took the chair.

Holder said he had fulfilled pledges from the last election on taxation, education, local option and Railway Commissioners.  He had served on the Land Commission, the Committee to enquire into the loss of the Star of Greece, and was chairman of the Barrier Trade Committee.

He had been against protection, but the Government had to concede the policy of protection a fair trial.  He then discussed SA’s generally favourable financial position and said the old deficit would gradually be reduced.  He then discussed the proposed progressive land tax (as in the editorial above).  The largest taxpayer in SA was the SA Company with over £1,000,000 worth of property (unimproved value) and those with most interest in it were living in England.  On this their land tax was £2,229.  Under the proposal this would increase to £12,900.  If this is too much let them sell the land to others and encourage population growth.  Increasing the tax all round would be unfair to many doing their best on the land.  As a result of this tax we propose to remit the duty on tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate and kerosene and reduce that on sugar.  We intend to extend the Transcontinental Railway and carry on works of water conservation and irrigation to produce flourishing settlements at Lake Bonney and Mannum.  It is proposed to reduce the autocratic power of the Commissioner of Railways.

He favoured a wisely devised scheme for federation, but not to have Australia governed from Sydney, Melbourne, or Albury.

T. Ward spoke to electors.  He was opposed to a single tax system and against progressive land tax.  He was for a property tax.  He opposed any other railway to the Barrier.  Federation was a dream and local jealousies had first to be sank. [sic]  He was for a capitation grant and against changing the divorce laws.  He was for a Transcontinental Railway

Mr Ridgway said he would address them on another occasion.

All candidates were in favour of compensation for persons loosing [sic] property by fire from locomotives.
