For the Town and District by the Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes

Half the provisions for the tea were donated by W.R. Ridgway and the rest by subscription.

The proceedings throughout the afternoon and evening were affected by the wet weather, but still in all £50-13-3 was raised.  A further £80 is needed as the trustees are determined not to increase the £200 debt on the building.
