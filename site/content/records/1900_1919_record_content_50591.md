Burra Town Council.

J.E.H. Winnall writes that an anonymous donor has offered a roll of honour for those who have fallen and may yet fall in the war.  Accepted with thanks.

Mr Thamm appeared protesting that his residence in Young St had been assessed at £20.  It had cost £235 and a neighbour’s 5-roomed house was assessed at £8.

Cr Killicoat: ‘Why, isn’t it true that the pro-Germans got all they wanted at the last election.’

Mr Thamm: ‘I don’t want to be called a pro-German.’

After some discussion Cr Killicoat moved to reduce the assessment to £17-10-0, as they had reduced Mr Kellock’s from £26 to £20.

Mr Thamm thanked the council for its ‘careful consideration of the matter and the magnificent result achieved.’  [Mr Thamm’s letter in the next issue, page 3, confirms that the tone here was sarcastic.]

The Mayor reported on the deputation to the Commissioner of Railways re a Saturday night train.  The deputation represented towns from Gawler to Petersburg.  The response was an unpromising one: to consider the matter.

In the matter of private post boxes at Aberdeen it seems the only way they will be obtained is if the local postmaster buys them and has the revenue from them.

This was left in the hands of North Ward Councillors.

Cr Killicoat declined to accept the responsibility.

A letter of Sympathy was sent to Mr Carey on the loss of a son on active service.

There have been no applications for the lamplighter’s position.  Mr Pryor indicated he would take it on at 30/- a week if Council would undertake to give him a few days other work per month when available.  Accepted.

A notice will be inserted in the Record forbidding the removal of sand from Burra Creek.
