Burra Town Council

A letter to be sent to Bagot, Shakes and Lewis calling their attention to by-law 13 re obstruction of a watercourse and requesting them to remove same [from the watercourse behind the brewery] or proceedings will be taken.

The footbridge in Bridge St is to be repaired.

About 300 ft of timber is required to repair the Waterworks well, but it is to stand over till the Commissioner can be interviewed about the reduction of the capital account when the condition of the well will be raised and a plea put in for the necessary repairs.
