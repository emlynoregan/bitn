Redruth Reformatory.  On Wednesday afternoon four girls escaped from the reformatory while feeding chickens in the backyard.  Their absence was noticed after about 20 minutes and Mrs Holden informed Cpl Noble who failed to find any trace in the area.  News the next day said they were seen heading towards Baldina.  Several days ago a girl ran away on a Sunday morning and succeeded in getting away from the town, but was found by Cpl Noble resting in a hut near Hanson.  We point out that it is a punishable offence to harbour or keep any of the girls and there is a possible penalty of Â£25 or six months in gaol.  The girls are by regulation allowed out into the yard and the same girls have been out scores of times before without incident.  On Friday they returned and gave themselves up to Cpl Noble.  They had fared badly with little food and little sleep.  On day one they travelled 16 miles, but in taking a cut across the hills they turned towards Burra instead of towards Adelaide.
