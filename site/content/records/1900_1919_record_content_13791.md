Farmers & Producers Political Union, Burra Branch met at the Institute on Friday & passed a motion calling on members to support Mr W.B. Rounsevell whose policy was entirely in accord with that of the union and after that, how they liked.  There was a feeling that the decisions from Jamestown & Terowie were unrepresentative of the feelings of those districts.  Proceedings were at times lively.
