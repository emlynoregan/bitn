The Burra Manganese [Mining] Co.  The mine lies some six miles west of Burra Railway Station.  Some years ago a large deposit of manganic iron was worked as a flux for copper smelting and the company owns the old quarry.  It is claimed an iron lode runs north south for miles, but work at 100’ level suggests this is false: rather there is a series of blows along a north-south line.  A 100’ shaft has been sunk north of the southern blow and cross cut 76’ east and 32’ west and this shows no lode connecting the blows.  From the east cross cut a drive south found the original blow after 57’.  There are traces of manganese and cobalt, but in the absence of any local market for flux no further work is warranted unless below water level when the % of oxides and cobalt associated with manganese oxide might increase sufficiently to justify extraction.
