The Australian Heritage Commission and MacMillan Australia are preparing a book: A Register of National Estate for release in 1981.  Mr Ian Auhl has prepared a 2,000 word entry on Burra for this publication.

Readers Digest is preparing a book of photographs on Historic Towns of Australia.  It will contain more than 1,000 colour plates and more than 300 pages.  Burra is one of the 50 towns featured.  Mr Auhl has been asked to assist with the 300-500 word introduction to the Burra material.

Ian Auhl is already assisting the SA Department of Mines and Energy to produce a special publication marking the centenary in 1982 of the SA Geological Survey.

Also the ABC is aiming to produce a 30-minute film on the history of copper mining in SA.  The Burra section will contrast early shaft mining with the present day open cut operation.
