Local Board of Health

A suspected case of infantile paralysis at Burra Hospital is left in the hands of the secretary & the Officer of Health.

[Special meetings of the Local Board of Health are reported for 7 February, 21 February & 7 March.  All relate to the infantile paralysis case, but the reports are not very illuminating and eventually Northfield Infectious Diseases Hospital writes that John Corbett was admitted on 6 February and discharged 23 February.  This is the young man who arrived with Perry Bros. Circus.]
