Burra Waterworks.  The deputation on Monday to the Town Council protested the decision to make each water assessment stand alone.  On learning that the ratepayers were so strongly opposed the resolution was rescinded.

There is an article of 1â…” columns on the issue.

There was much argument on the loss of the concession which allowed shopkeepers to use the shop allowance on their home properties.  If users buy so much water per annum why should it matter where it is used?  There was also much argument about the lack of meters.  A large amount of the water that is pumped is not paid for.  The Waterworks have been badly managed for ten or more years said Mr Wilkinson.  Most of the meters were then returned to the Government since when things have been getting worse and worse.  He said the concessions enjoyed after about 15 years had become an unwritten law that should be respected.

The mayor said it had only been introduced about seven years ago by one who has since moved to another colony and who also moved many of the meters.  Mr Wilkinson thought the concession was allowed when Mr Holder was Town Clerk and the argument of Mr Wilkinson was supported by Mr Lane.  Dr Brummitt added his support while admitting the water waste was a problem for which another solution was needed.

Cr Fuss allowed the justice of the argument but said the waste problem remained.

At the Council meeting on 5 June Cr West gave notice he would move to rescind the motion ending concessions for excess water at the next meeting.
