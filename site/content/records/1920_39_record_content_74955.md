Football.  The season opened at Spalding on Saturday.  Kooringa lost badly and only five of the team were part of last yearâ€™s premiership side.  Surely not all the others have retired or are on holidays.

Spalding		5.4	8.7	10.9	17.13	(115)

Kooringa	0.2	1.6	4.9	5.12	(42)

[Which the paper describes as a loss by 71 points.]
