‘Jam with Ham’ began as a five-piece Dixieland jazz band a bit less than a year ago.  It has grown to have a membership of 17.  Although it focuses on music of the 1940s, various subgroups of the band perform in many other styles.  They will be the feature of the Apex Club’s cabaret this Saturday night.
