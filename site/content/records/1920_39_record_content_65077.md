A Record Wedding Anniversary?

Lately Tasmania has been suggesting a 70th wedding anniversary there was a record.

Mr & Mrs Hams of Terowie had a 70th wedding anniversary and Mr & Mrs Sam Baker of Burra went one better in November 1934 when they celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary.  They were married in Kooringa in 1862.  Mrs Baker died in August 1935.

[The Hams claim does not seem to stand up to investigation.  Edward Hams married Jane Smith 17 December 1853 at St George’s Church, Gawler.  Edward Hams died 11 August 1921 and Jane Hams died 3 November 1921, meaning their last wedding anniversary was their 67th.

The Baker claim is essentially correct, though the marriage on 29 November 1862 is registered as having occurred at a house in Redruth rather than in Kooringa.  Mr Baker died 22 August 1938.]
