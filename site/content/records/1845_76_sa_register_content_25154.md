St Mary’s Church.  Two handsome stained glass windows have lately been given to this church and placed on either side at the east end.  One was given by Mrs Winnall as a memorial to the late Mr John Winnall, her husband.  He was for some years a Warden of the church and Superintendent of the Sunday school.  The other was given by several seatholders in memory of their children.  The memorials were executed by Mr Brooks of North Adelaide.

The subject of the children’s window is Christ blessing little children with the emblems of the font and the dove, the names and dates of the deaths of the children and the text ‘Suffer little children to come unto me’. 

The other’s theme is Christ’s blessing the bread and the wine.  This has as symbols the pelican, the sacred monogram (ΑΩ) with emblems of the crucifixion: nails, hammer, crown of thorns, sponge, spear etc. and the text ‘This do in remembrance of me’. 

[These two windows were subsequently removed from St Mary’s on Limestone Hill to the new St Mary’s where they can still be seen (January 2012), though I cannot see the text cited for the Winnall window and the bread and wine blessing is obscure.]
