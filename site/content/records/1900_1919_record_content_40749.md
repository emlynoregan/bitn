Editorial on the Seaside Trip.  In such a time of financial hardship and war it was after considerable debate that the trip was decided upon.  Some took exception to the idea that those in debt would go on an excursion practically at the expense of their creditors.  Rumours abounded.  Walker & Sons have been accused of threatening to summons any of their debtors who took the trip.  Of course this is nonsense, but it is liable to do them harm.  They have taken out an advertisement labelling it as ‘absolutely untrue’.  Similarly wild rumours are reported from Mintaro because this year no second train will run.  If the train from Burra is not filled the committee will consider the possibility of taking passengers from Farrell’s Flat and Mintaro.
