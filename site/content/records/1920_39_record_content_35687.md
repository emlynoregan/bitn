Burra Town Council, 6 October

F. Treloar’s objection to A.A. Nankivell’s leasing the road adjacent to the latter’s property was adjudged reasonable and was upheld.

Mr Lomman offered £1 for a piece of road adjoining blocks 6, 7, & 8 at Hampton and £5 for two adjacent blocks owned by the Council.  To lie on the table.

The main road grant for the year will be little more than half last year’s.

Retiring Councillors this year are Kellaway, Morgan & Lee.
