Fire.  A fire broke out in grass in Burra Creek opposite the Institute on Thursday morning.  A fire break was burnt from the Black Bridge to meet the advancing flames.  The main effort was to save the old stockyards at the rear of the Burra Hotel, as on such a hot day (111Â°F) anything inflammable was in danger.  No damage was done to any property, but a number of young pines were scorched between the swing bridge and the Black Bridge on the eastern side.  These were a memorial to Mr Oborn who had taken a keen interest in them and quite a number will probably die.
