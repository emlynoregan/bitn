Rose of Sharon Tent IOR met on Wednesday and presented Mr H. Richards with a parchment and a handsome gold Albert in acknowledgement of his services to the order on the occasion of his leaving the town.  The junior tent also presented an address and a gold pencil case.  Mr Richards was one of the oldest members and had filled every office in it with credit to himself and profit to the order.  [An Albert is a chain for a pocket watch.]
