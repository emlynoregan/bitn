Burra Tourism

It has been an exceptional year for Burra tourism.  The Burra Visitor Centre has been filled to capacity on most days in the tourist season.  Burra Heritage Passport sales have increased and hits on www.visitburra.com have reached almost 10,000 per month.  Since March 2009 accommodation sales have gone through the roof with more than double the bookings for March and July than for the same months the previous year.  Burra businesses stand to benefit either directly of indirectly from the influx and Burra residents enjoy a wider range of goods and services than would otherwise be available.  There is a clear need to upgrade the Burra Visitor Centre.  A larger centre would make it possible for clients to browse the information on offer.  The present site cannot provide for more space and has at times become uncomfortable overcrowded.  More shelving would make local produce more readily available also.  It is imperative to have space for visitors to browse the internet for local and regional tourist information.  Parking for coaches and caravans is also a problem.  The Goyder Council is considering the issue and a solution cannot reasonably be long delayed.
