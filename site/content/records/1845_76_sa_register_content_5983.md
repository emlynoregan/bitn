Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate.  15 April.

William Balman was charged by William Simmons with illegally selling a stockyard, the property of the complainant.  The Magistrate advised them to settle out of court and this was eventually done.

Samuel Bignell, wheelwright, applied for a summons against John Owen for illegally taking possession of a cart, the property of Bignell, and placing it in the public pound.  Mr Grant, the Clerk of the Court, said the cart was only impounded to keep it safe until a partnership dispute between the parties could be resolved.  His Worship granted the summons.

17 April

William Stuart, butcher was charged by Sergeant-major McCulloch with keeping pigs in a stye in the creek, thereby creating a nuisance in the neighbourhood.  Stuart admitted the charge, but said if he were not allowed to keep the pigs he would be obliged to give up his business.  His Worship said he liked a piece of pork, but the defendant could not be allowed to endanger the health of the inhabitants.  As this was a first offence, Stuart was not fined on condition he removed the nuisance and paid court costs of 16/-.

19 April

Several Germans attended the court today to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen for the purposes of naturalization.

His Worship said the Court of Revision would be held on 28 April.
