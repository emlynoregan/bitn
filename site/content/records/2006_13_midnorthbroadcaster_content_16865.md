Maureen & Barry Wright recently returned from a seven-week project re-charting the Murray River from Yarrawonga to Renmark.  It is time consuming work to chart the depth of the channel, marking the sandbars and snags and photographing points of interest.  They were accompanied by Lisa Smedley and at times by Di and Malcolm Beinke.  Their River Murray Charts will appear in its eighth edition this year.
