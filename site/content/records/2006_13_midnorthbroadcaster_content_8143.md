Local Council get Federal Funding

The Federal Government is providing nearly $33 million across the 139 local government areas in SA.  The Regional Council of Goyder received $652,152 of which $164,773 will go towards road upgrades.  These grants are part of the Federal Governmentâ€™s $1.7 million [sic: for $1.7 billion] funding aimed at helping them deal with the impact of the global economic crisis.

Regional Council of Goyder has adopted the concept plan for the redevelopment of the Burra Creek.  Feedback to the Hemisphere Design concept has been positive said Bruce Stockman of the Community Management Committee.  The feedback will be incorporated in the finalised layout.  [Photo]
