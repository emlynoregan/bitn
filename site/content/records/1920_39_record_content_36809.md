Burra Defence Rifle Club: A Historical Review

The minute books refer us back only to 1899.

A range had been used periodically to 1899, principally for military shooting, but then interest was displayed and Mr D.J. O’Leary granted permission for a portion of his property to be used for firing on, to the south of the town.

The club progressed till 1904 when at the AGM there was not a quorum and at a subsequent committee meeting it was decided to disband temporarily.  (J.A. Pearce, N. Pearce, R.D. Pascoe, A. Bennetts & P. Roach.)  Assets were then 22/3 and 60 packets of ammunition.

The club was restarted in 1907 following an enthusiastic meeting at Lord’s [Burra] Hotel.  G. Lord was elected Captain and practices were held on Wednesday s and Saturdays.  It was then that the range on the eastern side of the town was established.  Captain Lord held the office from 1907-18.

The new range was opened 17 June 1907.  The membership for that year was 56.  In 1901 there were 60 members and in 1929 28 members.  So far for 1930 there are 45 members.  In 1918 the drain of members due to the war caused the club to consider going into recess.  It decided to go on and the peak period of the club’s efficiency was reached in 1924 when a team of 20 won the Country Club Championship of SA at Pt Adelaide.  If the Government maintains the ammunition and efficiency grant for 1931 the Club should reach a very satisfactory position.

[A long list of inter-club competitions is then printed.]

One early record shows that the visitors from Blyth were to be entertained with 10/- worth of pastry and sandwiches, 5 gallons of beer and half a dozen tonic ales.

Trophies have come from a variety of people.  [A number of donors, trophies and prizes are then listed.]

Financial support has come from R.M. McBride, N.H. Pearse, A.J. McBride, R. Reed & Sons, T.H. Pearse & L.W. Gebhardt.

[State District Unions are then mentioned.]
