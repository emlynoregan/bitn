St Mary’s Vestry Meeting, Tuesday 24 April.

A meeting was arranged for 24 April to consider the advisability of appointing a successor to Rev. A.E. Taylor.  It was resolved that a pipe organ be purchased and that two thirds of the funds from the next strawberry fete be devoted to that fund.  An increase in salary was devoted to the Rector.
