Advertisement.  William Chace of Little Para takes out an advertisement reflecting the demands of teamsters taking copper from Burra Burra to Adelaide.

[He wants £3-5-0 from 1 October to 1 April and £3-15-0 from 1 April to 1 October, with back carriage to be £3 all the year.  He too outlines the costs of the teamsters, with stresses on somewhat different costs from ‘Teamster’ above.  He says that as the Para Plain is now largely fenced they cannot set their bullocks simply to graze, but must buy hay at 16/- per trip.  Their own rations come to £1-4-0 per trip and wear and tear at 18/- per trip.  Their wages at £2-5-0 per tip, giving a total of £5-3-0 for 3 tons of copper ore delivered to the port.  The present payment is £8-5-0.  This gives a balance in the teamster’s favour of only £3-2-0 and that assumes no bullock dies or is lost.  Last summer 200-300 bullocks were lost and this can be expected this year as well.  More land is being enclosed increasing the cost of feed and the unenclosed feed is of poorer quality and the cattle more apt to stray.]
