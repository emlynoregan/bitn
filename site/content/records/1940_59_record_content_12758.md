Pte Jim Kotz DCM, MM has returned to Burra.  He got both decorations in New Guinea on 25 August at Milne Bay.  He enlisted in July 1940 with Nelson Hann who did not get overseas due to sickness.  He arrived in Palestine in April 1941 and soon became one of the Rats of Tobruk.  He was there for 4½ months and found it ‘not half as bad as in New Guinea’.  After Tobruk he was repatriated to Australia early in 1942 and then sent to New Guinea in August 1942.  His was the first AIF Battalion to arrive in Milne Bay.  Soon the Japanese landed and the battle lasted about a week before they were driven off.  He and a Captain took out a Japanese machine gun with a Tommy Gun and a bayonet attack.  Later in the same night he rescued a wounded Militia Captain from a hut under machine-gun fire, carrying him over 100 yards to safety.  Unfortunately just then he was wounded in the chest and had to stay where he was for three days.  The Captain died a fortnight later and Jim got malaria.  They were both rescued by native stretcher-bearers.  Recovering in various hospitals took about five months.  He thanked Burra ladies for the supplies from the FFCF for himself, Schwier, Arthur Ridings & Bob Ellis.  The last two had been killed in New Guinea.
