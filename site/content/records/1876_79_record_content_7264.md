Inquest at Aberdeen on Thursday into the fire on Wednesday that consumed Broad's Aberdeen Hotel. J.D. Cave, coroner and D. Wells, foreman of the jury.

John Broad: - Was home all-day and slept the night in a downstairs room facing onto the main road. All other lodgers and servants had gone to bed and all seemed quiet and safe. About 2.00 a.m. heard some crackling as of the lighting of a fire and thought it was the ostler who always lit the fire. Woke Mrs Broad and said the ostler was lighting the fire and it was not yet time. She went to the kitchen, but came back and said that all upstairs was on fire and I was to get up. Got up and called the men. Saw flames from upper windows. Found the servant girl lying on the ground. She said she had jumped from the window. Sent for the police and then took out what furniture we could. The assembly room was saved, and the roof on the outer rooms was taken off to stop the fire. Am only a tenant, but the furniture and stock was insured for £1,000 and the premises for £1,500. When I got outside flames were coming from three windows. Two of the [upper] rooms were occupied. Think the fire started in the centre rooms. One window did for two rooms which were divided by a lath and plaster partition and occupied by a servant and a lodger respectively. Ann Broad: - Supported her husband's testimony. There were six rooms upstairs. Only two were occupied: by a lodger and the servant girl, Ophelia Johnstone. Saw the upper rooms on fire along the passage. The man who slept upstairs was not exactly sober. He had a candle and wax matches to light his pipe. There were curtains at the window, but the table was not near them.

The enquiry then adjourned to the hospital.

Ophelia Johnstone: - Went to bed at 11.30 p.m. Put candle on chair by bed and put it out once in bed. The man next door was then snoring. Was awakened by smoke and part of the room was aflame. The window was nailed down, but I broke the frame and got onto the verandah and jumped down. Fire could only have come from the next room as nowhere else was occupied. The man had been very free with his matches, throwing them down on the carpet before he went upstairs. I broke the window with my hand. While on the ground I saw the man come out on the verandah.

The enquiry then returned to Aberdeen.

Thomas Long, labourer: - Was on my way back to Farrell's Flat from Terowie after delivering sheep. Slept in the Aberdeen Hotel Tuesday night. Went to bed between 9.00 & 10.00 p.m. Put the candle on the table by the bed. Blew out the light when I went to bed. Was awakened by smoke and heard a female scream and break the glass. Got onto the verandah. Tried to go back for my clothes etc., but couldn't. Was quite sober. I lost a watch, boots, rug, blanket and other small things.

Edmund Alexander Jeffrey passed the hotel at 1.30 a.m. and saw neither fire nor a light. Henry Walker lives nearby and saw fire coming from the hotel windows at about 3.00 a.m. There were several other witnesses including the police, but they added little of significance. While it was clear that suspicion clearly pointed at some action by Thomas Long there was no clear evidence and the verdict was that fire started in the upper storey, but there was no evidence to show how it originated.
