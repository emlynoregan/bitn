The Housing Trust of SA in Burra

If enough applications come forward the SA Housing Trust would erect homes in Burra.  Mr A.B. Hastings of the Housing Trust said this at a meeting in the Town Council Chamber on Tuesday last week.  The houses would most likely be prefabricated due to the difficulties of obtaining both bricks and the masons to erect them.  They would be available for purchase only, on long term finance.  The Trust builds in groups to gain the advantage of mass production methods and will normally not build in groups of less than five at a time.  Preference is given to returned servicemen and applicants with families.  The cost for such houses within 100 miles of Adelaide is £1,400 to £1,500.  The houses include three bedrooms, fences, bathroom & kitchen plumbing, a copper and troughs.  War service loans are available for those eligible.  For those with a War service Loan the deposit is usually c. £80 and for others c. £300.  [Further details are printed.]
