Burra High School: Headmaster’s Report

The School opened with an enrolment of 70 and there was an average attendance for the year of 62.  There was one change of staff during the year.  Mrs Kowald replaced Miss Miller as Domestic Arts Assistant when the latter was transferred to Naracoorte High School at the start of the year.

In last year’s Intermediate Exams 11 sat and 8 gained full certificates and the other 3 gained enough to enable them to add on subjects in future years.  Outstanding results were:

Keith Pulford: 8 subjects with 2 credits

Donald Reed: 8 subjects with 1 credit

Carleeta Simpson: 8 subjects with 1 credit.

Two of the three Leaving candidates gained certificates and Judith Wood passes 6 subjects with 2 credits.

Sports have been well catered for this year as usual.  At the Mid-Northern High School Sports at Riverton, Allen White broke the high jump record by clearing 5 ft 2 inches.

Our own sports day was held on the Memorial Oval instead of at the racecourse and drew a larger attendance of parents than usual.  We continue to hope that something will be done to enable swimming lessons to be undertaken in Burra.  The Minister of Education is strongly in favour of establishing swimming pools.

The Parents and Friends’ Assoc. has again done a great job and the addition of a radiogram and pick-up costing £200 is due to their efforts.

Library books to £40 have also been bought.

The Association also sponsors the High School Ball and Annual Banquet.

The High School Council under Mr H. Jennison as Chairman has carried out its duties very effectively.

Religious Instruction providers are thanked for their work throughout the year.

The whole school visited Adelaide in September, when various industrial firms were visited and an overseas liner was inspected at Outer Harbour.

The Intermediate Class went to a performance of The Merchant of Venice at the Theatre Royal in Adelaide and Wayne Sibly was chosen as the Advertiser Youth Travel representative for the Burra District.

Most students now wear the school uniform and local stores stock supplies of it.
