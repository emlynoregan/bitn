E.T. Baulderstone writes concerning the Burra War Memorial Oval, pointing out that neither the football nor the cricket nor any other club has any ownership of the facilities; the oval is the property of the ratepayers of Burra.  An improvement committee is appointed annually and in ten years has done a magnificent job in providing facilities with very little support from sporting bodies etc.  The next project is to improve the grassing of the oval and watering of the playing field.

He writes that the town cannot maintain more than one oval and he clearly regrets the tendency of some to drift away from the oval to play their sport elsewhere.  He calls for unity behind using the Burra Oval.
