Burra Town Council.

The mayor reported on the visit of the Ladies’ Band to Adelaide and its great success.  Sir Henry and Lady Galway had had their photo taken with the band and he thought the Council should obtain a copy for its chamber.  The Councillors agreed to subscribe for it.

Cr Dane congratulated the Mayor on his son’s winning the Military Cross and a motion to that effect was 2nd by Cr Killicoat and carried.

Congratulatory letters are to be sent to Surgeon-Major Steele MC, Chaplain-Capt. Durnford MC, Capt. Somerville DSO MC, Lt Crewes MC & L-Cpl Bishop MM and a letter of condolence to the Jesser family on the death of Pte Len Jesser.
