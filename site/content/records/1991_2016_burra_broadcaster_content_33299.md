Letter.  Stuart & Ruth Norris submit a lengthy letter on galahs.  They call for research to substantiate any claims and say galahs do not kill trees, and they rather lay the blame for such death on land clearing, irrigation practices and the effect of both these on the water table.  They deny that the noise problem is real.  Visitors love the flocks of galahs that are far less offensive to their ears than the dangerous drivers that use the roads as race tracks.
