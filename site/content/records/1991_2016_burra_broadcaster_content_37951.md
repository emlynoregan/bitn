Letter.  Danny Smith writes in to explain the recent roadworks on the western extension of Stock Street and around a trouble spot on Vineyard Terrace.  The Council undertook the work at his request to stop storm water from entering his property and to allow good access to his shed to house recent purchases he wished to see sheltered.  He was grateful that his vehicles would no longer be damaged seeking access to the shed and the work should prevent any legal intervention if storm water created further damage to his property.
