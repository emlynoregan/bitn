Entertainment.  Lindon & Webster of the Queen’s Theatre were in Kooringa last week.  They brought up a number of mechanical figures.  Mr Lindon, as maker of these, deserves considerable praise.  Several songs and a hornpipe followed.  The host of the Burra Hotel allowed the use of his Assembly Room on Thursday and Saturday and it was filled almost to excess.
