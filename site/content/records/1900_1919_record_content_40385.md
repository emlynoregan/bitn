Railways Standing Committee is considering the various proposals for a Booborowie railway.

Spalding to Booborowie via Yatina Gap

Farrell’s Flat to Booborowie

Hanson to Booborowie

This last seems the most favoured, but there is a complication in that any railway might interfere with the profitability of the Spalding Railway which was built under the guarantee system.
