Kooringa Christmas Amusements taken from the SA Register for Friday 4 January 1856.

Wrestling matches in front of the Miners’ Arms Hotel on Friday.

On Monday a fine bullock was roasted whole by Mr Watts & Mr Stevens near the Burra Hotel.  Some fine slices were cut at noon and by 6 p.m. it was considerably diminished.  J. Pearce then gathered about 40 natives together and after three cheers for the Queen, three for Prince Albert and three for the Royal Family, he helped them to the roast beef so that in a short time only bones remained.

Several foot races were run between men, boys, girls and blackfellows.

Jingling and jumping in sacks concluded the sports.

On Tuesday rifle shooting at a target was held for a first prize of a revolving rifle and second of a revolving pistol.

There were also horse races at the Cross Roads Inn (Nankervis’s).  [For which details were printed.]  After the races the usual sports continued.

Outside the Miners’ Arms wrestling continued on Sunday morning.

Notes.  The Miners’ Arms is the present Burra Hotel, then a single storey building.  It was Burra’s second hotel, built in 1847 with H. Chandler as the first licensee.  The Burra Hotel was the old wing of the Burra Hospital.  It was demolished in 1967.  Erected as Burra’s first hotel in 1846, its licensee was Abraham Wren.  In 1856 the licensee was A. Barker, grandfather of the late John Barker.  Cross Roads Inn, a few miles west of the Mine on the bullock road to Pt Wakefield, stood from 1853 to 75 on the ‘site of the present home of Glen Finch’s old home’.  [Sic.]
