Snow blanketed a large area of Burra, Mt Bryan and Hallett early last Thursday morning as an extreme cold front moved through SA.  Rain fell overnight with 10 mm in Burra.  The snow varied greatly across the district varying from a light dusting to several centimetres.  Paul Wedding 13 km east of Booborowie had a fall that lasted from 6.45 a.m. to beyond 7.30 a.m., but his neighbour received only 10 minutes of it.
