2nd Leader on the ‘Absurd Charge’ against Inspector Gray.  Cr Rabbich appears to be grasping at straws to get even with the Inspector and the evidence before the committee is amusing and ridiculous in the extreme.  The action of Cr Rabbich cannot be too severely condemned.

[It is not said what Cr Rabbich is getting even over, unless there were issues relating to the recent banning of the boiling down establishments in town.]
