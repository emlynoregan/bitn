Stockowners Assoc. of SA, Burra Branch

On 16 June the President of the SA Branch, Mr I.J. Warnes, entertained about 70 members of the Association to dinner at the Burra Hotel. W.G. Hawkes spoke about an impending depression.  The Minister of Agriculture Hon. T. Pascoe spoke of the boy immigrants.  G.F. Jenkins MP expanded on the pastoral industry and the shearing dispute.  The article concluded in 1¾ columns on page 4.

W.G. Duncan proposed a toast to the President.  I.J. Warnes in reply ranged over carious activities of the Association before turning to the shearing question.

[Shearers had not achieved the rates they sought at arbitration and were threatening now not to abide by the Arbitration Court ruling.]

He was also concerned that boy immigration be matched by girl immigration and was concerned at the drift of country girls to the city.

‘Perhaps it was quite time the girls came out of the shops and offices and went into homes.’
