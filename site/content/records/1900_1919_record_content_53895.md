Burra Institute Annual Report.

Changes in the year saw Mr Harcus depart as Vice-President, having been moved to Broken Hill.  He joined the committee in 1905.  W.E. Hodge replaced him and Rev. Bloyd joined the committee.  Free use of the hall for patriotic use was the equivalent of a Â£23-14-6 donation.

The library now had 4,772 books.

Membership:	1916	double  25	single  148	total  173

1917	double  22	single  202	total  224

This was mainly due to the Choral and Orchestral Classes memberships.

Commercial classes continued another year, but membership is disappointing with 16-12 in the different quarters.

An architect will report on enlarging the hall in the New Year.
