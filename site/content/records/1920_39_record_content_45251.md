Developments at the 92ft level are most promising.

First 50 ton 14cwt crushed at the battery yielded 52oz 19dwt 12gr or 10oz 0dwt 20gr per ton which was highly satisfactory.

The mine was open for inspection on 2 March and about 200 people inspected it.

Golden Harp lease.  Shaft now at 16’6” and logged up.  The quartz and iron reef cut out at 13ft.  Will continue sinking to cut veins exposed to the north.
