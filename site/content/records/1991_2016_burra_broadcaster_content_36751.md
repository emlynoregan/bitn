St Mary’s was filled with people on Sunday for the concert of organ and choral music to celebrate the centenary of the pipe organ.  The three organists, Denis Nettleton, Jan Cockington and Rosemary Nairn all have Burra connections.  The two choirs, Woodville Concert Choir and Treble Country Choir, performed beautifully. The organ was built by Josiah Eustace Dodd in 1905.  MC for the concert was Peter Harvey.  [Photo]

The concert concluded with Felix Mendelssohn’s Wedding March in honour of Len & Muriel Bence’s Diamond Wedding.
