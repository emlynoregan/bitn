Burra Town Council, 17 August

The Highways Department responds to a letter re the Bon Accord Bridge, saying that after further investigation its decision remains that it should not carry more than 5 ton loads.

A letter from the Burra Burra DC advises that it would not amalgamate with the Town Council in the purchase of the Burra Institute.

It was decided that two members of Council would attend a meeting with the Burra Institute Committee to discuss with it the setting out of an agreement under which Council would take over the Institute.  Councillors Kellaway and Marston were chosen as the delegates.
