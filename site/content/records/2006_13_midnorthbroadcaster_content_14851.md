After many calculations and with friend Kevin Kakoschke deputising as his ‘chainman’ determined the spot where the pin marking the point should be.  With the aid of a hand held GPS position fixing device they found the pin under eight inches of dirt.  They went on to find other pegs of the Radium Hill Pioneer Cemetery and some associated with the old uranium mining reserve.  They did, however, enjoy much more comfortable conditions and much better food than the original survey party.
