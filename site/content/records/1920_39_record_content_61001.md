The motor cycle events were dusty due to the lack of rain.  H. Denton took out the Motor Cycle Handicap and the 8 lap Mid North Dirt Track Motor Cycle Championship went to L. Fredericks, who also took out the Mongolata Motor Cycle Handicap.

In the horse events Greensborough won both the Andrew Tennant Handicap and ‘The Gums’ flying handicap.  The popular Lynch Draught Horse Race this year drew only five entrants, but was well contested, finally being won by Graham Dow on T. Kallio’s Wait Awhile.

The Military Events were carried out with order and precision.

The crowd was orderly and the police had a quiet day.

[Personal interest: H. Fuss was on the organising committee.]
