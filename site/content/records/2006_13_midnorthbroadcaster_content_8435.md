Burra Adventurer Donna Kelly and friend Gill Plastow (66) are set to trek across the Simpson Desert to raise awareness of the Heart Foundation.  This will be their second attempt and this time they intend to follow the steps of Sir Cecil Madigan.  He led the first scientifically base crossing in 1939 from Old Andado Homestead to Birdsville.  They expect to take about 18 days covering 30 to 35 km a day with 4WD support vehicles.  Their first crossing two years ago averaged 30 km per day amid dust storms and 46Â°C temperatures. Gill lost her son to cardiomyopathy when he was 15.  She has previously cycled the Canning Stock Route and walked from Darwin to Adelaide.
