Flagstaff Hills.  Mr H.W. Tiver has had boring contractors at work right on top of the hills near the Booborowie Road near the known soak.  Water was struck at 104 ft and boring continued to 141 ft.  Water has risen in the bore to the 90 ft level and a pump of 10 gallons a minute for 30 minutes did not lower the level.  Mr Roy Lloyd was the diviner used.
