Football

The Rovers team in the Peterborough Football Assoc. completed the season on 11 September undefeated when they took out the Grand Final.  This was last done in 1930 when Imperials got through the season undefeated.  Rovers’ goal-sneak Charlie Kellaway, formerly of Burra, kicked 12 goals during the match, which was a record for the Assoc.  He was presented with the ball as a memento.  He passed it on to his small son Garry, the Rovers’ mascot.
