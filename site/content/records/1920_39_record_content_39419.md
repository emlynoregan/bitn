Burra Hospital Board, Monday last.

The Mayor moved to rescind the motion banning the hospital from admitting local young ladies from becoming nurses.  The whole issue was discussed at length and included the fact that the last Board election was fought largely on this issue and the candidate in favour of employing local girls was badly defeated.  The Mayorâ€™s move was lost, being supported only by the mover and seconder.
