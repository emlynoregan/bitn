A lavatory block for both sexes.

The cost is estimated at £6,000.

Recently also the local hall has been extended with a new supper room and kitchen costing about £2,000 and a similar amount went into the new Club House at the Bowling Green.

The Star Maker Show of 1956 recently played to a capacity house.  Its twenty-three item program raised £97, which lifts Community Centre Funds.
