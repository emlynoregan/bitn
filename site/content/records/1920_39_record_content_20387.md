Henry Roach left Burra to live in Adelaide last week.  Apart from his father’s connection with the mine in early days the name Roach has been identified with milling in Burra for nearly 50 years and the mill on the Aberdeen-Kooringa road may be known as Roach’s Mill for some time to come.  It is just 50 years since Mr Roach came to live in Burra.  After many years engaged in milling he has of recent years sold a considerable amount of Burra property.  Recently he sold the last: Butterworth’s Mill, at a good price to British Imperial Oil Co. for use as a depot.
