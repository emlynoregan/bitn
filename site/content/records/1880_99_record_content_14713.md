W.H. Hardy writes expressing amazement that the editor on 10 October came out against the eight hours movement.  He argues that a greater population would not bring greater prosperity, at least not of itself; if they were merely farmers, farm labourers and the like.  He goes on at length to ague his case using income figures.  He says incomes dropped when hours of work dropped.  The editor’s argument for greater productivity, he says, implies that he wants men to work the ten hours for the same as they earn now for eight.  As for professional men working ten hours or more - perhaps they do, but they get well paid for it, and by the hour.
