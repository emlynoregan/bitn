Burra Burra DC

Discussion on council boundary reforms are continuing with neighbouring councils.

Ursula Street (between the Burra Hotel and the Snack Bar) is being upgraded with improved lighting, paving, underground drainage and a ramp and steps leading to Burra Creek.

Burra Creek water will be used to irrigate lawns and garden areas adjacent to the creek in Burra.
