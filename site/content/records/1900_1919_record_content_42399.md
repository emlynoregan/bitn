It was the shortest route from the corner of Paxton Square and buyers [at the saleyards] were inconvenienced by the lack of it.  A number of ratepayers had also objected to its removal.  It had served well for 40 years.  The site upstream would not be as convenient for the saleyards or the Recreation Ground.
