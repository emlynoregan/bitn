Obituary & Inquest.  An inquest was held at Redruth Court House last Thursday into the death of a newborn child.  J.E.H. Winnall was coroner.  [Unnamed female child surname Jordan, born and died 9 April 1919: lived 14 hours.]

Last Wednesday acting on information from Mr & Mrs F. Highett of Kangaroo St M-C Giles took up the floor of the privy at the back of Mrs Jordan’s House and found a newborn child, submerged but for its face.  It was washed and every aid given by Dr Williams and it was transferred to Nurse Young’s hospital, where it died about 5 p.m. from shock, exhaustion and spontaneous bleeding.  Dr Williams had been called in to attend Annie Jordan, who in his opinion had recently given birth.  On legal advice Annie Jordan (15) refused to answer other than formal questions.  Other members of the family responded in a like manner.  The inquest was adjourned till 3 May.
