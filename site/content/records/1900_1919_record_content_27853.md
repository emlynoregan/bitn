Burra Burra Copper Mine held its 18th half-yearly report, which showed nothing but a little tribute work had been done.  Receipts were £200 and expenditure £164.  The credit balance in hand was £2,563.  Regret was expressed at the death since the last meeting of T.B. Gall, who had been a chairman for some time.
