Mt Bryan East School

The old school at Mt Bryan East is currently being renovated for travellers on the Heysen and Mawson Trails.  $100,000 has been provided by the SA Health Department to the Adelaide Central Mission, who will be carrying out the renovations on six heritage buildings along the trail and fitting them with bunks and stoves.  There are 75 huts between Cape Jervis and Parachilna Gorge.  From Spalding to Newikie Creek accommodation is provided at Willalo Hall and Hallett Railway Station.  Renovations at Mt Bryan East will included repointing the stonework, repairing the roof and replacing ceilings and the installation of a slow combustion stove.  Adelaide Central Mission is using the project for training disadvantaged men.  [Photo.]
