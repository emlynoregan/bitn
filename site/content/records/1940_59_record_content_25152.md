Burra Institute.  At the AGM Mr A.B. Riggs declined to stand again for the committee.  Mr Riggs has held a variety of positions with the Institute for very many years.  Mr W. Carpenter moved a minute of appreciation be recorded in recognition of his services.  This was endorsed by Mr H.J.B. Jennison, Mr J. McGrath, Mr Genders and Mr Hegarty and carried by acclimation.  Mr Riggs said he had to give up the position for a variety of reasons and one of the chief was that he was trying to get the Burra Show going again after the war and that would take his utmost efforts.
