W. West, Accountant etc. for SAMA, writes concerning sanitary conditions in Kooringa.

Nothing, he says, is easier than for a minister to denounce from the pulpit, but the amount of good it tends to effect is very questionable.  The reve rend gentleman might have informed those in the congregation that recently the company presented the Church of England with an acre of land for the purpose of erecting a new church.  As one of the officials alluded to he says he could say he had never been addressed by the reverend gentleman mentioned.  Never before was Kooringa in a more cleanly condition than at present.

If ‘Inhabitant’ turned out to be a medical man residing not a hundred miles away from Mt Pleasant, West would thank him to be f rank and open enough to sign the name his  fat her or mother bestowed on him.

I, 1 (2), 7 July 1876, pages 3 & 4 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 2 on the microfilm.]
