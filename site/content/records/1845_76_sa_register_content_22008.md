Burra News, 1 June

On Friday Captain Gregor, formerly one of the surface captains of the Burra Mine, found the remains of extinct animals in clay in the bed of Spring Creek.  The jaw of an enormous animal held four teeth measuring 2Â½ inches square on the upper surface.  They were embedded in bone for five inches and protruded from it two inches.  The piece of jawbone is about one foot long with indentations for several more teeth.  Other pieces of bone were also found.  The site was about halfway up the range of hills in the side of a channel some six feet deep, near its bottom and close to the rock bed.  No one in Burra has the scientific knowledge to identify the animal.
