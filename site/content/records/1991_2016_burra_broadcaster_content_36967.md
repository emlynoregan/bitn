BBH Social Club.  Another successful ‘Miss BBH’ Pageant was held last Saturday at the Burra Sports Complex.  A good crowd saw ‘the girls’ model a range of swimwear and evening outfits.  Miss Farrell Flat (Casey Cooper) was crowned Miss BBH 2005.  The event raised $750 in coin applause.  Casey Cooper also won the men’s arm wrestling contest, while the women’s section went to Mel Miller.
