Burra Electricity Supply

The labour and material position has not improved and so ETSA advises that it cannot supply the town for another five to seven years.  ETSA advises it has not had further negotiations with the Burra Electric Supply Co. and suggests the Council should renew the franchise, which expired in November 1951, for a period of five to seven years.  ETSA would be willing to make machinery available if the company’s plant could not be maintained.  High voltage ETSA lines serve Farrell Flat and Spalding, but are not large enough to serve Burra as well.  The Council is concerned that it will not be able to meet the increased street lighting cost if the franchise is renewed.  At present the charge is £380 p.a. and the Council cannot afford much more.  Mr G. S. Hawker MP will be approached to try to get the ETSA supply expedited.
