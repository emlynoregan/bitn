Aberdeen P.O.  About a year ago attempts to get a post and telegraph office at the northern end of the town fell through.  A meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel, Aberdeen on Tuesday last to remedy the situation.  A committee has been formed to prepare a memorial for presentation to Parliament to have a post and telegraph office in the north end of Burra.
