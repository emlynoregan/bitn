Vincent Burke contributed an article stating that Burra had to face some hard facts about the changing demographic structure of the town and district and the impact of those changes on its economic future and state of health.  He was concerned that overall there had been a loss of retailing in the Market Square precinct, especially relating to food and basic needs.  Ten shops were presently vacant.  The school population had declined by 30% over 15 years.  There had been a loss of some essential services and threats to others.  He included a number of statistical tables as supportive evidence:
