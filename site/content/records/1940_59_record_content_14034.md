Burra Town Council, 21 June

Mr Makin Minister of Munitions is making enquiries concerning the inspection of certain buildings suitable for a munitions annex, including Drew & Crewes’ old store at Aberdeen, garages, etc.

The Town Clerk reported Mr Fowler had visited and inspected the building.

The Mayor felt he should have been informed, as Council had been working on the matter for twelve months.

HMAS Burra-Bra will be sent a wireless receiving set from the people of Burra.  The Council has donated £5 and following a public meeting last Friday 800 buttons will be sold to raise the money needed.  A donation list will be published in the paper and any surplus funds will go towards comforts for the sailors.  The cost of the wireless is less than £30.

POWs in Java.  Three Burra boys are reported to be POWs in Java:

Pte Robert Lee was reported missing in February 1942.  He is the son of Walter Lee.

Pte Albert Kerin, the second son of Mrs Edgar Kemble has been reported missing.

Dennis Harris a son of Mr & Mrs Jack Harris previously of Burra was also reported missing.

The Burra Mill of which only the walls are left standing is considered dangerous.  One of the walls is badly cracked and falling stones might inflict serious injury.  Cr Bevan pointed out the problem.  Cr Harvey said the Council had not been advised of any transfer of ownership from Messrs Thomas & Co.  Cr Bevan moved they be asked to pull the walls down.  Carried.

Ratepayers’ Meeting.  The Mayor said it seemed the ratepayers did not seem to want a meeting.  He said he regretted the election in West Ward as unwarranted and an unnecessary expense.
