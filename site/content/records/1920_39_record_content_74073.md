Mr Charles J. Pearce was given a social on Tuesday 21 February by members of the Male, Female and Juvenile Tents of the Rechabite Lodge.  Mr Pearce was retiring after 62½ years as secretary.  He will be 83 on 2 March and only resigned at the end of 1938 due to failing health.  He has been a member of the lodge for 72 years.  He has since regained his health.  As well as a large attendance of Rechabite Lodge members other Lodges were also represented:

Bro. R.W. Bowey District Secretary IOR, Adelaide

Bro. Ern Fuller PNG & Bro Alwin Pearce (Secretary) represented the IOOFMU

Bro. E.J. Davey represented the AOF

Bro. C.S. Preiss PP of the Buffalo Lodge

Bro. A.B. Riggs PCR occupied the chair and the Mayor & Mayoress attended.

Speeches are reported from A.B. Riggs, R.W. Bowey, Mr John Drew, Edlie Thomas, The Mayor, Rev. Tilbrook and Ern Fuller.

The chairman presented Mr Pearce with a handsome Westminster chiming clock.

Mr Pearce in responding said he had been elected secretary when 20 and meetings were held in the Baptist Church, now the Council Depot.  At the time Mr White kept a school there and we paid him 5/- to hold out meetings.  Officers were a strict lot in those days and members not conducting themselves in accordance with the rules were fined.  After a few years meetings moved to the Institute, where they have been held ever since.  When he became secretary he said the funds were between £50 and £100.  A few years ago when the District Consolidated the Lodge handed over £5,000 to the District.  He recalled working well with the surgeons of the tent: Doctors Dashwood, Cave, Sangster Sen. & Jnr, Nesbitt, Brummitt, Caw, Ashton, Steele & Steven.  He also mentioned District Secretaries and District Meetings.
