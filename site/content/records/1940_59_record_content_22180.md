Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society held its annual meeting on 21 June.

During the year several needy cases have been assisted.  Wood has been provided in the winter and Christmas Cheer for the aged and infirm.  Birthday gifts were given to two very aged ladies.  Early in January the society lost its beloved secretary, Miss Helen Wilkinson after many years of service.  She became a member in 1933, Assistant Secretary in 1935 to the late Miss Coglin and Secretary in 1936, a position she held until her death.
