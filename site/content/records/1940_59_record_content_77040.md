Burra Town Hall

An appeal has been launched for £4,000 to enable the Town Hall to have a new supper room and kitchen.  Following this will come the installation of Cinemascope equipment necessary for today’s motion pictures.  The building was erected in 1874 since when additions and alterations have been carried out.

From 1874-1945 the building was conducted as an Institute and controlled by trustees.  In that time a dress circle was added and dressing rooms built at the rear of the stage, which was enlarged at the same time.  Finance for these changes was through the issuing of debentures.

In the early history of the building it is found that the Masonic Lodge, Foresters’ Lodge and other organisations conducted their business in rooms provided.  The Horticultural Society conducted flower shows in the hall.  The District Council of Burra had its first office in the building and the Corporation of Burra also.  The property was transferred to the Corporation in 1945.  To permit the proposed changes preliminary work has been completed.  The Burra Library now occupies the rooms previously leased to the Burra Branch of the CWA and the room previously the public reading room has been repaired and had a new ceiling installed and painted, and it will be the future home of the CWA.  It will officially be handed over on 26 April.  The two rooms previously used for library purposes will form the supper room and a kitchen will be built on the western wall.  Entrance from the hall will be through a door to be built beneath the window nearest the dress circle on the western wall.  Plans and specifications have been prepared.
