Wool Washing

Wool sent from Australia to England in former years often fetched a low price due to the amount of dirt within the wool.  Both the cost of land carriage and the freight to England for this dirt was considerable.  One small run calculated that last year £180 was paid to transport the dirt!  The dirt can be removed by soaking the sheep in hot water and then directing a strong jet of cold water on the sheep while it is in a bath.  The Messrs Cowper of Baldina near Burra have erected a simple yet serviceable apparatus operated under the supervision of Mr B. Dowling.  The cost, when taking into account the increased value of the wool, is trifling.

The washing place is in Baldina Creek in which water flows continuously.

Water is taken in a race over sloping ground until it has a height of six feet – the race is c. 110 feet long.  Near the end are two spouts a few feet apart so two sheep can be washed at once.  They are made of zinc four feet deep, three feet wide and twelve inches across at the top, tapering to a jet of one eighth of an inch.  Externally they look like a wedge.  The stream emerging is nearly the length of a sheep.  Underneath the spouts are tanks about five feet deep.  The top of the tank is six feet from the race and two feet from the bottom of the spout.  Adjoining the spout tanks is another tank ten feet long by five feet wide, with three divisions where for every 100 gallons of water there is mixed two pounds of soap and four pounds of soda.  This will wash one hundred sheep.  The tank holds 1,200 gallons and is supplied from two large boilers holding 800 gallons situated within a few feet.  The water in the soaking tank is kept at a temperature of 110°F by means of the boiler.  The sheep are taken from a yard six at a time and plunged into the first division of the soaking tank.  This is deep enough to immerse them and they are kept swimming for three minutes, till thoroughly saturated.  In the second division the water is shallow enough for them to gain a partial footing and here they spend a further three minutes.  In the third division they get a firm footing for another three minutes before running up an inclined plane to the stage adjoining the spouts.  They are then thrown into the spouting tank.  Here two men seize the head and legs and keep each animal floating under the spouts.  100 to 150 gallons a minute descends on it.  As the water falls it takes away incredible quantities of grit and dirt.  The men turn the sheep around until it turns white – a process taking from one to two minutes.  By this time the animal is exhausted and barely able to bear the weight of the water in the fleece – estimated at about 60 pounds.  The sheep are then left to dry for two or three days on grassy land.

The cost is from 1d to 2d per sheep.

The quantity of dirt washed from sheep from the Murray Flats, which are very dirty, is from 50 to 60% of the weight.  A bale of unwashed wool weighs about 448 pounds, while a bale of cleansed wool weighs about 200 pounds.  The saving in carriage and freight is obvious.  In addition the clean wool fetched a higher price.  Last year two pounds of greasy wool fetched 16d, but cleaned and reduced to one pound it sold for 21d, a clear gain of 5d and 2d on cartage easily covered the cost of cleaning.  Losses by death in the process are trifling – less than 0.5%.
