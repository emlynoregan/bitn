The Mary Warnes Community Room was opened on Friday by Ms Carolyn Cooke, granddaughter of Mary Warnes.  In 1994 it was suggested that the buildings at the old swimming pool could become a baby’s changing room.  After much discussion, the Council offered the small storage space adjacent to the Visitor Centre for conversion to a safe, comfortable and hygienic area to feed and change babies.  There were a couple of disabled local teenagers who also needed these facilities.  More than 24 local groups and families donated goods and money.   A number of generous local tradespeople were also vital in getting the place transformed.  It will be open during Visitor Centre hours and will be maintained and cleaned by Council.  Mr Graham Kellock represented the Council and was presented with a certificate of accreditation to say the room meets criteria set down by the Nursing Mothers’ Association of Australia and the Australian Parent Magazine.  After the opening the CWA provided morning tea.  [2 photos.]
