Editorial on the need for a well in Market Square. Francis Clark & Sons have offered to sink one at 5/- a foot for the 1st 50', 10/- a foot for the 2nd 50', 15/- a foot for the 3rd 50' and 20/- a foot for the 4th 50'. (I.e. £125 for 200') A group of men offer half the sum to be repaid by council if sufficient water is found: the sum to be forfeited if it is not found.
