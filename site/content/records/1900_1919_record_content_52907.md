The Mayor’s Report for 1917.

The last wheat/hay harvest was exceptionally good, but the mice plague and the damp winter have led to severe losses in storage.  The Government commandeered the crop and so far has paid 3/- a bushel.  The coming harvest looks like also being a good one.  The pastoral industry has been prosperous and lambing has been encouraging.

The war continues and the revolution in Russia and setbacks for the Italians have made it more difficult for the Allies.  Burra & District have continued their strong support for all patriotic efforts.

The seaside trip on 24 February was a great success and over 1.000 adults and children went to Glenelg.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band

The Burra Coronation Band did creditable work, but as more and more boys enlisted it finally collapsed with only one or two players left.  The idea of a Ladies’ Band emerged and Mr James Bentley was approached to do the tutoring.  The old instruments, which were cheap to start with, were found to be mostly useless, but the girls set about raising money and were soon practising.  Much of this effort was due to Cr McWaters.  Since the foundation of the band Mr I.J. Warnes has proved a strong supporter, together with others on various occasions.  The band has provided valuable assistance at all local patriotic occasions and has also visited Adelaide and other towns and been enthusiastically received by the public.

Anzac Day on 25 April saw a public demonstration in Market Square with a march of school children and speeches at the Rotunda.

A Memorial and Intercession Service was held in the Institute on 29 April and the hall was crowded.  Addresses were given by the Mayor and Mr J.E.H. Winnall.

Repatriation Day on 9 March was held to provide funds to help our boys on their return.  There was a procession headed by the Ladies’ Band and the Adelaide Locomotive Band visited.  There were patriotic speeches by the Mayor and Messrs Hawkes, Winnall and Rev. S.J. Bloyd.  A Union Jack was auctioned under the Bugler system and various stalls did brisk business.  The Locomotive Band gave a concert in the Institute in the evening.  A little over £2,000 was raised.

Red Cross Day on 1 June took the form of a fete in aid of Red Cross and Trench Comforts Funds with the sale of gifts in the Institute.  About £225 was raised.

Violet Day on 6 July was held in appalling weather and the auction of a bunch of violets under the Bugler system raised £185 and the total for the day was £356, which under the circumstances was encouraging.

The Anniversary of the War on 5 August saw a large gathering in Market Square.  The Ladies’ Band attended and speeches were delivered by the Mayor & Messrs W.G. Hawkes, J.E.H. Winnall, Rev. Father Prendergast, Captain Trigg & Mr H.J. Penno.

Australia Day was held on 1 September.  The Ladies’ band again headed a procession.  A gold button auctioned under the Bugler system realised £978 and became the property of R.J.M. McBride for £225.  (The second highest bid was £200 by A.J. & P.A. McBride and the third £100 by Messrs Hawkes & Daskein.)  The town’s patriotic societies took part – the Cheer-up Society, Soldiers’ Aid Soc., & Red Cross.  A picture show in the evening raised £40-16-0 and the total for the day was c. £2,000.  World’s End Friends contributed c. £30 and the Burra School Fife & Drum Band and the Boy Scouts gave valued assistance.

Navy Day on 2 November again saw a visiting band – The Naval Band from Adelaide.  They and the Ladies’ Band contributed to the success.  £700 was raised for the men of the Navy and Mercantile Marine.  Speeches were made by the Mayor, Lt Argent, Staff-Surgeon Morris and Mr Lawrence.  There was a concert in the evening at the Institute.

YMCA Red Triangle Day on 12 October saw the sale of buttons and a burning candle guessing competition raise c. £50.

Burra Cheer-up Society continues its good work with regular weekly meetings and farewell socials and a parcel for departing boys.  Soldiers and sailors returning are met at the station by the Ladies’ Band and a welcome home social is given later.  In January 2,250 khaki handkerchiefs were despatched, 400 Christmas puddings were also despatched and £20 provided for cigarettes and tobacco.  Christmas Boxes for 50 nurses at No. 14 Hospital in Egypt were also provided.  Much valuable help has also been given the Adelaide Society.  Many grateful notes have been received from recipients of these gifts.

Soldiers’ Aid Society is doing many of the things that the Cheer-up Society does, especially making comfortable and useful clothing for the troops.

Patriotism.  We believe the district has raised about £45,000 for the war effort and about 500 local young men have volunteered.

The Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney are doing splendid work in the town and for the patriotic efforts.

The Supreme Sacrifice has now been made by about 54 local men and many others have been severely wounded.

On Australia Day a handsome Honour Roll was presented to the town by Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce, containing the names of Burra & District Boys who have fallen in the war.  Lt-Col. Beevor unveiled it and Scout Patrol Leader Tiddy sounded The Last Post.  It is now fixed at the public reading room of the Institute.

[A detailed statement of income and expenditure then follows.]

Rates collected for the year amounted to £945-13-0.

North Ward	£142-11-0

East Ward	£171-0-0

West Ward	£152-11-0

All wards ended the year in credit: North & East with about £21 each and West about £42.

Parklands.  Dead trees have been removed and replaced and hundreds of trees added.  Wanton destruction of trees continues to be a problem.  A garden has been planted by the Black Bridge in Kooringa.  The account began in debit £23 and ended in debit £3-5-8.

The Cemetery.  The main expenditure has been in repairing the walls for £28-8-6 and in painting for £10-5-0.  The year opened in credit £140 and ends in credit £113.

The main roads grant was £430.

Tar paved roads previously done have been attended to.  We look forward to tar paving all the main thoroughfares.

Local Board of Health.  Started the year in credit £101-11-0 and ended in credit £47-13-6.

Lighting.  This account opened in credit £3-1-8 and closes in debit £6-18-4.  Carbide was very dear this year and greatest care had to be exercised.  The town has 20 lights and each one costs over £7-10-0 to maintain and yet the results are far from satisfactory.  Improvement to a more up-to-date system is needed, but will have to await the end of the war.

Carbide costs for the year	£71-7-7

Lighting [Lamplighters]	£70-1-0

The Corporation owns 2 horses, 2 drays, 1 water-cart, 1 road-roller, 1 hand-roller, 1 sanitary cart, 1 tar sprinkler plus tools etc.

In general the town has made satisfactory progress considering the war raging.  Many new and substantial houses have been erected.  Roads have been reclaimed and new gardens formed.  The appearance of the town has improved.  The telephone system has been extended.  With stock, wool and produce prices high only the return of peace is a hindrance to prosperity.
