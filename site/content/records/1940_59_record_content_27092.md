Burra Kindergarten was to be a Pre-School Kindergarten financed by voluntary contributions and not a Private school.  Any child would be eligible to attend even if parents could not afford to contribute.  Donations in hand are £11-19-0 and a further £25 is needed before a move could be made to open the Kindergarten.
