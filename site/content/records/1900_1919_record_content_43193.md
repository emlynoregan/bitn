Burra Show Society.  A general meeting was called last Wednesday to decide whether the withdrawal of the Government subsidy this year should influence the holding of the show.  It has been learned that Saddleworth, Tarlee and Kapunda will not hold a show this year, but that shows at Clare, Petersburg, Balaklava, Gawler, Jamestown and Eudunda were going ahead.  Gawler expected to be very successful because of the cancellation of the Royal [Adelaide] Show.  Clare’s prizes were down 15%.

Mr Winnall remained opposed to holding a show.  He moved the suspension of standing orders to allow the decision to hold a show to be rescinded.

Mr Crewes opposed the motion.  Surely, he said, the removal of a £25 subsidy was not going to affect Burra after it had done so well towards patriotic funds.

T. McWaters endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks.  A.D. McDonald, S.M. Lane and J.H. Gallagher also opposed the motion which was lost 5 to 12.

Profits, if any, this year would go to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.

The sheep dog trials ended £1-4-6 in credit, but they had yet to pay for advertising and trophy inscriptions.
