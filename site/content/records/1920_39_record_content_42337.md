A.B. Riggs writes concerning party politics.  He says it is all very well and proper to promote state or nation before party and he speaks well of Mr Hill in this respect, but he also says party is not about to disappear.  As long as there are Socialist candidates there will be anti-Socialist candidates and good men will fail to be elected without a party behind them.  The Liberal & Country League is the medium through which SA may be governed by the country and what is good for the country is even better for the Metropolitan Area.
