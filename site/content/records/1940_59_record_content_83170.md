Burra Racing Club held a successful meeting at Balaklava on 15 October where the gate takings were £490.  It is thought the profit will be c. £500 of which the club will retain 20%.  The rest goes to a fund controlled by Northern Racing Clubs’ Association to improve amenities for member clubs.  The first aim is to provide starting gates.  The next Burra meeting is scheduled for 25 March when the re-sown track should be in order.

[The actual results of the races were not printed.]
