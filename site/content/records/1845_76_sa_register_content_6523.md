News of the NSW Gold Rush

The Sydney Morning Herald of 21 May has arrived courtesy of Captain Bennett of the Thomas & Henry.

The news from the diggings caused 20 ships to sail without waiting to be loaded, to prevent the desertion of their crews.

[The paper reports a gold discovery by a shepherd called McGregor, in the Wellington district, but he kept its location quiet.  It goes on to recount Hargravesâ€™ exploration and his report of the widespread presence of gold in the Wellington-Bathurst area and how Hargraves has established a company of nine working miners at Ophir diggings.  Other sites where he discovered gold are cited as Summer Hill, Guyong and Lewis Pond Creek and a little at Dubbo.  There is news of a universal rush to the fields.  Blacksmiths are in great demand for picks and cradle makers are also very busy.  One correspondent suggested that perhaps 3% will become permanent miners.  Stories of individual discoveries are told.  There is speculation about whether, as in California, the rush will lead to lawlessness and a breakdown in order.  The Government is sending troops and police and an assay office is to be opened on the field.]
