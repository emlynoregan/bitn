BCS.  An agreement to lease has been signed by Telstra and the school for the land for a mobile phone tower overlooking Burra on Brewery Hill.  It will give coverage for Burra and halfway along the Morgan Road.  Sites have also been considered at Black Springs, Mt Cone and Hallett.  Telstra is anxious to extend its coverage north and along the highway to Broken Hill.  Goyder Council development officer John Brak said no application to build the tower had yet been lodged.  Despite consultations the former Burra Burra DC had been unable to secure a service.
