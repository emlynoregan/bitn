Burra Town Council

Burra Electric Supply Co. offered special rates if the Council wanted to switch on the special flood lights for Victory Celebrations.

Cr Harvey objected, saying the Council already had a £25 overdraft.

Cr Carpenter agreed.

The Clerk said the floodlights would cost £2-7-3 per night.

Cr Bevan was prepared to donate £1-1-0.

A motion to use the floodlights was lost 4 votes to 2: Crs Jennison & Bevan for and Harvey, Carpenter, Kellaway and Lee opposed.
