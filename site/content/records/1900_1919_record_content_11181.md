Weather.  There is still no rain.

Baldina crops are poor, thin, short and becoming discoloured.

At Black Springs crops are fair.

Farrell’s Flat and Hanson have some nice green patches, but mice there are wreaking havoc.

Leighton area is doing better.

Since the above was written some rain has fallen.  On Monday there was a change with driving dust and visibility virtually zero, but in the afternoon rain set in and 69 points were recorded.  The rain was general and to the east falls varied from 12 to 50 points.  At Gumbowie snow fell thickly.

Rain is continuing as we go to press.
