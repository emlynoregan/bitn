Editorial on the Embezzlement Case

The main discussion is on the suggestion by the plaintiff’s counsel that local JPs should not sit on the case.  The writer sees SM Hinde’s dismissal of the case as an endorsement of the judgement and impartiality of the local JPs in dismissing the parallel case recently.  They should be encouraged by Mr Hinde’s actions and his confidence in them.
