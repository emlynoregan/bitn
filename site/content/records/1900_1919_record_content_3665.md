Railway Accident, c. 3 miles north of Burra at a spot known as Forder’s on Thursday evening.

The driver and stoker of the goods train noticed they had run over something.  They stopped and searched, but failed to find anything.  They reported the matter at Mt Bryan and a ganger was sent out to investigate.  He found the sickening remains of a man who appears to have lain down on the rails to await his doom.  His head and upper torso was found about 12 yards from where the train struck him and his legs about 50 yards further on;  ‘between this were found a number of pieces of flesh, etc., which had to be picked up in a bucket, filling it to the brim.’  Nothing further was found to identify the victim.  A further search on Friday found a pocket knife and a couple of pieces of ivory.  He was c. 5’11” tall.  At the inquest on Saturday Lawrence O’Brien, hotelkeeper of Redruth, said he saw the deceased on Thursday 13 June in the hotel for dinner and he had given the name of Fitzgerald and had no relatives in SA.  He came from Waterford in Ireland when he was 14 and went to California.  In Australia he had worked at Oodnadatta with a boring contractor.  He did not mention his first name and said he was headed for Adelaide.  He had paid for his dinner and two nobblers of brandy.

Thomas Vivian saw the deceased on Thursday about 3.30 p.m. near Cobb & Co.’s Corner when he appeared to be quite sober, but had no swag.  He was killed no more than 50 yards from where Vivian saw him leaning on E.N. Finch’s fence.

E.N. Finch confirmed seeing him about dusk.

M-C Phelan then described the appearance of the body parts as he had seen them on Thursday night.

Verdict: ‘Death by throwing himself in front of the engine whilst in an unsound state of mind.’
