Burra High School held its break-up at the Institute on 20 December.  A program of items was presented and then Mr Haese read his report.  They had started with an enrolment of 56 and had an average attendance of 44 despite removals and illnesses.  In February Miss M.T. Coghlan replaced Miss B.E.M. Dunstan who went to Woodville.  From now on Woodwork and Domestic Arts would count as Intermediate subjects in the Technical Certificate.  Certificates for 1932 results were presented in May.  George Hann had 5 Leaving Honours subjects and Gordon Bruff won an Intermediate Exhibition worth £120.  The school divided into Brown and Blue Houses for scholarship and sports and Browns won with 421⅓ to 3991/6.  Next year we lose free education with the introduction of fees in the High School.  The Mayor presented the prizes and the list is printed.

Best Intermediate results for 1932: Gordon Bruff.

Excellent Leaving Honours Results & Steele Prize for 1932: George Hann.

Dux of School 1933: Nathalie Neagle.

Second 1933: Gordon Bruff.

Dux of 1933 Intermediate: Gilbert Tuck.

The items then continued, concluding with a delightful play entitled: Tea-time Confidences.

A collection raised £5-10-0.

Dr D. McD. Steele, Chairman of the High School Council contributes a letter somewhat over 1 column long about the imposition of High School fees.  He outlines the widespread opposition to this move by the Government.  The Minister responded to all protests that he intended the system to be introduced for first term 1934 – parents could apply for exemption from all or part of the fee.  The objections to this were spelled out to him by the various protests.  Dr Steele appeals to all parents to send their children to High School.  One suggestion to save on costs was to close all country high schools except for those at Pt Pirie, Peterborough and Mt Gambier.  He warns that if numbers fall the Government might be tempted to implement this recommendation also.  Those seeking exemption should see the headmaster on the first day of term.  A reduction of – I think – 25% is made for a second child.  The fee applied only to those students over the age of 14.
