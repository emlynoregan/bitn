[The editor goes on to say that the subsidy attracted would fail to meet the police moiety of £140 by about £60, which suggests that the £78 attracted a £ for £ subsidy.]

Where does the £61-8-6 come into the story?  Is it the unexpended remains of the previous Govt. grant?]

This would result in the council effectively not only receiving no subsidy, but in addition would actually owe the Government £60 on account of the police.

The Council document shows they expect a grant-in-aid of £253 and in order to get this they will have to spend from the rates £393, made up of £140 police moiety and £253 in cash.  The £253 must first be spent and vouchers then sent in to obtain the Government grant.  Their budget must be to spend £646 if they expect a grant of £253 - made up of £253 cash from rates, £253 from grant-in-aid and £140 of police moiety.

If, as they propose, they spend only £393 the cash subsidy claimable would be only

£126-10.  [The £393 would represent £126-10 from rates plus £126-10 from subsidy plus £140 for the police moiety.]

The editor suggests: -

Defer reduction of the subsidy for one year because after this year it is likely the subsidy will cease and with it the police rate also.

This would allow the expenditure on public works to rise by £387-19-6 and indebtedness to the Government would be met.

The clear gain to the town would be an increase in subsidy by £224-12-6

It would be wise, as suggested by Crs West and Sampson to reduce the interest on the debt by the issue of bonds.

Why is it necessary to increase the town’s debt?

The debt has benefited the town in enabling the expenditure in the town of double the amount of the debt, above what would else have been spent.  That is to say that money representing the debt has been spent plus a subsidy equal to it.

We have no doubt about the wisdom of it and in view of the early cutting off of the grant we believe it should continue while the grant lasts.  To pay the debt off now is to lose money, while to pay it off when the grant ceases is to lose nothing.
