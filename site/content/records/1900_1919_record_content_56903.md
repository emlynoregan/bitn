Burra Boy Scout Room: Laying of Foundation Stone

Mr Rigney organised the Scout Troop three years ago and since then great work has been done.  When the building is finished the boys will have a home of their own in a solid well built form comprising two large rooms: one 45’ x 20’ and the other 20’ x 20’.

Proceedings began with a march from Market Square with the Cheer-up Ladies’ band and the school Fife & Drum Band with the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney, Wolf-Cubs under P-L George Sara and the schoolchildren with Mr Hitchcox.  Councillors and others assembled at the site.  There were speeches by Mr Winnall, Rev. H. Hopton (who had been Scoutmaster at Auburn) and Scoutmaster Rigney before Mr Crewes laid the stone.  They had their first home burnt down [the old White Hart Hotel] and their second was the Waterworks.  The present site had been given by Mr James Reed with an old building on it.  Mr I.J. Warnes had given a generous donation.  Three years ago there had been 18 scouts and there were now 42.  One of their old members, Horton Jennison, was at the front.  A collection after the stone laying raised £60, including a horse worth £20 from Mr G. Sampson.  The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. then provided tea in a marquee and added a further £8 to the total.
