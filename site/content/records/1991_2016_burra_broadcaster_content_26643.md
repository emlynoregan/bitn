Goyder Council

Austek Roofing of Kapunda has been asked to re-roof the Burra Regional Art Gallery for $11,816.

The Paxton Square Cottages Working Party will review the National Trustâ€™s request re the lease arrangements for BVC.

Council will provide $3,000 this financial year for Redbanks Reserve maintenance, but is unwilling to commit future funding.
