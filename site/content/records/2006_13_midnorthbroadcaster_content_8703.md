Andy & Di Smith of Melbourne write a letter to the paper reviewing their experience of a visit to Burra & the Clare Valley.  The tone of the letter can be judged from the paragraph in which they ‘wanted to congratulate the South Australian Tourist Commission on the magnificent job they had done to keep the attractions of Burra and the Clare valley a closely guarded secret from the prying eyes of outsiders.’  Their advice includes:

Avoid attracting hordes of tourists from NSW or Victoria – they might increase rural employment and transform currently unoccupied buildings into viable, but pretentious boutique small businesses.

Avoid any mention of the region in the media or on the web.

Don’t mention the [Boer] War and the making of ‘Breaker Morant’ and the Burra/Redruth Gaol connection.

Avoid World Heritage listing.

Don’t let it be known that Burra is a living theme park in brick and mortar.

Don’t let publicity attract wine snobs to the world class boutique wines of the Clare Valley.

Hide the fact that this region is a fine jumping off place for the outback.

Under no circumstance allow money to be donated or sought for the restoration of the Burra Railway Station – it might attract voracious tourists with fat wallets.

Keep the Burra Bakery’s Cornish pasties a secret.

Also make sure not to mention or review the excellent Indonesian restaurant, the White Cedars Café, run in Burra by Francis Walling and Putu Suta.
