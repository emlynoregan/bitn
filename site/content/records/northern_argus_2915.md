The Community Employment Program will provide a grant of $104,137 for tourist development at the Burra Mine.  There will be a sponsor contribution of $13,674 made up of $5,000 from the Department of Mines & Energy, $5,000 from the Department of Tourism and $3,674 from the Burra Mine Management Committee along with a non cash donation of $12,892.  The project is scheduled over 28 weeks.

Historic ruins will be excavated and stabilised under archaeological supervision.  Walking trails and interpretive signs will be provided.  Debris will be removed from the Morphett Chimney flue and the area around Morphett’s Whim House will be cleared.  [A more detailed list of sites to be stabilised and given signage follows.]
