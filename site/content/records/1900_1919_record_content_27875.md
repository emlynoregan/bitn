Kooringa Cottage Homes

Recently five cottage homes directly opposite the Methodist Church, built by Mr J. McBride for the use of the worthy poor, were declared open by the Rev. Vivian Roberts, the President elect of the Methodist Church of South Australia.  They are built on the site of old mine cottages, which had stood for many years, but which had become dilapidated eye-sores.  The new buildings were erected by John Pearce & Sons and are replete in every comfort and convenience.  Mr & Mrs McBride and family attended.  Mr McBride, in handing over the deeds said it was simply a gift to God to be held in trust by the Methodist Church for the use of those worthy poor people who needed a home at the close of their lives.  Rev. Roberts expressed his pleasure at accepting such a trust from ‘one who had done so much in his long life for his needy fellow creatures’.  The visitors then inspected the buildings and expressed pleasure and delight at the cosy and homelike appearance of the dwellings.
