The International Council on Monuments and Sites has entered the debate over the lifting of the Burra Mine Reserve.  ICOMOS has made a submission to PIRSA saying that Burra is currently under consideration for nomination as a World heritage Site and in 1979 Burra was the location of the proclamation of the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter, which provides guidance for the conservation and management of places of cultural significance.  It says the proposal by Phoenix must be measured against its impact upon the State Heritage listed values of the site and its potential World Heritage values along with the preparation of a Conservation Management Plan.
