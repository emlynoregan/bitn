Editorial on the forthcoming ratepayers’ meeting.

The editor blames the Mayor and Councillors Parks and Hardy as the principals with Cr Harris getting second prize.  He says:

‘There is not the slightest doubt but that the meeting held on September 12 was illegal, therefore all the proceedings were illegal.  On that date the assessment for the year 1893-94 was passed, and if the motion dealing with the matter is not rescinded serious consequences will follow.’

‘It is high time the ratepayers took the matter up, and once and for all put a stop to the continual bickering for personal motives.’
