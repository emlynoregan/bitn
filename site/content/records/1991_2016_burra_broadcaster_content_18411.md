J. R. Langmead, Chief Inspector & Officer in Charge North East Local Service Area, writes an open letter to the Burra Community.

In December 1997, a public meeting was held in the Burra Town Hall to address complaints that had been received from members of the community concerning the way in which the town and district was being policed.  At the meeting a committee was appointed to work with senior police to overview the investigation of the complaints.  This letter honours a commitment to keep the public informed of the results.  Senior staff from the Police Internal Investigation Branch spoke to 17 people who had lodged individual complaints and to three others who wished to air their concerns.  None of the complaints involved serious misconduct, but rather revolved around how police dealt with members of the public.  All complainants have agreed to have their complaints resolved informally, allowing police the deal with maters raised as issues of management.  At the end of the investigation the Police Complaints authority wrote to each complainant advising them that matters had been resolved and the investigation was complete.  Some of the problems raised are being addressed in the â€˜Country Policing Review.  While acknowledging there were certain problems, it is important to note that in the past Burra police have enjoyed very positive working relationships with their police.  In a recent survey over 400 randomly selected households were asked about community attitudes towards police.  Just less than 50% replied and 86.6% of those who did so were either satisfied or very satisfied.  This is well above the state average of 77.6% and the national average of 78.8%.  It reflects intensive work done since that public meeting nearly 12 months ago.   The first meeting of the recently formed Police Community Consultative Committee was well attended and details of this committee and its aims will be published in due course.  The original committee appointed at the public meeting has been very diligent in seeing that the Burra community has not been disadvantaged in any way.  They have had numerous meetings with senior Police officers to discuss the progress of the investigations and I acknowledge the role they have played in addressing and resolving the issues raised.
