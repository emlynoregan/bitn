Burra Show Society.  A special general meeting last Friday changed the rule forbidding the President to serve for more than two years consecutively.  The argument was that originally nominations were openly done at a meeting and voting was public, but now nominations are sought ahead of time and voting, if needed, is by secret ballot.  Mr Winnall outlined the reasons for desiring a change and Mr McWaters moved the motion, which was 2nd by Mr R.M. McBride.  Mr Hawkes supported the change, as did Mr J. McLaren and it was carried unanimously.
