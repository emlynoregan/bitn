Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard

Last year a pygmy bluetongue was found inside a dead Brown snake.  Since then 50 live lizards have been found.  The discovery was a remarkable coincidence.  Who but a herpetologist would have stopped to examine a dead Brown snake on a roadside near Burra and then bother to dissect it  to discover its most recent meal and who but a herpetologist would then identify that meal as a pigmy bluetongue lizard (Teliqua adelaidensis), a species not recorded since 1959?

Graham Armstrong and Julian Reid did just that last October.  Anyone else would have just driven on.  This exciting discovery resulted in an extensive search for more of the lizards.

Mark Hutchinson of the SA Museum found a second dead one, presumed to have been killed by a kestrel.

Funding was obtained from the Endangered Species Program and Tim Milne was employed to continue the survey.  On 6 November 1992 the first live animal was seen in 33 years.  Since then, over 50 have been found in three localities.  In spring and summer most were males, presumably out looking for mates.  Females and young were seen later in summer.  It was found they lived in spider burrows rather than in logs or among rocks.  Tim has been able to lure them out using grasshoppers on a rod and line to go ‘fishing’ for them.  They are found in pastures on which grazing has occurred for 100 years, but seem to favour remnant Lomandra grassland of the rocky creek-lines, which have escaped the plough.  These are a threatened community.  The search for further colonies will continue and the life history, movements, behaviour and ecological requirements will now receive attention.  [Photo.]
