Mrs Doyle and Miss Olive Doyle have moved from Mt Bryan East to live with Mrs Doyle’s daughter, Mrs A.E. Willis, at Booborowie.  On 3 February a presentation of an easy chair was made to Mrs Doyle (who was not well enough to attend) and that was accepted by her son Mr Harold Doyle.  Miss Olive Doyle was presented with a travelling rug.  Mrs Doyle had been an active community member since coming to the district to reside in 1914, whilst Miss Olive Doyle had lived there all her life.
