The Burra Golf Club held its last major event on the sandgreens last weekend, when the Burra Hotel sponsored an ambrose competition, which attracted a field of 51 players in 13 teams.  Gawler Caddieshack took out the major Burra Hoteliers Trophy with a 6 under par round on a countback from the Farrell Flat-Moonta team.  Next week will be the last programmed day for men on the sandscrapes.  Negotiations with Farrell Flat and Hallett will be held to complete the September program on their courses.
