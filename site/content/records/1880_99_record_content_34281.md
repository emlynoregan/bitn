Redruth Court.

The Burra Town Council lost two cases when they tried to collect rates from the police houses in Redruth and Kooringa.

Burra Town Council.  There were many appeals against the assessment, though many of them came from J.R. Stephens (23) and SAMA (10).

As a result the assessment drops from last year by:

£49 in North Ward

£20 in East Ward

£371 in West Ward

The huge fall in West Ward is due to the decrease in the value of one SAMA property from £1,000 to £700.
