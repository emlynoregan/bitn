Burra Town Council, 3 April

The Council met in a special meeting to discuss purchasing the Burra Institute.  The balance sheet and other financial details were presented to the Council.  The Institute showed an absolute loss last year of £3.  [This figure was corrected in the paper of 18 April to £36.]  Interest on the overdraft was at 5% and in order to pay off interest etc. it would be necessary for the Council to strike a rate of 3d in the £.  Renovations and new seating would bring the debt to £4,160.  If this could be procured at 4½% and £186-15-0 was paid off in interest only, a rate of 3½d in the £ would pay off the principle in 20 years.  The Mayor said that £200 would clean up the building and the other £1,000 could stand over for the time.  He was keen to have a solicitor draw up a form of agreement and the solicitor could see the State Bank and the other authorities necessary.  He said in answer to a question from Cr Kellaway that the reason the Institute was in debt was that some years ago additions were made in the expectation that the Government subsidy then being received would continue and clear the debt.  The Government then suddenly cut out the subsidy.

Cr Kellaway said that one bugbear was that they would have no control over the library.
