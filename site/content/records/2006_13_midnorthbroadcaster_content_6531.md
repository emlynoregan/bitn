The Melbourne Cup Luncheon

Due to $500 being raised, Burra Hotel publican Bill Overell attended in a dress with his staff.  ‘Billinda’ looked resplendent in a flowing floral ensemble and designer silk scarf and accessories.  He also crossed to the Commercial Hotel to place his bets on the race and took part in the fashion parade.  About 140 attended the luncheon.
