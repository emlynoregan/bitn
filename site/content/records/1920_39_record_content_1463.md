Thomas B. Ashton writes re the Burra Hospital from which he was excluded in July 1917 when 11 of the 12 patients there were his and when of the 91 operations done since July 1916 he had performed all but 17.  On 27 June 1917 Mr Winnall reported the grant was £1,000 and they had got through with £861.  £760 had been raised by subscription and patients.  Now they are keen to embrace what I battled for against their opposition.  I hope the new era will end one in which one doctor is expected to work in an honorary capacity for doing that for which another receives a salary.
