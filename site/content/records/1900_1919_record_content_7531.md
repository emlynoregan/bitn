Mr Burns favoured the resolution because he thought some advantage should be given to tributers.

Mr Drew moved as an amendment:

‘That local shareholders having fullest confidence in the wealth of the Burra Mine and having respect to the number of local men who are anxious to get work on it, trust that the directors will soon be able to see their way clear to start some work on the mine.’

Mr Crewes thought the directors needed to be told the unvarnished truth about distress in the town and the urgency of the need for employment.  We are told directors are not philanthropists, but they do have sympathy with the needs of the town.  He felt the amendment was weaker and supported the resolution.

Dr Sangster said that rather than breed discord he would withdraw his motion in favour of the amendment as he thought they said much the same thing.

The amendment was put and lost and the motion then carried unanimously.

The resolutions are to be conveyed to the directors in Adelaide by a deputation of Dr Sangster and Rev. W.G.M. Murphy.
