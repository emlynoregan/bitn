Ordinary meeting 21 March.

Tobacco trees in the cemetery are to be destroyed.

The mayor reported that an old shaft had made an appearance near the pumping station.  The works Committee will investigate and act on this and another nearby shaft also complained of.

The Hydraulic Engineer sent a tracing showing the water mains, stopcocks and fireplugs in the town.

The Hydraulic Engineer wrote to say no changes could be made in the engine as it had already left England and to say the hydrant had been sent.

The Mayor said the understanding was that the engine referred to was to be disposed of and a new and larger one substituted.
