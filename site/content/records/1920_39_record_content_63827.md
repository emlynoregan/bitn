Redruth Social

A social was held in the Redruth Memorial Hall on Wednesday evening.  A short program included Mr P. Rosman with his dancing doll in humorous numbers, Mr Bob Morton on mouth organ, Miss Mavis Gare and Mr Lindsay Thomas in songs and duets and Mr J. Pearse from Adelaide with songs and elocutionary numbers, with Miss Clarice Reed as accompanist.  This was followed by Community Singing and supper.  After supper the oldest games that could be recalled were played: ‘Here we go gathering nuts in May’ and ‘My Friend’s Chair’.
