Charles J. Pearce turned 73 on 2 March and also celebrated 53 years as Secretary of Rose of Sharon Lodge IOR.  He is the only original officer of that lodge still alive.  Meetings were originally held in the Baptist Church, now the Council Depot.  He has also been Secretary of the Lily of the Valley Tent for about 45 years.  He was born at Springbank in 1856, the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs William Pearce, tailor, who arrived in Burra in 1847.  As a lad he was apprenticed to the late W.L.H. Bruse cabinetmaker, but has been in business for himself for 43 years.  In 1882 he married Miss Agnes M. Thomas, daughter of Andrew Thomas FCS, City Analyst of Adelaide and had a family of five sons and five daughters of whom seven survive: Mrs P. Flint (Kingston), Miss A. Pearce (Kooringa), Mrs E. Howath (Williamstown), Sister M.A. Pearce (Kent Town Private Hospital), Lisle Pearce (who manages the business in Burra), Andrew Pearce (manager of Swan & Co. Melbourne) & Max Pearce (manager for Elder, Smith & Co. Burra).  Andrew and Courtney who died about three years ago served in the Great War.  A grown-up daughter Mrs T. James died in recent years.  A sister Mrs J.D. Jordan of Ashfield NSW also survives.
