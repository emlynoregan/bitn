Two local fire fighters, Terry Daniels (48) of Burra and Trevor Huddleston (51) of Terowie, have returned from helping at the Victorian bushfires.  They went to Churchill and operated mainly around the Redhill Road area.  The devastation was heartbreaking.  Their experience will be valuable in training local crews.  [Photo of Terry Daniels.]
