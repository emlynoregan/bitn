Editorial on the Alfred Stanley Lines Case

The editor comments on a recent court case in which Henry Skews was charged with beating Alfred Stanley Lines.  The editor says, that without in any way condoning the actions of Skews, it is clear he was provoked sorely by the actions of a lad who is either self-willed or takes a delight in doing what is wrong and has an immovable conscience.  Nevertheless, orphans and other boys in the care of masters should not be knocked about, because two wrongs do not make a right.

[Note that Alfred Stanley Lines, born 6 April 1885, was orphaned in 1855 when his father murdered his mother and then committed suicide.  See VI, 449, 16 June 1885, Page 3.]
