St Joseph’s Bazaar raised £78-11-10, somewhat beyond expectations.

The bazaar on Friday & Saturday last was opened by the Mayor who was welcomed by Rev. Father Redden.  Stall holders are listed.  The total amount taken was £107-14-10.

Rain has continued and the Burra Creek is in flood and all other creeks flowing strongly.

The Austral Biorama Co. visited Burra on Monday in the interests of the Salvation Army.  The company comprises male and female instrumentalists with a grand bioscopic display of fine pictures.  The attendance was smaller than hoped for, but the program was much appreciated.

Burra Record libel case.  The case brought by Cartwright against W.J. Davey and A. Willmott resulted in the awarding of £50 against Davey and Willmott.  (Details next issue.)

Supreme Court, Wednesday.

John Nash (19), John Bryant (19) & Thomas Heffernan (18) were charged with stealing articles to the value of £6 from R. Finch.  The jury gave them the benefit of the doubt and they were discharged.  Heffernan was then arrested to complete a term at Magill Reformatory, but he escaped and has not been seen since.

Lawrence Farrell from Jamestown, porter at the Burra Railway Station, broke into a case of whisky in the goods shed on Tuesday night.  He was found at his home on Wednesday night asleep with a whisky bottle half empty.  He claimed he had bought it at the Royal Exchange Hotel, but enquiries showed otherwise.  He was charged with unlawful possession and given seven days, rather than with larceny which carries a heavier sentence.
