Accident.  A semi-trailer driven by Mr Robert Rohrlach of Tanunda was severely damaged when its load struck the overhead railway bridge at Burra North at about 5 p.m. on Wednesday.  The load was a large crane jib, which struck the bridge, moving it slightly out of alignment.  Train services were not disrupted, though train speeds slowed to a minimum until repairs were effected.  Damage to the vehicle was c. $800.
