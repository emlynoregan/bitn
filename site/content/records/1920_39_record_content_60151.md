I showed the letter to Mr Howard Lloyd, whose office was the headquarters of the old SA Mining Assoc. and he has many interesting records there.  In 19½ years it yielded £4,750,000 worth of copper ore and paid nearly half of that in wages.  Shareholders received £800,000 in dividends, or a return of £315 for every £5 share.  The invested capital was £12,320 only and no call was ever made.

In 1914 Mr Lloyd was appointed liquidator of the SA Mining Assoc.  On the walls of his office are interesting sketches of the mine in 1847 by S.T. Gill.  Perhaps more interesting is a long panoramic sketch of the mine painted by a stable boy who obviously made his green pigment out of copper ore.  Also on the mantelpiece are two fine geological specimens.
