McPhee’s Butchers had a film crew from Hong Kong visiting last Friday to film the preparation of saltbush meat.  It was to be part of a five episode series: ‘Superb Travel and Dining’, focused on the ‘paddock to plate’ principle.  The crew also visited other regions in SA.

Mr McPhee said it would provide great exposure for Burra and Burra’s saltbush products.  Filming began on a property near Burra and included a Hong Kong chef’s preparation of a dish at Skillogalee Winery.
