Many trees have been damaged or destroyed by a person or persons unknown.  Pepper trees have been planted from St Mary’s to the Mine Bridge.

At Victoria Park a new cricket pitch has been laid and the bicycle track is about to receive attention.

The cemetery is in good order and its account in credit £42-14-1.

A £100 special grant was received to effect repairs to the Commercial St Bridge.

Waterworks.

Two years ago they were in a bad way – reliant on one boiler which was in a bad state and the engine was struggling to keep going.  Today the boiler and engine are in thorough order and can be relied on.  The Cornish engine has been repaired.  The smaller boiler has been re-tubed and refitted and the engine thoroughly overhauled and several worn parts replaced.  The worn out iron chimney has been replaced by a new stone one and a cement floor laid in the boiler house.  Close to £200 has been expended and after paying working expenses we have £176-18-3 in hand.  The day is not far off when we will have to provide a larger reservoir as out population will be on the increase.  [This estimate was at least in part based on the reopening of the mine.]  The present reservoir holds only 33,000 gallons.  I would suggest one of 200,000 gallons.  A quarry near the old one could be utilized and the whole done for about £300.  This could store several days’ supply.  William Pryor, in charge of the works, has proved a painstaking and capable officer.

The slaughterhouse.

Despite several attempts to get over this question the Council has not been able to achieve a result, but at least now all meat sold in Burra is inspected.  A site for a new rubbish depot has been selected.

The Mayor thanked the Town Clerk, Mr O. Bartholomaeus for his careful attention.

Mr J. Jenkins appeared to object to the planting of trees on the road to the Mine Bridge as it was ‘beautifying private property’, but the Mayor thought it a credit to Council.

Mr Jenkins was also annoyed that the Council had acted against public opinion in the slaughterhouse issue, but the Mayor said it had been impossible to proceed on the lines resolved upon.  The Burra Council was not the only one not to have a public slaughterhouse – even Adelaide did not have one.  Cr McLaren said that the authorities seem to have realised that the Health Act as presently constituted was unworkable.  He regretted the apparent apathy of businessmen with regards to municipal matters.

Cr hardy supported the Mayor’s speech.  The £4 the North Ward was overdrawn was due to the flood early in the year.  He said the slaughterhouse question would have been settled if SAMA had not asked an exorbitant price – Mr Jenkins said: ‘They wanted £220.’

Cr Hardy: ‘They asked £500 for it.’

Burra Town Council, 18 November.
