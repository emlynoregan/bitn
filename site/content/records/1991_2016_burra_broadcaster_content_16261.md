16261→Burra Uniting Church will have a special service on Sunday night, at which mime, circus skills and story-telling will be the order of the night, with the roguish characters of Rivet ʼn’ Tuft.  This duo have been together since 1983 – Grant Wildman and Trevor Wright.  They offer a wide range of drama, through Dramatic Solutions – a company that presents thoughtful drama for all age groups and situations.
