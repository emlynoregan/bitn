Burra Mine

Exploration rights for the Burra Mine have been let.  Drilling will start within a few days. The Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan announced this today.  The rights have been granted to Mines Exploration Pty Ltd on behalf of Broken Hill South Ltd, North Broken Hill Ltd, Electrolitic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd and McPhar Geophysics Ltd.  Exploration work by the Department of Mines has shown that redevelopment of low grade oxidised ore in the old mine was a sound economic proposal and that further exploration for primary ore near the old workings was worth while.  Mines Exploration Pty Ltd represented a predominantly Australian group.  The company would expend a large sum in further testing of the low grade oxidised ore and also the deep ore deposits.  A decision on whether it would be economic to establish a mining treatment project for oxidised ore can be expected within twelve months.
