RSL Annual Report 1962

Attendance has been just enough to keep the branch open.  During the year two sets of indoor bowls were procured with money left by the estate of the late Mrs Sara Gare, which made for many happy evenings for the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  On Anzac Day the march and parade was led by the Port Pirie Pipers’ Band and the evening service was held in St Mary’s.  Eighteen members attended.  Remembrance Day was observed with the usual service at the Memorial in Market Square.  Held on a Sunday when a number of members were absent, it drew only sixteen of them.  The Ministers’ Fraternal did not reply to the invitation this time and the President read Mr Bean’s Requiem instead.  The annual ball was successful thanks to the Ladies’ auxiliary in particular.  Forty-six members attended the annual dinner, with visitors also from headquarters, Saddleworth, Jamestown, Farrell Flat and Hallett.  It was very successful from a social point of view.  The Christmas party was a small event, but most enjoyable.   The Burra RSL continues to support two Legacy wards – largely from money from bottles collected by people of the district.  The Governor, Sir Edric Bastyan paid a visit on 9 November and shook hands with each of the approximately 60 members present.
