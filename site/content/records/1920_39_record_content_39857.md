Reece Air Pageant.  On 24 October a large gathering of residents from the district took place at Maurice Collinsâ€™s paddock at Copperhouse.  Captain Miller arrived in a large monoplane and Captain Hussey in a biplane.  Many took advantage of reasonable prices for a flight with Captain Hussey.  There was later a display of balloon bursting and bombing and to end the show a parachute descent by Lieut. Reece.  Many thought the descent of a dummy by parachute from c. 50ft was the real thing, but Lieut. Reece jumped from a great height and made a successful landing.
