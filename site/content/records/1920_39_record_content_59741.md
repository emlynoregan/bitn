Methodists were on the first ship to come to SA.  Captain Morgan of the first ship, [of settlers] The Duke of York, conducted regular divine service each Sunday and held a service on the ship on its arrival at Kangaroo Island 26 July 1836.  The first settler to step ashore was the youngest on the boat, Lucy Anne Beare and she was a Methodist.  The first adult ashore was Samuel Stephens, the son of the President of the Wesleyan Church in England.

Samuel East, a Methodist local preacher inaugurated regular services in the Company’s carpenter shop 19 August 1836.  When the site of Adelaide was chosen the settlers moved to Glenelg and on Christmas Day 1836 a divine service was held in the surveyor’s hut with 25 present.  Two Methodist local preachers conducted it.  John C. White started the first regular services on the mainland after he arrived on the Coromandel, 1 January 1837.  He had been a local preacher at City Road, London.

The first service in Adelaide was in Mr Giles Abbott’s hut.  Two classes for Christian Fellowship were formed 11 May 1837 (men’s and women’s) in Edward Stephen’s hut.

Rev. William Longbottom arrived when his small vessel, en route from the eastern colony to WA, was wrecked on the SA coast and the survivors walked for 45 days to reach Adelaide.  The first stone church in Adelaide was a Methodist Chapel on a piece of land in Hindley St where the Eagle Hotel now stands.  It opened on 1 March 1838 and was 22 ft x 50 ft x 9 ft high and accommodated 200.  Mr White preached in the morning, Mr Mincham in the afternoon and Rev. T.Q. Stow (Congregationalist) in the evening.  When it proved too small, Mr Stephens offered a block in Gawler Place, though some thought it rather far out in the bush.  A foundation stone was laid 27 November 1838 by governor Gawler.  They also started a mission for the natives.  The new church was 37½ ft x 68½ ft and held 500-600.  It opened 7 July 1839 with Rev. Longbottom preaching in the morning, Rev. J. Drummond (the first Presbyterian minister) in the afternoon and Rev. T.Q. Stow in the evening.  The Baptists bought the Hindley St church for £500.  Then Rev. Daniel Draper arrived and wanted a new church.  He donated £100 and John (later Sir John) Colton donated another £100 and half an acre in Pirie St was purchased for £600.  Later more land was added to the east for £1212.  Governor Sir H.E.F. Young laid the foundation stone for the Pirie St Methodist Church and it opened 19 October 1851 at a cost of £6204.  The Gawler Place church was then sold and together with the opening efforts the debt on the Pirie St Church was reduced to £2187.  In the eight years of Daniel Draper’s service 27 churches and 4 manses were built.  He went to England on furlough and was drowned on his return journey when the SS London sank in the Bay of Biscay.  Within five years of settlement SA had 25 Methodist preaching places and four churches and in ten years had extended to Gawler, Kapunda and Burra.  At the first Australian Conference in Sydney in 1855 SA had nine circuits with twelve ministers.  At the third Conference in Adelaide, SA had 47 churches, 67 other preaching places and 12 ministers and 108 local preachers.  There were 2101 members and 624 teachers looking to the needs of 4275 Sunday school scholars.

The first SA Conference was held in 1874 with Rev. W.L. Binks chosen as 1st President.  By this time there were 160 churches and 100 other preaching places.

All the above refers to the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the strongest branch before Methodist Union in 1900.

In 1840 John Wiltshire, a Primitive Methodist, began to preach in Light Square.  The Primitive Methodists built a church in Elizabeth Street, Adelaide, and were strong at Mt Barker.  After four years Rev. J. Long came to serve Adelaide and Rev. J. Wilson went to Mt Barker.  By the time of Methodist Union they were about half as numerous as the Wesleyans.

Bible Christians began in 1850 with Rev. J. Way and Rev. J. Rowe being the first ministers.  The former was based at Bowden and the latter went to Burra.  Rev. T.E. Keen was brought out to serve the Gawler Plains and Mr Way established a church in Young St in Adelaide.

The Methodist New Connexion built Maughan Church in Franklin St, under Mr Maughan, who died young.  In 1888 this branch of Methodism merged with the Bible Christians.

The Union of the three remaining Methodist branches was achieved in 1900.

Prince Alfred College was established when 13 acres of land was purchased at Kent Town in 1862.  Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, laid the foundation stone on 5 November 1867 and Mr S. Fiddian BA was appointed headmaster in 1868, though the college had started before his arrival in the Pirie St Lecture Hall.

The Bible Christians operated Way College under Dr W.G. Torr from 1 February 1892 until Methodist Union and in 1904 it became Methodist Ladies’ College.  In 1926 Mr & Mrs R.H. White donated the Chapman Alexander Institute to the Church and it became Wesley College, the training college for Methodist ministers.

Other Methodist Institutions established over the years include:

Memorial Hospital, North Adelaide

The Mt Barker Rest Home

The Magill Children’s Home

Resthaven, the recently started old folks’ home

Maughan Central Mission

Kuitpo Colony

Bowden & Brompton Mission
