Editorial on The New Year

1905 was not marked nationally with any great event.  Here we should look forward with hope.  Commercially Burra has little prospect of prosperity.  The harvest is fairly good and farmersâ€™ incomes should be encouraging, but late frost damage reduced a very promising yield.  There is little employment in the town.  There were hopes that the mine might be in full swing, but this was not to be.  This has been long promised and nothing has resulted.  Residents have now lost hope and many are leaving as quickly as possible.  The promise of a pumping plant has not yet been fulfilled.  Some still believe the open cut at least will be unwatered and that a few men will find work there.
