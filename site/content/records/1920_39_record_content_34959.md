Unemployment

Mr S. McHugh MP spoke to a gathering of the Burra unemployed at a meeting on 21 July presided over by Mr S. Dowling.  Members of the Town Council and a number of businessmen attended.  Mr McHugh said such a state of affairs had never before existed in Australia.  Never before had debt been as high or unemployment so numerous to say nothing of the long drought.  Australia had borrowed heavily since the war but now the London markets were closed to Australian borrowers.  People had been living beyond their means.  The current Government loan would be allotted for relief purposes.  Victoria owed SA £150,000 through the Railway Border Agreement, but had paid only £57,000.  He thought the local council should borrow £1,000 not the £500 they had sought.  They were all hoping for great things from the visit of Sit Otto Niemeyer.  Mr McHugh then went on to hope the mining industry might come to our aid.  The Government was spending £1,000 a day on relief.  There were hopes for more settlement in the South East of the state and for a timber industry there.  He did not want the dole in SA.  Big wages must come down.  Mr F. Sara asked if there was anything moving at present.  The loan would have an effect three months away and in the meantime people were in a bad way.  Mr McHugh said that just at present there was not anything.
