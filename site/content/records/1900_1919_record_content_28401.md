Larger advertisements and a column of the town directory.  There is a column of humour in fluctuating amount.

After the fire.

Page 1

Much the same as before.

Page 2

Advertisements increase in number and the news contracts often to less than one column, but can be as much as almost two.  There are a few editorials.

Pages 3 & 4

Much as before.

Overall the paper shows few signs of very active reporting and there is relatively little editorial comment.  The extended illness of the editor and proprietor in the latter part of the year cannot have helped in maintaining the paperâ€™s vitality.  Locals do seem to have rallied round with advertising after the disastrous fire early in the year.
