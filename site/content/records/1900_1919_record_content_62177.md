Burra Town Council.

Mr Winnall advises that prosecution of the tree destroyers was likely, but not certain to succeed.

It was resolved that the matter would be settled on payment of £2-2-0 each and an apology in the Burra Record.

Three men were making progress on the road for the new bridge on cemetery road.  [Ayers St]

Information was obtained that reinforced concrete would be much more expensive [than stone].  It is proposed to build in stone with iron girders.  Cr Radford favoured timber girders.

[The decision is unclear – to be built according to specifications, but the price of iron girders is to be obtained.]
