Premier Don Dunstan visited Burra last Tuesday.  In a busy day he met the Burra Burra DC, the School Council, inspected Samin Ltd Mine, toured the townâ€™s hotels and attended an evening barbecue.

At the school he said the SA Government was proud of the pioneering work being done at the Burra Community School.  The co-operation and sense of community of the people of Burra ensure that in every sense it will be a Community School.  He inspected the work on the new site.

He also had a meeting with the District Council where he was welcomed by Mr Jennison, who stressed the need for a sealed east-west road from Morgan to Spalding.
