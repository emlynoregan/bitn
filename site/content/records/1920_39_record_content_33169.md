Institute Classes.  At the annual meeting of Institute subscribers E.J. Davey queried whether the cost of the Choral & Orchestral Classes was covered by receipts from their entertainments.  Mr Radford said they generated Â£40 per annum which more than covered the lighting expenses and as every member also had to be a subscriber the Institute benefited that way too.
