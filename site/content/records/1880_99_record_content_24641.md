'A Wanderer' preaches for the rights of the workers and the unemployed against the rich, ‘the nabob, big bug, snobocracy’.  Against those who accuse the unemployed of being lazy and shiftless because they sometimes won’t take jobs on the slavery terms offered.  He makes a cry for:

Equal opportunity for all [men, of course]

Payment for Members of Parliament

An end to indirect taxation

An end to the sale of Crown Lands

Free and compulsory education

Adult suffrage

A simplified civil law and lower court fees so we may

‘not be sat on by the almighty dollar, nor got at by these scheming humbugs the lawyers.  Why should a poor man be got at because he cannot afford to pay the fees demanded.’
