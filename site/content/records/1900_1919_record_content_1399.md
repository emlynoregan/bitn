Salvation Army.  Captain Deeble and Lieut. Gullick (who has been promoted to Captain) will conduct their farewell services at the Army Barracks next Sunday after being here for six months.  It is the Salvation Armyâ€™s policy for moves to be approximately every six months.  The lassies will be succeeded by male offers whose names are not yet known.
