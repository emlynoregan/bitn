Burra Burra Mines

Reports from other visitors to the Burra Burra Mines fully support the statements of the Directors.

In four weeks ending 13 December 1845 358 tons of ore were raised; 190 from Penny’s Load.

Discoveries of native copper in a state of extreme purity are becoming increasingly frequent and indications of great and enduring wealth are daily produced.

The line of natural road is of general remark.

There is nothing new to report from Princess Royal Mines, but a small quantity of ore sent in gives every promise of quality and we understand the existence of copper in great quantity is no longer in doubt, though it is at present less tangible than the treasures of the Burra Burra Mine.
