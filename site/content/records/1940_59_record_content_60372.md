Burra Hospital AGM was held last Wednesday.

Chairman F.T. Marston reported that financially the year had seen an increase in the overdraft of about £1,500, due to fewer patients and consequently less income.  Economies had been effected, but a minimum number of staff are needed to function.  Outstanding accounts owed to the hospital amounted to some £2,400, which appears too high for the district.

The advent of the extended Commonwealth Medical Scheme should help.  The number of patients had dropped from an average 17.4 per day to 10.4 this year.  Maintenance had been limited to essential work.  A start had been made on the Nurses’ Home and renovation to existing bathrooms.

The working loss for the year was £1,562 and the overdraft was £3,330 (up from £1,872 the previous year.)

Dr Mellor, as MO, pointed out the difficulties of staffing and especially of getting trained staff.

The re-organised No. 5 Private Room, which had become a Minor Casualty Room, had greatly helped in handling outpatients and provided an X-ray and dressing room.  He also spoke on the advantages that would flow from the new Nurses’ Home and the bathroom renovations.

The foundation stone of the Nurses’ Home would be laid by the Premier, Mr Playford, on Friday 2 October.
