Burra Town Council, 19 May.

(Cr Butterworth and Inspector Gray were absent with influenza.)

No reply yet from the Commissioner of Public Works on the Waterworks issues.

Complaints have been made by police re the Rifle Co. firing over the road at the rifle range, but Lieut. Watt says all necessary precautions are taken.

The Mayor has collected c. £20 towards tree planting costs.  He would like some trees on the hill on the Baldina Road as an experiment and they should negotiate with the District Council to that end, also the flat opposite the brewery which could also be the site for lawn tennis courts.  (SAMA approval would be needed.)

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis respond that they need clarification re the obstruction in the watercourse.  There are a series of watercourses which have filled up gradually.

Cr Hardy favoured immediate legal proceedings.

Cr Rabbich thought to refer it to the Public Works Committee with power to act and this was carried.
