Ayers Forest Proposed Destruction

Hon. T. Butterfield, the Commissioner for Crown Lands, has decided to throw open the 800 acres (approximately) of Ayers Forest for selection.  Everyone around is shocked and Booborowie residents are astounded that such stupid vandalism should be proposed.  Despite unanimous objection from the foremost men in the district he has said in effect:  ‘Is that all you have to say, well I’m going to use my own judgement, you don’t know of what you are talking, I, only I, know and I am going to allot the land.’

Local opinion is that the land is useless for agriculture.  200 of the acres have not even been planted with trees: being judged too infertile for that.

A meeting in opposition was held at Booborowie on 1 December.  On Monday last week (30 November) the question was raised after the ratepayers’ meeting.  The Mayor said it was being done on economic grounds, but it was false economy.  He had been part of the deputation and said it was received as no deputation should be; simply being told the Commissioner had determined on cutting up the forest without any attempt at a reason.  The present Government was quite apathetic with respect to forests Mr Bednall said and students had to go interstate to graduate.  Mr Radford said, though not worth much now, its value in 25 years was hard to estimate.

A motion condemning the move was passed unanimously.

On Tuesday a well attended meeting in the Booborowie Hall was presided over by Chairman W.J. Cousins of the Booborowie DC.  He reported the response to the deputation.  An article had appeared in The Register and Mr Warnes hoped the Advertiser might also join the cause.  The Stockowners’ Association had protested to the Premier.  The arguments are reported in almost 1½ columns and most ridicule the economics of the move and stress that the land is not only no good for cropping, but would need very expensive clearing.  [The timber was not suitable for milling, but] was valuable for fencing and 73 excellent telephone poles had been cut this year.  It was also useful in timbering wells and building sheds.  Mr Earle said he had so used it and believed in the course of time there would be £50,000 worth there.  The meeting unanimously pledged not to apply for any blocks offered and it reaffirmed the motions that had condemned the move that had been carried at the earlier meeting.
