Letter.  Helen Szuty writes outlining how the Council has adhered strictly to its required consultation process regarding its Draft Annual Business Plan – for which neither written no personal submissions were received, but failed utterly to respond to the public meeting held on 8 November 2007 in the Burra Town Hall, where a packed meeting expressed strong desires concerning the retention and maintenance of the Paxton Square Cottages.  She urges ratepayers to attend a public meeting on Thursday 4 September in the Burra Town Hall, organised by the Ratepayers’ Action Group.
