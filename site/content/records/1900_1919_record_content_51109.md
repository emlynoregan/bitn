Violet Day in Burra.  The gross takings were £356.  It was celebrated last Friday in very adverse weather.  The rotunda was decorated in memory of the fallen with a wreath for each of the fallen and also Ptes Lindsay Stephens and Reg. Johnson who enlisted elsewhere.

Just as preparations were complete steady rain set in for the rest of the day and evening.  Despite this the Ladies’ Band marched up Commercial St and played a number of selections.  John Drew gave a moving address followed by Mr Winnall and the Mayor.  Lt Donaghue appealed for recruits.  A bunch of violets sold on the Bugler system raised £185.  Postcards of the Ladies’ Band and Sir Henry & Lady Galway sold well (18 dozen).

The ceremony at the rotunda had to be abandoned on account of the wind and rain and the speakers stood in the rain so the public listening could shelter under the Market Square verandahs.  Despite this the response was good.  The produce market had to be moved into Henderson’s Buildings (courtesy of Harris Scarfe & Co.) and thanks went to the many shops that dressed their windows in purple and white in memory of the fallen.
