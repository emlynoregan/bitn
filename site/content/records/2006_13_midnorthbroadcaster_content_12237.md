Historian Captures Burra Life

When historian David Walker began to lose his sight he was stimulated to write about his family history.  David is a Professor of Australian Studies and he has captured feelings about people in his family and the events that shaped their lives in the 19th and early 20th century in Burra as well as his own life in Adelaide.  From the 1870 members of the Walker family had a drapery business in Market Square.  Davidâ€™s book entitled Not Dark Yet is both humorous and moving.
