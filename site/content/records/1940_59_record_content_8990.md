Burra Town Council, 2 February

Instructions were received from the Department of Civil Defence requiring street lighting to be reduced by half.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. responded, saying it had replaced all 100 cp lights with 50 cp and all 50 cp lights with 25 cp lights.

His Worship suggested some back street lights could be cut altogether.

Cr Marston said he understood that some Councils in similar circumstances were being charged much less for street lighting.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. will be asked to reduce the Councils lighting bill.

Cr Lott replaced Mr Robinson as Cr Representative on the Civil Defence Committee.

Burra Civil Defence Committee asked for a warning siren for Burra North.

It was observed that sirens are practically unprocurable at present.

It was resolved that Council would co-operate fully with Burra Civil Defence’s black-out trial.

Burra Institute Committee informed the Council that a difference of opinion had arisen between it and the Institutes Association and consequently negotiations on the sale of the Institute property to the Corporation had now fallen through.

His Worship said that evidently the Committee did not want to sell the property.

Cr Lott asked that the running expenses of the Council truck be placed on the table at the next meeting.  He would like to compare the cost with that of a horse.  Petrol was getting very scarce.

His Worship said it might be wise to buy a decent horse.

Reported that the Burra Hospital balance sheet showed an improvement of £500 on the previous year.

Mr Jack Clemson, a local drover and returned serviceman from the Great War, is in the Burra Hospital after being stung behind the ear by a scorpion.
