Newsprint.

A deputation of representatives from 700 country papers has asked the Minister of Customs to assist in getting newsprint from Canada and the USA.  New Zealand has already acted on this.  The cost of paper has risen form £15 to £40 per ton and papers will not be able to continue at this price – or not beyond the end of 1916 at any rate.  Mill prices have changed little; it is the transport costs that have rocketed.  Aid was promised.
