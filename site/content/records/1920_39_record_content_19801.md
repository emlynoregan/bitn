The Mayor said when Cr Harris broached his scheme the matter had not been fully thought out.

Cr Woollacott was offended by the ‘turned turtle’ comment – he had changed as a result of the RSL conference.

Cr Kellaway had also changed and now supported Cr Woollacott’s motion and added that its advantage was that it cut off the dangerous road between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

Cr Riggs was opposed as ‘it did not behove the Council to pick up and carry on a scheme another committee had dropped’.

He moved the memorial only be fenced 25ft x 15ft with posts and chains (with gaps for pedestrian access).  The guns to be mounted on cement blocks on the south side of the Memorial within the fence and until the area was ready the guns to be placed opposite the Institute.

[The original idea fenced the Rotunda & Memorial and envisaged gardens and lawn within the fence; though later the RSL suggested shrubs and gravel as a cost saving change.]

He suggested a gala day to raise the necessary funds which he estimated at about £50.  This would close the road between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

The Mayor agreed about not picking up someone else’s scheme and supported Cr Riggs and Cr Allen seconded Cr Riggs amendment, because it was cheaper that Cr Woollacott’s proposal.

Cr Woollacott thought comments about picking up other’s schemes were absurd.

Cr Riggs’ amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Harris, Riggs & Allen voting for and Kellock, Kellaway & Woollacott against.

The Local Government Department Inspector is to be asked to investigate the crusher.

Messrs R. McWaters & W.J. Thomas Jnr wrote to the Council asking Council to plant a row of 30 stone pine trees either side of the road that reached a dead end between their properties at Aberdeen and if it did so they would look after them.

Cr Riggs moved that it be done if it cost not more than £1.

R. Fuss was granted permission to build a verandah on the Bon Accord Hotel and a letter was sent to him pointing out that the application should have been sent in earlier.

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to erect additions to Miss Bentley’s shop in Morehead St.

P.H. Nankivell of Kooringa was granted permission to erect a kitchen on his property.

The Main Roads Committee suggested an application to the Local Government Department for a grant of £600.  The local members had suggested it was worthwhile and a deputation will wait on the Government.

Various maintenance works were passed.

Local Board of Health

Burra Hospital Board asked for the appointment of Council’s representative to the Board.

Cr Woollacott moved Cr Riggs be re-appointed.  Cr Kellock seconded.

Cr Allen amended that Cr Kellaway be appointed and Cr Harris seconded.

The Mayor gave his casting vote for Cr Kellaway.

Crs Woollacott, Kellock & Kellaway said he was out of order.

The Mayor said they had recently passed a no confidence vote against Cr Riggs because he supported the reduction of the size of the Hospital Board without instruction to do so.

Cr Riggs said he had, as he understood, been given a free hand.

Cr Kellock ‘Your Worship’s action is “dirt”.’

The Mayor: ‘I object to that remark.’

Cr Kellock: ‘I don’t care if you do.’

He maintained it was so to announce an opinion before the amendment was put.

The amendment was then put and carried on the Mayor’s casting vote.

[The ordering of the above report appears to be confused: as it reads the amendment was put twice, but the content suggests otherwise.]
