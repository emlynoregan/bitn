Staff Profile: Elizabeth (Libby) Eaton

Last year I was the Reception/Year 1 teacher at Melrose Primary School.  This year I will be replacing Robyn Page as Special Education Teacher Year R-7, while she is on leave.  My other ‘hats’ involve releasing teachers for duties other than teaching and curriculum development.  I enjoy sports, e.g. horse riding and golf.  I have a special interest in drama and in 1988 joined the Patchwork Players (Booleroo Centre) to participate in My Fair Lady.  I play the piano and folk guitar.  Last year I used skills that I had developed as a past member of the Pembroke Girls’ Choir and Pembroke Choral Society to reform the Melrose Primary School Choir.  This year I am keen to assist with the choir at BCS.
