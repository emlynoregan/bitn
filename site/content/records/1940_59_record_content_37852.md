[South Australian Register, 15 October 1896 reports the dreadful suicide-murder at Cavanagh and the ensuing funeral at Dawson.  Joseph Thyer killed his wife and five children before hanging himself on the gallows in the stockyard.   The tragedy was discovered by his eldest son, George Albert Thayer, aged 17, who had been away from home on Sunday 11 October, when the events took place.  He found his mother, sister Florence (12) and the baby, Roy (4 months) dead on the bed in his motherâ€™s bedroom, with their heads dreadfully battered in.  The body of Charlie (6) was in the cot in the same room, while Edward (9) and Alexander (7) were in their bed in the back bedroom.  All had been killed in the same manner.

The remains of Mrs Thyer and the five children were buried in one seven foot square grave in the Dawson cemetery and Mr Thyer was buried apart from the others.]
