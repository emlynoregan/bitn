Walter Stanley Pearce enlisted in the AIF at Keswick 22 July 1915 and he was killed in action on the Fleurbaix Battlefield 20 July 1916 aged 24.  Family members from Perth visited his grave last year and sent information to SA members of the family who have visited Burra to further their research on the family in Burra where Walter Stanley was born.  His parents Walter & Ann Pearce lived in East Street and his grandfather Hedley lived in the cottage behind East Street now known as Peppertree Cottage.  Stanley was a draper by trade.  He had five sisters and three brothers.
