The resolution of 5 July 1917 terminating Dr Ashton’s appointment as a medical officer ‘was proper in the circumstances’. 

There was no evidence that a nurse revised or countermanded a surgeon’s instructions about an operation.  [They added that to have carried out the operation at the time requested would have been unsafe.]

There is no evidence of personal animosity to Dr Ashton, or of a desire to strip him of remuneration.

The Board did not find ‘in the constitution of the hospital or in any agreement with the medical officer of the hospital that Dr Ashton possessed any right to charge for operations on his own patients at the hospital, such patients paying the ordinary hospital charges’.

[While this finding is no doubt true in a legalistic sense, this finding would certainly appear to fly in the face of long established custom and certainly it was not only Dr Ashton who was involved.  Dr Ashton says in his letter that he was told when he came to the town in 1910, by the Chairman of the Hospital Board ‘doctors could charge private patients fees just as if they were in their own homes.]

The evidence shows that Dr Ashton charged a non-fee paying patient for attendance on her while she was a patient at the hospital.

[The statement by the patient included in Dr Ashton’s letter, while not making things quite clear on this, does raise doubts about this allegation.  She says the £17 was ‘for private and hospital attendance together’.  She was never told the £17 was for hospital attendance alone.  She further says she was never asked to pay the bill after explaining the circumstances.]

There is no evidence of the Board seeking to humiliate medical officers.

Evidence shows the hospital was never left without a medical man to conduct operations.

There is no evidence to show that the appointment of Mr P.A. McBride to the Board was unsuitable.  [The objections by some at the time had been on the grounds that he was rather young and that his appointment gave the McBride family too many connections on the Board either by blood or marriage.]

There is no evidence that the Board did anything to discourage subscriptions.

There was no need for patients to be sent out of town for treatment as a result of the way the Board treated Dr Ashton.

The Board was not responsible for people travelling elsewhere for treatment (often in unfit conditions for travel).

There is no evidence the Board charged excessive fees.  The Board is not responsible for Dr Ashton’s refusal to work at the hospital.

Meetings of the Board are open to the public.

The Board is not responsible for gathering sufficient patients to satisfy standards set for training probationers.

Findings on allegations made by the Hospital Board

See general conclusions.  [Essentially confirming that it is doing its duties.]

[That legitimate uses of the hospital are being abused by medical officers.]  See general conclusions.

The assertion that contributions fees and gifts have risen since 1909 is true only if the amount subscribed for equipment is taken into account.

Dr Ashton did refuse to attend Board meetings and Dr Williams attended sometimes and apparently is now regular in his attendance.

The resolution of the Board concerning the complaints about the treatment of the enteric patient Riese was justified and Dr Ashton made no complaint about it for over two years and then it was not a bona fide objection.

See b) above.

Dr Williams is a gentleman of equal standing with Dr Ashton.

Dr Ashton was not considerate to the staff regarding times of operations and visiting hours and was disrespectful to the matron.

Nurse Mosey’s application for leave was dealt with properly.

The hospital has always been available for patients.

There are at least 35 beds available.

The Board has no reason to doubt the evidence of Nurse Fuss that she received no orders for preparations to be made for an operation on a patient named Rogers.

[Nurse Fuss was B.M. Fuss.]

General Conclusions

The Hospital Board and nursing staff have done their duty under difficult circumstances: ‘had it not been for certain actions of Dr Ashton, the circumstances which necessitated the holding of this enquiry could not have arisen.

The trouble has originated and came to a crisis in connection with.

admission of patients

attendance of Medical Officers at Board Meetings

the Board’s desire, conveyed to Dr Ashton re giving orders

hours of Medical Officers’ visits

arrangements regarding operations

The hospital was established as a public hospital for the purpose of

treating the sick poor
