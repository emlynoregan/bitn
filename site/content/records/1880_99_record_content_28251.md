Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School held its anniversary last Sunday.  Rev. W.H. Hodge preached in the morning and evening with a service of song in the afternoon for which Rev. H.T. Burgess did the connective readings.  At the public meeting on Monday Captain Paull, who is in town on a visit, took the chair.  He is a former superintendent of the Sunday school.  There has been a decrease in numbers through removals.  Rev. Hodge was welcomed to the circuit and Rev. Burgess gave an address on the ‘Relation of Children to the Church’.
