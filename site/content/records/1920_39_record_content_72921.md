Rev. D.L. Redding has accepted an offer to take charge at Clare and will leave Burra on 1 January 1939 after five years here.  He has been very popular and has built up attendance especially of the young and has similarly affected the other parish churches at Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett and Black Springs.  In financial matters fetes were successfully replaced with direct giving and a day of prayer.  The financial position of the church has been placed in a sounder position.  The popularity of young people’s socials each fortnight has not waned.  His role with the RSL will be greatly missed, as will his interest in sport.  He has also been a great supporter of the Church of England Day School and in early days at Mongolata went out every week for a short service and community sing at Carpenter’s Café.  Also for a period he was secretary of the local High School.
