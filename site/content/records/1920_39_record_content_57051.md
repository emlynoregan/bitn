Accident.  On Thursday evening a car driven by Mr G.H. Dow, Secretary of the Burra Hospital, collided with a big Hudson containing six shearers, in front of the Maternity Wing of the Hospital.  The Hudson was seen to be being driven erratically and on the wrong side of the road.  Even pulling far to the left Mr Dow could not avoid the collision.  The cause seems to have been a heated argument between the driver of the Hudson (who was sober) and one of the men in the back seat.  No one was injured and as the speed of both cars was not great, damage to the vehicles was not severe.
