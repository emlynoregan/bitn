The Minister’s answer was not very precise.  In summary: probably not.

Would the Government put down a bore for water?

Mr I.J. Warnes said a bore nearby found a fair supply of water.

The Minister said he would have to look at the lease to see if they could take timber from it.

Some tools were available, but would have to be signed for and returned if not in use.

As for rations: in some districts arrangements were made for one individual to collect for all on the field and this should not be a problem.

The party then went to Mr Barker’s show where men had driven a tunnel 120ft into the hill, but so far were only finding traces.

Mr Rampton’s claim was on the same seam as Mr Byles’.  Three men were taking out about ½ ton a week, but after expenses they were in debt.

Terry’s shaft is down 20ft following the lode, but the seam appeared to be dragging.

At Burns & Motherall’s the tunnel is 80ft long.
