Burra Racing Club AGM was held at the Liberal Union Rooms on Friday last and reported a very successful meeting on 17 January 1914.  £276 had been spent on improvements and money in the bank was now just £0-7-4.  Robert McBride had sunk a well for them for ample water.  C.B. Warnes timbered the same.  A.J. McBride supplied a windmill and tank.  John Berryman helped with pipes and laying them.  The next meeting will be on 16 January 1915 with half the profits to go to the Belgian Relief Fund.
