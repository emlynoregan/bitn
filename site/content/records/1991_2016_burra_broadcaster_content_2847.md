Harry Quinn is this year’s Australia Day Citizen of the Year.  He came to the Booborowie district in about 1950 after flying as a wireless operator in the RAAF in WWII.  He has given dedicated service to the local community ever since.  As a Board Member of the Burra Hospital for 32 years, including ten years as Chairman, Harry hardly missed a meeting.  He strove to maintain services and upgrade the building and facilities.  He represented the hospital on various committees and health related associations.  He also served as councillor for Booborowie on the Burra Burra DC for 16 years from 1959 to 1975.  He was a foundation member of the Booborowie Bowling Club in 1954, President 1968-75 and again 1992-3 and a member of the Booborowie Tennis Club 1950-65.  He served on the Booborowie Hall Committee 1956-79 and was president 1965-67 and was a member of the Booborowie School Council 1957-77.  He has been involved with the Catholic Church Council since 1966 and with the Booborowie RSL Sub-branch from 1954 to its closure in 1982; 11 years as Secretary, 3 as President and 4 as Vice-President.  He has travelled many thousands of kilometres and spent thousands of hours in community service over the years.
