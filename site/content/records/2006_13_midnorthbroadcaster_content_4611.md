The Ulysses Club, an over 40s motor cycle club, held a successful weekend in Burra last October.  Twelve members returned recently to hand cheques worth $800 each to the Burra Hospital Auxiliary and to the Senior Citizensâ€™ Group and Meals on Wheels.  About 350 Ulysses members had been to Burra for the weekend trip in October.  The club began in the early 1980s as a social club for people with an interest in motorcycles and they try to donate money to charities and local organisations as often as possible.  The club annually donates about $100,000 to their own Ulysses Club Arthritis Research Fund and they voted on which Burra groups should benefit.
