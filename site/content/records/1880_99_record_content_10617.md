Redruth Court, 12 September

Thomas Harvey sought to eject Ann Williams from allotment 45, Aberdeen.  Williams claimed title by adverse possession and the court upheld her claim, subject to Supreme Court opinion - to be sought within a month if at all.

There is a fairly detailed report of a breach of promise suit of Elizabeth Geach v. Frederick Jones.  The court awarded Geach Â£150.
