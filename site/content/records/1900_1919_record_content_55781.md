On Monday a trip in two motorboats was organised.  After dinner the girls played at a football match until it was time to catch the train home.  On the way they played at Crystal Brook Station for the large crowd assembled there.  They reached Peterborough at 11.10 and then had to wait for the Broken Hill Express â€“ in the interval they were shunted up and down every line in the yard.  The express arrived at 3.40 a.m. and Burra was reached at 6 a.m.
