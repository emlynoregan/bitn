Obituary.  William Thomas Rabbich died at Westmere WA recently aged 77.  Until 1896 he was engaged in farming and butchering at Burra with his late father Mr W. Rabbich and his brothers Harry & Maurice.  He was also involved in Municipal affairs and was Mayor.  [North Ward Councillor December 1892-November 1893 and December 1888- November 1892.  Mayor December 1893-November 1893 and North Ward Councillor December 1894-November 1896.]  He then went to Boulder WA where he bought land and was elected to the first Boulder Municipal Council and was Mayor for three years in the town’s heyday.  In 1906 he purchased land in the Williams District and lived there where he was a member of the local Road Board for years and also its chairman.  He made several unsuccessful attempts to enter the WA Parliament.  He was a staunch churchman, kind and charitable.  ‘Burra’ was his political and municipal nickname.  He visited Burra a few years ago.
