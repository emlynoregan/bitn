Burra Co. MI.  Major-General Downes inspected the Burra Mounted Rifles last Wednesday, with Lieut. McCullum from Gawler.  After Brigadier-Major Stuart had inspected arms and accoutrements there were drills and a mock attack.  The General complimented the Company on its performance.

The Military Ball on Wednesday night was a great success.  Dancing began at 9 o’clock with a polonaise polka followed by 23 other dances.  Sentaro’s Canary String Band from Adelaide provided the music at a great cost, but the result was first class music.  About 50 couples danced at any one time.  Lieut. J.A. Watt was MC.  The hall was well decorated with flags etc.  The General & Major Stuart were received at 10.40 p.m.  Supper was taken at midnight after which dancing continued till c. 3.30 a.m.
