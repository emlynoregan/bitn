The previous Treasurer was accused of wilfully misleading the House by submitting insufficient estimates of expenditure etc.  Without new taxation the colony would end the year down £593,000.  The Government therefore proposed a ½d in the £ land tax and an income tax of 3d in the £ on incomes over £300 and of 6d in the £ on incomes derived from investments.
