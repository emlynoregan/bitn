'Back to Burra': Tuesday

Charabancs took visitors to places of interest.  These included the miners’ huts, the cemetery, the Burra Mine, the Reformatory, Copperhouse and Flagstaff Hill.  In the afternoon many went to the show and in the evening the social at the Redruth Memorial Hall was popular, while at Kooringa there was a popular concert at the Institute preceded by Murison’s Jazz Orchestra and the program comprised part songs by the Aber-Koori Minstrels and other soloists.
