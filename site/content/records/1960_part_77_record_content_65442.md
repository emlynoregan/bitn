Burra Mine – Samin Ltd.

E.C. Allen MP asked the Premier, Mr Dunstan, about the possible effects on ground water levels of the second stage operations of Samin Ltd at Burra.  This is estimated to pump 1½ million gallons of water a day from the mine to keep water levels below operating levels.  Landowners would like to see it replaced underground if possible.

Mr Allen asked if the water level at the Bon Accord shaft was falling – it being the present source of water for the mine’s operation.

Mr Bakewell, secretary to the Minister of development and Mines, advises that a survey of bores within 8 km is being undertaken so that drawdown can be determined during a test later in the year.  It is believed unlikely bores further away will be affected.  Of the 91 bores located, 22 are not in use, 8 provide domestic supplies, 59 are for stock and 2 are for irrigation.  The mine is expected to have a relatively short life and the artificial recharge of the aquifers is not considered to be beneficial.  No significant fall in the level of water at the Bon Accord shaft has been noted.  The level in the open cut has fallen about 12 inches in the summer and this is considered normal.
