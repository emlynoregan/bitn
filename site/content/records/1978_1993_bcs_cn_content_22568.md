John Michael Oates

Aged 34 and married with two children.  Third generation of a family living on a pastoral property 28 km east of Burra.  Have been involved in Tennis, Golf and Pistol Clubs over the years and a committee member of the Burra Picnic Race Club.  Councillor for the past four years and sat on a number of committees.  If re-elected my priorities are:

1.  Continuing the upgrading of rural roads.

2.  Upgrading the streets of the four towns.

3.  Supporting small business in the district.

4.  Helping to steer the district and community through the present tough times with minimal cost.
