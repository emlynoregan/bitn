Editorial on the Prorogation of the SA Parliament.

2nd Leader on the Water tanks and wind pump for Market Square and the possibility of a general water supply - but fearful of the high cost of the latter based on figures from Gawler, which were outrageously high.

The Aurora Australis was brilliant on Monday night.

Sir W.D. Jervois, Governor of SA, leaves shortly to become Governor of New Zealand.

Rev Father Peters lecture, Temperance, was well attended.

SAMA stated in its half-yearly report that the Burra Mine was likely to be advantageously disposed of shortly.
