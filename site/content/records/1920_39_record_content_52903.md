Mongolata Goldfield

Some quiet developments recently have seen pegs appear as far down as the turn-off on the Broken Hill Road some six miles from Byles’ Mongolata properties and several new claims we believe to have been pegged on the western side of the range.  Swift development may take shape at any time.

We have seen the rich piece of ore recently obtained from the Takati Claim; it looks like an ordinary block of building stone.

At Mongolata several little homes have recently been erected and the ‘town’ is gradually growing.
