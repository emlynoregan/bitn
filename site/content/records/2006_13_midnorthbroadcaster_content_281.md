Burra National Trust has plans to streamline management and has set up a maintenance committee.  The stonework repairs needed at Redruth Gaol and the Unicorn Brewery Cellars are to be assessed.  Plans also include the installation of soundscapes at the Bon Accord Museum and the erection of a shelter to protect artefacts from the weather.  Reports on the replacement of the large beams at Morphett’s Enginehouse have been received.
