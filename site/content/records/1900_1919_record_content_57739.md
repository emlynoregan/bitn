The Mayor’s Report for 1918.

The season’s prospects for farmers locally are fair and the pastoral industry is doing well.  The stoppage of the Great European War after more than four years has been the occasion of great rejoicing.  People of Burra have responded most heartily to all patriotic calls during the war and especially over the last 12 months.

The Seaside Trip was held on 23 February and over 1,100 availed themselves of the trip to Semaphore.  Two trains were provided and the whole day was a great success.

The Burra Branch of the League of Loyal Women was established at a meeting on 29 January as a result of urgent calls for assistance in the Trench Comforts Fund.  Mrs W.G. Hawkes was elected President with Miss D.L. Hawkes as Secretary and Mrs T. Ashton as Treasurer.  Since 19 July they have operated a Luncheon & Tea-room at the Cheer-up Rooms in Kooringa, which has been largely patronised and a great source of funds.

Children’s Patriotic Demonstration

A major demonstration was held by the children of the Burra School on 13 April in aid of Red Cross.  The Boy Scouts, Soldiers’ Aid Soc. & Returned Soldiers all assisted and about £130 was raised.  During 1918 the contributions of scholars to the Children’s Patriotic Fund have been:

Primary School	£226-5-10½

High school	£26-0-3

War Certificates

Primary School	£80-10-0

High School	£26-2-6

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band

This has been fully occupied with patriotic work.  As well as assisting at all local patriotic efforts they have on several occasions assisted at efforts in Adelaide.  They have also visited several country towns.  They have attended the railway station to welcome home every returning boy.  They have also collected large sums of money for the cause.

Violet Day

This was celebrated on 24 June in excellent weather and a monster procession headed by the Ladies’ band went from the railway station to Kooringa where the usual speeches were given.  A bunch of violets was sold for £250 under the Bugler system.  The usual stalls etc. operated and there was a concert in the evening by the Adelaide Curlew Concert Party.  Proceeds amounted to c. £550.  At the service in Market Square over 100 wreaths were hung by relatives and friends around the rotunda and Brigadier-General Forsayth delivered a most eloquent speech.

Red Triangle Day

Sunday 12 May saw the visit of Mr Virgo, Empire Secretary of the YMCA who gave a lecture at the Institute on the work of the society.  £330 was raised to keep its activities going.  Red triangle Day on Friday 31 May again had fine weather and stalls were erected.  Returned Soldiers’ Concert Party entertained the crowd and the Ladies’ band attended.  A silk flag was auctioned for £70 under the Bugler system.  The Ladies’ band took a prominent part in the evening concert and the day raised in all c. £700.

Boy Scouts

This important organisation for the boys has long felt the need of a drill hall of its own or a room for their meetings.  On Saturday 28 September a crowd gathered in Market Square and marched to Aberdeen to take part in the laying of the foundation stone for the new building.  The stone was laid by the Mayor and donations of £60 were laid on the stone and £8 came from afternoon tea.  Membership has risen from 18 to 42 in three years.

Anniversary of the War

This was held on 10 August; again in perfect weather.  Large crowds gathered in Market Square and the town was extensively decorated.  The usual sort of procession led by the Ladies’ band took place with a Queen competition, stalls, Cheap Jack etc.  Colonel S. Price Weir DSO addressed the gathering.  The auction of a gold button under the Bugler system realised £273-14-0.  The Institute was crowded for a magnificent film show at night and in all the total proceeds were c. £1,438.
