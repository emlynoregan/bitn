Burra Rifle Club.  Four possibles were scored on Saturday.  Captain Field achieved one at 600 yards and then Bert Scholz.  R. Bernhardt and Bert Scholz scores possibles at 700 yards.  [Check this: it seems strange that Scholz was still not one of the best with handicap.]  Best score off the rifle was E.C .Hopkins while with handicap the top scores were from M. Kakoschke, E.C. Hopkins & D.H. Field.
