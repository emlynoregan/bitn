Shell Co. Dance on 29 August was a great success.  Burra Electric Supply Co. installed lighting free.  Music was broadcast over 5AD and 3UZ, but it proved impossible to receive it in Burra and Mrs George Hann and her three sons provided the music.  The use of the SAFU rooms was given free.  The decorations were well done.
