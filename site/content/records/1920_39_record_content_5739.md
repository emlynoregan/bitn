Burra Town Council

There was a discussion re the Fire Brigade with the Mayor strongly in favour of action and Cr Radford and Cr Treloar concerned about the water supply.

Ct Harris moved the town be brought under the Fire Brigade Act.  Cr Ewins seconded.

Cr Treloar moved the question of assured water supply be settled first.  Not seconded.

Cr Harris’s motion was carried.

Retirement of Councillors in December: the Mayor and Councillors Radford, Treloar & Kellaway.  The mayor said he would not stand again but for the Soldiers’ Memorial and he would give an indication of his intentions at the next meeting.

There was considerable discussion about a post and drain in Drew Lane and whose responsibility it was and who would be responsible for public liability and whether Drew Lane was a private or Council road.

The Town Clerk was directed to ascertain Council’s responsibilities and liabilities.

Cr Radford moved an electric light be placed in the new telephone box in Aberdeen.  Carried.

A letter of condolence will be sent to Mrs McBride.
