Burra Town Council.

Retiring officers are: Mayor	E.W. Crewes

North Ward	E. Cox

East Ward	M. Pederson

West Ward	W.C.L. West

Auditor	T.T. Shortridge

A letter to be sent to the Commissioner of Crown Lands re repairs to the Commercial St Bridge which is in a dangerous condition.

A large petition complains of the removal of a portion of the loading wharf at the railway station which has created great inconvenience.  The Railway Dept. is asked to restore the same.  It was decided to refer the petition to the Hon. J.J. Duncan to bring the matter to the attention of the Railway Dept.

There has been some vandalism by boys at the cemetery with broken glass and the destruction of plants.
