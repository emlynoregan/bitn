Editorial on SA Politics.

A comment on the present state of SA politics in which the editor believed the Government to be weak and ineffective and was failing to implement its policies.  He felt that the emergence of the Federal Government had set back state politics for years.  [Presumably by siphoning off able men like Holder.]  He also thought that payment of MPs had been a bad move.
