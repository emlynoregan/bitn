Letter from ‘A Labouring Man’

It is commonly said that in SA labour is scarce and overpaid.  I shall demonstrate that it is not too highly remunerated.  A Member of the Legislative Council has said that if workingmen’s wages were increased it would lead to drunkenness and immorality.  In SA mines, the agricultural trade, sheep farming etc. are yielding great profits.  Labour is the capital of the working man.  Let us see how that capital is being remunerated.  The rate of wages is £1 to £1-2-0 per week.  Allow a man and wife with three children (about the average). Let us see what his necessary costs are.

Rent of a cottage	3-6

½ load of water	1-0

Wood	1-0

Oil	3

1¼ lb soap	6

½ lb tea	1-0

3 lb sugar	9

1 pint milk/day	1-2

1 lb butter	3

Bread 5 lb/day	5-3

Vegetables	1-2

Meat 18 lb @ 3½d lb	5-3

£1-1-11

I am confident these cost will bear scrutiny.  Surely the poor man should have sufficient in excess of these necessities as would clothe him and his family and give some little education to his children.  He cannot do this at the present rate of wages.  There are calls for the richer population to fund charity education.  Can the labourer be being paid too well when his children must be educated by charity?  Under these circumstances it is too bad to be mocked by men in the Legislative Council and to be told by the press of the dearth and scarcity of labour, but not a word about the high cost of rents nor the high price of fuel and every article of consumption.  During the past two year the cost of items which benefit the capitalist have increased by 100 to 150%, while wages have risen 10 to 15%, showing at what ratio the working man participates in the prosperity of the colony.
