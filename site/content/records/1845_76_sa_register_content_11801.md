Kooringa News, 27 July

Rain has fallen plentifully for the past eight days rendering the township a mass of mud and stopping most transport.  Foot traffic is almost impossible and but few drays are venturing forth.  It has also been bitterly cold, keeping most people indoors and presenting a miserable aspect to visitors, such as the two gentlemen from Mr Gregory’s overland party, who visited last Sunday.

[Gregory’s party had come south from Queensland along the Strzelecki Creek in search of the missing explorer, Ludwig Leichhardt, passing along the eastern edge of Lake Blanche and the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges.]

The township of Warrapoota was offered for sale at the Burra Hotel last Thursday in blocks of one, two, three and five acres, but there were no purchasers.  It was offered again on Saturday with a similar result.  There is much land on offer at present, viz., Millerton, Clonmel, Copperhouse, Hampton, Roach Town, Nelson, Yarwood and Warrapoota; beside land in the townships of Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen.

[Note that of these, the locations of Clonmel and Warrapoota are unknown.]

A meeting of the creditors of Messrs Liston & McFarlane, tanners and curriers, was held at the Burra Hotel on Saturday.  A committee was appointed to go into their affairs and report on Monday.  This found their assets exceeded their liabilities by about £300.  Whether they are forced into bankruptcy will largely depend on creditors in the city.  It is to be hoped they are not hard pressed as they are hard-working men and have recently made improvements that have cost more than they would now get back.

A kangaroo hunt was held last week by a group of locals with others from Clare and Adelaide.  They set out on Tuesday for the scrub and camped out that night.  On Wednesday they scored seven kangaroos.
