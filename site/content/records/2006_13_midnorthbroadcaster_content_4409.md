Maddy Angel has been a Year 12 Art student at BCS this year.  A display of her vibrant work is currently part of an exhibit at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  Two of her works have been selected as part of the 2008 SSABSA Art Show to be held in Adelaide.  Much of her focus has been on portraits of friends and herself.  Next year she will move to Tanunda with her family, where she will undertake a three-month bar management course at TAFE, after which she intends to travel overseas.  [2 photos.]
