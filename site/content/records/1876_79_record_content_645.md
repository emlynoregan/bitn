Burra Institute

We suggest handrails be added to the front steps to prevent accidents.  A lady missed her footing and fell down several steps on Tuesday.

Parliamentary Club.  On Monday the quorum was reduced from 13 to 10.

Rev. D. O’Donnell of Clare will lecture in the Institute tomorrow night on Temperance and on Monday night on Tom Hood: His Life, Character and Works.

Burra Institute.  An amateur entertainment on Tuesday last drew about 150 people.  It raised money for the prize fund of the public school.  [The program is printed.]
