Accidents.  Jacob Jansen was driving in from Baldina and when his companion got out near Abberton Park apparently couldn’t control the horse alone.  He ended up in a creek near Mr Cave’s house.  The trap was smashed and Jansen broke several ribs and has punctured a lung.  He has since rallied slightly, but remains in a critical condition.

On Wednesday two men employed by Hill & Co. collided while riding at Paratoo, both fell heavily, one was injured slightly, the other was taken to Terowie and thence by train to Burra Hospital, having been rendered insensible.  His position is regarded as hopeless.
