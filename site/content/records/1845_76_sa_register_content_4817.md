Rev. James Pollitt charged that John S. Maling, carpenter, had attempted to remove some shingles, the property of the complainant and also with an assault.

The defendant had contracted to do some work on the parsonage at Redruth, but had then refused to go on with the contract.  On Monday he had attempted to remove some bundles of shingles that had not been used.  He refused to desist when asked and had forced the bindle against Pollitt’s knuckles, removing some skin.  Pollitt’s servant had come out and Maling then went away.

James Edward Woodforde corroborated the above and said the defendant also was very abusive.

John Seymore corroborated the evidence of the preceding witness.

Defendant claimed the shingles were his property; part of 16,000 for which he had paid.

Complainant said he could produce the bill to satisfy His Worship they were his.

His Worship said ownership of the shingles was something he could not decide.  Even admitting the shingles were the property of defendant that did not give him the right to remove them by force.  He should have summonsed the complainant to show cause why he detained them.

For the assault Maling was fined 10/- with 25/- costs.
