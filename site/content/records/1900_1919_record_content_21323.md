A Bolt.  A horse with a baker’s cart attached bolted along the road between Abberton Park and Redruth on Thursday and the Misses Killicoat and Miss Cave along with young Lloyd Builder had a lucky escape from colliding with it, due to some good driving by Miss C. Killicoat.  Bread was widely scattered, but little damage beyond a broken wheel to the cart.
