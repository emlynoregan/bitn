Weather.  Clouds built up on Monday last week and on Tuesday rain set in from the east and continued all day.  In the east it continued on Wednesday, though it stopped in Burra.   At 4 p.m. word came through that Wandillah had recorded 170 points in an hour and the creek came down 15ft deep.  In all they got 2½”.  At Baldina 116points fell and Deep Creek came down 200 yards wide.  At E. Rooke’s the flood was a memorable sight after a fall of 275 points.  Norman Farm, like the other properties lost fences and fallow land.  At Stone Chimney Creek the dam filled for the first time since Herbert Morgan bought the property.  Mongolata got 1” in five minutes and 3” in two days.  Poonunda recorded 232 points and Baldina Creek there flowed a banker.  The Deep Creek and Baldina fords suffered £100-£150 damages.  Thistlebeds got 3”.  Further to the east falls were steadier, but still 1½ to 2” on such stations as Kia-Ora, Murkaby, Braemar & Faraway.  Some watercourses flooded.  From the top of Dare’s Hill a flood a mile wide could be seen.  Ulooloo Creek ripped out fencing at Mallett while Ketchowla recorded 132 points without damage.  Pine Creek got 170 points, but Mulga Hill recorded 373 and it was similar at Pandappa.  I.J. Warnes at Sturt Vale and Warnes’ Lagoon received good rains on the 19th and feed is already showing.  Oakbank and Quondong recorded over 2” and 3” falls were common in the Mt Bryan and Mt Bryan East areas.  Falls to the south were less.  ‘The Gums’ got just 61 points, Balah 56, L.M. Gordon at World’s End 75-80.  Tom Heinrich at Dutton’s Cross recorded over 2” and E. Phillips of World’s End had 180 points in three showers, while Mr Duell did not get enough for run-off into his dam.  Koo-owie and The Gap got about 160 points, Springbank c. 60 and Burra 82.  Generally the best rains to the east since 1913.
