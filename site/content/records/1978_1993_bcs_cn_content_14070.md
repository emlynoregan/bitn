Born Rotorua New Zealand.  Schooled mostly in Australia.  BSc in Fiji and Dip. Ed. From Adelaide.  Appointed to Tintinara Area School.  Met and married a local farmer, Greg, and we have two sons, Michael (7) and Andrew (3).  Moved to Penshurst in SW Victoria where I resumed teaching at Hamilton H.S.  In 1986 returned to SA and I had two contracts at Murray Bridge H.S. before being offered a permanent position at BCS.  Greg works for Collinsville and we live at Booborowie.  Both of us are keenly interested in sports.
