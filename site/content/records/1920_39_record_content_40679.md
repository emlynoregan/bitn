Mongolata Mines

Flaherty, Bevan, Morgan & McRostie’s Claim has been registered as a company under the name The Mongolata Block 8 Gold Mining Co. NL.  The directors will act in an honorary capacity for 12 months until the mine is on a paying basis.  The property is c. 16 miles from Burra.  There will be 200 £5-shares.  The gold in this claim is quite invisible.  The gold-bearing leader is 6-8” wide.

Mongolata No. 8 has produced at the rate of 5-6oz per ton and gold is at c. £7 per oz.

At Byles’ a lode of low grade, but payable ore has been struck about 7ft wide and 6ft deep.  About 300ft of tunnelling has been done.

Rampton & Clarke have found a very rich seam, but only 4” wide.  It is estimated at 15-20oz per ton.

Permission to get rainwater from the old Reformatory has been obtained, as this supply is not being used.  The Commissioner of Public Works is to visit next week concerning a water supply.
