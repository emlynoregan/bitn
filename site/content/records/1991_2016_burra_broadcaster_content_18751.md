SA Ambulance Recruitment Drive

Profile of Garry & Jenny Gebhardt (by Jenny)

We were married in 1988 and have three children, Kirsty (10), Justin (9) and Jason (3).  Garry works in Clare as store manager for McLeod’s Tyres.  Our interests include cooking, boating, gardening and camping.  Garry was born and raised in Burra and I was born in Clare and spent most of my life in Yacka.  We moved back to Burra in 1995.  We joined the Ambulance Service in 1997 and find that as a couple it works well, being able to cover each other’s roster if necessary and the other is able to look after the children.  Garry is able to work one or two days a week for the Clare Ambulance Service, who are also stretched for their daytime roster.  It has given both of us the confidence to deal with situations where once we would not have known what to do.
