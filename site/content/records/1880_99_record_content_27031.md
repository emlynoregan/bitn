Cr Pearce considered that Mr Bartle had placed himself in a very suspicious position by going away and by offering to pay back £2 when he must have known he had a large sum in his possession.

Cr Davis thought he could easily mislead ratepayers by giving false receipts.

The books, receipts and meters will be inspected.

The Mayor suggested testing water from Mother Gilbert’s Well and the Market Square Well because the Waterworks lease was coming up for renewal soon.

Mr Simpson said tests some time ago showed Mother Gilbert’s Well was not strong enough and Cr Pearce said he did not think the Market Square Well had sufficient water for the town either.

The mayor assured Mr Pinch that the Government had said it would take the water if it were suitable.

Cr Pearce said a special meeting of Council had suspended Mr Bartle and he moved that Mr Simpson continue in charge until an officer is appointed.  Carried.

The meeting was deemed ‘special’.
