St Mary’s Sunday School held its annual gathering last Wednesday for a 6 p.m. tea followed by a concert, after which prizes were distributed.  Rev. S.J. Bloyd appealed for parents to take more interest in the school’s activities.  Mrs C. Fuss, Misses Vera & Doris Fuss, Miss Carey and himself were glad their efforts were appreciated, but he hoped both for more students and for more mothers and daughters capable of teaching to come forward.
