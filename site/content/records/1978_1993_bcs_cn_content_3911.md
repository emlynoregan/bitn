Burra Burra DC had a win when David Wotton, the Environment Minister visited for the Local Government Conference.  Paxton Square has received $66,000 from the Federal Government and the Tourist Bureau.  Mr Wotton was reminded that his Department was holding things up by ‘sitting on’ a similar contribution.  Apparently over $250,000 is earmarked for the project due to commence later this year.
