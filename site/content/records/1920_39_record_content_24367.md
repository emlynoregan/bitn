Show Smoke Social

The President Mr I.J. Warnes entertained the committee, stewards, judges and visitors at the Show Luncheon Room on Friday night.  This was the first such gathering in the show’s history.

In proposing the toast to ‘The Government’ Mr A.B. Riggs raised the question of the town name.  Burra was on the maps, but in the telephone book or the postal guide it was nowhere – in either you found Aberdeen and Kooringa.  He thought the official names now in use should be eliminated and the post offices be called North and South Burra.

Other speakers were Mr R.J. Carter MP for the district, Hon G.F. Jenkins MP & Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hon. George Ritchie MLC, Hon. W. Morrow MLC, Mr I.J. Warnes, Mr M.A. Radford, Mr P.J. Pickering, Hon. W.G. Mills MLC, Mr J.E. Pick, Mr S.H. Robinson & Mr E.F. Marston.  The report extends for 3¾ columns.
