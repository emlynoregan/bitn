Redruth Court, Monday.

Thistle cases continue.

L.W. Gebhardt said he had cleared 4,000 of about 8,000 acres and had striven to comply with the Act and believed he had done so.  Case dismissed.

A.G. Gebhardt was fined £2 + costs for a similar case.

Mr H. Bowman’s case was dismissed, as he was not the occupier of the land cited.
