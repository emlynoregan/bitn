Column by ‘Fossicker’

The Town Council has spent diverse sums on tar paving experiments, but so far without success.  The recent trial near the National Bank still needs attention.  It is useless to proceed unless it is done by those who understand it.

The Legislative Council is delaying in the matter of household suffrage.

Consideration of the Mt Horrocks water scheme seems very drawn out.

The Friendly Societies’ Sports Committee are very perplexed about where to hold the meeting.  Victoria Park is in such a poor state.  The council should spend some money here, and not let it become a white elephant.

Cricket.  Burra 134, Mt Bryan 3 for 61 when stumps were drawn.

Scratch match at Victoria Park on Wednesday

Goodwin’s 48 & 88 (136) defeated Davey’s 37 & 49 (86)

‘G.C.’ & ‘Go Alone’ reply briefly to Brummitt on Methodist Union.

Rev. J. Homann will conduct two services in the old German Chapel in Redruth on Sunday 5 November.  In the morning in German and in the evening in English.

Burra Defence Rifle Club.  Half-yearly meeting shows a credit balance of £7-7-9 in the bank plus £1-1-11 cash.  Winner of the last match was A. Millet.
