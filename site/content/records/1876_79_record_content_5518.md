Letter to Editor from Rev. R.W. Campbell defending himself against the charges brought against him by Mr Lipsett â€” he admits a few days ago to bringing Mr Lipsett before the church on a charge that was fully sustained. The church court then asked the defendant to resign and on his doing so the charge was withdrawn.
