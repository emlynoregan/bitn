Local Board of Health

The general sanitary conditions in the town have been satisfactory.  There were several infectious cases throughout the year.  Despite some heavy legal costs of £45-11-2 over the Lawn & Co. case we started the year £48-16-8 in credit and ended in credit £13-4-11.

The Medical Officer reported 11 cases of scarlatina and 3 cases of diphtheria.  Mouse-plague of favus was prevalent last summer.  [A fungal infection: a form of ringworm.]
