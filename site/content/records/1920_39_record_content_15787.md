Boxing.  At Kooringa Institute 28 April, for a sum of £50 in the main match, Murray beat Seal on points.

The first match was Ritchie v. Kennedy, but the result is not printed.

In the second match Les Pavey defeated P. McLellan.

The fight arranged between A.J. McLellan and Lauritsen was postponed due to the illness of the latter.

The Women’s Christian Temperance Union continues to meet monthly.

Archie Williams who has been promoting the local boxing contests was born in Redruth 53 years ago and educated at Burra.  His parents kept the Bushman’s Home as a boarding house when bullock teams plied between Burra and Broken Hill.  He has always been interested in boxing and took an active part when young.  Later he trained and managed boxers and before enlisting in the AIF he was manager of Cessnock Stadium in NSW and in 1922 was manager and referee at Shepparton Stadium in Victoria.
