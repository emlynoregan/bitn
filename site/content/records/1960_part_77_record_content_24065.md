National Trust

Mr Andrew Tennant has donated Dower’s shop in Market Square to the Trust.  There is also a donation of £50 towards renovations.  The building is of solid stone.  It will be used as a museum.  The old jinker from the mine has been housed on a site adjacent to the building.  The housing for the jinker consists of roofing only and was subsidised by the Tourist Bureau.
