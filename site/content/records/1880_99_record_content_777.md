Burra Town Council.  5 April

The Mayor reports that trees have been offered by Mr Ullmann and Rev. Father Kriesll.

The Mayor has received the deed of conveyance for the cemetery.

It was resolved to sell the £100 bond held by the cemetery and to devote the proceeds to the cemetery and the road leading to it.

Work to the value of £10-10-0 is to be done to the Ayers Street Bridge by Mr Phillips.

Other bodies are to be approached to lobby the railways to allow passengers to travel by goods train - a second-class carriage being attached.
