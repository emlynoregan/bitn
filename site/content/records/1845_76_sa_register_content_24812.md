Port Waratah Smelting Works.  There is a lengthy report on this NSW development.

Nearly all the ore smelted at these works comes from SA mines, where their richer ores are smelted by coal brought from Newcastle.

‘In order to economise fuel, and at the same time reduce the cost of carriage, The SA Copper Mining Company has opened these smelting works at Port Waratah for the purpose of smelting the inferior ores here, where coal is abundant and consequently cheap.’

The ores sent from SA largely took the place of ballast that would otherwise have had to be loaded and unloaded for the return journey when coal was sent to SA for smelting the richer ores.

[The rest of the article suggests that this arrangement applied to the Wallaroo smelting works and therefore the Yorke Peninsula mines.  Burra ores are not specifically mentioned.]
