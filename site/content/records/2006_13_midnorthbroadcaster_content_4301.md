Wind Farm.  The recently announced wind farm at Hallett Hill will create c. 150 new jobs during the construction phase.  34 turbines will generate 71 megawatts.

[The figure 34 does not accord with the 71 mentioned in the announcement in the previous issue.  There seems to be a confusion between turbines and megawatts.  The following extract from Wikipedia clarifies the position:

‘Hallett Hill Wind Farm, also known as Hallett 2 Wind Farm, was completed in late 2009.  It consists of 34 Suzlon turbines each 2.1 MW, giving and installed capacity of 71.4 MW.  Up to March 2011 it was averaging a capacity factor of 39%.’]
