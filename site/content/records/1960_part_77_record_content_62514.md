Local Government in Burra.  Researched by Ian Auhl.

From an article in the Register 11 May 1872.

A pleasing sign of improvement in Kooringa is that the Burra Mining Co. is beginning to repair its numerous cottages, and make little additions to roads and footpaths.  The town has been in their hands for more than twenty years and signs of the amount spent on it by the landlords, who are supposed to have drawn rent from every house until recently, are few and far between.  The tenants have been equally indifferent to appearances and as a result Kooringa has been shabby and many of its houses, if such they can be called, are among the most squalid in the British Empire.

In the main street one sees business places paintless and with stucco off their fronts, a stable roof held on by stones to prevent it blowing away, signboards unreadable owing to the latest coat sweating off and old lettering showing through.  A blacksmith’s wooden shop that has not stood upright in the last ten years and the words ‘Letterbox’ visible on a house that was used as a Post Office 22 years ago.  With all this, a stranger is surprised to learn the tradesmen are well to do.  There are a few exceptions and of late considerable improvement has taken place in a few instances.  One large drapery firm has put in new windows and repainted its front.  Other houses of business have undergone a little repair and last week the Mining Co. began covering their row of cottages in Market Square with iron and renovating the police cottage walls.

With this and Mr Banks’ new assembly room and his public house undergoing outside improvements the square would present a decent improvement if the ginger beer factory had a new face.  But a stroll among houses at the back of the commercial quarter has a depressing effect.  Ruins present themselves everywhere.  There are cottages without doors and windows and the roofs are often dilapidated.  Company houses have daubed and dirty walls and paint is either unknown or ancient.  The Wesleyan Mission House and Chapel are surrounded by a substantial stone wall.  St Mary’s Church has recently been thoroughly repainted inside and out, as has the Bible Christian Chapel and a few residences of the tradesmen, but in other directions all is in desolation.

The company has begun removing a few old walls and filling in the little creeks on the roadways with old mortar and plaster and is making a kind of road from the paddock towards the cemetery.  It is to be hoped more refurbishment will go on and that Kooringa, on entering upon a new career of prosperity, will ‘be relieved from the disgrace of being styled, as it has been, the shabbiest town in the Australias.’

From an article in the Register 2 July 1872.

The District Council movement has died again.

The first agitators, disgusted with the conduct of some others, have stopped their efforts.

This is to be lamented because local government would greatly improve the town.  Goats and pigs roam at ease in the streets, much to the annoyance of people who have formed gardens.  The roads are miserable.

A meeting has been held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms in Kooringa to consider the desirability of forming a District Council.  Perhaps in no part of South Australia are the roads outside an important town in such a deplorable state as these.  Before the land became settled and fenced, traffic could generally be carried on by travellers striking out on fresh tracks when the old ones became too cut up.  Now fences preclude such a course and a Council for the repair of highways is imperative.

Captain Killicoat JP presided over a meeting of about 30 people.  Mr A. King advocated a District Council extending north to the southern half of the Hundred of Kingston and south to the Hundred of Apoinga; an area of some 80,000 acres.  Mr J.R. Stephens proposed a Council be formed of such an area.

Mr Ridgway thought this included too much useless country and wanted the Council confined to the township.

Mr O. Harvey was in favour of the original proposition.

Mr J.R. Stephens thought the area would have to be divided into wards.

Mr Moody was glad to see such energy and action and sought to nominate Councillors and Auditors.

The district was divided into North, South, Redruth and Kooringa Wards with five Councillors; one in each of the first three wards named and two in the last.  Chosen as Councillors were:

North Ward	Mr J. Dunstan Sen.

South Ward	Mr McCullock [sic] JP

Redruth Ward	Captain Killicoat JP

Kooringa Ward	Mr J. Drew JP

Mr H. Dawson

Auditors	Messrs G.V. Goodhart JP and W.H. Rosman

Note by Ian Auhl:

It has been stated that the population of Burra in 1850 was 20,000.  This is incorrect.  The combined population of Redruth, Aberdeen and Kooringa was a little over 4,500 and 1003 men and boys were employed at the Burra Mine.  By 1861 the population of the three towns was 4,347.  The SA Mining Association then employed 1,208 men and the population of the County of Burra was 5,483 with 15,856 acres under cultivation.  By 1871 the population of the three towns had fallen to 3,401 and the cultivated area had increased to 65, 215 acres.
