Burra Town Council, 7 September

The Municipal Association poses the question whether men should work for their rations.

Cr Bevan thought they should.  There was plenty to be done and getting rations for nothing had a bad effect on the men.

The Mayor and Cr Jennison will be delegates to the Municipal Association with instruction to support work for rations.

S. Sara sought permission to erect a verandah with posts 3ft from the edge of the footpath.

The Council discussed liability issues.

Cr Jennison said he had discussed this with Mr Sara who then asked if he could carry the posts out to the kerb and he could then have a suitable balustrade.

Approval was granted for posts on the kerb with no balustrade.

Finance: West ward was slightly in credit and the other two wards were overdrawn.
