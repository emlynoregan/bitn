Burra Hospital

The annual report showed the Board managed to balance its budget for 1959-60 despite two pay rises, increasing commodity costs and a drop of 750 occupied bed days, when it was read at the meeting in Burra Town Hall on Monday 23 August.

Ratepayers contributed on the following basis:

Burra Town Council	£410

Burra Burra District Council	£1,380

Hallett District Council	£340

Robertstown District Council	£190

Chairman A.D. Radford said the fall in patient numbers meant a fall in revenue of £2,250.  Salaries and wages account for more than 50% of expenses.  The scatter of hospital buildings means more domestic staff are required.  Fees were raised in March, which will benefit the coming year.  Fluorescent lighting was installed in the Men’s and Women’s Wards, which considerably brightened up the wards and recently the hospital and Sisters’ quarters were treated for termite extermination at a cost of £150.

Lawns have been sown in front of the Wing and the Nurses and Sisters’ Home and about 30 trees planted.

[Presumably ‘Wing’ refers to the Maternity Wing.]

The Women’s Organisations have again been active and have handed over £550.  This assisted in renovations to the Sisters’ Quarters at a cost of £1,200 – for which Government subsidy has been promised.

The Hospital Auxiliary has also rendered valuable service, especially in repairing bed linen etc.

Since the close of the financial year the hospital has received a bequest of £399-15-0 from the estate of [the late Mrs Clare Ethel Gare].  This will be devoted to capital improvements and so attract a two for one subsidy.
