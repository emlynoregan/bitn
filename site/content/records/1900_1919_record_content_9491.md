Mr T.T. Shortridge went to Adelaide by train on 7 January and has not been heard of since.  His family is concerned for his welfare.  A well-known resident for many years, he has long been secretary of the AOF.  A special audit of their accounts has shown all to be in order.  Any information would be gladly received.
