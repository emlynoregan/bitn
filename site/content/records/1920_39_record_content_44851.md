Mongolata Goldfield

A.L. Walker cites a letter from Frank Treloar.

Treloar says he little thought that when Walker brought down a carload of books from the Burra Mine and when he (Treloar) got another load from the Mine Office, that they were saving the history of the mine for the state.  And it will now live in book form at the Archives.  The Directors of SAMA have also given the books they used.

James Pearse (of Jeffery Pearse’s family) and I (Treloar) went to the Archives on Monday and spent several hours wetting [sic: whetting] our curiosity.  The Mine started in a small way in 1845.  The first balance sheet in 1846 showed a primitive affair and yet they began as self-supporting and didn’t look back for many a long year.  Before smelting began the ore went as fast as bullock team could cart it to Pt Adelaide and thence to Wales for treatment.  In 1847 they started paying quarterly dividends of 200% or 800% p.a.  This was not distributing sufficient of the profits and directors advised a payment of 1,000%.

‘I am pleased to see how well Mongolata Mines are moving along, and can imagine how excited Mr Frank Harris is – Frank Treloar.’

Walker continues – you can see how important Burra Mines were in those days when each £5 share returned £315.

He then describes the Mongolata geology.  It is situated on the edge of the pre-Cambrian formation and breaks away to the Eastern Plain.  The east edge of pre-Cambrian rocks also has the Adelaide Hills Mine, Ulooloo, Wadnaminga, Teetulpa and Olary gold deposits.  He says in America the following of stringers was found to lead to rich pockets of ore which would pinch away, but eventually open out again.  He advises all at Mongolata to follow all stringers, as they must eventually lead to gold deposits.  There must also be plenty of alluvial gold, but in such an old deposit it is hard to say where water courses were hundreds of millions of years ago.  A proper geological survey is needed to give more information concerning the lay of underlying rock beds.
