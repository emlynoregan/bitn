Mt Bryan East Mails

A meeting at the Mt Bryan East Schoolroom on 30 June considered proposed changes to the mail service.  The proposed new service would arrive at Mt Bryan East Thursday afternoon on its way to Braemar and the sheep stations en route, arriving back in Hallett on Friday.  There would be a service to and from Mt Bryan East Saturday morning and Monday afternoon.  The majority were in favour, believing it would be the best service the district had ever seen.
