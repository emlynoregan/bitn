Weather.  On 18 May high winds at Mt Bryan East produced the worst storm in memory for that area.  Trees were widely flattened with large limbs torn off or trunks broken off half way up.  Windmills were reduced to twisted ruins.  Sheds were demolished and haystacks blown over.  Dry grass was piled high against fences.  About 28 points of rain were recorded at the southern end of the district.  Hand feeding of stock and some water carting are the main jobs for the day at present.
