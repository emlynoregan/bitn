Fire.  A drover camped near T. Harvey’s seems to have started a fire on Friday from his cooking fire.  Mr Harvey’s oat crop was being reaped and he lost c. 20 bags of oats.  The fire destroyed 40 acres of Mrs Affolter’s grass, the mainstay of her cows, upon which she relies.  The fire was halted at a creek.
