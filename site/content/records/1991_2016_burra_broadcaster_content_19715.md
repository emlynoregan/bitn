Partnerships 21

Education Department District Superintendent Trevor Tiller answers some of the questions raised.

The editor then provides a column of comment to the effect that the Government has been slow to give out information and explanations and expected schools to sign up before the end of August without a word of consultation.  Some have and some have not.

It seems, he says, that more than 90% of teachers in the Australian Education Union are opposing Partnerships 21.  He ends by asking what is wrong with our schools now.  ‘If it ain’t broke why fix it?’
