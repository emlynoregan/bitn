Obituary.  At Mr Fuss’s house near the Burra Railway works on Thursday 21 July Henry Edmonds, a labourer on the line and formerly employed by the Smelting Works as a water carrier, ate a hearty meal and at about 8 o’clock complained of a pain between his shoulders, which he ascribed to wheeling barrows.  He retired at 9 o’clock and at 5 a.m. Mr Frederick Fuss called him.  The deceased said he would lie in a little longer.  Within ten minutes he began to cry, breathe heavily and scream.  Mr Fuss struck a light and found the deceased could not speak.  He went for Dr Dashwood who was soon in attendance, but Edmonds died soon after Mr Fuss’s departure.  An inquest was held at the Burra Hotel by W.H. Challoner JP.  Dr Dashwood said a post mortem revealed the deceased had died from a diseased heart, the aorta having become perforated from ulceration.  The liver was much diseased and probably caused the heart condition.  The deceased had been a steady industrious worker, who had visited his native country with his family about four years ago, returning after some months.  He had been at work on the line for some five weeks and expected his family to join him shortly.  He was aged about 40.  Verdict was that he died of disease of the heart.

[Henry Edmunds died 21 July 1870 near Kooringa aged 42.]
