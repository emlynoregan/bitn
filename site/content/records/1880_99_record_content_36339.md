Burra Town Council.

The Railway Commissioner has said that the water tested [from the townâ€™s supply] was unsuitable for locomotives.

A letter from SAMA grants land for approaches to the new footbridge over the creek.

The majority of Councillors were opposed to accepting a tender for the new bridge and it was decided to defer the matter for three months.
