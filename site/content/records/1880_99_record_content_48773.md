Editorial.  The writer regrets the tendency of committees and such to fall out has spread from the Town Council to the School Board of Advice, with Mr West’s resignation from that body.  ‘We need not reproduce the facts, for they are widely known.’

After referring to earlier Town Council meetings, including the one with the Mayor’s report of 16 January and the Mayor’s refusal to accept any motion on its being received or not, the editor goes on to say that since then standing orders seem to be things of the past.

At a meeting on 6 February the Mayor did consent to take a motion for or against the report.  Is not this an inconsistency?  On 6 February Cr Linkson said the report was not true and he would not vote for it at any price.  Three other Councillors pointed out that His Worship’s report was not correct and finally voted against it.

‘We cannot alter anything in the minutes’ said His Worship – true – so why did he allow Cr Hardy to alter a question on 4 January in reference to the Waterworks?
