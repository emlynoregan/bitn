But this was a Government decision and nothing to do with the Board.  Mr Hawkes says that when I asked the then Chief Secretary (Mr A.W. Styles) about the appointment he replied that a letter from Mr George Lawn had suggested Mr McBride as suitable.  Mr Lawn is the town scavenger.  He then says we (the Board?) feel the appointment should not have been made in this way.  The Board knows of nothing that influenced the appointment.  Mr Lawn is a strong Labor supporter and a letter to a Labor Government would have some weight, perhaps.  Previous to the Verran Labor Government, when a vacancy occurred we would suggest a replacement.  The Verran Government said we had no power to suggest or to nominate.

Mr Hawkes also says ‘the rude, rough, and ruthless treatment of the medical men by the Hospital Board has been the whole cause of the trouble.’  After writing the letter to the Chief Secretary already cited, this statement is inconceivable.

Mr Winnall then referred to the curt reply to the Board on 15 March 1916: ‘Your note of the 16th received.  Yours T.B. Ashton and a. Evan Williams.’

Dr Ashton also said to Mr Warnes he should ‘come over into a quiet corner over the bridge and settle the matter’.  If the board has been asked to resign we have no knowledge of it.  Mr Winnall had been a Board member over 20 years.

Mr Winnall then turned to Mr Davey, who said he represented all the Friendly Societies.  Mr Winnall disputed this.  He was appointed a delegate at an ordinary meeting of the lodge for which no notice was given of the business.

Mr Davey asserts that surgical operations cannot be performed in Burra, but Dr Williams has an equal degree.  When we appointed Dr Ashton an Honorary surgeon there were some who asked if he would co-operate with Dr Williams.  Dr Ashton recently did refuse to consult with Dr Williams unless his instructions were carried out.  Dr Ashton then said ‘It is no use my giving advice if it is not carried out.’

Mr Davey questions whether men appointed to the Board because they held high financial positions, were the best for that position.  Mr Winnall said these men represent all classes.

[This seems a specious argument at best.  They may have been representatives of the town, but they were certainly not drawn from all classes.]

Mr Winnall claims not to have a high financial position.

[Such matters are, of course, relative, but he was a solicitor and clearly at least comfortably off.]

He claimed the Board was as representative as possible – given that conflict of interest would preclude including any businessman likely to tender for hospital supplies.
