HiChick.  The first batch of pedigree chickens, some 1,700 of them, arrived on 2 June after being hatched at the Torrens Island Quarantine Station.  Farm Manager, Pat Hallion, said the shed was working well, including the heating and cooling systems.  The amenities block will be built next, followed by the second shed, which should be finished by December.  Currently four people are employed full time.
