Cr Sampson said that Cr Ridgway had shed no light on the matter at all.  The plan said ‘Reserve’ and not ‘Public Reserve’.  He didn’t want to go to legal experts, but to leave things as they were at present.  Was North Ward to bear the legal costs - if it were the council as a whole that would do so he would oppose such a move.

Cr Coglin thought the council had moral but not legal right on its side.  The best course was that of Cr Sampson.

Cr Ridgway had no doubt of either the legal or moral right.  The Supreme Court had deemed that ‘Reserve’ meant public use.  He did not propose to enter merely a caveat on the title, but to apply for title under the RPA.  It would be for anyone else to enter a caveat.  It should simply have been gazetted like the other Redruth Reserves, but as the council was not in favour of proceeding he would withdraw the motion.

The Mayor suggested a legal opinion be obtained.  On of the first acts of the district Council when formed was to seek to fence and plant the Reserve, but the ratepayers had not then consented.

Cr Ridgway said that unless the council did something the reported owners would and then Council would have to defend their claim.

Cr Coglin moved that the positions of Inspector and Dayman be merged and the Town clerk and Collector of Rates positions be merged.

The result would be a saving of £100, which would become available for subsidy and so be worth £200.  Cr Sampson said five days notice of such a move had to be given.

Cr Coglin agreed to withdraw his motion till salaries were being discussed.

Council then proceeded with officers and salaries.

Cr Coglin moved Mr Cave be reappointed Town Clerk at the same salary, but including duties related to the Waterworks with a rearrangement of where the payment would come from the different departments to increase the amount able to claim subsidy.

Not 2nd.

Cr West then amended that there be a combined office of Town Clerk, Controller of Waterworks and Inspector of works at £200.  Not 2nd.

Cr Sampson moved a committee report on the matter next meeting. Cr Sampson 2nd.

Cr Tiver amended that the Town Clerk be reappointed at the same salary as at present.  Cr Coglin 2nd.

The amendment was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

[And presumably the motion passed?]

Meetings will be 1st Monday and 3rd Saturday of the month.

Finance Committee Report:

The financial position is difficult and no new work except what is essential should be done.  At the end of the present year the debts will be:

Recreation Ground	£200

Cemetery	£41-10-9

General Account*	£449-13-4

Bonded Debt	£2,300

* In view of the Mayor’s report in the paper of 21 November the figure here for the General Account seems more likely to be the figure for the General Account plus the Recreation Ground and Cemetery less the Health Account credit.  This total then being estimated at £412-17-11.
