Goyder Council

Has adopted the rates as reported last week.

The Eudunda STEDS scheme will be assessed.  It is one of the oldest in SA and it is expected it will need to be replaced in the near future.

Northern Waste will arrange to have a single operator for their compaction truck and while this is more efficient, there may be need for some grouping of bins in rural areas.

A survey on waste management will be undertaken with recommendations on the operation of land-fill sites.  Significant expenditure is likely to be required.

Burra Visitor Centre has a new website: www.visitburra.com.

The Annual Mt Bryan Dinner Dance on Saturday 24 July raised $1,300 for Mt Bryan Soldiersâ€™ Memorial Hall.

Regional Events & Festivals funding from the State Government will continue to support Jazz in the Monster Mine and will also support Wheal Burra Burra Festival this year.

Burra North Railway Bridge.  Work on the reconstruction of the Barrier Highway rail crossing is ongoing.  In the past week the removal of the large concrete supports that bore the weight of the bridge has been undertaken and the embankments are being changed to slope gently to the edge of the highway.
