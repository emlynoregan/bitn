Mail Coach Accident.  A serious accident occurred to the mail coach between Mt Bryan Hotel and Burra on Tuesday evening.  For some unknown reason it capsized and the passengers on the box seat were thrown into very dangerous positions.  The driver escaped with a severe graze, but Mr John Dunston [Dunstan?] was thrown among the horses and fell on his head.  He managed to escape with a nasty blow and a good shaking.  Mr Ambrose Harris of Kooringa was found under the coach with his leg badly broken below the knee.  He was removed to his residence where he now lies in great suffering.  The inside passengers were women and children, who all escaped without serious hurt.
