The Main Street Committee is looking for a registration of interest by the end of October for the formation of a Burra Railway Preservation Society.  The Riverton Historical Railway Society has three or four ‘Red Hens’ in working order and should there be enough interest here there is the possibility of a ‘Red Hen’ tourist runs between Riverton and Burra.
