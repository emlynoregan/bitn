Obituary.  Miss Mary Anna (Polly) Hutson died 13 January.  She was a daughter of Mr & Mrs John Hutson and was born at Burra 24 August 1866 and lived in Burra practically all her life.  She was educated at the local school and afterwards was a dressmaker until ill health forced her to retire.  When younger she was a teacher at St Mary’s Sunday School and a keen church member.  Physical disability largely confined her to her home in the last 20 years.  If John Hutson’s family of three sons and three daughters now only Mr Harry Hutson survives.
