The industry is preparing for one of its largest expos.  More than 40 studs will be exhibiting their sought after rams in and around Burra at the 2012 Elders SA Stud Merino Expo on 19 March (on properties) and 20 March (at Burra Oval).  Stud masters and sheep buyers from al over the country will descend on Burra for the Expo to assess the latest merino and poll merino rams the state has to offer.
