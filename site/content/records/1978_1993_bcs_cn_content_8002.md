Council has covered the old dump site and screened the new site with a dirt embankment.

Wind blown rubbish remains a concern.

A new dump is to be developed over the next six months

The area around the swimming pool is to be enlarged and improved.

Telecom has made plantings around the automatic telephone exchange.

Australia Post has repainted the old Post & Telegraph Office, which we understand is to be sold.

The Ayers Street Bridge has had new hand rails installed.

The Pig and Whistle Crossing has had a cement beam and hand rail installed.

Some fencing or perimeter definition would enhance Paradise and Welsh Place.

Plans include

Tour bus stop with barbecue facilities on Bridge St creek bank parking area.

Bennetts Farmers are to demolish their offices adjacent to the Council Building and construct new premises to complement the area.
