11th Annual Synod of the Mid-North District of the Methodist Church was held at Spalding 30 & 31 October.  The Kooringa Circuit desired that probationer S.W. Line continue in that circuit next year and all other ministers have been invited to continue in their circuits for a further year.

£1,000 was spent on the Redruth Church at the time of its centenary and £900 has been spent on the Saddleworth Church and manse.

Synod was strongly opposed to the Bill to legalise mechanical hare coursing.

The next synod will be at Kooringa 28 & 29 October 1952.
