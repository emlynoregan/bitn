Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. to 16 November

The main tunnel has advanced to 519ft with a small 3” vein at 505ft giving 2-3dwt per ton.

Golden Harp.  South drive advanced to 12ft on a lode yielding 10dwt per ton.

We understand a Government bore has been sent to a field where the average yield is 3dwt per ton so why has one not been sent to Mongolata which produced over one third of gold raised in SA in 1933?

A further test of Mongolata will be made this week when 25 tons from a claim three miles north of Byles’ Mongolata will be put through the battery.
