Waterworks.  Assessment in 1888 was £12,132 and in 1893 was £9,578.

The rates brought in £489-17-10.  Interest on the lease was £406-2-2 and the engineer was paid £132.

The Local Board of Health reported no major problems for the year.

Cr Walsh then spoke of his two years as a Councillor overseeing works in the North Ward to see them done economically and judiciously.  At the start of his term the ward had a deficit of £14 when Cr Rabbich retired.  There was a credit of £2 at the end of last year and now there was a debit of £11, due mainly to relief work, though the recent extraordinary election had cost £4.  Councillor Walsh then ‘blamed’ Mr Rabbich for bringing Mr Hardy out for the election and canvassing for him.

Mr Rabbich: ‘It’s an untruth.’  If he had time he would contest the election.

In the recent unpleasantness about the Waterworks engineer Cr Walsh thought it his duty to demand an enquiry.  Had he been guilty I would have been the first to say ‘send him going at once’ the Councillor said.  Cr Walsh was of the opinion that an expert from Adelaide should be got to find the irregularities so much spoken of.  He was thanked by acclamation.

Cr West then briefly spoke of his two years, saying he had always worked with honesty and straightforwardness.

Cr Parks thought it unnecessary to go into details after the Mayor’s report.  He had started the year as Chairman of Public Works, but without an overseer had found it too time consuming and resigned.  He was sorry about any friction that occurred.  The greatest concern was over the Waterworks.  He believed that Cr Harris and Cr Sampson were justified in their steps.  ‘Councillor Walsh seems to reflect on the way in which the matter was dealt with.  The charge was not one of drunkenness.’

The Mayor: ‘Yes, certainly it was.’

Cr Parks: ‘No, it wasn’t.’

Mr W. Killicoat: ‘Yes it was one of drunkenness and you know it.  You have been the cause of nearly all the irritation in the Council.’

Uproar ensued and the East Ward Councillor had to appeal to the chair to restore order.

‘The Mayor: . . . Councillor Harris went to the Town Clerk and tried to rake up things that occurred six years ago.’

Uproar.

‘Cr Harris: That’s lies, lies, lies.

The Mayor: Allow Councillor Parks to speak.

Councillor Parks: The charge _____ .

A Voice: Sit down, get off the platform.

The mayor: I would ask everyone to allow Councillor Parks to proceed.’

After some unprintable remarks from the floor Cr Parks wound up his remarks briefly.

Dr Brummitt was asked to speak as a candidate for the Mayoralty.

He was going to accept the nomination and recalled that last time he was Mayor 10 or 11 years ago in difficult times it took up too much of his time then and he was not prepared to accept the office if there was to be a repetition.

Mr Rabbich said he was standing for North Ward and would pursue a policy of economy.  He thought the offices of Town Clerk and Inspector could be amalgamated.  10-12 years ago the Town Clerk was also overseer of works.  They could pay a good wage; say £150, thus saving £30 p.a.

A Voice ‘Nonsense.’

Mr Rabbich: ‘At present the Town Clerk receives £120 p.a.

Town Clerk: ‘No – I get £50 or 19/3 a week.

Mr Rabbich: ‘Anyhow he receives £120 for all his work and the Inspector £60.

Town Clerk: ‘I defy anyone to carry out the two positions.  When Mr Holder was Town Clerk the Waterworks were not in existence.  The engineer should be paid £2-10-0 a week not £3.’

A Voice: ‘Give him fair play first.’

Cr Parks, as candidate for East Ward, said he was against the amalgamation of the Town Clerk and Inspector.

Cr West offered himself for re-election with a policy of honesty, straightforwardness and economy and would not interfere in the present arrangement of offices.

Mr Shortridge was again standing as auditor a position he has held for 8-9 years.

Dr Brummitt said he would like to see a pavilion at the oval, but would need to see how it would work first.  He did not think a reduction in rates possible until the whole of the bonds were repaid in 1897.
