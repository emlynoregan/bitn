Burra Public Conveniences.  A recent complaint from a Broken Hill visitor about the filth in everyway at the womenâ€™s convenience in Burra, prompted the Council to say that the place was thoroughly cleaned every Friday, but by Monday offenders had again turned it into a place of vile filth.  It will be thoroughly cleaned on Monday as well and an effort made to catch the offenders.
