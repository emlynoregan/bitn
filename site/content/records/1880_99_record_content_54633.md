Editorial on Municipal Affairs.

These are again drifting into danger.  The last Council meeting was wasted on trivial [procedural] matters.

Cr Parks wanted to know by whose authority a load of wood was ordered for the Waterworks.

The Mayor said he ordered the wood.

Of course he did, and he should have: he was placed in the position of Chairman of the Waterworks Commission.

Does Cr Parks think he needed to call a special meeting of Council to order a load of wood!

Cr Linkson sought to have a call of the whole Council to expunge the motion sacking the engineer and substitute one calling for a committee to investigate the charges against the engineer.

The Council then digressed into legal opinion and trivia.  Regardless of any legal technicality, Mr Littlejohn deserves the justice of an inquiry.  The wave of technical objections makes one think that the Councillors made rash statements without the slightest foundation, and that they will not allow the man to have his request granted at any price if they can possibly avoid it.
