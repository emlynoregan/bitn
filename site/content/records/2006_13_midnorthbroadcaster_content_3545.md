Goyder Council has declined to be involved in the funding of BOBfest 07, which will kick off on Sunday 21 October in Clare Town Hall.  A cash contribution of $3,000 was sought at the July meeting.

Burra Online.  Burra can now be viewed worldwide with the launch of the Burra Burra Heritage Website on 19 July 2007.  It ticks off one of the priorities of the Burra National Trust Strategic Plan for 2007.  The site gives access to accurate information on the branchâ€™s products, including its four museums, Malowen Lowarth Night Tour, the Passport Key and the Bon Accord Cottage B & B.  An online booking facility is planned for the future.
