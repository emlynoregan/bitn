W.H. Hardy writes concurring with the editor that the Government is treating the town shabbily over the Waterworks.  The reply from the Minister to the latest delegation was ‘knowingly made up of untruths and nonsense’.  The Council was unwilling to hand the works over to the Government without first approaching the Government for a better deal.  Mr Foster spoke most favourably of the justice of our complaints and has led us to believe that something could be done, but after waiting weeks nothing has changed.  Despite the Minister’s claim no inspection or valuation was made and as a result I have moved to have the works returned to the Government.  It is about time people began to object to being treated so shabbily.
