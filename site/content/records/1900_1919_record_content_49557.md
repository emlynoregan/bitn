Burra Hospital Board.

A. Gebhardt resigns.

The falling patient numbers due to war conditions will not affect probationer nurses’ certificates.

The Board for the next 12 months is: A.J. McBride JP, J. McLaren, E.W. Crewes JP, J.E.H. Winnall JP, I.J. Warnes JP, C. Bartholomaeus, P.A. McBride, S.M. Lane JP, F.T. Harcus, and T. McWaters JP.

The porter has given notice and will be replaced by Mr Henry Walker.

The Board congratulates Dr Steele on being awarded the Military Cross.

Burra Cheer-up Society is preparing for Repatriation Day when they will run the sweet and cool drink stall.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ band will appear for the first time on 19 February at the Grand Camp Concert at the Institute.  A parcel was sent to Pte Bell for whom a social could not be arranged.
