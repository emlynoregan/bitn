Burra Town Council, 2 February

Permission was granted for the Aberdeen Tennis Club to extend the kitchen of the tennis shed.

A letter from the Municipal Association referred to the By-Law concerning caravans.

He [who?] said caravans were being used in increasing numbers,  He suggested a site be made at the Playground where public conveniences were handy and water and showers could be installed.

The District Clerk had reported to him [?] that the RAA was enquiring whether Burra had a caravan park.

Cr Marston did not favour turning the playground into a caravan park.

It was decided to let the matter lie on the table till the next meeting.

Quarry industries advised that half inch Bulldog [i.e. road metal] cost 12shillings per ton in 40 ton lots and three quarter inch Bulldog cost 11 shillings per ton.  The shunting fee was 20 shillings (£1) and rail freight 15 shillings per ton.

The damage to 90 glass domes at the Burra Cemetery amounted to between £200 and £300.

The ratepayers’ meeting on 28 January was adjourned due to poor attendance.  The Mayor said 11 were present.

The solicitor advised there were no Acts governing electricity lead in wires, but a set of standards.
