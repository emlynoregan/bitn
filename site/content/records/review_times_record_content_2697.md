Burra DC will appeal against the Industrial Court’s order to reinstate and compensate the wages of a council overseer who was dismissed in 1982 because of alleged sexual misconduct.  This was decided at a special Council meeting on Tuesday night.  The court ruled on Friday that Mr Ronald Moreland had been dismissed after being wrongfully accused of sexual harassment and blackmail.  The Council was told it could face a payment of up to $100,000 in lost wages, in addition to having to pay the wages of two overseers once Mr Moreland was reinstated.  Mr B.V. Shillabeer, in handing down the decision, said community attitudes in Burra were largely to blame for Mr Moreland’s wrongful dismissal.  The special meeting of Council was called when Councillors and workmen involved in the case threatened to resign when Mr Moreland reported for work on Tuesday.  The District Clerk Mr Allan Dwyer said Mr Moreland had been reinstated last Friday, but this would be suspended once the appeal was lodged, pending a court decision.
