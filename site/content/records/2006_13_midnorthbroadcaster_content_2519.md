Letter.  Mr & Mrs L. White from Newcastle write about being ‘ripped off’ at a hotel, a tea room, a food shop and another shop while visiting Burra – a real litany of bad service.

A shop assistant tried to charge them for a local paper that had clearly been much read.

Two local hotels charged them $2.50 a glass more than locals were paying.

They were charged $2.50 for a glass of water when one of them had a coughing fir while waiting for their meal at a café.

Another shop sold them stale goods.
