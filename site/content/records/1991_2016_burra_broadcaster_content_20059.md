Burra Community Library Board received the 21st annual report at the AGM recently.

Chief Librarian Tess Hopkins said that more and more the library was becoming an information centre drawing on both traditional and developing technology.  The Dynix system was functioning well.  Students & members of the public were using the CD Rom Network extremely well and the Board was considering either upgrading or replacing these machines in a few months.  The Ian Auhl History Room continues to be well used.  The ongoing research by Shirley Thamm was much appreciated by both the public and the library staff.  The local history collection was held in trust by the library and needed ongoing care and protection.  The depots at Terowie, Hallett and Booborowie continued to function well.  Housebound members of the community have books delivered to them and The Senior Citizens Club has a selection of books taken to their fortnightly meetings.  Mrs Colleen Woodgate will continue in her role as Chairperson of the Board with Barb Secomb as Secretary and Geraldine Smedley as Treasurer.  Other members of the Board are Janet Slade, Shirley Thamm, Ruth Jaquet, Kym Haebich, Kevin Fahey, David Evans, Bryan Dunow, Robert Skinner, Chris Kerrigan, Cathryn Peppiatt and Jenny Dolphin.
