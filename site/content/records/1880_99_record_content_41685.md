Burra Town Council, 15 June.

In the Mayor’s report:

Mr Hargraves, the main road surveyor, has inspected the Bon Accord ford and asked for statistics of road use there.

Water has been laid on to the smelting works.

The lamp on Henderson’s Bridge has been erected, but will have to be raised 6” and this will be done tomorrow.

Watertables in Market Square need cleaning out.

Public Works.  The road near the Gaol and that leading to Hampton has been finished.

The bridges have been tarred.

Cr Sampson moved a ladder be got for lighting lamps.  Carried.

Cr Sampson moved that the lamppost in Market Square be moved to Henderson’s Corner and another burner be substituted for the one now in use.  Carried.

Cr Sampson said he had seen Mr Lewis and told him that for £20 they would take the matter of diverting the water entirely out of his hands and divert it.  Mr Lewis declined.

In fairness to Mr Lockyer who had cleared out the watercourse the council should either remove the soil or compel Mr Lewis to do so.  Four or five notices had been served on Mr Lewis and he would move ‘That Council put men on at once to clean out the obstruction to the creek so as to let the water go through its natural channel.’

Cr Watt said Mr Lewis had undertaken to give £15.

Cr Sampson: Will Cr Watt guarantee it?

Cr Watt believed Mr Lewis a man of his word.

Cr Rabbich did not want to accept £15 as he felt it would be insufficient.

After further discussion on serving further notices Cr Watt moved the £15 offer be accepted and despite Cr Rabbich’s objections it was carried.

The work is to be done as soon as the £15 is received.
