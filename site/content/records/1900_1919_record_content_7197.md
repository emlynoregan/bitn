New Year’s Pranks.

Some of the lads who in earlier years indulged in New Year’s Eve larks were asked why they refrained this year and why a footbridge or the like was not displaced replied: ‘Oh! The bloomin’ Council didn’t appoint any ‘Specials’ to have a bit of fun with.’

The Council seems to have learnt that such appointments were looked on as something of a farce and realised there are better ways of spending £3.

‘Whip’ reports that at the Terowie Sports on 1 January ‘Dick’ Gully won the three mile bicycle handicap and A.F. Heinrich was 2nd with O. Baynes 3rd.  Baynes won the one mile event and came second in the two mile with Heinrich second and ‘Dick’ Gully third.

Weather for the holidays was pleasant and many went to the Booborowie Sports or to the World’s End Races on 1 January.

World’s End Races on 1 January were very successful and six events were contested.  The Maidens and The Handicap were won by T. O’Dea’s The Norman, though some people are saying he was ineligible for the former given his striking resemblance to old Trentalto!  Results are printed.
