Burra Race Club held a very successful meeting last Wednesday.  Gate receipts were £172; weather was perfect and there was good racing.  The track was in excellent condition except for the new section on the northern side, but that will be remedied.  The main race was the Squatter’s Handicap, won by Chesson.  Mr G.R. Jesser who trains and races Chesson accepted the trophy.  The jockey was W. Pyres.  [Other results are printed.]
