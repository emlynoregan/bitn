A free Bushcare Workshop has been organised at Mt Bryan by the Nature Conservation Society, Trees for Life and greening Australia.  These series of workshops across SA are particularly aimed at community groups interested in conserving and maintaining native vegetation.

Previous to European settlement extensive areas of the plains and low hills in the Mid North from Clare to Peterborough were devoid of trees and shrubs.  They were Temperate Native Grasslands dominated by native grasses and herbs such as lilies and daisies.  Less than one percent of these areas survive and most of the survivors are heavily infested with weeds.  The remnants are important habitats for rare and endangered species.  The workshop will consist of a slide show and talk by botanist Rick Davies and zoologist Tim Milne.  Rick has done extensive work on weed control in native grasslands and Tim is doing a PHD study on the endangered Pygmy Blue Tongued Lizard.  The talk at Mt Bryan Hall 9 a.m. Tuesday 2 February will be followed by an afternoon visit to the newly acquired grassland area at Mount Cone, which is to become a conservation park.  It contains some of the best surviving areas of remnant grassland.
