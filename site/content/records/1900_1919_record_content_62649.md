Hanson welcomed home Lieut. Stanley Bishop MM & Driver Robert Motherall.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

£240 is to be divided among the local returned men who have lost a limb or returned seriously wounded.  [See The Mayor’s Report for 1919, XXXXI, 48, 3 Dec. 1919, Supplement, where it is revealed that 12 men each received £20.]

Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes, who were about to go on a world trip, were accorded a farewell social last Wednesday at Leighton Hall.  It took the form of a banquet and in just over 2 columns there are reports of speeches by Messrs Winnall, McLaren, W. Cock, J.Q. Hogan, J. Gallagher, J. Drew, L. Foote, S.M. Lane, Ruthven, E.W. Crewes, Wade & Cr Radford.

Mr Warnes’s reply gives something of his life story and more of his philosophy.

He said he had wanted to go in 1914, but the war had prevented him.  Now he either had to give up work, or take a long break.  He had lost energy and drive.  Up to then whatever he undertook ‘he always made it his business to be boss.’  The first money he earned was 37/6 from his father for shooting kangaroos.  His father paid him no wages till he was 21 and then £1 plus clothes and food and an occasional holiday.  He recalled going to into Burra and returning without spending virtually anything because there was nothing he saw that he wanted.  Even now he would pay anything for what he wanted, but would not buy any article, however cheap, if he did not have a use for it.  As a youth he had an ambition to have £1,000 and be married by 30.  He was left something and married at 28.  He said he would be happy when he shore 20,000 sheep or got 4,000 bales of wool.  Today he shore 40,000 sheep.  He had succeeded in improving wool yield.  He was fighting the battle of his life [to be re-energised and given purpose].  When he went to Adelaide first he was green, but he believed he had done some good as a representative of the pastoralists.  He had seen the Board of the Pastoralists’ Association change to young energetic men and their financial position improve vastly to a credit they called ‘Warnes’ money’.  There were times when he needed money – last year he had an overdraft of £20,000, but he had the confidence and trust of those with whom he dealt.  With the exception of a few minor accounts he now owed no one anything.  He was also quick to cut his losses if a venture failed.  He made friends and foes, but bore no malice.  He gave hard knocks, but believed a man was better regarded is he said straight out what was on his mind.  He had once ridden a bicycle 100 miles to play cricket against Burra, made a duck and enjoyed it.  He had enjoyed his life work since.  There was still much to be done.  He hoped to see the battlefields of France and hoped to be home for next shearing in 8 or 9 months.
