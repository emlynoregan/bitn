Children’s Week, 24 October to 1 November

Burra & Booborowie students and youngsters from Burra Out of School Hours Care (OSHC) have work displayed at the Burra Bank SA Branch.

Lower North Health Growing Healthy Kids Team hosted a Teddy Bears’ Picnic at the Burra Oval last Wednesday.  At the oval for the event were representatives from AutismSA, the Division of Rural Medicine, Disability SA, Child and youth health, members from Woolworths in Clare and the Burra Scouts. The crowd was not large.
