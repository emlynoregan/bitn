Council Amalgamation

The District Councils of Burra Burra, Eudunda, Robertstown and Hallett are nearing the final stages of preparing an amalgamation to be submitted to the Local Government Boundary Reform Board.  This follows work by the Structural Reform Working Party set up by the four councils, whose report from its three sub-committees will be considered at a meeting today to be finalised.  There will be recommendations for the new Council to comprise four wards: Burra, Eudunda, Hallett and Robertstown, with a Council of eleven members with a Chairman elected from the Councillors.

Rate increases are to be kept in line with the CPI and rating parity is to be achieved by 2002-03.

[Further details on changes to Governance, Finance Services and Organisational Structure are printed.]
