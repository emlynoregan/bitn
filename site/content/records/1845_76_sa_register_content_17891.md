Kooringa News, 20 October

The weather has been stormy and wet.  The rain reportedly extends at least as far north as Arkaba.

Mr E. Chapman, who is leaving Burra for Adelaide, gave an entertainment at the hotel for all children attending the same school as his.

Mr J. Anderson has been replaced as manager of the Bank of Australasia here by Mr Goodhart.

Numbers of wool drays are passing through.

Miners and others continue to leave for Wallaroo and Moonta.

Many houses here are desolate with their doors and windows smashed.
