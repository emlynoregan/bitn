Criminal Sittings, Adelaide, 1 April.

Thomas Byrne (34) was accused of arson at Drew & Crewes.  The judge commended the police in their work with respect to the case, but ruled that it was a dangerous one to take to a jury.  The Crown Solicitor agreed that there was no case to answer and entered a nolle prosequi and Byrne was discharged.
