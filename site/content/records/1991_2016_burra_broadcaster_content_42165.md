Burra Broadcaster – FINAL ISSUE

Due to financial constraints this will be the final edition of the Burra Broadcaster.  News from Burra & Districts will be covered through the Plains Producer – a larger paper with a larger distribution, as of next week.

The Burra Broadcaster commenced publication after the closure of The Mid North Broadcaster in June 2013.  The introduction of the online news service www.burrabroadcaster.com.au in August 2014 [sic: for 2013] was followed by the publication of the first hard copy using a home printer and later supported by the Burra Community Library.  The paper took a more professional appearance after gaining sponsorship from AGL, allowing for better quality photos and colour on the front and back cover pages.
