Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

The Governor will lay a utility stone.  It will be inscribed to show it was laid by His Excellency, but will be subsequently buried out of sight so that no names except those of the fallen will appear on the memorial.  The handle of the silver trowel to be used by the Governor will be of Burra malachite.  Miss Trix Pearce has been added to the committee making up the list of names for the Memorial & the Honour Roll.  Chairmen and Councillors of the surrounding DCs are to be invited to the laying of the foundation stone.  A decoration committee was appointed.
