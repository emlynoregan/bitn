EFS Officers and others met in the Burra Town Hall on 28 November from Burra, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie to plan their co-ordinated reaction to fires this season.  They discussed the three divisions of fire fighting:

Field operations

Service to supply the needs of the Fire supervisor

Planning â€“ tactics and operations control

Each Council has at least one EFS station with control rooms and premises suitable for use as a district control centre, bur equally important are trained personnel to staff such centres.

Sgt Haynes cited the problems unique to the Eastern Stations Area.  This area covered 6,871 square miles in which there are 15 occupied homesteads and of which only two have a radio link with the Broken Hill Flying Doctor.  Of the remaining 13, seven are virtually connected to the outside world only by a party-line telephone; three on one line and four on another.  Both lines connect only to the Burra exchange.  The greater part of these lines is old private lines and the majority is carried on mallee posts, often white ant eaten, which would burn like kindling.  Another problem he discussed was the incompatibility of the various radio systems then in use.  Radios capable of DSB, SSB & HF operation were needed.  Sgt Haynes thought Burra was the logical co-ordinating centre.  In the 1951 fire in the Eastern Stations area some units travelled 300 miles chasing smoke and never saw a fire.  There was no co-operation or direction.  Maps have now been prepared at 1 inch to 16 miles, showing all homesteads, occupied and unoccupied and all dams and waterholes and major roads and tracks.  Supervisors should have lists of names, addresses and phone numbers, with particulars of equipment available.

Mr J.N. McBride, Supervisor of the Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Organisation, also addressed the meeting about the present situation and expectations for the fire season.  Negotiation between the two Council areas represented will continue.
