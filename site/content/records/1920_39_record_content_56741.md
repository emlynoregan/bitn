Obituary.  Mr R. Sharp died at the Burra Hospital last Sunday.  He was born 18 June 1856 and migrated from England in 1874.  He worked on sheep stations for a number of years.  In May 1906 he married Mrs King of Hallett.  On retiring some years ago the couple came to live in Kooringa.  Mrs Sharp died in October 1931.  At the Anzac Sports on 3 June he was one of the four injured when a motor cyclist crashed through the boundary fence and it is thought the shock and subsequent complications caused his death.  [Robert Sharp died 30 June 1935 at Kooringa.  He actually married Mrs Sara Ann King nee Honan 6 May 1905.]
