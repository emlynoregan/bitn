Obituary.  Mr Thomas Henry Pearse died at ‘Glenbower’ on ‘The Gums Station’ on 26 June aged 76.  He was born at Holne Village, Devonshire in 1857 in a family of nine sons and one daughter.  Several brothers died in Australia and one is currently a draughtsman at Keyham Dockyard, Plymouth.  He emigrated to Australia in 1877 on the Forfarshire.

[Personal note: my great-grandparents Alfred & Mary Allen migrated in 1877 on the Forfarshire.]

He travelled north on the train and by bullock dray to open a wheelwright’s business at Terowie and later at Hallett.  In 1884 in conjunction with his brother-in-law the late William Cockrum he purchased ‘The Gums’ from R.M. & W.J. McBride.  At the time it was quite small and parts of the area had been farmed, but not successfully, being beyond Goyder’s Line.  Mr Pearse eventually bought out 33 farmers and settlers to make the holding of 97,000 acres it is today.  He later bought Caroona, east of Mt Bryan in conjunction with his father-in-law, the late George Hiles of Petherton, Mt Bryan.  Mr Pearse’s brother, Harry, managed it until he died and later Mr Pearse’s eldest son, Bertram, became the owner.  Mr Pearse was thrice married.  His first wife was Emily, daughter of George Hiles and there were four sons and one daughter (one son died in infancy).  His second wife was Adeline, another daughter of Mr George Hiles and a son of this marriage died in infancy.  The third wife was Evaline Mathilde Herminie Meinck, daughter of R. Meinck, a farmer of Quorn.  The eldest son Bertram Wellesley died of wounds at Gallipoli in 1915.  Surviving sons Norman Hiles Pearse and Harold Leslie Pearse live at ‘The Gums’.  The daughter Ida Elizabeth of the first marriage married A. Scott Martin of Elder, Smith & Co. and predeceased both her father and husband (the latter of whom was killed in a car accident a few years ago).  Mr Pearse with his sons founded T.H. Pearse & Sons Ltd.  Among their holdings were ‘Warioota Station’ in the north and a share in ‘Witchelina Station’ Farina and extensive areas in Yundamindra and Mt Celia Stations near Leonora in WA.  He was for many years a member of the Morgan and Apoinga DCs and of the Stockowners’ Council of SA.  During a period of drought  he, along with P.L. Killicoat and John Barker, was instrumental in getting rental on leasehold country east of Burra reduced and leases placed under ‘the lease in perpetuity Act.  He and his wife did a world tour in 1921 and placed a memorial tablet to his soldier son in the old Parish Church.  [See Burra Record XXXXVII, 1, 7 Jan. 1925, page 3.]
