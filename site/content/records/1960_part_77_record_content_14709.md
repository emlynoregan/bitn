Accident. A semi-trailer with a load of 12 tons rolled over yesterday morning on the hill near Mr Herb White’s home.  It was en route from Radium Hill to Melbourne.  The turntable snapped and the trailer rolled over.  Part of the load of steel principals entered the driver’s side of the cabin, but fortunately the driver, sensing the danger, had just moved to the other side of the cabin.  The driver Donald William Richardson had a lucky escape.
