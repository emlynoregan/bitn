Salvation Army.  On 16 August Commissioner McKenzie (‘Fighting Mac’) visited Burra and was welcomed by the local corps.  He was given a civic reception by the Mayor T.H. Woollacott in the form of a dinner at J. Allen’s rooms.  This was followed by a civic reception at the Institute before the public meeting.  Mr Carne of the RSL proposed the toast to the guest of honour, supported by Cr Jennison.  The whole visit is reported at length in c. 2¾ columns.

John H.S. Faulds of the Salvation Army in Kingston St writes thanking the Mayor, RSL and others for the welcome accorded Commissioner McKenzie.
