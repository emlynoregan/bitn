Obituary/Inquest

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at Farrell’s Flat on Thursday 18 April on the death of Patrick Butler of Canowie, who had died on the previous day.

Samuel Miller said that about 3 p.m. he and John Wilson had met the deceased about a mile from Hanson [Farrell’s Flat].  He asked them to assist him through the ‘gluepot’ with his team of horses and wagon loaded with wheat.  Deceased was on the near side and the others on the offside.  When partway through they heard a cry and immediately stopped the horses.  The deceased was found jammed between the nearside hind wheel and a fencepost.  Keogh and Boyd, who then came up, helped back up the horses, but it took half an hour to extricate Butler.  Deceased was still alive when Miller went to report the accident.

John Wilson gave corroborative evidence.  Alexander J. Boyd of Kooringa gave supporting evidence and said the deceased had died about half an hour after being extricated.

John Wilson said the deceased was quite sober and Police-trooper Davis said he found no intoxicating liquor on the wagon.

John Butler of Mt Lofty, son of the deceased, said his father was a farmer of Canowie Belt aged 60 and an experienced driver, used to horses.  He considered the part of the road where the accident occurred to be very dangerous.

Police-trooper Davis said that on seeing the body, he found the leg severed below the knee.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

[Patrick Butler died 12 April 1876 near Hanson, residence Canowie aged 63.]
