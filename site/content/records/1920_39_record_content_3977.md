The Trench Mortar has arrived.  There is considerable dissatisfaction since the war souvenir sent to Peterborough took a whole truck to convey it.    The trench mortar would easily fit into a fruit case.  The Mayor keenly resents this glaring slight and is making representations and it is hoped to get some more fitting trophy to flank the Fallen Soldiersâ€™ Memorial.
