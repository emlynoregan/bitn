Burra Town Council, 17 June

The local RSL protested the removal of the guns without advising them first and objecting to a Councillor’s use of a private opinion as official RSL approval.

Various road works were approved.

A move to place the guns on concrete stands was deferred to the next financial year as it was estimated to cost £7-10-0.
