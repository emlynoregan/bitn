H.J. Button writes concerning A.B. Riggs’s letter.  He considers it useful to hear a range of views, but fears that Mr Riggs suggestions would actually aggravate the trouble – for example sacking the overseer and doing no public work for 18 months.  One would think Mr H. Wilson merely followed others around and watched the other men work.  He takes instructions from the Council and works as well as the next man.  After 17 years service he is entitled to a little more consideration than a casual hand.  Every man out of work means so much less purchasing power and a further fall in prices of primary products.  We need to arrest this fall by keeping as many employed as possible.
