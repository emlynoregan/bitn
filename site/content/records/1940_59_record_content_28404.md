Prime Minister’s Visit to Burra

The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Chifley, addressed a large and attentive audience at Burra on 16 September.

He was accompanied by Mr A.E. Smith MHR for this district and spoke for about ninety minutes.  He gave a comprehensive outline of his party’s achievements during the war and said high taxation rates would have to be retained for some time in order to maintain financial stability, but he said little about future policy.

Mr A.E. Smith spoke first.

[His speech is reproduced in c. 3 columns and was a speech that looked back on the party’s record more than it looked forward.]

Mr Chifley’s speech also concentrated heavily on his party’s record in the war years.  He spoke in support of the referendums, sought to justify high taxation, while pointing out that twice in twelve months there had been reductions and that interest rates had fallen and unemployment was at 0.5%.  They had been most anxious to abolish petrol rationing, but this had not been possible without harming Britain’s financial standing in the dollar countries. [c. 1⅓ columns.]
