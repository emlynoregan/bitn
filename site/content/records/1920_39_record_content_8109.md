Dr T.B. Ashton writes in reply to I.J. Warnes’ letter.  [He accuses Warnes of timing his letter so no reply was possible before the election.  He says Warnes was a member of the Board in 1917 which complained that both doctors were using the Burra Government Hospital for their private patients without legal right.]

I knew that this had been the practice for many years.  The Government appointed a Board of Inquiry which found the practice was illegal under the Hospital Act of 1877 and the Public Charities Act.  The Government accepted the finding and as a law-abiding citizen I ceased to use the hospital in this way.  The other doctor became Government Medical Officer on an increased salary, but continued to treat private patients and to charge his fee and has done so ever since.  My request in November 1920 for re-instatement was on the assumption that the old conditions were now legal.  After six months of evasive replies I found it was still illegal and I was to be exploited – expected to do gratuitously work that the other doctor was paid for.  I refused to accept this false position.  Only in February 1922 did the hospital become a subsidised hospital.  Granted that the Act of 1877 failed to meet modern needs or present day conditions: this does not explain why the Act was not altered when attention was drawn to it five years ago – or enforced impartially to all.
