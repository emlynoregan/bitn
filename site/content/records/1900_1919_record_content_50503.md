Burra Boy Scouts.

16 of the troop attended the rally in Adelaide.  They left Burra on Friday 23rd March and were billeted with metropolitan scouts.  The main event was a review held on Montefiore Hill on Saturday afternoon.  A procession of 1,800 scouts left Victoria Square at 2.30 p.m. headed by the Naval Band and they were inspected by His Excellency Sir Henry Galway, Chief Scout for SA.  On Sunday they met at the Queen’s Statue [in Victoria Square] and marched to St Peter’s Cathedral.  On Monday morning they packed like sardines into a special train for a day at Brighton.  There was an evening concert in the OBI [Our Boys’ Institute?].  Tuesday was a reception for visiting scouts by Mr Isaac, Mayor of Adelaide, in the Town Hall and in the evening a free entertainment in the Majestic Picture Palace.  On Wednesday country scouts went to Port Adelaide by special train and then by steam tugs to Glenelg and back.  In the evening there was a free entertainment at the Central Picture Theatre.  Thursday brought visits to places of interest with DSM Webb, though this was marred by rain.  Lunch was at Covent Gardens and the afternoon visit was to Ellis’s Ice Cream Factory (Peters Ice Cream) and then to the bakery to be bountifully supplied with cakes.  Friday was a free day with the return to Burra on Saturday.
