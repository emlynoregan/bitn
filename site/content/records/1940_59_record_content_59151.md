Mr Lea reiterated the two-year time frame and the offer to supply plant from ETSA.  In an emergency ETSA could supply material for the line from Waterloo, if the Council and/or the Company would provide the labour.  Council thought it better to await ETSA construction in two years.  The community appreciates the service given by BESC since 1923.  [Sic: supply actually began Thursday 27 March 1924.]  However, Council is desirous of safeguarding the future supply so that when ETSA power arrives all will be in order.

This article was written to advise ratepayers of the position and to squash any rumours that may be circulating relating to this matter.
