Burra Town Council, 29 March. Special Meeting.

Two applications were received for the position of Waterworks Engineer.  One arrived late and was laid aside.

James Littlejohn of Gladstone was the other applicant.  His testimonials told of 20 years experience as an engine driver and fitter and asserted he was trustworthy and reliable.

Cr Hardy moved his appointment at £2-2-0 a week.  Cr Sampson 2nd.

The Mayor thought that he lacked experience in waterworks and would need coaching from the present engineer in the laying on of services, flushing mains etc.

The motion was carried with Pinch and Watt opposed.

It was arranged to give the Town Clerk £20 a week [sic] as Secretary and Collector for the Waterworks.  [Clearly a misprint for per annum.]

Ordinary Meeting, 1 April.

The Mayor reported the fountain had been re-erected for the £5 allowed.

The Waterworks Committee is to visit and take over the Waterworks on Wednesday at 3 p.m.

The new By-law re hawkers’ licences was amended to cover only fish, fresh fruit and vegetables and then referred to a committee.
