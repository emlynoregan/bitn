Frank Treloar: Looking Back.  Another long article.

In December 1847 the directors of the mine Messrs Beck, Peacock, Graham & Waterhouse came by Chambers’ conveyance to the mine on a periodic visit.  They appointed Mr Thomas Burr as general Superintendent.  Captain Roach was to attend to the mining operations and the handling of ore.  Mr Burra would attend to accountancy etc.  The powder magazine was built.  The smelting operation established by Mr Dreyer who claimed smelting experience in Germany, was well advanced when Burr arrived.  It was a small furnace with a large pair of bellows to provide blast by use of a horse whim.  It was supposed to put through 8cwt of copper per day, but after 22 hours it produced only 4cwt of rough copper and needed repairs.  A second trial had similar unsatisfactory results with damage to the bellows etc. and distressing the horses.  The attempt was a costly failure.  The mine badly needed bags for ore despatch and called for 120-150,000.  They were loading 30 bullock drays a day and sometimes many more – up to 100 some days.  Three fresh wells were sunk in Kooringa for drinking water.  There were complaints that sheep with scab were offered for meat.  SAMA erected slaughterhouses and yards.  In September 1848 Mr Challoner replaced Mr Burr and thing improved.  He proved a very methodical officer.  In 1848 Mr Elphick was appointed assayer and Mr Burslem surveyor and draughtsman.  Building blocks were being allotted.  For building, local pines were used and SAMA sold bricks, palings and small lots of sawn timber.  SAMA had also let contracts for 35 cottages for £45 each and for 10 at £30 each.  66 horses were in use at the mine for whims and drays and six new ore jiggers.  The Captain set prices for tributers such that he expected the men to earn an average of £2 a week.  Ore carters were paid 25/- a week, labourers 25/-, whim boys 12/- and ore picking boys 8/-.  Carpenters, blacksmiths and sawyers earned £2 a week.  The directors then believed that men, especially miners on tribute were getting too much and cut wages.  They announced that from 2 November 1848 miners were to get 30/-, labourers 21/-, whim boys 10/-, ore picking boys 6/- and carpenters, blacksmiths etc. 38/-.  This caused the first strike in SA.  The workers were quite willing to continue at the old rates.  Ore loading stopped for a fortnight.  The mine management at the top showed a vindictive spirit.
