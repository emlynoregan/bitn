Accident.  The horse in a trap containing Mr & Mrs J.A. Watt and two children bolted near Kooringa, when loose horses approaching from behind frightened it.  Mr Watt was thrown out and dragged into a fence, but then the reins got caught in the wheel and pulled the horse up.  No one was much hurt and the damage to the trap was slight.
