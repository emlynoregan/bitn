Obituary.  Rev. Joseph Thomas of Stockton NSW died 25 March 1935.  He was the fourth and youngest brother of the late Mr James Thomas.  The news was not broken to Mr James Thomas, who was seriously ill at the time and subsequently it never seemed expedient.  Like his brother, Rev. Joseph Thomas was born at Kooringa, his parents having arrived here in 1848.  After a few years Mr Thomas Sen. went onto the land.  Consequently they are among the pioneer settlers of the district.  Mr Thomas took charge of his sons’ education.  Early on Joseph Thomas expressed a wish to join the ministry and asked his parents to give him a college education.  They agreed and he was sent first to Watervale Grammar school and thence to Prince Alfred’s College and then Shebbear College, Devon, England.  He returned to SA as a Congregational Minister and laboured in SA until 1903, when he went to NSW, where he laboured to within a month of his death, having then retired from active work after 50 years devoted service.  [Born 15 February 1868 Kooringa.]
