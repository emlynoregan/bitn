Booborowie Hall Opening

The opening was only cancelled after Mr & Mrs Warnes had arrived and as it was too wet to go home and the ladies had the tables ready for dinner, it was decided to stay for a while.  In the end the weather fined up and in fact the dayâ€™s planned activities apart from the opening mostly took place.  The bazaar, concert, supper and dance were all held successfully.
