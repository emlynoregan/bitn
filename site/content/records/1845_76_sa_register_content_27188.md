The Peak’s Crossing Accident Inquest

J.D. Cave JP was the coroner and Henry Dawson was Jury Foreman.

George Gitsham , guard, said the train started two  minutes late at 5.32 a.m. and was started in the usual manner and according to regulations.

John Rumball, the stationmaster, heard the train depart as usual just after 5.30 a.m.

Gitsham said the first indication of the accident was a shock to the train at the 97th mile post.  He was standing on a seat looking out the window and knowing the looseness of the embankment was expecting a signal.  He heard a loud splash and saw the trucks toppling over and disappearing one after another.  He had received no signal for the brake.  He put down the brake hard and so saved the last four trucks and the brake van.  He got out of the van and went to see to his mates.  He could not see them for the steam from the engine.  He thought the first culvert had been washed away.  He saw the engine and the tender and the fore part of the train were in the chasm all smashed up.  He walked a mile and a half to a get a conveyance and reported the accident at the Burra Station at 6.30 a.m.  The accident had happened at 5.51 a.m.  He had followed his instructions under regulations in returning to the station to secure assistance.  The stationmaster had sent a special engine to the scene at 7.20 a.m. and he returned with it.  He then found the engine buried with ten trucks in an opening in the embankment about a chain north of the culvert, which had been caused by the flood.  A stream of water was running through the opening and there was a large mass of hail and stubble lodged against the embankment.  Had the ganger walked this part of the line before the train it would have prevented the accident.  Walking the line had been knocked off recently, though they had previously done so.  He had never reported what he knew of the looseness of the embankment, but the Permanent Way Inspector would have observed it. The previous night had been very rough.  Holmes normally rode in the guard’s van, but he supposed he was on the engine as a look-out because of the rough weather.  Holmes had been the Walking Inspector of the Permanent Way from Burra to Riverton and it was his duty to see whether anything was wrong with the line.

John Rumball said Gitsham had reported the accident at 6.3[0] a.m. He sent for a doctor and ordered a special train be got ready.  Tried to telegraph to Adelaide, but the line was down.  It was nearly 7 a.m. when he started for the accident with as many men as he could muster.  On arrival he could see the back of Holme’s head and another man’s face, but could not recognise him on account of the face being parboiled by steam and hot water.

He sent Gitsham on to Farrell’s Flat to communicate with Adelaide, put out the engine fire and sent a man down the line with a danger flag.  [He then described the scene as has previously been set out.]

Henry C. Mais, Engineer-in-Chief and Manager of SAR produced a copy of the rules and regulations.

[He also described the scene.  He believed one reason for the collapse of the embankment was the nature of the material, but that was inevitable; it was necessary to use what was available.  In other places the water had flowed over the rails, depositing debris on the top, but not causing damage to the permanent way.  Had the culvert not been blocked up he believed it would have been capable of carrying away all ordinary storm waters.

The last body had not been removed till 7 p.m.  The body of the driver was in an almost vertical position among a lot of wheat and debris, but did not appear much bruised.  Homes was leaning out as if he had been looking ahead and thus doing his duty.  The fireman had hold of the steam-regulator.  The appearance of ballast above the chasm no doubt led them to believe the line was all right.

The duty of walking the line was performed at the lower end and he had not been aware until yesterday that it was not done up to the present time.

[Mais then outlined the regulations requiring the walking of the line.]

Branford was the Inspector of the Permanent Way and responsible for keeping this section of line in good order.

Mais had never received any report casting doubts on the safety of the embankment.  It was not Home’s duty to walk the line, but that of the men under him.  He had no idea the embankment was unsound.  The watermark on the telegraph poles was 12 ft high.

William Navin, ganger, said he was aware of the regulations re walking the line.  On the morning of the accident Mr Holmes had asked who was to walk the line. He said it was Thomas Roach’s turn; each man of the gang walking it in turn.  It was the custom to walk the line after the first goods train had passed.  This was because of instructions from Mr Branford in the previous September who said that the goods train driver and stoker had sufficient light to see any danger.  After that the line had always been inspected after the first goods had passed.  He had worked the line since its construction and had never known the culvert unable to carry away water, though he had observed the watermark above the line after heavy rains, but it had done no harm.

Patrick Roach said he recalled Navin reading out the instruction from Mr Branford.

He had received 7/6 a month for walking the line when it was in operation.

Henry Branford produced the instruction re ceasing to walk the line as requested by himself  and endorsed by R.C. Patterson, Chief Assistant Engineer.

The change was because the driver and fireman had sufficient light; it was not about saving money.

He considered it possible the accident could have been averted if men had walked the line, but it was not a certainty.  The breach would have been discovered, but the men might not have been able to stop the train.

[Much more detail around this matter is printed.]

He did not consider the embankment unsafe.  Never knew the water high enough to endanger it.  Several reports had said the bank was settling, but Mr Homes had never reported it unsafe.  Gitsham had similarly reported settling without saying it was unsafe.
