A letter is published from Dr Lynn Arnold AO, CEO of Anglicare Australia and Dr Jeffrey Driver, Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide.  It takes issue with the letter of Ken Grundy published last week:

The letter was ill-informed and did not fully reflect our views or those of Anglicare SA.  The Constitution of Australia reflects a time when Aboriginal people were discriminated against.  It allows any Australian Government to make laws based on race.  Section 25 allows people to be excluded from voting by virtue of their race alone.  Section 25 and Section 51 (xxvi) are no longer defensible and should be repealed.  We believe the Constitution should contain a statement guaranteeing cannot be legally discriminated against based on race. It should contain a statement recognising the value of Aboriginal peoples and their languages as the nationâ€™s first people.
