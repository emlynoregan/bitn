BCS.  Staff Profile: Janele Todd

I am a contract teacher at BCS for Term 1, which may be extended to a full year.  I am teaching English and Drama in the secondary school plus the Year 6 Class for a few lessons a week.  Although originally from Adelaide, I taught last year at Quorn area School, where I taught Humanities and also Speech and Debating in the Upper Primary Unit.  I enjoyed teaching the vast cross-section of age groups.  My interests include sports, reading, knitting, collecting stamps, drama, music and art – though I don’t get time to be fully involved in the last three.  Mt favourite sports include netball, cricket, tennis and basketball among others.  For the last couple of years I have been active in playing netball and cricket and umpiring netball.
