Football.  A letter from A.B. Riggs of the [New] Burra Football Association in reply to Mr Hogan.  The BFA held a meeting on 18 March 1925 and resolved that the Association go into recess for 12 months and that South Booborowie would retain the shield for that period.  The BFA met again 24 March 1926 and then resolved that the Association be wound up and the shield be returned and hung in the Burra Institute.  The then secretary was to retain the books and office sundries until another Burra Association be formed.  The Kooringa Football Association advertised its AGM for 1928 twice to enable all interested to be present.
