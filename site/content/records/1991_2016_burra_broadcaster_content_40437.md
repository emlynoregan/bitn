Aleppo Pines – Comments posted on Burra Broadcaster Website

Maureen

The effort is unlikely to eliminate the source of Christmas trees or of shady trees in the town.  The mine site has been identified as an important grassland site as it has not been grazed to any degree and as the location of some rare and endangered plants, it deserves protection.

Peter

The mine site has not been grassland for more than 150 years and will not support any plant native to this region.  The Aleppo has a valuable cultural heritage and tourists’ experience will be heightened when viewing a mine site framed by the trunks of mature trees.  They will also appreciate the shade.

Lisa

Aleppo pines seem to grow in places where not a blade of grass, native or introduced will dare.  The Aleppo grows and softens the town landscapes and, while I am all for preserving our history, I trust common sense prevails and a balance between green (of any sort) and history will be reached.

John

Any species that becomes invasive should be controlled – not necessarily eliminated, but controlled.  Native plants and grasses should be encouraged and this is almost impossible if tree growth becomes too large in numbers.
