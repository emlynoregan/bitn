Burra Hospital Christmas Festival

On the evening of 23 December the usual festivities were arranged in the grounds, organised by Mrs J.R. Barker & Mrs G.H. Dow with musical arrangements by G.E. Dane.  There was a very large attendance and cars lined the road for a quarter of a mile.  The Burra Brass Band under J.H. Murison played several selections in its first appearance.  Threatened rain held off till a slight shower right at the close.  [The program is printed.]  Board President I.J. Warnes presided and thanked all who contributed to such a successful occasion.  The Mayor also gave an address.  The financial position of the hospital was currently all right.  In the last 12 months 300 patients had passed through and expenses totalled c. £4,000.  Income was:	Government Subsidy	700

Rates from Councils	800

Patients’ Fees	1,500

Bequests	 700

£3,700

With some money in the bank the year had ended about balanced, but 1931 would start with nothing and so they would need all the support they could get.

Dr Steele on behalf of the Hospital thanked all involved.
