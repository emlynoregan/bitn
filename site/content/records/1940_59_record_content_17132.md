7,000 bales of wool

3,000 eggs per month

Burra imported 1,600 lb butter per month

1,800 lb fritz per month

200 lb of other cooked meats per month

The Mayor in answer to questions said no butter factory had been erected in the district and little ice cream was produced and Burra had no cold storage facilities for fruit and no local abattoirs.  A lot of casual labour was likely to be available after the war.

Mr Pope said and works established would provide only seasonal work and it would be paying 4% on capital in competition with older works whose interest charge was only 1%.  This disadvantage could be minimised by spreading the charge between the abattoirs and the freezing works.

W.D. Davies spoke as manager of the Burra Bacon Factory which had been going for three years.  He had been there for 12 months.  All his manufactures were being canned.  He would like the Government to lease him a portion of the factory, as had been done at Pt Lincoln.  There were sufficient pigs to keep a factory going all year.  With a radius of Hallett, Robertstown & Clare/Kybunga he could get 300 pigs a week.  He was currently handling 150.

G.S. Hawker said it was more profitable to send lambs to market by road at Â¼ a head than by rail at 10d per hear because they got less knocked around on a lorry.
