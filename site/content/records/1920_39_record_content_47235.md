Burra Town Council, 11 August

The Town Clerk reported the death of the Corporation horse – a good animal, and that 127 dogs had been registered.

Township lots sold by the Council had returned just sufficient to pay the rates due and the Council had become the owner of six comparatively valuable blocks.

The Council debated the problem of parking between Drew & Crewes and Walker’s where the bend made it dangerous.  The Mayor and Town Clerk will report on the matter next meeting.

Cr Dow raised the question of opening the road south from Justice Lane.

The Mayor reported there were 68 on rations in Burra and 33 at Mongolata.

There were no outstanding rates from 1932 and there would practically be none for 1933.

Cr Jennison was appointed Council representative on the Hospital Board.
