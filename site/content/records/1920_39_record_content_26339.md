Robbery.  ‘Frank Lang arrested on suspicion with the above robbery appeared at Redruth Police Court on Monday last and was remanded in custody until 12 noon today.’

[There is no mention of any ‘above robbery’, but the paper of 11 April on page 4 makes it clear that this refers to the Bon Accord safe theft.]
