Weather.

The weekend of Saturday & Sunday 5 & 6 February saw wild weather with heavy rainfall across SA.  Hallett had its heaviest rainfall ever, recording 98 mm, breaking the record of 81 mm in 1890.  The falls were associated with former tropical cyclone Yasi, which produced severe thunderstorms and flash flooding.    Roads are closed throughout the eastern district.  Several local homes were flooded and Yunta recorded 132 mm in 24 hours.  Falls to the east were also high.  Quondong Station recorded 130 mm over Friday & Saturday and 185.8 for the entire weekend.  It has had more than 560 mm since last September.  Falls at Woolgangi ranged from 50 to 75 mm.  Creeks and watercourses are flowing everywhere.  Burra recorded 46 mm in the 24 hrs to 9 a.m. Saturday.

Sample figures (in mm):

The Barrier Highway was closed and Terowie was isolated and without power until 9 p.m. Saturday night.  Houses in Yongalaâ€™s main street had to be sandbagged.  [Photo of Yongala.]
