The Mayor thanked them for the frank discussion, but thought Cr Bevan a bit hard on the ministers.  He was personally against Sunday tennis.

Cr Dow asked if they were not going to sell on account of Sunday tennis, then where did they stand on the agreement which clearly said no tennis on Good Friday or Sundays.

Cr Riggs amendment was passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Cr Dow then asked what this meant for the Easter Tournament, arranged for Good Friday.

Cr Riggs said he meant in his motion the agreement as it stood.

Cr Sampson said he referred to the sale of the property only.

The Mayor said he had no intention of upsetting the tennis tournament arrangements.

Cr Dow said there was a lot of humbug about Sunday tennis and yet nothing was said against Good Friday, the holiest day of the year.

Cr Kellaway said either a portion of the clause should be deleted or the agreement kept.

Cr Riggs said we were only asked to discuss the sale.

Cr Dow moved that the words Sunday and Good Friday tennis be deleted, but that lapsed for want of a seconder.

Plans by the Town Clerk to enlarge the rotunda were laid on the table.

Cr Dow moved:

The concrete floor be enlarged by increasing the diameter 6ft at its present level.

The balustrade be removed and provision made to replace it when required.

Electric lighting be changed to provide for eight points.

The cost be taken from the general fund.

Motion carried.
