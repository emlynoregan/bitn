Gold Fever in New South Wales

We hear from reliable sources by the overland route that gold has been discovered in large quantities in the Bathurst district.  A Mr Ellerton brought a lump weighing 9 oz.  The news has caused great excitement, with towns and stations being deserted and everything rising in price.  The universal feeling is that there will be a second California.

[Mr Hargrave’s discovery is then described.]

Extremely pure gold has been discovered in SA in the past, both by washing and in sundry dry diggings, as for example the Victoria Gold Mine.

‘A gold mania would be to these colonies a source of great misery, by diverting to a precarious pursuit labour that is now so profitably, productively and happily exerted in the cultivation of a generous soil.’
