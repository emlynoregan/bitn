On 16 September Burra wrote to the Board demanding payment of £1,750 in breach of his contract.

This sum represented:

Two years’ salary	1,400

Two years’ house rental	100

Two years’ water and fuel	50

Passage to England	200

On 27 September Burra received notice that the SA Mining Association had paid £26-17-0 into his bank account as being the full balance due to him.  Burra declined to accept this as settlement.

Fisher believed he had established a breach of contract and it was not his job to prove the validity of the cause of the dismissal; that was up to the defendants.

He claimed of the jury £1,750 less the £26-17-0 already transferred, plus such damages as the jury may determine.

Henry Ayers gave evidence of knowing the defendants and of acting as their agent in writing letters etc. He outlined events leading to Mr Burr’s appointment.  Mr Stocks Jnr had been Resident Director from February 1846 (appointed in December 1845) to February 1847.  Mr Chipman had been appointed Superintendent in January 1847 and it was his letter of resignation that had led to the approaches to Mr Burr in August.

Ayers said he had signed the letter of 31 august on behalf of the Directors named in the margin – their names had been inserted there at Burr’s request so he would know with whom he was dealing: Cass, Beck, J.B. Graham, W. Peacock, J. Waterhouse, W. Paxton, S. Stocks Jnr, J. Brown, J. Ellis and W. Allen.

Gwynne argued for a non-suit, largely on legal technicalities.  When this failed, he then addressed the issue of the causes for the dismissal; alleging Burr’s failure to carry out his duties in the terms of the contract.

One of Mr Burr’s duties was to assay ores, and another duty was not to purchase ores under 20% copper, or of an average less than 25% (in the event of lower grade and higher grade ores being mixed in a parcel of ore).  He should see that the ores were properly dressed.  He had also to keep a diary of events at the Mine.  (Burr contended that the extensive correspondence with Ayers met this requirement.)  He also had to oversee the erection of cottages.

Burr had asked for the appointment of an assistant, Hoskins, to do the actual assaying.  The Directors had grown dissatisfied with Hoskins and decided he could not be recognised as an assayer for the Mine.

On 12 June 1848 samples of ore were sent to Adelaide for assaying and the Directors became convinced that something was very rotten in the management.  On a visit to the Mine the Directors had found six heaps of ore totalling 6,550 tons.  Six samples were taken and half of each was given to Mr Burra to assay and half sent to Adelaide.  This ore had already been bought on the basis of 38⅛% copper.

Burr’s own assay returned 311/6%.  This meant the plaintiff had overpaid wages.

On the lower floor there was a heap of ore paid for and ready for shipment.  It was found that of this, heaps of upwards of 500 tons were less than 20% copper.  If sent to England the company would have drawn against it on the assumption it was at least 25% and so have tarnished the company’s reputation.

The cottages Burra was supposed to be supervising were also very defective.  Some were built without foundations, while others had leaky walls and walls that were not perpendicular.

Ayers gave evidence of telling Burr his duties on 14 September 1847 at Burra; Burr having arrived there on 10 September.  Copies of the rules were given him on 15 September when Ayers was leaving with the Directors.

When Ayers visited the Mine in August 1849 the cottages were no better, despite Burr’s complaints to the contractor (Taylor).  Burr had also failed to communicate the Directors reply to complaints from the miners, which had led to the 1848 strike.

Case adjourned.

Case resumed 3 November.

Fisher cross-examined Ayers.

Burra Mine first ground was broken on 29 September 1845.

The Directors were then: Beck, Graham, Peacock, Neales, Solomon, Stocks Jnr, Penny, Paxton and Bunce.

The Superintendent’s duties were to oversee and give direction to all underground excavations and surface work, including cleaning and dressing of the ore.

First Captain was Henry Roach, appointed January 1847.

Second Captain Bryant

Third Captain Goldsworthy

Fourth Captain Penglaze [print here is faulty, but the name when he gives evidence is Samuel Penglaze.]

Penglaze is the surface [or elsewhere the grass] captain.  His duty was to attend to ore dressing.

Written instructions dated 8 September 1847 were given to Burr on 15 September 1847.

Burr sent about 102 letters to the Secretary/Directors during his term, together with some thousands of documents, including the Superintendent’s Report.  Ayers swore that this latter was not in the form of a journal.  He could not say whether everything of importance was enumerated.  Witness assented to a long list of returns as being Burr’s duties.  After Burr had left, they had found no copies of the correspondence.  An incomplete diary had been found.  At first letters were transmitted weekly, but later as postal arrangements changed, they were sent twice weekly.

Questioning then turned to the cottages.

Ayers said he had not seen the cottages from 10 August until after Burr’s dismissal.  (A contract was presented for the erection of the 40 cottages, the subject of complaint.  It was in Burr’s handwriting and dated 5 April 1848.)

The cottages were to cost £45 each.  Some were unfinished when Burr was dismissed and had been continued by the same contractor, who had been paid about £200.  Some stone cottages had been built before that of 3-4 rooms each, at a cost of c. £150 each.  They had been erected under the supervision of a distinguished architect.  [Kingston]

The smelting house in stone and brick had cost £1,500.

Ayers admitted that these cottages ‘were all cracks’ as was the smelting house, though ‘not more cracks than in other buildings in town’. 

Fisher was queried as to relevance and said he intended to show these cracked buildings were erected under the supervision of one of the complaining parties.

Ayers said the census had show there were c. 1,500 living at the Mine – a number of them ‘in holes excavated’.
