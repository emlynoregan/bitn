Final of the Burra Red Cross Junior Competition took place on Friday afternoon in the form of a Children’s Tea Party.  The opening was performed by Mrs Brian Swift of Adelaide, daughter of Mrs John Tennant, who for many years until 1939 was President of the Burra Red Cross Branch.

During the afternoon Lieut. H. Morphett AIF (returned) gave a brief, but interesting talk on his life in the battle front overseas.

The total money raised was £798-17-3 and Baby Reed headed the contest with £409-19-0.
