Obituary.  Thomas Williams, late of Ironmine, was buried at Burra Cemetery on 23 April.  He was born at Jamestown almost 77 years ago and lived in that neighbourhood till 1917.  In 1901 he married Harriet Ellen Barnett and until they left the district the family was connected with the Presbyterian Church, of which Mr Williams was a trustee at Belalie.  When they moved to Clover Hill (Georgetown) they attended the Baptist Church and at Ironmine they went to the Methodist Church.  They moved to Ironmine in 1927, taking up land now held by his son, Milton.  Mr Williams was a keen rifleman at both Jamestown and Georgetown.  Ill health forced him to go to live with his daughter Mrs Nykiel about seven years ago.  There were eight children:  Everard & Jean deceased, Violet Mrs Tucker of Kingscote, Julia Mrs Nykiel of Glenelg, Milton of Ironmine, Ethel Mrs Morgan of Seaton Park, Keith of Kapunda and formerly of Ironmine and Gordon of Muston Kangaroo Island.  At the time of Mr Williamsâ€™ death he and his wife were staying with Keith at Kapunda.

[Born 9 June 1877 Belalie East: died 22 April 1954 Kapunda, residence Glenelg.]
