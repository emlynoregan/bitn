Marlene Wooton has been recognised for thirty years tireless service to the district’s senior citizens.  She was given a lunch by about 60 members of the Burra Leisure Activity Group.  The LAG was her brainchild 30 years ago while she spent three months in hospital recovering from a back injury.  It operated initially from a spare room at the Burra Hospital.  For five years she worked as a volunteer before the Yorke and Lower North Health Service acknowledged the value of her effort by placing her on the payroll.  They and the Council then helped in securing the old Aberdeen Football Club rooms at Burra North.  YLNHS and LAG members were enthusiastic about acknowledging Marlene’s work over all the years.  Marlene said the whole group of members and volunteers had become like an extended family.  Marlene acknowledged the support of her husband, Gordon, and her children.  She has won many awards over the years for her efforts.  A presentation was made of a gold bracelet.
