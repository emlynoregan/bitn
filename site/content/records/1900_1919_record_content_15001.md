Burra Musical & Dramatic Club’s performance of Our Boys at the Institute on Friday evening drew a splendid attendance.  The large hall was well filled and over £13 was taken for the reserved seats.  The performance was very good, and is reviewed in something over a column.  In all over £22 was taken.
