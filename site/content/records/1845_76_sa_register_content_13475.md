Kooringa News, 30 May

The Bible Christian Sunday School celebrated its Anniversary on Sunday when sermons were preached by Rev. Way.  The chapel was filled to overflowing.  On Monday the students and teachers walked in procession, accompanied by music and banners.  A shower of rain somewhat dampened the spirits of both students and teachers.  A tea feast was followed by a public meeting presided over by Mr Thomas Richards.

Thursday last, Her Majesty’s birthday and Whit Monday were both observed as a half holiday.  Almost all shops were shut and races were held at Dry Hill [Cross Roads] on Monday, but they were thinly attended.
