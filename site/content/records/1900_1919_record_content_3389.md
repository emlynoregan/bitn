F.W. Holder’s Banquet.  A large send-off is planned for Mr Holder, Premier of SA, in the form of a public banquet in the Burra Institute on 13 May.  It is c. 13 years since he was first returned to Parliament to represent the Burra District.  Various Ministers of the Crown will attend.  There is a letter from the organising committee urging people to secure their seats by buying tickets by the 8 May, as by then the caterers need to know the numbers.  Single ticket 3/-, Double (Lady & Gentleman) 5/- and Lady 2/6.
