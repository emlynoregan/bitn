Football.  Rambler’s Football Club meeting 14 April drew 30 enthusiasts.  The idea for a club came from Rambler’s Cricket Club in the absence of much local enthusiasm for football in other directions.  Two teams will be formed.  Elected: Patron, John Barker; President, N. Hiles Pearse; Secretary, E.C. Johnson; Assistant Secretary, Bert Aldridge.
