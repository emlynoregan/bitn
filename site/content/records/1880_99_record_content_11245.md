Cr Rayner said £425 had been available for North Ward and £411 had been spent, but work in hand would use more than the balance.  Kerbing had been the main item.  Not so much had been spent in Redruth as in Aberdeen, but the kerbing would not have to be done again.  The mayor regretted that the footway from Kooringa to Aberdeen had not been gone on with due to conflict with the Road Board.  This would change if the Council eventually got control of the main roads within the Corporation.  Mr Rayner was proposed and 2nd for another term, but could not give a definite answer yet.
