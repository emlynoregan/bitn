Burra Amateur Swimming Club opened its season 10 December with temperatures near the century.  About 200 people visited the pool.  For this year dressing rooms were built and paths graded and steps cut into sloping banks.  The water is deeper than last year and the approaches safer.  P.L. Rosman Vice-President performed the ceremony in the absence of President T.H. Woollacott.  Mr Carne the Secretary will soon leave Burra and will be hard to replace.  A bridge has been built across the neck of the pool and was a great boon to bathers.  Money was needed to finance improvements.  Much work has been put in by R. & C. Fuss for which the committee are grateful.  Messrs E. Steer & L. Thomas were thanked for help with beginners.  Others who had provided help and material were Messrs Steele of the Forest, W. Carpenter, W. Hunt and H. Jennison.  Results of competitions are printed.
