Burra Town Council

The Mayor and Town Clerk are to discuss with ETSA the establishment of a depot and its likely sites.

Mrs Baynes will be appointed office assistant for six three-hour sessions per fortnight, until the end of the financial year.

SA Housing Trust is to be asked to consider building rental accommodation in Burra due to the lack of rental houses in the town.

[In response to this it was reported on page 1 that the Trust had sent up application forms.]

St Mary’s Ladies’ Guild held its AGM on 28 April.  Mrs Drought was thanked for her leadership and farewelled.

£50 and 12 theatre gowns had been sent to the Mitchell River Mission.  A report on other activities for the year occupies c. ¾ column.
