Frank Slatter of Spalding says today is the 25th anniversary of his arrival in SA.  He and a mate, Bert Poole, came to Adelaide on the Omar having been sent from Balliol College Boys Club in Oxford to learn Farming.  They commenced at the Booborowie Experimental Farm.  Frank put in six years there, ending up as head stockman.  Bert Poole returned to England in the depression, but Frank thinks there are a number of the lads who worked on the Booborowie Farm still in Australia.  He would be glad to hear from any.
