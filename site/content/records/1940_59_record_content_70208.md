St Mary’s.  The organ recital on Thursday night by Mr Clem Davey, supported by soprano Marjorie Forsaith and baritone Mr L.H. Thomas, raised £30 for the organ fund.  Mr R. Sandercock took a tape recording from which it is hoped records can be cut to aid the cause.  The organ needs an overhaul after 40 years of service and about £60 [£600?] is needed.  To date about £150 has been raised.
