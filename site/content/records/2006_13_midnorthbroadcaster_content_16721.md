Robertstown’s Peace Hall was dedicated 90 years ago on 18 April 1923.

History of the hall:

10 December 1918 Peace Institute Trust bought the land from the Crown Lands Department.

Specifications drawn up by Diekmann Bros of Gawler and tenders called.

After a recess of two years the tender o£1550 from T.H. Woollacott Jnr was accepted.

On 7 October 1922 the foundation stone was laid by W.W. Mosey.  The inscribed trowel is presently in a trophy cupboard in the supper room.

The trust was dissolved in 1926.

In April 1925 the adjoining block, now known as the car park, was purchased.

November 1925 a lighting plant was purchased.

In 1956 a large supper room and kitchen were added by R.H. Sachse for £2650.

Supper room opened by George Hambour MP 23 November 1956.

The cloak room was converted to a ladies’ powder room and toilet by T.B. Voigt and opened 3 May 1963.  There was a celebratory debutante ball in the evening.

A front porch and toilet block at the rear were added in 1967 for $1,800.

A day centre room, bar, store room, inside men’s toilet and remodelled kitchen were added in 1996 by the DC of Robertstown.

In 1999 acoustics were improved at a cost of $16,700 and the interior was repainted.

In 2003 a barbecue area was added and opened on the 80th anniversary of the hall.

Stage lighting has been added and the supper room acoustics improved in 2010.

The hall is now owned by the Regional Council of Goyder. And the exterior was repainted in 2012.

An annual strawberry fete in November raised money for maintenance.
