Fire Inquest.  There was an investigation Thursday into the fire that destroyed the house occupied by Mrs Treweek at Kooringa.

Mary Margaret Treweek said she was awoken by her daughter at 1 a.m. who said the house was on fire in the S-W corner.  She blamed Mr Kroncke for setting it alight in an act of arson.  Kroncke had told his wife two years ago that he would put a match to the house.  Her husband had bought the lease for the house from Kroncke for £2.

Laura Treweek said she had awoken to see the roof on fire over her head and had wakened her mother.

Eliza Treweek (sister of previous) corroborated this.

Henry Edward McNamara, a neighbour, and P-C John Worthy Johnson gave supporting evidence on the blaze.

Carl Kroncke, labourer, denied all accusations and said he had slept the whole night in his house, the early part on a sofa and later with his wife.  Mary Kroncke, his wife, corroborated this.

The jury found that the fire was wilfully set and ‘strong suspicion attaches to Carl Kroncke, the previous lessee of the house.
