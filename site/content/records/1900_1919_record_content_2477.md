Redruth Reformatory.  For Christmas Sir E.T. Smith and Mr C. Birks presented a swing to the Reformatory and Mr Taylor and friends gave a parcel of games and books and a parcel of surprises for the table on Christmas morning.  Matron Holden remembered those in her care and her gifts were much appreciated.
