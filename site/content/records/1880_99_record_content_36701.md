While the tax was quite popular at the last election we think on more consideration it requires further thought and has certain flaws.  If the aim is, as Dr Cockburn says, to break up the large estates and change them from pastoralism to farming, is this going to achieve it?  We feel the large estates can afford to pay the tax and therefore will not be broken up and for land beyond the rainfall area such would not be beneficial and the tax would have no effect on the town and city holdings.  Therefore without significant changes it becomes merely a revenue raising devise.  We would agree with a single property tax.  Still we do advocate the cutting up of the large estates where they are not put to best use, but in doing away with monopoly we must not turn robbers.
