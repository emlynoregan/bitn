Burra Mine Area opened as a Tourist Resort

On Friday a large gathering of local and district residents attended the opening of the Burra Mine area as a Tourist Resort by Mr P.F. Pollnitz, Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau.  It took place at the gate on the eastern side of the mine area.  Also present were the Town Mayor & Mrs Baulderstone and Mr P.H. Quirke MP with Mrs Quirke.  The Burra Town Clerk Mr R.W. Fullgrabe introduced the Mayor who welcomed guests.  The Mayor said the Council had brochures printed giving a brief history of the Mine and its workings, to give visitors an idea of what they were inspecting.  In 1845 the Burra Mine had prevented SA from going bankrupt and the importance of this fact makes it essential that every effort be made to preserve these old workings.  Ex-Councillor H.C. Cummins had first suggested ‘selling’ the mine to visitors as a tourist resort, but up to that time not much thought had been given to the idea and the Mine had mainly been used as a rubbish dump site.  Mr Baulderstone said he soon fell in with the idea, as he realised what a wonderful venture it could prove.  Later he had the opportunity of showing Mr Polnitz over the site and from his enthusiasm had been much heartened.  The response to a public meeting to discuss the matter was disheartening, but he and his Councillors had battled on and though they had aimed to open it in March, it had not been ready until now.  He thanked former Burra High School Headmaster Mr Murray scrivener for writing the history used in the brochure.  He also thanked Mr P.H. Quirke for tracing facts used in it, Mr McGrath for his reproduction of photos and Mr S. Sleader for lending the same.  The Burra Record was thanked for printing it.  There was still much to be done.

Through the efforts of Mr Rex Warnes the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society has agreed to return the Old Jinker to be preserved on the Mine Property and this would be part of the Museum collection.

Mr Pollnitz then opened the site.  He said other countries went to much more trouble to ‘sell’ their historical attractions and we should also.  Burra needed to encourage people to stay in the town to see the attractions.  He would encourage the formation of a museum as mentioned by the Mayor.

Mr Quirke moved a vote of thanks and spoke of the amount of information and other material available for such a museum project.  [Photo of the Mine in working condition: probably taken in 1869 just before conversion to open cut operation.]
