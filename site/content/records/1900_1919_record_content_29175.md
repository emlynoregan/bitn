A Bolt.  The horses in W.H. Stevensonâ€™s buggy were tied to the verandah post at the post office on Saturday when they became frightened.  They broke the bridle, pulled down the post and dashed for home along the road to Aberdeen.  They went up the hill, past the station and were only stopped at the gate to Springbank by Mr Lewis who followed in a car.  Amazingly no damage was done to the buggy or the horses, other than the broken bridle.
