Northern Trail-Riding Club of Burra.  Recently six members and their horses went to Bendelby Station near Orroroo for four days of scenic trail riding on the property of Warren and Jane Luckcraft.  The visitors stayed in well equipped shearersâ€™ quarters and enjoyed some rugged riding in very scenic terrain.
