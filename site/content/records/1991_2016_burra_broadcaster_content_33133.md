The Department for Environment & Heritage has acquired the Tooralie Gorge property of 2,900 ha, adjoining the Caroona Creek Conservation Park.  The park contains exceptionally high biodiversity values and has long been ungrazed by livestock.  Short term management issues include road reserve closures and feral animal control.  Hopkins Creek Conservation Park in the Burra Hills also contains exceptionally high biodiversity values and it is for these that it is being maintained rather than for visitor access.  Redbanks Conservation Park will be promoted by the SA Museum as a site where the public can see and visit mega fauna fossils.  A resource centre is required in Burra to display replicas and examples of mega fauna.  Successful burning and grazing trials were held at Mokota Conservation Park in autumn 2003 and more are planned for 2004.  Burns have proved particularly useful in removing horehound seed, with 80% gone in one year and most in subsequent years.  Aerial feral goat shooting is planned for Caroona Creek and Redbanks Parks in March.  Co-ordinated fox baiting is also planned for 2004.  Funding has been allocated for boxthorn, peppertree and artichoke control along Baldina Creek.  A section of the Hallelujah Hills has been acquired by World’s End Conservation Pty Ltd, a private group of conservationists.  It is a 415 ha property of high biodiversity.  There is concern over vandalism of Aboriginal rock art along Stone Chimney Creek.
