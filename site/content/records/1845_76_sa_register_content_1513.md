Burra Burra Mine

A recent visitor has been astonished at the self-evident richness of the property.

Nothing decisive has been done at the Bon accord, but people there had raised a small quantity of good ore.

He did not visit the Princess Royal, but other sources report some beautiful sample of ore among the last productions.
