The Burra Mine

The talk here has been of nothing except the complete cessation of all work at the Mine.  A notice was posted last Friday that all work would cease on Thursday 24 September.  People feared that after the news in last weekâ€™s Register all work would cease, but few anticipated all creek dressing would stop so soon.  Such, though, is the case.  At the end of this week there will not be a single tributer at work and in two months it is thought not a single person will be raising or dressing ore by the present method.  Reports also say that at the end of that time the engine will be halted and the water be allowed to rise to its natural level.  The miners fear that when that happens the timbers will slip from their places and all the ground above will sink down to form a vast quagmire, being dangerous to work on and very difficult to remove.  Future mining in that ground would be all but impossible.  No doubt all this has been considered.

The effect of this complete stoppage will be disastrous for the working and business classes.  Already men are leaving daily for Wallaroo and once they have found homes their families will follow.  When the new works commence a complete change of population will have taken place.  About 300 men and boys are now employed.
