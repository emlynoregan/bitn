The Editor (Terry Wilson) writes on the need for Burra to have an industrial zone, which has been a matter of some discussion for quite a while.  Three factors limit possibilities in Burra:

Zoning regulations

Perceived heritage conflict

Nearness to a watercourse

Enquiries from the Broadcaster over two years have elicited no replies except prevarication.  A firm industrial base would help boost the townâ€™s dwindling business activity and help the ancillary services and shopping facilities to thrive.  Other towns in other areas with similar problems have tackled the difficulties and done things such as offering sites and services or free rate periods of up to five years.

A project with only twenty extra incomes would have a positive effect and look what happened to real estate values when Adchem shed fifty workers.  As a result families left, school numbers fell and there was a glut of empty houses.

If the decline of the town as a service centre is not seen as a dangerous option, decisions will drift on as they have been for two years.
