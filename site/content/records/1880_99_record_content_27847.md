Letter from W.T. Rabbich re the proposed stock tax.  He considers the Council could do well out of building their own stockyards, but opposes any extra 1/- rate as an alternative.  He estimates that for an initial outlay of £1,000 they could earn c. £500 p.a. at a charge of ¼d a head.  No one would buy by sample and nor would shifting the saleyards out of town be so easy: what would the District Council’s reaction be to that?
