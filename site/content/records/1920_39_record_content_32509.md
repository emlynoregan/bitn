Burra Town Council, 16 November

A letter from the RSL Burra asked why Council had not responded to a request for the reasons for moving the guns from Market Square.

Cr Lee moved a reply be sent regretting any feelings the RSA has that a slur had been cast by the lack of a reply, but the Council had not arrived at a decision on the subject matter.

The Council reserves the right to deal with its own property as it deems to be in the best interests of the town.

Council received a letter about land adjacent to Mr J.H. Smith’s.  The Council had sold it under the belief it was a gazetted road.  It is not and the contract will have to be cancelled and the money returned.

The Town Clerk said he remembered it being used as a road and believed the Council had a claim.

The Public works Report was submitted for work to be adopted.

Cr Woollacott objected to its inclusion of metalling from Young St.  [The report as printed says tar-dressed from Young St to the Racecourse Gate.]  He said it shouldn’t be approved in the dying hours of the Council without North Ward Councillors being consulted.

The Mayor demanded he withdraw this, as Cr Morgan was at the committee meeting and anyway the matter was a Main Road concern, not a Ward concern.

A very heated altercation ensued, but the motion was ultimately put with Cr Woollacott against.

Cr Allen moved to rescind the motion denying Mr Treloar the right to have pine trees removed from in front of his property.  This motion was lost.
