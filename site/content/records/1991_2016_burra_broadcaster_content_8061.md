Wesfarmers Dalgety celebrated 10 years in their present location in Market Square last week.  ‘Ploughback’ money raised from local purchases provided a cheque for $2,250 for the Burra Hospital.  It was handed to Lesley Phillips, Executive Officer & Director of Nursing.  This has enabled the hospital to purchase a foetal heart monitor.  Another cheque for $1,945 went to the Burra Kindergarten for a new fence.
