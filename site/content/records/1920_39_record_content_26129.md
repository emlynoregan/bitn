Burra Town Council, 5 March

C.A. Smith, architect of Adelaide, applied for permission to erect a bathroom and lavatory on the north end of the second storey of the Burra Hotel.  The Town Clerk said this would place them over a street.  It would be different if this was a right of way.  The building would be supported by a bearer wall and would be practically over to Mr Dower’s premises.  Application denied.

J.S. Williams was granted permission to build a motor shed at Redruth.

Dying and rotten trees near the Rectory are to be removed.

Road matters were discussed and some works approved.

Cr Harris reported damage to willows along Burra Creek.  (General opinion is that most of the damage has not been done by children.)

The Overseer reported that heavy timber 9” x 4” had been dislodged from the Avenue and thrown into the creek.  Other acts of vandalism were reported.

Some drainage matters were raised.

Work to the Bon Accord Bridge concerning the banking up of the road is reported as having been done well.

[The Overseer’s comments indicate the Council was using the Hospital Quarry & Ford’s Quarry.]
