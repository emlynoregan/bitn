Burra Town Council, 21 November

Results of the Municipal Elections [as already noted] were announced.

Council refused to receive an unsigned typed letter purporting to come from local butchers and claiming that unlicensed persons were selling meat in the town.

The Mayor had sympathy, but such a letter could not be received.

The law was odd that local butchers had to comply and be licensed, but anyone could bring in any sort of meat from outside and there was no case or redress against them.

A further allotment of Â£132 from the Unemployment Scheme has been received for work on the Kapunda-Peterborough and Clare main roads.
