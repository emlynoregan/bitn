Mr & Mrs Alphonzo Richardson celebrated their Golden Wedding at Nelson, Burra, last Wednesday.  A spacious marquee was erected and a large number of friends and family attended.  Mr Richardson was born in Bermuda in 1829 and his wife was born there in 1840.  They were married at Wesley Church, Bermuda on 6 April 1860 and later migrated to Australia with eight children and three nephews: Messrs J.E. & W. Doe and R.H. Steele.  They have lived in Burra ever since.  Mr C.A. Fuss, an old friend of the family, proposed the toast to the coupleâ€™s health and happiness.
