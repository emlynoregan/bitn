Redruth Court, Wednesday

The embezzlement case against William Barkley is reported at length in about 2⅓ columns.  The court was crowded and the case was heard by P. Lane & J. Sampson.

Counsel examined carefully the operations of the round of the van driven by Barkley in the Hanson district and also his behaviour while taking charge of the business during Jordan’s illness.  Jordan alleged that he had been robbed by Barkley’s behaviour in allowing unauthorised discounts on accounts when they were paid and by his purchase of such things as eggs at prices in excess of those he was instructed to pay – 5½d a dozen instead of 5d.  On the other hand much of the evidence revealed Barkley to have worked very long hours, sometimes being out with the van till after midnight, and to have done other work suggesting he was diligent and reliable.  His virtual running of the business during Jordan’s illness was also brought up.  Jordan was shown to have dismissed Barkley abruptly without warning and without asking for any explanation and without giving any reason.  There was no evidence to show that the accused had benefited financially from any of his actions.

The bench decided there was no case to answer.

A second and associated charge of falsifying the books was also dismissed.
