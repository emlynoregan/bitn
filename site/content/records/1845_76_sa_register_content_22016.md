Report on the Board of Education.  [Editorial]

In the last twelve months 28 licensed teachers resigned their connection with the Board and with but one or two exceptions it seems it was due to being unable to make a living.  Even in places where the population is large enough the fees are often so small as to be inadequate to sustain the teacher and his family.  Many parents are too poor to pay fees and too proud to classify their children as destitute.  Others have money, but prefer to put their children to work.  Attendance is also often very irregular.  In areas of scattered settlement the position is even worse.  Some attempts have been made to have a school teacher teach alternately at two sites – but with very doubtful success.  The number of destitute children rose by 174 in the past year and for this year is expected to rise further.  One bright spot was an increase in the attendance of children aged 11 or over.  Attendance at night schools also rose.  Last July 625 attended at night.  A training school for teachers is required.  Many schools operate in very poor buildings – badly ventilated and overcrowded.
