Sgt L.H. Thomas sends a letter to his mother from Palestine.  He tells of the trip to reach the camp at Jerusalem.  He describes a long train trip across the desert and of meeting Mavis Riggs at one point where they detrained and were stopped for three hours.  She was at a hospital there and they had a long yarn.  Clem Davey was at the same camp.
