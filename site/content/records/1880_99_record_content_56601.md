The Mayor was sorry it contained statements about abusive language.

Cr Harris then said that the report about works was true and Mr Launder told him the parts about expressions used were true.

Cr Sampson said that none of the Councillors was present and if they were the Council should not be dragged into it.

Cr West objected that the report contained falsehoods about himself.  It said he wanted the work stopped, which was untrue.

Cr Harris and Cr Sampson had a nasty exchange and the Mayor called for order.

Cr Sampson objected to Cr Hardy being allowed to write with venom and spleen and slander ratepayers under protection of Council.  If it continues it would be better for all Council to resign and he was disgusted at Cr Harris’s support for the report.

After some further acrimonious exchanges the Mayor said it would not be fair to accept the report and finally he refused to put the motion, as the severe condemnation of a ratepayer was for acts and statements not specifically stated and for which no evidence had been advanced and to which the person in question had no opportunity to reply.

After some further verbal sparring a committee was formed to attend to clearing away dead trees and prepare for new plantings.

Cr Sampson drew attention to the damage done by young boys to the oval wall.

There was another acrimonious discussion on the new by-law affecting hawkers.

Cr Sampson said it was only a fad of Cr Hardy’s.

Hardy objected to ‘fad’, so Sampson withdrew it in favour of ‘mania’.

Hardy accused Sampson of telling deliberate lies in outlining how the by-law came about.

Sampson said Hardy had presented the by-law as drafted and prepared by him, but it had come from Wallaroo.  No one had asked for such a law in Burra: it was merely Cr Hardy’s mania.

Cr Parks supported Hardy.

Cr Rabbich supported the by-law after Sampson had given the example that a few weeks ago they had to pay 4d to 6d a pound for meat, but it fell to something like 2d a pound once outsiders advised they were prepared to supply meat.

Cr Sampson believed the by-law would lead to higher prices.

Cr West opposed the by-law.

Hardy said it was not introduced to suit any ratepayer, but to compel hawkers to pay something towards expenses as well as storekeepers.

Eventually the Mayor ruled it be dealt with at the next meeting.
