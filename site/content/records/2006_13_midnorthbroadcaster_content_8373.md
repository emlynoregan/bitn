Meals on Wheels will mark its annual day of celebration with special meals and visits from local chefs.  In Burra Mary Dunstall and Jan Tiver will deliver a special meal to Bill Webb at his home to mark the occasion.  Jan has been a volunteer with Meals on Wheels since its inception 38 years ago.  Bill has been receiving meals for the past 22 years, making him by far the longest serving recipient in Burra.  A team of 45 volunteers deliver meals to 25 Burra residents, five days a week.
