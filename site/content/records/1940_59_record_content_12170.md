AC1 Dudley Field was given a social at Leighton Hall on 5 December.  He is the second son of Mr & Mrs Jack Field of Leighton.  Dancing from 9 to 10 was followed by speeches and the presentation.  Speakers were A.D. McDonald MP, Mr Roy Earle and Cr Lomman.  Dudley had gone to the local school and then to Burra High School.  He had been good at sport.  He was well known in the district ‘owing to being on the grocery round’.  Dancing continued to midnight when supper was served.
