Burra Town Council, 3 October

Burra DC is prepared to receive a deputation from the Town Council about the road to Princess Royal.

Cr Bevan and the Mayor had a heated exchange over the matter of payments to cart metal at 1/- a yard which had attracted no offers from lorry drivers, but one from a dray.

A letter was opened in which T. Bown offered to cart from Burra Quarry to the racecourse gate for 1/- a yard.  As it had been addressed to the DC Crs Bevan & Jennison said it could not be received.

The Town Clerk said the envelope had been addressed to the Town Council.

Cr March moved that the previous motion lapse as no offers were received and that prices be asked for.  It was finally resolved to ask for offers at 1/4 a yard.
