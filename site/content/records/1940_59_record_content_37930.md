Mr J. Harris, who works at H.J.B. Jennison’s Tyre Service, was severely burnt about the face on Thursday.  The boiler that is used in the re-treading department had just been examined by the Boiler Inspector and Mr Harris had treated the inside of it to prevent rust.  To speed up the drying process Mr Harris placed a rag soaked in kerosene in the boiler and lit it with a match.  A little later he opened the furnace door to see if the rag was burning.  Evidently it was smouldering, but the draught from opening the door allowed the vapour to ignite explosively, shooting flames into Mr Harris’s face.  He is presently at Burra Hospital, where he is making a rapid recovery.
