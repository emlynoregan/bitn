SA Mining Association [Editorial]

The half-yearly report of the Directors was forwarded to shareholders a few days ago and the half-yearly meeting was held last Wednesday.  The operations of the Association have, it appears, been more successful during the past 6 months than those of the two preceding years.  The quantity of ore raised amounted to 6,940 tons.  A portion of this was obtained from dressing refuse ores from former periods.  A t the close of the half-year ending 31 March there was on hand at the Mine 4396 tons of ore.  This, added to yield of the last six months brings the quantity to 11,336 tons.  Of this 5,807 tons have been delivered to the Copper Co. for smelting and 5,528 tons remain at the Mine.  About 600 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide since the last report, at an average of £101-13-10 per ton, but the declining price of copper in London has meant the Directors have had to reduce the price here to £95 per ton.  There are about 70 tons of copper presently on hand.  To the end of September 1859 the cost of producing 6,979 tons of ore was £81,134-17-4.  This ore realised £93,239-4-8, leaving a nett profit of £12,104-XX-X.  The cost of raising the ore referred to was £11-12-6 per ton and the nett proceeds were £13-7-2 per ton; making the profit £1-14-8 per ton.  This is not as favourable a result as previously.

For the last half-year and for the previous half-year the amounts realised per ton have been considerably lower than for previous sales.  The Directors do not indicate whether this is due to a lower quality of ore or to a fall in the price of copper.  It is probably the former, resulting from the admixture of ores recently raised with ores from a previous period.  The Directors do not expect the results of the next report to be as good as the present, though they do say the half year just finished shows an improvement.  In estimating profits the Directors have to deal with three half-year periods; namely the half-year profits that have been attained by actual returns, and the two succeeding half-year profits, which can only be approximately estimated.  For the first of these periods to 30 September 1859, the profits ascertained are £12,104-7-4, for the second, to 31 March 1860, the profits are estimated to be £11,000 and for the period to 29 September 1860 the profits estimated are £13,231-7-1.  The absolute balance in the hands of Directors is £24,444-12-5.  Out of this they intend to pay a dividend of £5 per share [100%] before the end of next March.  In addition to the balance on hand, the value of ore and copper not yet realised is estimated at £24,231-7-1, making the total profit balance £48,675-19-6.

The Captain’s reports of the Mine continue to be very favourable both with respect to the present ground and future prospects.  The expenditure in connection with the Karkulto Mine appears to have been £31,407.  Captain Roach’s account of this mine is also favourable and the Directors hope to make it produce a profit in the future to counter the heavy expenses already incurred.  The Directors have one of their captains in the far north examining and reporting on the mineral nature of the country there.  We do not infer from their report that they entertain great hopes of important mineral discoveries.  With respect to three of the four mining claims near Mt McKinlay that Captain Bryant was sent to test, he has recommended abandoning three of them.

The number of persons employed by the company is 953, being a reduction of 125.  Doubtless this is due to the large demand for miners in other parts of the colony rather than a decline in the demand at the Burra Burra Mine.
