Accident.  The notorious S-bend just north of Mt Bryan has claimed another victim.  A semi-trailer loaded with hay rolled over there last Tuesday morning about 8.40 a.m. Police, Hallett SES and Mt Bryan CFS attended.  The driver was not seriously injured, but was taken to Burra Hospital for observation.  The accident again raised questions about removing this dangerous bend.  Clearing the site took about six hours.
