Burra Hospital Secretary, Mr J. Chilton has sought to allay the fears of some members of the community about possible changes to the townâ€™s hospital services.  Recent reports have said the Health Commission has plans to restrict services in smaller country hospitals, by centralising obstetrics and surgery in larger centres.  He said that to date no information from the Health Commission detailing these objectives had been received by Burra Hospital or any other Hospital in Central Sector Country Area 2 (Snowtown, Clare, Riverton, Burra and Blyth).  It is anticipated discussions will start soon.  When similar proposals were planned in the Barossa Valley there was considerable opposition and the proposals were modified to the satisfaction of all concerned.  The staff and Board of Burra Hospital will strenuously oppose any attempt to reduce or remove existing services and will seek public support if required.
