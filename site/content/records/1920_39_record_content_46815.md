Burra Town Council, 3 July

Messrs Finch & Son offer to help cart gravel at 4/- per load and to supply the gravel free for the road near the cemetery to their property.  Consideration was deferred.

P.A. McBride gives permission for ‘Johnny Green’ to be erected on the site chosen by Council.

R. Warnes, stationmaster, advised that the flooding from the station yard was from overflow from the overhead tank and was unlikely to recur.

Ratepayers desirous of working out their rates are to be allowed to do so.

IOOUF Aberdeen lodged an application to build additions to the lodge room.  Granted.

Various minor road works approved.
