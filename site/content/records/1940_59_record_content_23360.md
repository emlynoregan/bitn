Thousands of Golden Carp are dying through lack of water in the Government Dam on Block A in the Hundred of Baldina.  It is likely some ova will remain unhatched in the mud for a considerable time, allowing the dam to again fill with fish when water returns.  The fish, dying or dead, weigh from two pounds to the tiniest of wrigglers.  When cooked they are not relished by people who know anything about edible fish.
