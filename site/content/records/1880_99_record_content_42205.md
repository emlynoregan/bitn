Editorial on Larrikinism.

From time to time the larrikin element presents itself and at Kooringa Magistrate’s Court on Thursday three individuals were charged by L-Cpl Thomas with disturbing the peace and maliciously breaking windows of a house in Roach St.

At about 11.30 on Wednesday night a resident of Bridge Terrace was disturbed by someone forcing open his door.  He went to the door to be confronted by three men who asked where a certain person lived.  When threatened with the police they left and at 2 a.m. on Thursday three men of a like description appeared in Roach St where they aroused and annoyed the neighbourhood and scared the occupiers.  The same person as before was asked for.  They were asked to leave, but instead broke the windows of the house and terrorised the lace for two hours before a woman managed to escape and sought the police.

On 21 December 1889 three youths broke windows of a house in Commercial St – though on that occasion more by accident than intent.

On this occasion the men were let off lightly with fines of 10/- and 2/- damaged each.

The neighbourhood is being continually annoyed night after night with someone patrolling about after certain degraded reprobates.  Responsibility falls on the shoulders of the person who directed the strangers to Roach St.

‘Kooringa is troubled with two or three old hags who deserve to be tarred and feathered and then hunted like dogs out of a respectable community.  The authorities need to take the matter seriously and leave no stone unturned to punish the guilty.
