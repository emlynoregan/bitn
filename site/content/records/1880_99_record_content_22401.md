Carl Obst substantiated the above, saying the deceased had three glasses of beer before Arnold came and was not tipsy when we left Midwinter’s.

William Midwinter jun. son of William Midwinter who keeps the Woodcutter’s Arms* Baldina, agreed that the deceased was not the worse for liquor.

The verdict was death by a wagon passing over his body and was accidental and not otherwise.
