Mr McBride MHR met with the Burra Mayor and Cr T.H. Woollacott to hear their submission on extra petrol for persons employed by farmers and pastoralists.  At present they come under the heading of private motorists, but have to use their cars to get to work because unlike their city cousins there are no trains or trams for them.  Mr McBride said he appreciated the situation and would try to get the position alleviated.
