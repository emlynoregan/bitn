Burra Town Council

Burra Burra DC offers the Town Council the use of the slag heap provided it returns 1¼ inch screenings yard for yard; to be stacked separately for measurement.  Resolved to reject the offer.

Cr Lott moved that Messrs Tillett & Son be charged for 200 gallons of water used at the cemetery.  Lapsed for want of a seconder.

It was moved & seconded that last meeting’s Public Works Report be adopted.  Carried.

An amendment to the contrary by Cr Lott seconded by Cr Reed was lost.
