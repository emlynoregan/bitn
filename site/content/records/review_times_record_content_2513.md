Burra Burra DC will install an underground automatic watering system at the Burra Oval.

A Public Meeting in Burra last night formed a community committee to assist the Council in such areas as promotion of tourism and the town; areas in which the Council cannot give the consideration they merit.

Burra Common Effluent Scheme.  The contract has now been completed, though the men are engaged on further extensions to the system.
