Accident/Obituary.  Brian Kenneth Baulderstone, a 19-year-old apprentice carpenter of Firle, was killed near Hanson on Saturday night when the car he was driving overturned.  The car was a Holden sedan and his mother Mrs Nellie Margaret Thompson was a passenger.  They had intended to stay at Burra overnight before proceeding to Terowie the next day.  The noise of the crash was heard by Messrs Barry Eberhard, Kevin Lane and John Bray who were in the area.  When they arrived the car was back on its wheels, but the occupants had been thrown out.  The ambulance and Burra Police were summoned and Mrs Thompson was admitted to Burra Hospital with shock and severe bruising.  The driver was dead when examined by Dr R.B. Pitcher.  Brian and his mother were to have attended the Prize Shoot at Terowie on Sunday.  Other members of the East Marden Club did not learn of the fatality until they arrived at Terowie the next day.  Although the shoot continued the East Marden members withdrew.
