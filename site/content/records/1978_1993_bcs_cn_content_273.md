BCS.  The Management Committee at its last meeting decided that the District Advisory Committee would be doing the co-ordinating of projects that had previously fallen to them and in addition the administration of the use of school facilities was now well established.  As a result they recommended t the school Council that their oversight should in future be confined to the use of the Community Hall.
