Hallett Railway Debate continues over Mt Bryan Railway Station location. Summary so far:

(1) First site chosen was Sec. 75 near Mr Ullmann's house on Mt Bryan Flat, about midway from Burra to Hallett.

(2) Objectors convinced the Commissioner of Public Works to change to the southern portion of the travelling stock route near Gumbowie [only about 6 miles south of Hallett]

(3) Another deputation then sought to have the first decision reinstated. The Commissioner says he wants to accommodate the majority so the debate continues.

Ed. favours a site near junction of Main North Road and the road from Mt Bryan East; near the District Council Chambers as most traffic will come from the east. This site may be subject to flooding and if that can't readily be rectified then a site on Sec. 75 is the better choice remaining. It would suit Mt Bryan East and Banbury while the northern area towards Hallett is sheep country and the suggested location there is too near the Hallett terminus.

A sensible alternative would be to realise that with relatively little traffic a loading platform at both sites without a proper (i.e. staffed] station might be best of all.

Some rail laying began at the Burra end on 29 Oct.
