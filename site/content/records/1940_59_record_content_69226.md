‘Ratepayer’ responds to ‘Mr Bednall’s vituperation’.

I have been told that the founders of the Burra electric Supply Co. never intended that there be profit sharing by shareholders, but it was to be handed over to the town when established.  ‘Was Mr Bednall an original shareholder, or are his acquisitions just pickings?’

While directors must look after shareholders, Civic Authorities have a duty to protect the interests of ratepayers and encourage progress.

Why not clarify the position to the public and leave spite out of it?

See Schedule Zone 5 at any office of the Trust and enlighten the public as to charges to be made for electricity.

‘This statement does not come well from the Director of a Company that has previously appointed a married woman to the position of Secretary.’

Key men would no doubt be retained by the Trust.

I was told by a representative of a large electrical firm that when the Trust moved into a district the sale of appliances and the rate of installations seemed never ending, thereby creating further employment.

No one questions the right of shareholders to get value for their undertakings, but with the great rise in value of line and plant this should be realised now or never.
