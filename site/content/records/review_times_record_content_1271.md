Burra Show Society held a Centenary Dinner at the Burra Hotel on Monday night for about 80 people.  Mr Roy Jeffery launched a centenary booklet, which is now for sale.  R.D. McCallum, President of the Northern Show Societies Association, offered congratulations and best wishes for the 100th show.

[See the explanatory note for the issue of 34, 2, 23 Mar. 1977, page 1, detailing why this was not the 100th show.]

The Centenary Booklet was compiled by Mr D.H. Field, Mr Ron Shipard and Mr Peter Stockman.

[It is an overview rather than a complete history and much of the early history was taken from the souvenir publication released at the time of the Back-to-Burra celebrations in 1925.  The newspaper article also refers to I.J. Warnes as the first President, even though it includes a list alongside it that shows this to be false.]
