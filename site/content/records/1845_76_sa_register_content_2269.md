Advertisement.  W.W.G. Nicholls again advises of a trip to the Burra Burra Mines, departing Monday at 9 o’clock.

He further advises that he now has new horse drays travelling there at the rate of 25 miles a day when heavy loaded in the worst weather.  He guarantees to take families, goods or dead weight at that rate.

He is still looking for a partner who can command £250 in cash or good horses.
