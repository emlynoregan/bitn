SA Mining Association at its AGM in its offices in King William Street on Wednesday considered the report of the Directors, deciding on the adoption of a scheme previously submitted to reorganise the Association.  The Hon. G.S. Kingston was called to preside.  Hon. H. Ayers read the annual report, which was adopted.

It was, he said, understood that in adopting the report, they approved the suggested scheme.

Messrs Beck, Elder & Co. in England had declined to increase their offer for the mine and negotiations with them had ended.

The non-residential shareholders had indicated a general approval of the proposed scheme, especially if the new shares were £5 fully paid, rather than paid to £3-10-0.  The Directors decided to recommend that and that a new company be formed on the lines proposed last October.

[He then outlined the proposal as already noted in the editorial in the paper of the same day.]

The proposal would also leave un-called capital to the amount of £90,000 available whenever circumstances might warrant its being asked for.  If the representatives of absent shareholders require to consult their principals before agreeing to the proposition now offered, six months’ notice may be allowed for shareholders to signify their assent or dissent to the arrangement.  In the meantime no dividends will be paid, but the works of exploration will continue.

The new company would be registered in England and have a Board of Directors in London for the transfer of shares and to conduct the company’s business in England.  The Boards of Directors in Adelaide and in London would be elected by shareholders in the new company.  Mr Ayers explained the mode of working at the 60 fathom level, for which the additional £37,000 was needed.  He said advice from London was that the non-residential shareholders were willing to co-operate in the proposed reorganisation.

S. Tomkinson moved that the necessary legal steps be taken by the Directors to dissolve the Association and to reorganise it on the basis of the proposal of 18 October 1865, with the changes respecting fully paid up shares as suggested in the Directors’ Report presented this day.

Answering a question, Mr Ayers said that the alternative of issuing new shares in the existing Association was a possibility (with the consent of an extraordinary general meeting), but was unwise and would greatly depress the value of shares, which were already quoted at a figure below their true value.  The motion was put and carried.

Mr James Smith said he supported the proposal, but was astonished that the company should collapse for the want of £37,000 after producing such extraordinary wealth.

The Secretary pointed out that while large provision had been made for continuing operations, the shareholders had always been in favour of frequent dividends.  The fall in copper prices had also hindered operations.  £37,000 could easily have been borrowed, but there was the need to bring the Association under the Limited Liability Act.  The five retiring directors: Messrs J. Beck, T.G. Waterhouse, T. Graves, the Hon. A. Blyth and the Hon. G.S. Kingston, were all re-elected.
