Frank Treloar, Burra’s First Historian

Frank Treloar (1852-1934) lived through the formative years of the colony of South Australia.  He was born in Adelaide while his father was away at the Victorian gold fields.  His youth was spent in the Clare Valley at Watervale, where he attended the famous Stanley Grammar School.  As a teenager he visited the Burra Mine and saw it in full swing, visiting both Morphett’s Pump House and the underground workings.  After he married at the age of twenty, Frank became part of the push to expand South Australia’s agriculture beyond Goyder’s Line.  He endured five hard years of drought and crop failure, exhausting his own resources as well as those of his wife. It was hard to admit defeat and return to Watervale, where he briefly found work as a wheat agent.

When he was offered the position as manager of Gum Creek Station, near Burra, he took it with enthusiasm.  He held this position for 18 years before moving into Burra where he worked for Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. for 30 years before retiring to Adelaide in 1930.  In Burra he was one of those small group of people who work to serve the community on committees of all sorts and he became secretary to many bodies; some paying and others honorary positions.   He acquired a reputation in the town as a man whose judgement was sound and whose integrity could be taken as a given.

Frank Treloar had long been interested in the history of the Burra Burra Mine and the township of Burra when  his series of articles on the Mine was published in the local newspaper, the Burra Record, between April and July 1929, under the title Looking Back.  Although others had earlier contributed articles recording their reminiscences, this was the first extended history of the famous Burra Burra Mine.  So interested were people in the series that the Burra Institute Committee decide to publish the series in booklet form.  The Town Council contributed £5 towards the cost and the publication was printed locally by the Burra Record.  Unfortunately soon after publication a fire in Pearce’s Building largely destroyed the building and most of the print run was lost due to water damage.  As a consequence the small booklet of about 50 pages has become a collectors’ item.

The information available in 1929 was incomplete with respect to the setting up of the Burra Burra Mine and the nearby Princess Royal Mine.  After further research Treloar wrote a series of articles on the steps involved in financing and starting the two mines of the Special Survey along the Burra Creek in 1845.  These appeared in the Burra Record in 1933.  At various times the paper also printed other of his reminiscences and various letters to the editor.

The Burra History Group has now put together all of the letters and articles produced by Frank Treloar that were published in the Burra Record between 1920 and 1934.  It also includes a few newspaper reports relating to his life.  Frank was a dedicated amateur historian who set down for future generations an accurate and interesting account of Burra’s early days and he had in addition the ability to relate what he saw going on in the local area to the wider context of the development of South Australia socially and economically.  We truly owe him a debt of gratitude both for his writing and for physically saving many of the South Australian Mining Association’s records, which had been abandoned in the company’s offices after the mine closed.

The Burra History Group’s reprint of Frank Treloar’s rare booklet will be launched as a 208 page book on Wednesday 18 May in the Burra Town Hall Supper Room at 2 p.m.  All are welcome to attend the launch and enjoy refreshments following the event and a tour of the displays at the Town Hall as a part of SA’s History Festival.
