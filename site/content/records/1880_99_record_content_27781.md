Letter from W.H. Hardy who inveighs against the glowing reports of Australia as the workingman’s paradise as pronounced by Dr Dale on his return to England.

‘Working men here are quite as much in the toils of the capitalist as they are in England.’

‘It is known that the best land in Australia is in the hands of a few selfish capitalists who have made big fortunes by exporting wool and skins, but who have stifled agriculture and strangled commerce.’
