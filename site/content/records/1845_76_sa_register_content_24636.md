The road north of Burra.  From the Guardian.

Thomas Bath chaired a meeting at Bull’s Mt Bryan Hotel on 8 July to discuss the condition of the road to the north and northeast from Burra.  Mr Bath said that when Ryan’s fence was erected they would not be able to get over the watercourse that in that place was the so-called road.  It was immediately necessary for the central Road Board to put the two or three very worst places in passable condition.  Secondly the Government must place funds on the Estimates to put the whole road in good order.

Mr H. Dawson moved a resolution to address Mr Bath’s first point.  [In his discussion he says that Ryan’s fencing of section 122 would make the road impassable.]

If something was not done soon the large and important traffic from the northeast would go to Booborowie and hence to Hanson Station.  This would be a loss to the Government of 14 miles of haulage on the railway.  Messrs Drew & Co. provided some statistics of interest.  There were 26 sheep stations north and east of Burra which would send their wool along the road if it were passable.  They contributed 2,000 tons of wool to the Burra Railway Station and considerable traffic went north to them as well.  Two stations alone had received 200 tons of goods via this road.   Also 61 farmers used the road and they had 12,000 acres under crop this year.  Even at 10 bushels an acre this would mean 4,000 tons of wheat would use the road.  (The good season in the year before last had achieved 17 bushels per acre.)  Wood cartage along the road was at least 3.500 tons.  In all at least 10,500 tons of traffic used the road in a year.  In the last 20 years the Government had expended the magnificent sum of £800 on it!  In return they had received all the money from selling the Hundreds of Burra [sic: for Kooringa], Kingston and Hallett, in which few sections were left unsold.  [The road between sections 122 & 123 was critical.]

Mr Jenkins seconded the motion and said the road to Hannaford’s Corner and opposite section 75 was in a frightful state and needed attention just as much as that at Ryan’s.  The proposition was carried.

Mr Cochrane proposed a petition seeking an immediate grant of £2,000 for the road.  Seconded by R. Collins.  Mr Masterman supported it and pointed out that not only would heavy traffic be stopped if no action was taken, but also the Royal Mail.  Mr Ind then proposed a committee be formed; seconded by Mr Ryan Jnr and carried.

After the formal business of the meeting as advertised was completed Mr J.B. Bull proposed there be a petition to make Mt Bryan a polling place and this was also carried.
