Burra Racing Club is now in a better financial position than for many years.  Membership has grown from 78 to 158 and the last meeting made a profit of Â£150.  This is due to the hard work of the committee and especially of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary, Messrs Symonds & J. Carpenter and the Chairman of the Committee, Mr P. Clarke.  More members are needed as only 10 of the 158 turned up for the AGM a fortnight ago.
