Australia Day was held in Burra last Friday.

The weather, which had been threatening, turned out to be ideal.  A team spent the morning decorating Market Square.  An afternoon tea tent was erected at the northern end of the square and at the south end was T.P. Hall’s pie-stall, lent for the day to another group of ladies.  In front of the rotunda were the articles to be auctioned.  The procession began approximately at 2.30 p.m. from Redruth.  It was headed by the police Cpl McCarthy and M-C Queale, then the Light Horse, Citizen Forces, Cadets under Lieut. Killicoat, Burra Coronation Band under Conductor Bentley, Burra Rifle Club under Captain Lord, Burra School Children under Mr Johnson, Copperhouse children under Mr Mazzarol, a large number of vehicles and 20-30 cars, the Kazoo-tin-can Band and the Copper Escort of small boys dressed in brilliant uniforms and carrying battle-axes and swords.

A.J. McBride’s car was judged most artistic; Mrs Barker’s car in wattle blossom and gold streamers was much admired.  Dr Steele’s car was most appropriate: a boat-shaped frame carried samples of state recruiting posters.  R.M. McBride Jun.’s car ‘was got up as a blackfellows’ wirley and was said to be from Oodnadatta’.  The tin-can band was organised by Mr Hann and consisted of about 40 boys in black faces and patched costumes with jam-tin hats and kerosene-tin drums.  At the rotunda Mr Crewe’s made another stirring appeal.
