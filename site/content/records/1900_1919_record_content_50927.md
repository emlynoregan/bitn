C. Tiver writes that on receiving the above he would have let the matter drop, but for Mr Thamm’s outburst following the paper report [on 30 May] where Mr Thamm says Tiver’s language ‘might have caused the King to blush’, which surely is an accusation of the use of bad language and a reference to ‘whitewash’ and ‘bulged eyes’ – but he assumes Thamm’s supply of ink will eventually run out as Thamm uses it ‘not only on me, but on several other well respected men of our town’.
