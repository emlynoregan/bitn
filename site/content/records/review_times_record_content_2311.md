Obituary.  Dr Martin Francis Toal DD died in Melbourne on 22 April aged 77.  He was well known in the Burra and Jamestown area and his pastoral work in the Burra Parish dated back to 1930.  Though stationed at Jamestown, he from time to time took turns with Monsignor F.A. Hentschke to help out Fr Morrissey in Burra.  Fr Morrissy remained in charge certainly until mid 1937, but records show Dr Toal was in residence there by October 1937 and he stayed till the end of 1948, however he also served as an interpreter and chaplain at Loveday Internment Camp from the end of 1941 to June 1942.  He was later appointed to the staff of St Francis Xavier’s Seminary in the Philosophy Faculty and his pastoral work ceased.  When a new priestly staff was provided by the Vincentian Order Dr Toal was granted leave to study overseas and the greater part of his research was done in Rome.  He spent more than 25 years of painstaking study and translation on scripture used in the Liturgy of the Church from the early Greek Fathers.  His latest work covering eleven years of research is in the process of publication. Thirty-six priests led by Bishop Bryan Gallagher con-celebrated Requiem Mass with his brother, Monsignor T.F. Toal in St James Church, Jamestown, on 26 April.  He had died in Melbourne on 23 April.  Religious, laity and children filled the church for the ceremony.  Bishop Gallagher paid tribute to Dr Toal’s work as a pastor and scholar of international stature and an outstanding member of the Australian catholic priesthood.  The Burra Parish was represented by Mr Jim Quinn of Mt Bryan, Chairman of the Burra-Spalding Pastoral Council.
