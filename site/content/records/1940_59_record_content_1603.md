We had a farm at Mt Bryan and in the first year got 27 b per acre, but in the next year got less than half that. (Before superphosphate.)  I used to cart to Broken Hill 66 years ago, with five horses and about 1878 was the first to take a loading to Wilcannia by road â€“ using bullocks for that.  When I was dam sinking at one time I had 91 bullocks.  I worked the NE road and at dam sinking for 32 years.
