Ordinary meeting, 7 March.

The Mayor reported he had met Commissioner Hill re protection at the Bon Accord crossing and the latter said it would be fully considered.

The inspection of the town on 2 March revealed it to be in a clean state with just a few matters requiring a notice to be attended to.

A memorial calling for the subdivision of land into workingmen’s blocks has been prepared and will be presented for Council approval tonight.  MPs Holder & Lake will be asked to assist.

I rule that Cr Hardy’s notice of motion to deal with a matter is quite irrelevant to the business of Council and therefore it will not be entertained.

The draft memorial on workingmen’s blocks was accepted.

Proprietors of three papers replied refusing to supply the name of their Burra correspondent.

The removal of the Henderson’s Bridge lamp to Mr Ullman’s corner was discussed.  [That is to the southeast corner of the intersection of Kingston St and Bridge Terrace.]

Some said raising it three feet would serve as well.  A decision was deferred.

North Ward Councillors are to make arrangements for the lighting of the lamp at the north end of town.
