Hanson Memorial Hall Fete & Dance on 3 November.

‘It is only three years since the hall was opened and so far the work done is paid for and not a penny owing on the hall as it now stands.  However there is much to be done, a stage has to be erected also a supper room added, hence the activities of the ladies, who are keen to have a finished job.’
