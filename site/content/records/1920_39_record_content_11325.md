Soldiers’ Aid Society, AGM last Thursday in Jubilee Hall.

There was a large attendance.  This year the society had a serious loss when the Bartholomaeus family moved to Adelaide.  Mrs W.H. Gare took over from Miss C. Bartholomaeus as Honorary Secretary.

Support for the Royal Institution for the Blind continued and preparations were in hand for the annual dinner for returned soldiers – whether members of the RSL or not.

Money raised goes to support military hospitals through the Red Cross Produce Dept.

Last August 26th dinner was provided for the RSL.

Attendance continues to be good with 13-22 at meetings.  No special efforts have been made for several years, but subscriptions and donations at meetings are the sole income.  As far as acting as a committee for the Royal Institution for the Blind however, we have laboured for four years.  The 1922 effort raised £104-3-0 and over the four years the sum is £310-11-10.

Elected for 1923-24 were: President, Miss Bubb; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames M.A. Radford, R. Elliott & C. Fuss; Treasurer, Mrs A.J. Wallis; Secretary, Mrs W.H. Gare and Auditor, Mr N.J. Tiddy.
