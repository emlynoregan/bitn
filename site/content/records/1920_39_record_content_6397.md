Mrs J.M. McBride was given a farewell social in the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School on 13 December.  She had been a regular attendant and consistent church member during her 18 years in the town.  Reference was made to both her own work for the church and the generosity of her late husband.  The Sunday school class presented her with a box of six daintily embroidered linen handkerchiefs.  John Drew made a presentation on behalf of the congregation and handed over a cheque for an easy chair for her new home.  Rev. Haslam also expressed his sense of loss at her departure.
