Burra Town Council, Monday

Cr Collins & Cr Sams were welcomed as new Councillors and Cr Kellaway and the Mayor were congratulated on their re-election.

Two lifebuoys are to be purchased for the Mine Pool.

Rates were fixed at the same level as last year.

The nurses were granted full use of the tennis court opposite the hospital â€“ Mr McBride having agreed to do so for his half of the property.
