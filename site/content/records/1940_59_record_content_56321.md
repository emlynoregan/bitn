Fire Fighting Meeting

The Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Organisation had a meeting at Koomooloo on Tuesday.  Some members travelled 140 miles to attend.  Some 50 people were present.  Mr F.L. Kerr gave an address and demonstrated fire fighting equipment.  In the business section of the meeting Chairman Rex Warnes was re-elected as were all other committee members and the joint secretaries Messrs H. Binks-Williams & F.N. Fabian.  In the past year two fires were reported.  One could have been very serious, but was controlled after c. 12 hours.  Another small outbreak was quickly extinguished.  One of the significant dangers is posed by wood cutters.  They will now be required to notify police and lessees of their intention to move camp at least seven days prior to doing so.  As Mr Kerr spoke the rain, which began about the same time as the meeting, grew in intensity, so that the noise on the iron roof of the woolshed drowned out the speaker.  Eventually he had to give up and proceed with the demonstration of fire fighting equipment, which also had to be done indoors!  Three types of sprays were demonstrated on a trough of waste oil.  Mrs Warnes and other ladies provided a fine afternoon tea and those present then had a wet and sometimes exciting trip home on sticky roads and the way to Burra lay through heavy fog and severe lightning, which made the town lights a very welcome sight.
