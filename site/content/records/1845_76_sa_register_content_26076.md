The Forrest Exploring Expedition

Mr John Forrest attended the cricket match at Farrell’s Flat on Saturday and then visited the Burra Mines, where an address was presented to him, congratulating him on his safe arrival after his long, arduous and successful expedition of exploration.  Mr Forrest and his party left Burra for Salisbury on Monday morning by the first train.  [His receptions at Jamestown, Gawler and Salisbury are reported at length.]

Burra 30 October: Mr Forrest at Kooringa.

Mr Forrest arrived at about 3 p.m., having travelled from Canowie since the morning.  Once his arrival was known, he received a warm reception.  A complimentary dinner was organised in Mr Lamb’s Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms, attended by 50 or 60 people.  Mr Philip Lane, Chairman of the Burra DC presided.  The exploring party comprised Mr John Forrest, his brother Mr Alexander Forrest, third officer Trooper Kennedy, farrier Mr Sweeney, and two West Australian blackfellows, including Jimmy Winditch,* who accompanied Mr Forrest on his previous visit to SA.  Mr Harry Gosse, who has accompanied the expedition a considerable distance, was also present.  J.D. Cave JP read an address of welcome [a paragraph of which is printed].  W.H. Rosman, Manager of the National Bank, proposed a toast congratulating the expedition on their 2,000 mile trek in six months.  Mr Forrest responded.  Other toasts and speeches were made by Alexander Forrest, Pierre (one of the blackfellows, who made an intelligent speech of about five minutes and provoked much laughter), H. Dawson and Harry Gosse.

[* In another part of the report he is called Tommy Windich, but this may be confusing him with Tommy Pierre, who is also named elsewhere in the article.  Winditch/Windich is said to be a splendid bushman and an expert at finding water.  He also had a good knowledge of the situation and characteristics of the other colonies and remembered well details of his earlier visit to SA.  He had an intelligent expression and was a mine of information on his native colony.  Pierre was literate and had a good deal of knowledge on a range of topics, but had a somewhat confused notion of colonial affairs.]

[There are reports on 31 October and 2 November of Forrest’s arrival at Canowie, Jamestown and Kooringa (page 5 in each case)and a very extensive report on his reception in Adelaide and on the expedition generally in the paper of 4 November, page 5.]
