Hanson-Booborowie Railway.  Reprint of a report in the Register.

The Railways Standing Committee has decided it was not expedient to construct the line.  In 1915 it had been recommended if it cost less than £163,000 and locals were happy to pay local rates.  In 1916 the Bill passed the Lower House, but was shelved by the Legislative Council.  By 1918 the cost had risen to £207,000 and the committee recommended deferral till costs settled.  Investigation showed railway traffic was not as great as it would have been if there was closer settlement.  If built it would mean that four lines served a strip of land 26 miles wide.  (The distance from Yacka to Mt Bryan.)

The Northern Line (Adelaide to Terowie via Burra)

The proposed Booborowie line (branching from the Northern line at Hanson)

The Spalding line (from Riverton via Clare)

The line to Gladstone.

The cost is still put at £207,000 and the loss was estimated at c. £10,369 [p.a.?]

Instead Federal Aid for roads should be used to upgrade the district’s roads.
