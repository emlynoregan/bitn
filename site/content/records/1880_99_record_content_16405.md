A Deputation of the Mayor and Cr W.R. Ridgway to the Attorney General (C.C. Kingston) as Acting Commissioner of Public Works was introduced on Friday by W.B. Rounsevell (Treasurer).  The first matter was the road leading to the station.  Before the railway station was built a good road existed, but subsequently the road was altered and a new road was never made so in winter it becomes a quagmire.  Council asks for a grant to get a road built to carry stock to the station.  The Corporation has no funds and the Road Board could not make the road.  The cost is c. Â£150.  The Corporation would do the work.

The deputation than drew attention to the new Waterworks.  The new engine ordered would only pump 2,000 gallons per hour while they needed 5,000 gal/hr, and even the old one did 4,000 gal/hr.  If not a new engine, they needed a new pump.  When water was laid on they were guaranteed 60 services.  At present they had 150 to 160 with more applying.  In 2-3 years they expected some 300.  The next request was for a piece of ground on which to sink the shaft connected with the waterworks.  The present shaft was sunk in the road and land adjoining which they wished the government to purchase for them - it was owned by the English, Scottish and Australian Bank.  They also drew attention to the supply of water to the railway station.  The Acting Commissioner could not immediately respond, but he would let the Commissioner of Public Works know their wants when he returned.
