Burra School will celebrate its centenary in October to coincide with the Copper festival on the long weekend.  There will be a light luncheon at the school on Sunday and an assembly of old students and teachers for the afternoon.  A centenary booklet has been written by former principal Mr Ian Auhl.  Special centenary pack of a port, reisling and moselle will also be available and other souvenirs are being prepared.  It is expected one wing of the new building will be available for use, but that the old building will be off limits due to extensive modifications as part of the rebuilding process.
