He was born in Antigua in 1876 and arrived in Melbourne, aged 20, in 1896, as a boy baritone in

The Georgia Minstrel & Cakewalk Theatrical Co.  He was supposedly on his way to England to enter college and complete his education.  Someone gave him a hiding one day and then the ex-Champion Light Weight Boxer of Australia, Mick O’Walsh (who died in Adelaide c. 1935) taught him how to box.

After two lessons he had his first fight in the ring against Paddy Hay in Melbourne in 1899.  Burke won.  He won 3 of 4 more fights in Melbourne before going to WA, where he drew with ‘Couta’ Miller in a 20 round fight in 1900.  Next he won £300 in defeating ‘Swansea’ Tom before returning to SA, where he beat Harry Marshall in 2 rounds at Port Pirie, and Paddy Hogan in 4.  Other fights followed before he went to Broken Hill to meet their champion, Arthur Kelly.  This fight was supposed to be rigged so that Burke got 60% of the gate when he ‘died’ in the 10th.  In the event he fought on to a 25 round draw.  He then beat Alan Williams, an Australian half-caste in 11 rounds and again in Port Pirie on points after 20 rounds.  He became Light Weight Champion of SA.  Most of his fights were in the old Cyclorama Theatre, later West’s and now the Metro Theatre in Hindley St.  He then had trouble keeping his weight down to the then limit of 9 stone 6 lb.  He was about 30.

He became a race horse owner and bookmaker in Victoria and fought only when it pleased him.  In 1908 at Stawell he knocked out Billy Marr in the 2nd round.  He considers his greatest fight to have been at Stawell on Easter Monday in 1910, against Bob Greenshields, the Light weight Champion of Australia.  It was arranged as a 20 round contest.  At the end of 20 rounds it was a draw and the official referee ordered an extra 3 round, and then an extra 2, but the match still ended in a draw and the £380 purse was split evenly.

After that fights grew infrequent and he became a promoter.  He had a few Welter Weight bouts, but he was really too light.  His final fight was when he was 40 at this weight and he suffered a TKO in the 6th round at the hands of Fred Seagar.  During this he was knocked on his prominent Adam’s apple.  Burke swears he thinks he swallowed it and afterwards could never sing so well.  In 20 odd years in the ring he was never knocked off his feet.

Today he works in Burra dry cleaning suits and costumes and says ‘times are a bit tough’.
