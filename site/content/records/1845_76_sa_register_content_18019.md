Inquest

An inquest on the fire that occurred at Gum Creek decided that it was caused by the carelessness of some bullock drivers who have been summoned to the Local Court.

The Full Court was held on Wednesday and Thursday and a man called Matthews was fined Â£5 for lighting a fire on Canowie Run without taking the necessary precautions.

Thursday was survey day at the Mine and 14 pitches were refused, many of the miners being off to Wallaroo and Moonta.
