Crs Kellaway & Carpenter were keen to keep the matter out of the press.  The Mayor said they were not in committee and therefore had not the power to ask the press to delete the discussion.

[The paper does not report on how the matter was resolved.]

The clerk reported that Council had the power to order the removal of unsightly structures or could get a court order to remove them itself.
