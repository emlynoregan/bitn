International Cables.  The two cables from Darwin to Europe are broken: one 100 miles out and the other 600 miles out.  This has provoked fears of a military cause for the disruption.  Victoria has responded by sending a gunboat to patrol outside the heads [of Pt Philip] and by getting its fighting forces into trim.
