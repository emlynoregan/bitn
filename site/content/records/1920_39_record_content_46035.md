Mongolata Goldfield

Curlew Claim.  Correction of last weekâ€™s figures.  Ore treated was 26 tons 15cwt and gold recovered was 121oz 6dwt 11gr

Block 8.  Work has gone in 17ft on the open cut, but the lode is not good so we turned to the north end of the main shaft and have driven9ft on the north side of it: lode about 4ft wide and of little value, but improving.
