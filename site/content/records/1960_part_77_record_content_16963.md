Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society held its AGM 16 July in the Mayor’s Parlour.  Elected: President, Rev. Drought; Secretary, Mrs H. Jennison and Treasurer, Mr F. Atkin.

In the year the sewing machine was repaired and lent to a family who will make good use of it.  A good second hand stove was supplied to one home and a holiday was funded for a young mother who much needed it.
