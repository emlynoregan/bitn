Kay Carpenter is the 2007 Dux of BCS.  The award is for all round achievement in the school year.  Kay is currently considering her options after Year 12, which include studying tourism at university, teaching English overseas or getting a job in retail.  She urges this yearâ€™s students to work hard and says that all the stress and anxiety, although very real, is worthwhile in the end.  [Photo.]
