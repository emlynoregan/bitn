Obituary.  William M. Irlam died 2 September at the age of 81.  He was born in Lancashire and at the age of 15 ran away from home and stowed way on a boat bound for Australia.  He was discovered and forced to act as a sailor.  At Port Adelaide he absconded.  He arrived in Burra in 1858 and worked for Mr Bosence at Aberdeen before going north to Bimbowrie Station dam-sinking.  He later became a boundary-rider at Wooltana.  After a few years he took land at Baldina and after a few years there moved to World’s End where he was for some years the Council Ranger.  He retired to Burra.  Mrs Irlam, nee E. Bosence, died 11 years ago.  Seven of nine children survive: R. Irlam (Perth), W.M. Irlam (Aberdeen), E. Irlam (Robertstown), Mrs J.J. Parker (Baldina), Mrs A.A. Nankivell (Kooringa), Mrs H. Broad (Adelaide) & Mrs S. Schmidt (Bright).  There are 27 grandchildren.
