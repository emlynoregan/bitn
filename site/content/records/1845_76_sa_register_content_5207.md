Police Commissioner Alex Tolmer’s Report

Extract from the Government Gazette of 31 October 1850.

Apoinga Police.  C.M. Penny, proprietor of the Apoinga Smelting Works made forceful representations to His Excellency on the need for police protection there.  Consequently a temporary police station was formed there on 21 September.  In the event that it is found expedient to make this permanent, I would respectfully recommend that the station be located in the vicinity of Hornsby’s public house.  This is a central position and would aid those requiring assistance at Kapunda Mines, Burra Burra and the surrounding area.  It would be a convenient halting place for police convening prisoners to Adelaide.
