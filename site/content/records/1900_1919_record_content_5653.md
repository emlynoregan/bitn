Editorial on the resignation of Lord Hopetoun as Governor General on the grounds that he couldn’t live on £10,000 p.a.  The editor thought his resignation was good riddance.  The President of the USA, with 67 million people gets only £11,000 p.a. and the President of Switzerland with 3½ million, close to Australia’s population gets by with just £600 p.a.
