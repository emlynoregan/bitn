Mr & Mrs M.C. Abbott were farewelled from Terowie recently.  They had carried on business in Terowie and are now going to reside at Brayville.  The business had been started by the grandfather in 1880 and was taken over by his son Charles who operated it from 1921until 1938.  Milton Abbott then took over.  Charles Abbott was afflicted with blindness for many years, but took an active part in the business until his death in 1954.  Milton Abbott was a leading tennis player and adherent of the Methodist Church, as well as a member of the Community Entertainments Committee and a past president of the Hospital Board.  He was a JP for 12 years.  Mrs Abbott was a leading tennis player and a great church worker.
