Letter from Ronnie Alderman from Booborowie School Governing Council

[Although not specifically stated as such, it is clearly a response to the comments of D.D. O’Brien of 7 December 2005, page 2.]

He writes of how on 7 December the Booborowie School and community came together to celebrate Christmas in true Christmas spirit.  The night reflected the strong links that support parents and community.  He then recounts the evening’s program and how it concluded with an assortment of delicious table treats, tea and coffee and was a great social opportunity to reflect on the night’s success.

Recently the Booborowie Governing Council was asked to reflect ‘in the mirror’ this Christmas and Council, School and community appreciated the opportunity.  The reflection was glowing – a very successful and fantastic school year.

‘…the absurd suggestion that the present community is discriminatory is purely emotional and inflammatory as too the timeline of two days…it is simply untrue and incorrect.’
