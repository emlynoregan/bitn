Ulooloo Diggings.  Mr William Armstrong of Hindmarsh and formerly a Victorian digger, reports that after spending some time at Ulooloo he considers it the best poor man’s diggings in the colony.  He and a mate obtained £3 worth of gold in a week.  He thinks it worthwhile on this showing to return and develop the claim.  There are 35-40 men on the field and he says they are at least covering expenses and several are making wages.  The cost of living there is moderate, but diggers need to go with some money in their pocket.  Moderate return can be expected and there is the possibility of good returns.
