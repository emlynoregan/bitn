A Bolt.  A horse with a trap bolted from in front of Bagot, Shakes & Lewisâ€™s offices in Commercial St on Wednesday.  It went up Kingston St and the Baldina Road to the stock road, which was negotiated till the hill was confronted after crossing the creek: the horse then started back and the trap overturned in the creek on the return run.  The axle was bent and a wheel damaged, but the horse escaped unscathed.
