After lunch the Governor delivered a stirring address.

In the evening there was a concert at the Institute with more patriotic speeches between the items.  Mr Sowden hoped the fine cavalcade of Cheer-up Girls would be in Adelaide for the opening of the Cheer-up Hut on 6 November.  He believed Burra’s contribution to the war effort which amounted to c. £8 a head of population was the finest in Australia.  Details of the sum raised are then given and the total turned out to be over £800.
