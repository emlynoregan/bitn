Second Leader on ‘Our Prospects.

The 1876 growing season has been marked by sharp frosts and a lack of rain.  This drought has been such as to suggest an end to the wave of prosperity which seemed to be settling upon the colony.  Wool, wheat and copper prices are all down in the Home markets.  Despite this great public works have been authorised. And much can be done to advance the colony.  Deep ploughing can be undertaken in preparation for the next season.  This has the virtue of trapping more of the moisture that does fall and in bringing minerals to the surface and into the reach of subsequent crops.

‘We have great faith in deep ploughing.’
