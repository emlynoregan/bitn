Inter-High School Sports were held on 11 May at Kapunda.  Some mishaps along the way saw most Burra students arrive too late for the opening ceremony.  Results were:

Clare 200½

Balaklava 185½

Burra 115½

Riverton 94½

Kapunda 79

One of the school buses had to wait for a spare part to come from Adelaide, so about half the students returned by private cars.  Next year Burra hosts the event.
