Mid North Community Radio

A committee if interested people have been looking into the possibility of establishing a community radio station in the Mid North.  It would broadcast a high quality signal in stereo FM.  The cost of the set up would be $26,000 and we are seeking promises for that amount.  Tests would be made to see that Burra would receive a good signal before donations were collected.
