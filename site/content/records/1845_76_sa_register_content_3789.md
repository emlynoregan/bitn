‘Observer’ writes on the Monster Mine and Smelting Works.

The operations at the Monster Mine are proceeding with vigour and the engine-house will soon be completed and it is expected that the engine will be doing its duty in les than three months.  The Patent Copper Co. is carrying out its interesting processes effectively.  Unfortunately I have a bone to pick with its manager.  I learn that last Monday more than thirty hands were dismissed on the excuse that there was not enough work to occupy them.  A couple of these men said they had been contracted with in Adelaide for 21/- a week, with the company agreeing to pay 10/- towards the carriage hire, with the men paying the other 10/-.  It had cost another 10/- for necessaries on the road and 12/- for a week in Adelaide before they could come to Burra.  Another 12/- had been expended in Burra before they began remunerative work.  Now they have been discharged before a chance of recovering the £1-12-0 expended to get there.  Surely this is not proper behaviour Mr Overseer.

As well as that; some time ago parties with bullocks and drays entered into contracts to supply 1,000 tone of wood. One such has now injured his back after supplying 600 tons and is under Dr Moore’s care.  He has sought to be released from the reminder of the contract, but the Overseer has threatened a prosecution for the bonded penalty of £50.

[The Editor said he published this complaint to allow the Overseer an opportunity of making any explanation the circumstances may require.]
