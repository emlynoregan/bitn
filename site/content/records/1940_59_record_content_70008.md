During the year visits were made by Hallett, Robertstown, Peterborough and Blyth and we visited Hallett and Robertstown and individuals visited Riverton, Blyth, Renmark, Marrabel, Jamestown and Cummins.  Thank go to Greens keeper Mr A. Bown, who unfortunately cannot continue next season.  The committee hopes to purchase the present property from the debenture holders and this matter is presently with our solicitor, Mr Bednall.  This will require incorporation, which is also in hand.  Social games have been less successful and I hope some constructive suggestions about this might come forward.  Elected: President, H.J.B. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, H. Binks-Williams & G.H. Dollman and Secretary, J.B. Topsfield.
