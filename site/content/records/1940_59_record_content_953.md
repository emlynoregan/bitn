Burra Town Council, 16 March.

M. Bednall of the Burra Civil Defence Committee wrote saying his committee thought the inclusion of all Councillors on it would make it too large and also unstable in membership.  It was really a matter for the Central Committee to determine.

The Mayor said he had not inspected the cemetery lately, but believed a certain Association was not satisfied with its appearance.

The Town Clerk said it was now one of the best outside of Adelaide.  Street cleaning is continuing.

Cr Robinson said after meeting the Civil Defence Committee it was necessary for the council to forward two names to the Premierâ€™s Office to fill vacancies.  Crs Robinson & Samuel were nominated.
