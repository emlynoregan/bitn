Come Out ’83

Highlights:

Year 6 Fun Castle and brightly painted rubbish bins.

Three Arts Council performances

Polished Brass on Tuesday – an introduction to brass instruments and percussion

Café Mad

Streetwise by Melbourne’s Handspan Theatre.

BCS students took their play Snow Bright and the Seven Wharfies to Leighton, Booborowie, Booborowie, Hallett and Mt Bryan Schools.

Friday Australiana Day saw visits by students from Booborowie, Hallett and Mt Bryan and Burra Kindergarten with creek tea, damper lunch, a sing-along, bush tales, bread-making, papermaking, golf, an archaeological dig and folk dancing.

There was a Teddy Bear’s picnic for the young folk and a Mad Hatter’s competition.

Miss Stratos taught Greek dancing and the whole secondary school ended up doing Zorba in the gym.

Other activities included a writer’s workshop, candle making, spinning, weaving, soapbox derby, picture framing and a visit to the school by St John’s with their vehicle and demonstration of techniques.
