Kooringa News, 12 January

A race has been arranged for 4 February between Mr Lampard’s Mare Kitty and on of Mr Smith’s horses for £50 each.

Mr Murray, surveyor, has been examining the route for a railway to be carried north to Burra via the Gilbert.  If built it would open up a large area for both agricultural and mineral development.

Several Royal Mining Co. Directors visited their property last week.  They are employing more men, so evidently they think the prospects are good.
