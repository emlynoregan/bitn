Waterworks Meeting.  There was a very large attendance at the meeting at the Institute on Friday 12 October to consider the Government and the Waterworks.  The Mayor, P.L. Killicoat, presided.

Proposal.  A deputation consisting of three members of Council and three ratepayers will wait on the Commissioner of Public Works (Hon. A. Catt) and urge that the Burra Waterworks be leased to the Council at a rental of £300 p.a.  Should the requisition be refused, the members for the district are to be requested to bring the matter before the House of Assembly.  Moved by J. Watt and 2nd by W. Geake.

£900 p.a. was an excessive amount to raise.  The stated £8,500 capital cost claimed by the Government was enormous and the works were never worth it.  £8,500 at 4% is £220.  Allow £150 for wages, £60 for fuel and £20 for the collector and you get £450.  To meet that the Government seek £1,000 in rates.

W.R. Ridgway pointed out the loss of railway purchase of water.  Why should Burra pay interest at 5% when Adelaide paid 4% and no other country waterworks paid over 2½%?  Astonishingly Parliament passed £500 as the working expenses when £250 was ample.

Dr Brummitt supported the motion.  He also said the charge of £960 for the Aberdeen Waterworks (i.e. the old works) was absurd and it should never have been more than £200-£250 even when new, and they were nine years old.
