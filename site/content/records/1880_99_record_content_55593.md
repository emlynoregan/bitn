The Council’s Printing.

This article refers to the way in which the question of the Town Council’s printing was settled.  The writer refers to ‘That poor specimen of humanity erected on two sticks with the outward resemblance of a man’ who claimed that the Record received £38 last year for printing, when in fact it was £25-5-0.  Last year the lamps cost £21-16-0 and tenders are to be called for lighting them in 1895, but the printing is to go to someone else ‘at all hazards’.

A Disgusted Ratepayer writes to condemn the handling of the Inspectorship issue.  He then goes on to condemn the way the printing contract was disposed of without reference to costs ‘on a par with Cr Rabbich’s usual mode of doing things.’
