Obituary.  Mrs W. Beerworth died 15 July at her residence in Kooringa aged 77.  She spent the greater part of her life in Carrieton.  She leaves a grown up family of five daughters, with 51 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

[There is no mention of a son though it is said elsewhere the mother of J.H. Beerworth late AIF lived in Kooringa.  The five daughters are not readily traced in birth registrations either.]
