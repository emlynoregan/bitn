Weather.  In the last week 155 points were recorded here and 2½” at Mt Bryan.  The creek came down in its biggest flood since 1915.  The creek is now wider than in the past and the flood was particularly impressive at the Pig & Whistle Ford which was three feet deep.  Black duck and teal are common and Porter’s Lagoon and Apoinga Lagoon are filling and teeming with birdlife.

To the east the falls have been disappointing with a few places around 1 inch, but others in the 20-50 points range.  Last Sunday morning some snow fell very early and there was a nice fall about 7 a.m.  There were heavier falls at ‘Blink Bonnie’ and at Mt Bryan with light falls at Leighton and Hanson.
