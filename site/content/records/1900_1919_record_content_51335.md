West Burra Copper Mining Co.  The Eighth Half-Yearly Meeting was held 26 July.

Mr G. Lord presided.  Work has been discontinued for most of this period.  After getting the report of the Chief Inspector of Mines it was decided to sink the new shaft a further 50’, but the wet weather has made his impossible and it will be resumed when fine weather returns.  The financial position is not strong.  The last parcel of ore returned £72 nett for 2 tons 17 cwt.  The credit balance is now £118-13-5, but after the present contract this will be £80-13-5.  The expenditure has been in developmental work.  We hope soon to have discovered a payable ore body.
