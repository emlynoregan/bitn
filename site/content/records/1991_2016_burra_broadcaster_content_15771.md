Archaeology at Burra

In the coming week a collaboration between the National Trust in Burra, Goyder Council and Flinders University will result in staff and students from the University conducting field work in Burra.  Their first work will be to provide an archaeological pre-disturbance survey on the dugouts used by miners at Burra.
