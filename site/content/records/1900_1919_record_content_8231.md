Reminiscences of Captain Killicoat.

Arrived at Pt Wakefield 18 July 1853 in the barque Malacca from Montevideo after a passage of 70 days with a cargo of 180 mules imported by the Patent Copper Co.  Other passengers were E.K. Horn, Mrs Isaac Killicoat and family and Mrs Skews and family.  These mules were used to carry low-grade surplus ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield – two bags or c. 2 cwt per mule.  This was then shipped to Swansea.  Mr Horn as agent went to Rio de Janeiro in the Malacca to buy the mules and then the barque went on to London for the Killicoat and Skews families and brought back a cargo of scrap iron.  On reaching Rio the Capt. found that the mules had been bought in Montevideo and went there and got them aboard, taking six weeks to return in rough weather.  The Mexicans in charge had much trouble on the voyage to Australia due to very rough weather and several mules died.  Mr Horn acted as Company agent in Pt Wakefield till the railway to Kapunda opened and traffic was then diverted there.  Mules were then used in wagons in lieu of driving in mobs with packs of ore by the Mexicans.  Other loads of mules followed and several loads of scrap iron, but while the Malacca was away it was found that Carculta ironstone near Black Springs would act as a flux for Burra malachite, so the load of scrap iron was used to build a wharf at Pt Wakefield and no more imported.  Mules were better than horses and had the longest and hardest stages (between Mule Camp and Burra) other stages to Kapunda via White Park which were shorter and easier were done by horses.  The Company had a variety of teams using horses, bullocks, mules and donkeys and did much of their own carting while others were employed in various ways.  At the works store you could buy almost anything and there was a butcher’s establishment to supply employees with meat at a time when many lived in the Burra Creek – some with large rooms, nicely whitewashed, cool in summer, warm in winter with fireplaces and shelves cut out of the ground.  The Patent Copper Co. had 18 reverberatory and three refining furnaces at work.  They constructed the roads and bridges between Burra and Pt Wakefield and Baldina and were lessees of Baldina Run then.  They also owned land between Burra and Pt Wakefield and for example grew hay etc. at Kadlunga to feed their stock.  The Mule Camp and White Park belonged to them.  The Company still carry on smelting at Newcastle and have wharfs etc. at Pt Adelaide and Pt Augusta and one of the best copper mines, the Clara St Dora near one of our great northern railway stations – smelting the ore at Newcastle.

[Note: other sources say Chileans rather than Mexicans.  White Park was on section 271 & 172 Hundred of Waterloo c. 2km north of Tothill Creek.]
