Local Board of Health.

Mr Winnall has engaged Mr F.V. Smith and filed a tentative defence.

Mr Winnall and the Town Clerk contradicted each other as to what advice Mr Winnall had given.

A.J. McBride writes explaining what he wanted to say at the Board of health on 7 September, but was prevented by the chair.  He believed the Board should have left the Lawn matter with Mr Winnall alone, unless they lost and then could have taken on a city lawyer for the appeal if needed, thus saving ratepayersâ€™ money.

Pte J.R. Clarke has been welcomed home to Hallett.
