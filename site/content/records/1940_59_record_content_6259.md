Obituary.  Mr William Bryce who died recently at his residence in Westbourne Park was once well known in the Mt Bryan District.  He was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1858 and came to Australia with his father and stepmother when aged 7 in the James Jardine.  They lived for a year on the farm of a relative at Morphett Vale, where he received a year’s schooling – all he ever got.  They then moved to Mt Bryan Station where an uncle, Mr William Bryce, was manager.  William became a shepherd for his uncle’s sheep, roaming the Razorback Ranges barefooted and camping beside his flock by night; much troubled by kangaroo rats, which in those days were abundant and would eat clothing overnight.  At one time a fire started by Aborigines came through from Ulooloo to the station in half an hour.  The sheds and house were saved, but little else.  Leaving Mt Bryan they went to Waukongaree Station and were employed by Mr Chewings minding sheep.  When land at Ulooloo was subdivided Mr Bryce Sen. took a block, but he died soon afterwards and a sister and brother died from diphtheria, leaving William Bryce Jnr to manage the place.  At 32 he married Georgina Cubbins of Yongala, a relative of an old Burra family.  After years of drought they moved to Mt Bryan East, but fared little better there, so they moved to Cartapo and struck the wettest season on record.  Five years later they moved to Mt Bryan where seasons and prices were good.  At 67 he decided to retire and went to live in the city, where he enjoyed a good life for twenty-two years.  He gave his help and services freely to the Methodist Church and died on 14 May 1941, leaving a widow and two daughters Mrs A.E. Auhl and Mrs Joseph Thomas of Willalo.  His son John predeceased him by three years.
