Accident/Obituary.  C.W. (Bill) Knight of Burra aged 56 died as the result of an accident at Booborowie in the early hours of Friday morning.  Mr Knight had been working north of Broken Hill for the past five weeks and was coming home for Easter.  He dropped a workmate off at Caltowie at about midnight and then proceeded to Burra.  Near Booborowie Hall he failed to negotiate a bend and the station wagon he was driving ran into a culvert on the right hand side of the road, resulting in his death.  [Clarence William Knight born 8 December 1911 Thebarton: died 12 April 1968 Booborowie, residence Burra North.]
