The Attack on Ullmann is given a more detailed account covering just over two columns.

In the case of Lines and Knevitt: Lines tried to prevent Knevitt’s arrest and had to be restrained by threat of a revolver and the constable was struck and kicked and hit over the eye and on the nose.  The last mentioned blow doing considerable damage.

These two were part of a gang of youths or a ‘push’ and Hornhardt was another member who, with Winders, asked to see Knevitt the evening after he had been sentenced.  When denied access Winders attacked Grosser and Hornhardt interfered.  With difficulty Hornhardt was arrested and Edward Winders was later arrested in his room at the Kooringa Hotel.  Hornhardt had been before the court previously which accounts for his more severe sentence.
