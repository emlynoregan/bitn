Burra Mine.  The company has taken advantage of the completion of the line to carry on it their heavy equipment recently arrived on the ‘Glencoe’.  It went up on the first train on Wednesday and a strong carriage was used to take it from the station.  Operations at the mine are being carried on as fast as possible and it is expected the arrival of the machinery will permit ore being dressed soon; perhaps in less than a month.
