Burra Cheer-up Society.

On 20 November the Ladiesâ€™ Band was at the station to welcome home Pte Andrew Pearce.  On Thursday the Band went to Mt Bryan to welcome Timothy James.  Photos have been received of the two Schuyler boys.  [Frank & Bob]

There was a welcome social last week for Ptes Andrew Pearce & Timothy James.  Sgt Dick Gully was greeted at the station the same night.  Sgt Gully had previously distinguished himself in the Transvaal Campaign.

On Wednesday 28 November the Band went to Robertstown to assist in raising money there for the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide.  A Continental had been arranged at the railway station.

Sympathy is extended to friends and family of Ptes G. Hill, Prior & Williams.
