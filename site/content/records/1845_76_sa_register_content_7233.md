A Dreadful Crime at Port Wakefield.  On Sunday 13 September Mr Lever, the Landlord of the Port Wakefield Arms, had some words with a mudpuncher named Dugald, who also broke one of his windows.  Lever went into his house and returned with a pistol, with which he blew away the whole of the manâ€™s lower jaw and tongue.  There was no medical assistance within 40 miles and the victim is not expected to live.  Lever made his escape, but we hope by now is in custody.  There are no police at Port Wakefield.
