E.T. Baulderstone  writes on Paxton Square costs.

He writes as Treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management.

The following is an outline of the management, finance, etc. of the Paxton Square Cottages Project.

Most people are aware that the cottages contribute to the history of SA and Australia.

I have been connected with their management for the past 20 years and wish to bring the correct facts to the notice of the grumblers who insist their rates are spent financing these cottages.

About four years ago the cottages were transferred to the Burra Burra DC gratis, the main reason being that the Council was in a position to receive grants, etc. for their development.

During the last three years approximately $500,000 has been made available in grants etc.

The Council appointed a management board to manage these grants and arranged for a loan of $100,000 for the first stage, which opened in April 1983 as holiday cottages.

18 months later the second stage was opened.

Since being in operation, the board has paid all loan repayments, amounting to over $65,000 and capital expenditure $42,000, in addition to the maintenance and operating costs.
