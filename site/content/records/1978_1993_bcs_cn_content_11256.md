The Women’s Agricultural Bureau of SA

A one-page article outlines the purpose of the organisation and prints the program for the Annual Conference to be held at the Burra Town Hall 12-15 August.

The organisation was aimed at women interested in agriculture and home matters.  It aimed to offer companionship and friendship, while encouraging informal adult education and the broadening of one’s outlook on life.  It was non-political and non-sectarian.
