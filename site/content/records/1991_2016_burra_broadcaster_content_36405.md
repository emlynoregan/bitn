Tony Ryan will be inducted into the Shearers’ Hall of Fame in Hay NSW on 24 April.  He will be only the second South Australian to have this honour.  Now 81, Tony was born in Burra and was a rouseabout before becoming a shearer.  He later became a contractor and then Senior Instructor in the SA Department of Agriculture.  He subsequently joined the Australian Wool Board, which became the Australian Wool Corporation.  He spent 22 years instructing young shearers.  As well as shearing techniques, he concentrated on physical fitness, repairs and maintenance of shearing equipment, industrial relations law and health and safety issues.  At BCS an invitation was issued for some sort of commemorative art work and a handsome sculpture resulted of the outline of a shearer shearing a sheep with the backdrop of an old style wool bale with Tony Ryan stencilled on it along with the dates for which he was a shearer – 1943-65.  Peter Reilly donated the old style wool bale and Andy Thomas the wool and a pair of hand shears was also donated.  The sculpture will be transported to Hay by the art teacher Roger Boehm for the induction.  [Photo of students with the sculpture.]
