Football.  Ray (Jimmy) James of Burra has won the G. Gilles Trophy for 1964 for gaining highest points in ‘B’ Grade football.  He also gained highest points in 1963, but no trophy was available that year.  Jimmy won the Mail Medal in 1950, 1951 and 1955 and now aged 43 and having completed 27 seasons of football, has decided to leave it to the younger generation. His ambition to be in a Premiership final has been denied him.  Although he was Captain-Coach of the Premiership side when Burra won in 1956 for the first time in 18 years, he was out of the Grand Final through injury.  The same fate befell him in 1960.  Last year in B Grade the team made the final, but were defeated.

B. Meyer for Clare South has won the Medal for Colts donated by the SA Umpires’ Association.
