AGL opened a new information office in Burra in response to the public’s widespread interest in the Hallett wind farm developments.  Visitors will be able to look at scale models of generator towers, watch a video of the construction of Hallett Stage 1 and get updates on AGL’s other projects.

AGL Hallett Wind Farm Stage 1 was officially opened in June 2008 with 45 wind turbines and a capacity of 94.5 MW.

AGL Stage 2 is currently under construction at Hallett Hill about 10.5 km south of Hallett.  The AGL Information Centre is at 7-9 Commercial St, Burra.
