‘Ratepayer’ writes disgusted at E.W. Crewes’s escape from the law last issue and also complaining that he had turned Hardy St [adjacent to Drew & Crewe’s bulk store at Aberdeen] into a wood yard.

G.A. Ridgway also complains that two reliable witnesses swore to the ownership of the cow, yet E.W      . Crewes got off.  ‘Comment is needless.’

Another letter follows a similar line.

Another letter asks why E.W. Crewes gets all the coronial enquiry jobs.
