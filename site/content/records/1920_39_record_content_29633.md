Burra Town Council, 21 January

Minutes of a special meeting which agreed to purchase a bitumen boiler for c. £250 were read.

The contribution for the local Fire Brigade for 1929 was fixed at £72.

F.M. Pearce was given permission to build a shop in Market Square for Jeffery & Byrnes.

Town Clerk reported the re-written assessment showed an increase of £287 (£256 of it in East Ward).

The mayor asked the Town Clerk to read an extract of advice from the Municipal Association for work to be done which had occasioned dispute at a previous meeting.
