Cricket

At Farrell Flat on Saturday Burra apparently defeated Farrell Flat by 7 wickets and 102 runs, when Farrell Flat could score only 52, but the description is muddied by the statement:

‘Burra, batting, first made 3 for 15 with L. Tattersall in three innings.’

In the Koonoona v. Buffs match Koonoona 3 for 170 defeated Buffs 50.
