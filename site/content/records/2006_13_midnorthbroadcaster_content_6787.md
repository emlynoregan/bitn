Two letters to the editor discuss the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre to be built at Eudunda at an estimated cost of $8.8 million.  Amanda Lloyd of Eudunda is sceptical and seeks much more information about the scheme and its financial implications.  She wonders whether it would be better to upgrade existing facilities and urges all concerned people to ask questions and seek answers before deciding on the path ahead.  Paul Schiller ECBaT Chairman and Nick Hambour Vice-Chairman of the Eudunda Oval Facilities Working Party write jointly to urge support for the scheme, seeing positive spin-offs for the whole region and expressing confidence of the areaâ€™s ability to obtain the necessary finance based on the funding obtained in recent years for other projects.  What is needed is a vision for the future.

Evan Hawke of Burra writes a letter, clearly concerned by the crisis in water management in SA and advocating a weir at Wellington on the Murray to supply irrigation water to the grazing land around the lakes.
