‘Student’ contributes an article on a trip to the Adelaide Exhibition on 23 March.  The school group boarded the railcar for the trip down and were photographed by The News on arrival – appearing in the afternoon edition.  A visit to the museum was followed by lunch and then a special tram took them to the Wayville Exhibition Grounds.  They ended the day at the Fun Park (sideshows).  Return was in a special carriage on the Broken Hill express.
