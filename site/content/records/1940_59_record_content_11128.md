A.B. Riggs writes to counter a story apparently circulating that Privates Ron Swinden and Arthur Cox were not the first to be publicly farewelled by Burra citizens.  Records show that they certainly were.  Reports in the Burra Record of 5 December 1939 confirm that they were the first at a farewell at the Burra Institute on 30 November 1939.  In the issue of 16 December [sic: actually the issue of 19 December]  T.P. Halls is reported as going to Adelaide to farewell his son Robert, but Pte Halls was not farewelled by Burra citizens, nor does his name appear on the Burra Honour list in the Record.  Pte Len Wahlert was farewelled during the interval at the pictures on Saturday 30 December 1939.
