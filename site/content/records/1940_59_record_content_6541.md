The Home Guard

It has been decided to replace the existing RSL, VDC and Rifle Club Reserve with a ‘Home Guard’.  While the existing organisations had no definite role in the defence of Australia, the Home Guard will be under the Military Area Commander, with a definite role to play.  The Home Guard will be recruited from men aged 18-60 who are not liable for military service or in essential emergency services.  The order of preference for enlistment will be:

Returned Soldiers

Rejected AIF & Militia Volunteers

Rifle Club Reserve

Other citizens

It will be a voluntary, unpaid, part-time force to provide local static defence protection of vulnerable and key points, guerrilla warfare and timely warning of enemy movements to superior military forces.

The present quota is only 50,000 for all of Australia and 17 for Burra, but it is understood that it will be expanded when equipment becomes available.
