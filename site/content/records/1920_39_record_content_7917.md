Burra Football Assoc. Friday last.

Aberdeen Football Club alleged that G. Dew lives nearer their ground than Kooringaâ€™s and therefore cannot play for the latter.  Minutes of 17 May showed that Dew considered he lived nearer Kooringa and consequently it was ruled 7 to 2 that he could play for Kooringa.  The meeting confirmed the original decision and it was left to the Aberdeen club to appeal to the League if they wished.
