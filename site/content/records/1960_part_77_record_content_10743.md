Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller

1917

The year opened with 23 students and a new football and basketball were ordered.  Seven students attended a Boy Scout Rally in Adelaide and the school celebrated Violet Day on 6 July.  On 21 August snow fell between 8 and 11 a.m.  Hazel Edwards got 5 subjects in the Junior Commercial Class.  Josephine West topped Junior Public and Grace Lloyd topped the Primary Class.

1918

The Head Teacher was R. Hitchcox with J. Biddle Assistant in Charge & Lois Jones Assistant.

There were 20 in 1st year, 7 in Commercial, 2 in Junior Public and 2 in Senior Commercial.  Commercial Classes were formed to encourage parents to keep children at school.  Application was made to the Education Department for the formation of a High School Council, but this was refused.  On 12 November three earth tremors were felt.

1919

J. Biddle was Assistant in Charge.  The school was closed for some time due to the influenza epidemic.  On 14 March the school took part in the opening of RSL Club Rooms.  On 2 April there was a Welcome Home to Nurses and Soldiers.  The Hon. John Lewis presented the school with gymnasium apparatus.  On 19 July Peace Celebrations were held and Peace Medals distributed.  The school assembled to see Prime Minister Hughes pass through the Burra Railway Station on the way home from the Peace Conference and they were given a half-holiday.

1920

School opened on 19 January with 26 on the roll, but only 19 presented.  Later in the year the possibility of school closure was raised.  Mr James Reed presented a Model Ship to the school, the sale of which had raised a large sum for patriotic funds.  @3 March Sir Ross Smith and party arrived and a half-holiday was declared.  On 3 July the school closed for a fortnight in honour of the visit to SA of the Prince of Wales.
