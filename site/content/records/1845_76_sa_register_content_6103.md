Court of Revision

When our special reporter arrived the town was abuzz with excitement over the coming election.  The Court was held in the small and very inconvenient Kooringa Court House as a matter of form, but almost immediately adjourned to the large room at the Burra Hotel.  Mr Dashwood presided, assisted by Messrs Bull & Chambers.

A group of four persons, headed by an elector named Taylor had objected to the 168 person being enrolled to vote.

Mr Mann appeared for Mr Kingston and the other 167.

The objections fell into two types:

Objections to parties who dwelt in houses of the Burra Burra Company, where the houses had a greater value than £10 p.a., but without paying rent.

Objections to parties who dwelt in houses of the Burra Burra Company, where the houses had a greater value than £10 p.a., but the rent paid amounted to less than £10 p.a.

After some discussion it was orders that the parties lodging the objection must appear or their objections must fail.

As the names were read over and no one came to sustain the objections, al the names were retained upon the list.

SA Elections: Mr Mildred at Burra

Mr Mildred the candidate for Stanley & Gawler entered the room at 5 p.m.

Dr Bull was voted into the chair and Mr Mildred spent some time describing his views on civil and religious liberty, education, no state aid to religion, the ballot, universal suffrage, triennial Parliaments, and state economy.

Mr Mortlock moved that Mr Henry Mildred was a fit and proper person to represent and that he be requested to become a candidate for the District of the Burra.’

Mr Taylor gave a rambling speech in seconding the motion.
