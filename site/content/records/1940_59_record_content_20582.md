Burra Primary School Grade VII visited The Burra Record office last Friday and will visit other local sites of interest in the future.  In about 1Â½ hours they were shown how things were done in the past, with the demonstration of an old press, shown the latest cylinder, cutting and wire-stitching machines and the linotype.  The linotype seemed to hold most interest, followed by the automatic addressograph, which addresses the wrappers used on delivered copies of the paper.  They also visited the stock room, housing the various papers and pasteboards used in printing.
