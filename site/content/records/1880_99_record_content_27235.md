Editorial Review of 1887.

1887 was not as disastrous as its predecessor: 1886 had been marked by financial, commercial and moral panic.

The year saw the South Australian International Exhibition of Arts, Industries and Sciences, which though not a Government enterprise, was favoured by it.  It was the responsibility of, and managed by, the private sector, though the buildings will remain mostly as Government property.  There were c. 700,000 admissions.

Economic recovery has been slow, but perceptible and on a sounder basis.

The season is propitious.

The Alma and Victoria Mine (Waukaringa) promises finally to deliver real dividends.

The riches of the Barrier will contribute to SA’s prosperity through the new rail connection.

Politics saw the introduction of a new tariff, which increased protection.

The payment of members of Parliament was passed for next year.

With some difficulty the Upper House was induced to pass a tax bill based on the old higher land values and decreased the untaxed amount from £300 to £200.

[The editor then discusses the political situation elsewhere in Australia, in the Empire, and finally in Europe.]

Locally there were no special events in 1887.

The loss of trade through the depression has been exacerbated by the construction of the Broken Hill railway, which has taken away the north-east trade.

Rising copper prices might have offered some hope, but it is now widely believed that the old mine will never work again unless under new owners.

At the election F.W. Holder and W.B. Rounsevell were elected and our late representative, Dr Cockburn, found a constituency at Mt Barker.

Mr Holder has given way to Mr P.L. Killicoat as Mayor at the end of the year.

The present demand for labour has given some hope that the unemployment trouble is past.

We have lost many local identities who have moved on to other places, most perhaps to Broken Hill.

Burra Town Council.  The Government has agreed to extend the lease on the Waterworks for three months.

The Primitive Methodist Tea was well patronised and their Sunday school anniversary also went well.

The Flower Queen performances were well patronised and successful.
