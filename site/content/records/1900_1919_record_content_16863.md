Paull’s Mine.  After considerable delay in setting up the machinery it is expected to start operation today.  There is plenty of ore in reserve in different drives and arrangements will be made to run three shifts when 750 tons will be treated weekly.  Mr C.A. Fuss left Burra on Monday to meet the new manager Mr E. Pryor at Petersburg and they travelled on together.
