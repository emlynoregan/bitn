The Sesquicentenary of John McDouall Stuart’s crossing of Australia from south to north is being celebrated.  It was 150 years yesterday that the explorer and his party reached the north coast of Australia to become the first Europeans to traverse the continent from south to north through the centre.  Celebrations are planned at Port Stuart in the NT, at London, Adelaide and at Burra this weekend.  On Friday evening a small exhibition of artefacts associated with the expedition has been arranged and will be opened at the Burra Regional Art Gallery, which is the site of the old Kooringa Telegraph Station.  It was from here that Stuart sent a telegram announcing his success and his return.  There will be a Morse demonstration.  Margaret Blacker of the John McDouall Stuart Society will be the guest speaker in the evening and there will be a dinner at the Burra Hotel.  On Saturday morning a small contingent of horses and riders will assemble at the Burra Pony Club for the re-enactment of Stuart’s arrival.  The group with wagons will stop at Peacock’s Chimney before making their way to the Gallery where Morse code operators will re-enact the transmission of Stuart’s telegram.  The team will then adjourn to the Showgrounds where The Burra Men’s Shed will provide a barbecue luncheon.  There is already a plaque commemorating Stuart’s telegram, placed on the Art Gallery by the John McDouall Stuart Society in 1995, the Burra Jubilee 150 year.
