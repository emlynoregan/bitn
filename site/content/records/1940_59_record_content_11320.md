Burra Public School Arbor Day was held on 11 September.  Two trees were dedicated to two former students who had died on active service in the war.  They were dedicated by Rev. H.K. Bartlett and planted to the memory of Dick Satchell and Rod Wilson by Barbara Hill and Norman Wilson respectively.  Special lessons were given in the morning dealing with aspects of Arbor Day.  Speeches were delivered by Mr H. Jennison, Mayor T.H. Woollacott, Rev. H.K. Bartlett and S. Kellaway, after which the children were granted a half holiday.
