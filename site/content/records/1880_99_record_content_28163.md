The Ratepayers’ Meeting on the waterworks reported last issue is here reported at length.

On 1 March the deputation of Mayor, Town Clerk and the two members for the district waited on the Premier, in the absence of the Commissioner of Public Works, and asked for a reduction in interest rates.  If not they would give up the works to the Government.  The alternative they had was to shift the pump to the Government well and then supply the Government.  The deputation was led to believe that the Government would take water from them if this were done.  Since the deputation other places like Gawler and Tea Tree Gully have also asked for a reduction in the rate of interest.  As yet there has been no reply from the Government.

The debt stood at 	£393-8-1

The income was		£257-3-0

Leaving a probable deficiency of	£136-5-1	as of 31 March

The Corporation would have to pay, if they retained the waterworks at 5% p.a., about £640 interest a year.

For 1886 the income had been 	£577-7-0

For 1887 income was 	£439-9-4

Plus sum owed by guarantors	£70-0-0
