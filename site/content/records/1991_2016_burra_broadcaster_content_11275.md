Burra Show, 119 years old.

An article reviewing the history of the show makes the following points:

In 1925 memories placed the first show in 1875, but reports in the Adelaide Observer say the first show was actually in 1877.  [There is no uncertainty about this; the first Burra Show is reported in the Burra News and Northern Mail 14 September 1877, Page 2.]

The first show was held in a walled enclosure of the old smelting works.

The first show was held in drizzling rain, but had a good attendance.   		     Admission was 2/6 and 1/- after 2 p.m.

The show was held in the smelting yard for nine years, after which there was a recess until 1894.

The resurrected 1894 show was held at Victoria Park i.e. the Burra Oval.

The 1894 attendance was estimated at 2,300 and the society closed the year £100 in credit.

From 1877 till 1884 the show was followed by a banquet in the evening.

In 1895 a substantial stone building was erected for indoor exhibits.  The society’s share of its cost was £90.

In 1897 the show was cancelled due to the appalling seasonal conditions of severe drought.

The show returned in 1898.
