Future Prospects

Visiting politicians and businessmen forecast a bright future for the district.  One said the Government is drawing up plans for a pipeline from the Murray to the Eastern Pastoral Country with a route Morgan-Florieton-Old Koomooloo-Bazentin-Faraway Hill-Braemar-Tiverton-Yunta and later to Broken Hill.  At present the Eastern pastoralists cannot really carry their stock through droughts and would be much more productive if properly reticulated.

A.P. Blesing, a former Minister of Agriculture did not like the prospects for wheat farming because the Chifley Government had a five-year commitment to sell 4Â½ million bushels to New Zealand at 5/9 a bushel.  Wool prospects were much better he said, with good potential for demand for Merino wool in the Northern Hemisphere.

Mr Mitchell, representative of a firm of wool buyers, said Australia could double wool production and still find buyers.

[Synthetics did not seem to offer serious competition in the immediate future, as they had poor wearing qualities and lacked warmth.]
