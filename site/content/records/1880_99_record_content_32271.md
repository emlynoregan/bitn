Since the last meeting the Association’s agents in London entered into an agreement to sell the mine for £70,000 along with the mineral rights in the Burra Survey and a further 1,783 acres elsewhere, but the purchasers are now declining to fulfil the contract.  The directors are seeking to compel the completion of the purchase.
