Goats are proving to be a problem ‘Out East’.  Large mobs are roaming the area and despite the dry conditions are keeping fat, though in the process they cause a lot of damage to herbage.  Graziers are paying well for their scalps.  We hear that over 700 have been destroyed at a dam on Mr Reg. Warnes’ ‘Gluepot’ Station in recent months.  One hunter shot 120 in seven days.  They are said to come from straying domestic goats from the River District.
