Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Institute on Monday of last week.  F.T. Sara was voted into the chair.  The Mayor read his report.

This year funds were allotted to Wards according to the length of roads and paths to be maintained.  S. Kellaway asked for Councillors views on this.

Crs Lee, Morgan and Woollacott were in favour, but Crs Allen, Harris & Pearce were opposed, believing generally that money should be spent where it was raised.

Mr Kellaway asked if Councillors favoured asking the Fire Brigade authorities for a faster vehicle for the fire reel – at present it could do about 15 m.p.h.  The Mayor said yes.

Mr Hall queried the posts and rails in the centre of the road off Ludgvan St leading to his place.  He considered it dangerous in an unlit street.  They wouldn’t be needed if the culvert went from pavement to pavement.

The Mayor said cost was a factor and the extra width of road would never be used.

Cr Woollacott thought it dangerous, but it was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.  The saving had been a paltry 24/-.

There was then some discussion about lopping and/or removing trees.

There was a question about a road to the school.  Apparently there wasn’t one, though there is some agitation to have one proclaimed.

Mr Riggs said he endeavoured to carry out his duties according to standing orders and believed the present method of deciding on Public Works was the best.  He favoured the method of allocating funds to Wards as used last year.  The town should be worked as a unit not as three wards.

Last year East Ward had a deficit because of the large sum needed for Finch’s Bridge.

Cr Pearce opposed the present system of Ward funding.  East Ward needed more money.  It had about 8 bridges to keep going and more heavily used roads than North Ward, even if North Ward had a greater length of roads.

Cr Woollacott thanked ratepayers for his re-election, but had hoped for opposition and hoped to see more at the meeting.  He considered the conducting of the Council to be unsatisfactory and the principle on which the Public Works was run was the most vicious he knew of in any Council.  It amounted to one Councillor being sooled against another.  Nearly all motions were carried on a block vote on the casting vote of the Mayor.  He had worked with the Mayor amicably for eight years as Councillor, but as Mayor he would have his own pet way of having work done.  Members who were not on the Public Works Committee had practically no say and £500 worth could be put through in half an hour.  He compared it to the Hospital Board where Mr Hawkes allowed each member a fair chance and business took 2½ to 3 hours, whereas the Council disposed of its business in less than half an hour.  He was gagged over the tarring of the road from Gully’s Wharf.  The road to Bevan’s had to be maintained, but East Ward picked up all the rates in that quarter.  [The new housing area of Graham.]

North Ward had to maintain the Station Road and the one from the racecourse along which all the wheat came.  The road in front of the Redruth Memorial Hall was a disgrace.  They needed proper plant and they had horses which no one would take for their hides.  The Council needed new blood.

The value of the houses and property had shrunk 25 to 50% and he wanted a cut in rates.  He knew a house which cost £400 rated at £900.

The Mayor said no work in North Ward was put up to Committee except by a North Ward Councillor and he denied either unfairness or ill-will.  Cr Woollacott was hard of hearing which had led to misunderstandings.
