Tpr Rollin Dare

Writes on 27 June from a place that was over 100ºF every day, but cold at night.  The hills were rough and treeless and they were taking quinine against malaria. The food, despite mostly being tinned was good.  He also describes supplementing rations with locally bought eggs and vegetables.  He suggests his mother read the Bible at Acts 22 Verses 10-11.  [Which explains entering Damascus.]  Writing on July 12 he talks of rugged hills that easily conceal snipers and where the roads make a series of elbow bends.  The sheep were poor and had very coarse wool and the inhabitants filthy.  Ploughs were hauled by any animal – even a cow or a donkey.  He mentions coming under machine gun fire, but being well protected in the carrier.  He was by 14 July in a comfortable camp by a cool stream and the war was over in that area, so he was anticipating some sight-seeing.
