New entrance gates will be provided at the southwest and northwest corners and a roadway built inside the area leading from one gate to the other and to partly circumnavigate the oval.

Existing dead or useless trees will be removed and a new tree planting scheme implemented – to include a row or avenue of trees, one of which will be dedicated to each of the men who fell in the last war.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd have generously donated land adjacent to the Drill Hall on which it is proposed to erect six hardcourt tennis courts, a clubhouse, a children’s playground and a shrubbery.

The total costs have not yet been ascertained, but the committee is confident that they will not exceed £3,000.

The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that donations of £1 or more will qualify for a deduction from income tax.
