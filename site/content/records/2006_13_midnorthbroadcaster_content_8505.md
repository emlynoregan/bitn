Football.  The BBH Rams are looking to make history this Saturday in the premiership match at Riverton.  BBH have never been premiers since their formation 1986 with the union of Burra, Booborowie and Hallett.  They have not taken part in a premiership game since 1988 when they lost to BSR Tigers.  In the minor round they won 16 of their 17 games.
