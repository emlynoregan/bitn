The inquest was then adjourned for Dr Cave to conduct a post mortem.

[The report then goes into considerable detail on the appearance and condition of various body organs.  The key discoveries were that the lungs were very congested and highly oedematous.  The right side of the heart contained a considerable quantity of clotted blood.]

Dr Cave concluded that the condition of the heart and lungs were sufficient to cause death.  The heart had probably been affected for years, but the lungs only recently.

The jury found that the deceased had died from natural causes.

‘Before the rising of the Court the Coroner said that the Resident Government Medical Officer, Dr Dashwood, had treated the Coroner and Jury in a very disrespectful manner.  He was the first medical man to see the body, and the proper person to have given evidence, but had sent a very lame excuse through Dr Cave for non-attendance, after having been requested by Lance-Caporal Smith to attend.  It was well known that Dr Dashwood had been attending private persons during the sitting of the Court, and if he could attend patients he could have been in court.  The Foreman said that the majority of the Jury fully concurred in these remarks.’

[Jane Goodfellow is registered as dying 10 August 1875 at Kooringa aged 32.  She was born Jane Armstrong.]
