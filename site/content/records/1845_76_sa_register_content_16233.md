Kooringa News, 18 December

This morning arrangements were made to present another address to Mr Stuart on his departure by the Adelaide mail and for escorting him for some distance along the road.  Mr McDermott SM, Dr Mayne JP and Mr J.R. Anderson JP escorted Mr Stuart from his room at the Burra Hotel to the mail cart when it drew up about half past eight.  The address was read by Mr McDermott and Mr Stuart acknowledged the honour.  He was looking better than on the previous evening as he was helped into the bus.

Nine cartfuls of people and others on horseback accompanied Stuart about three miles down the Adelaide Road, giving him three hearty old English cheers before returning to Kooringa.

The address:

‘To John McDouall Stuart Esq.

Sir – The inhabitants of the Burra beg me, before you leave this for Adelaide, to assure you that they rejoice at your safe return from your eminently successful though perilous journey, and they feel proud of the honour and privilege of being able to call you fellow-colonist, after having accomplished what your indomitable pluck and perseverance alone could achieve.

‘They sincerely regret that your health has so severely suffered from the privations and exposure to which you have been subjected and which are inseparable from the life of an explorer; but trust that the comforts  of a civilised home, to which you are now returning, will soon restore you to your former health.

They trust you may long live to enjoy the laurels which you have so nobly won, with so much credit to yourself and such material advantage to the colony, and which they feel sure will be duly appreciated by the public and the Legislature.  They heartily bid you welcome back to South Australia.

‘M. McDermott, SM

‘On behalf of the inhabitants of the Burra.’
