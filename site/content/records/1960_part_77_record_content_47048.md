Freedom From Hunger Campaign

Attendance at a public meeting on Thursday was disappointing.  A new committee was formed in Burra to address the challenge. Rev. Milton Edwards is Chairman of the District Committee.

Mr E.C. Allen, MP for Burra, is pushing for lights or reflecting strips on the sides of goods and passenger vehicles on trains following a recent accident.  [The railways officials and government firmly resisted this idea.]

The Burra District Swimming Club & Burra Football Club have been granted use of the Burra Town Hall on 30 August and 4 October and pictures will be cancelled on those nights.  Some people argue that the pictures are run at a loss and the hall could be let more often for other functions.  Picture attendances have improved somewhat since the hall modifications have been completed.  There are at present no intentions to further disrupt the pictures.

The Burra Schools have poor water pressure making the additional fire hydrant installed last winter ineffective.  The E & WS Department will provide an alternative feed by laying a main across the creek from the Telephone Exchange.

Bruce Stockman was successful in the recent SA Porker & Baconer Carcass Competition.  He was 4th in the Porker Section from 15 entries.  It is the first time he has entered.
