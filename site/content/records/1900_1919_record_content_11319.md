Fred Rogers, youngest son of John Rogers of Baldina, was riding to F.T. Jones’ station on Monday night on his bicycle.  At the 8-mile peg at Hangman’s Hut he was thrown off and broke his right collarbone.  On regaining consciousness after a few minutes he rode six miles to Mr Jones and after a painful and sleepless night walked back to his father’s at Baldina in the morning.  He was brought in to Burra in a trap and attended to by Dr Sangster.
