Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. for fortnight to 30 November

Crosscuts off the main shaft: east crosscut was extended at 200 ft level from 20 to 41 ft and has now been halted.  Have opened out on the lode 18 ft east of the shaft and began driving on this lode.  Advanced 9 ft south on the lode, which was 3½ ft wide.  Advanced north on the lode 8 ft.  The lode is broken and erratic and showing fine gold by sampling.

Open Cut: in the southwest end have gone down 18 ft through overburden and have picked up a rich vein carrying rich gold.
