West Burra Copper Mine: report of the Inspector of Mines after a visit on 18 Feb. 1915.

The mine is on section 116 H. of Hanson and 3½ miles SW of the Burra Mine.  The main underlie shaft was sunk on the dip of the lode for 100’ and then for a further 55’ on a soft break in the country.  At 53’ the lode was cut off in a fault and the displacement is not yet determined.  A fair amount of driving at 100’ has not found the lode though some isolated patches have been found.  Lode is well defined to 50’.  Some recent driving on the lode has shown high grade ore in a fairly defined lode for 20’ when a fault is found.

The inspector goes on to suggest further driving to find the displaced lode and winze sinking to assist in locating a drive to intersect the ore at 100’.  All in all he says the mine is still promising.
