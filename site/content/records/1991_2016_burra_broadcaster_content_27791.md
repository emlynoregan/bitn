Burra Antique Fair last weekend was very successful and dealers went away well pleased.  Visitor numbers were slightly up on last year and many shops suggested visitors were spending more.  Over 1,400 passed through the Town Hall and the new venue of St Mary’s Parish Hall.  The committee and the National Trust decided against fire engine rides this year on account of safety concerns, but the Model T was a static display at St Mary’s and the Diamond T was in Market Square.

Burra Red Cross will run a disaster services training course on 27 May.
