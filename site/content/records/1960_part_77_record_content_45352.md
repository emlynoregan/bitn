[There are several errors in this list:

* 1887 was omitted and F.W. Holder was the Mayor for this year.

† In November 1888 P.L. Killicoat was elected unopposed for 1889, but on seeing the election results he immediately resigned, citing personal reasons.  In fact it seems he was unwilling to work with Cr Sampson.  As a result of nominations called for 24 December 1888 F.W. Holder was elected unopposed and served as Mayor for 1889

‡ This should read P.L. Killicoat

§ In November 1901 Alexander Harris was elected unopposed for 1902, but he died on 25 December 1901 without attending a meeting of Council.  E.W. Crewes was elected unopposed to replace him on 10 January 1902 and served as Mayor for 1902.

║ William Charles Leonard West was Mayor from December 1906-November 1908.  Dr John Ikin Sangster Jnr was Mayor from December 1908-November 1909.

¶A new Act of Parliament, effective 2 November 1934 changed the Municipal Year from approximately a calendar year (actually December to November) to one running from July to June.  The life of the 1934 Council was extended to the 1st Saturday in July 1935.  This means that the later Mayors, beginning their terms in July, should be:

1937-39	S. Kellaway

1939-46	T.H. Woollacott

1946-48	H.J.B. Jennison

1948-50	F.T. Marston

1950-54	W. Carpenter

1954-69	E.T. Baulderstone.]
