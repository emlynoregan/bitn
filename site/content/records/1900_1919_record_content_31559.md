Election.  Hundreds watched the election results as they were posted on a large screen as they came in by telegraph.  Mr W.B. Page organised the screen and two large outdoor lamps to illuminate it.  [The February 14 issue says the screen showed results from every district and they were updated until a little after 2 a.m. when the last message arrived.  This was organised by the Liberal Union, but no location is given.]
