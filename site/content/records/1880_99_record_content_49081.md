Burra Town Council, 6 March.

The meeting of the Council is reported at length: running to 2½ columns, but it is unedifying and generally summed up by the editorial.

Though there was a great deal of dissention over the Mayor’s report as already noted, there was also unedifying squabbling over other relatively trivial matters such as who would water the trees and who would get paid for it.

Cr Kitchen submitted his resignation which was accepted and the fines pertaining to the move were waived.

[A presentation from Lodge members reported in XV, 237, 29 Mar. 1893 page 3, suggest he was leaving the town and the quarterly meeting of the Kooringa Wesleyan Circuit confirms he was moving to Adelaide, see XV, 238, 5 Apr. 1893, page 2.]

Nominations for the vacancy to be gazetted on 20 March.

The Mayor’s report at this meeting included an attack on Cr Parks which could not be reported because the Mayor ‘collared it after the meeting and pocketed it.’

William Bennett, the young man charged with setting fire to Mr Melrose’s grass at Ulooloo has been let off and two Williams brothers are now charged with the offence.
