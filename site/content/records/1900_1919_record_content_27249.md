The Burra Record resumes this week after a lapse of three months due to the fire.  The premises are still being rebuilt and we operate temporarily in entirely unsuitable premises as far as the compositors are concerned.  The fire reduced the old type to flakes of metal from 2-6’ long and 12” to 3’ wide.
