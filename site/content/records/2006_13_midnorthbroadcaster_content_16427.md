Helen Edwards writes:

I spoke with Goyder Council last September about the possibility that four local businesses could close.  I asked what Council would do about that and suggested that resurrecting something like the Yacht Club would bring people to the town.  For this the creek needed to be cleaned out.  £33,000 was allocated to this task.  The reeds were poisoned and I expected some follow-up, but nothing has been done.  The £33,000 can go back to consolidated revenue if there is no action.  The Council seems to have a policy of procrastination until projects wither and die.
