Tom Koutsantonis, Mineral Resources Development Minister, was in Burra last Wednesday to hear oral submissions regarding the proposed exploration of the Burra Mine.  Phoenix Copper is keen to undertake diamond drilling along the projected northern extension of the Monster Mine at Burra North.  The drilling program has been suspended pending the Ministerâ€™s decision on the lifting of reserve status for the mine area.  The Minister heard submissions and will now digest all the information and then return to Burra with a decision.  A spokesperson for the Minister said a decision could be expected very soon.  Mr Koutsantonis met with representatives from the Council, the National Trust, BRTBA, Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee and the CMC.  Phoenix Copper was not represented, not having been advised of the discussions.
