24 August 1988

Burra Traders’ Association Chairperson Gary Donaldson writes to complain on behalf of members about the incidence of itinerant traders operating in the area.

When goods purchased pose a problem the itinerant trader is not on hand while local retailers are.

Local traders pay rates and help maintain the district.

Local traders turn much money back into the town.

Local traders risk their resources and become part of the town.

When next you are running a raffle or require prizes for one or for a trading table or are selling tickets for an event your local trader is there.

ITINERANTS ARE NOT SUPPORTING ANY OF THE ABOVE.
