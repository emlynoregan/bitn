The Easter Cricket Carnival.  The weather was favourable for cricket and good play was seen on both pitches, Victoria Park and the Racecourse.

The Broken Hill team missed the welcome by the Mayor because their train was four hours late.

The dance in the RSL Hall on Saturday night was a definite success.
