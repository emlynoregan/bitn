A Letter to the Editor protests at Cr Sampson’s hypocrisy in objecting to the Salvation Army being a obstruction in the square; pointing out Cr Sampson is prepared to regularly obstruct the footpath himself while ‘standing on a box with a riding whip in his hand, surrounded by an assortment of, well, almost everything, for the purpose of, as he says, giving the people a bargain.’
