SA Gold Diggings

Messrs Carey & Wren have sent in an application to the Government for the discovery of several ounces of gold in a locality where 100 men can find remunerative employment in gold digging.  We understand that His Excellency is likely to make regulations that the reward be paid out of licence fees for gold digging.  We understand Messrs Carey & Wren are willing to their claim being tested by this means.

Mr Morris of the Lunatic Asylum has drawn attention to specimens from the vicinity of Cox’s creek.

An offer was recently made to Messrs Matthew Smith and Phillip Levi by parties wishing to work for gold in sections on the Torrens formerly known as the Riversedge Mine, for 10% of the amount produced.  The offer was declined.  And Messrs Smith and Levi now have a party working there.
