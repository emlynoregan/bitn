District Advisory Committee met last Thursday evening.  Much of the discussion concerned the need of it to act as a co-ordinating influence on the community.

A number of suggestions were made for community initiatives.  The development of Cousin Jack’s as a tourist Information Centre is one matter of high priority.  A suggestion was made that more use could be made of Johnny Green as a symbol.
