Burra Town Council, 5 April

The Burra Electric Supply Co. advises it is doing all it can about streetlights, but a wartime shortage of supplies is a problem.  It asks that Council get the official blackout regulations.  Council will do so.

Officers of HMAS Burra-Bra wrote saying personnel of the ship would place the plaque that Burra people were sending, in a prominent position and send a photo of it.  The ship also required two radio receiving sets and hoped the people of Burra could assist.

Cr Lee moved that the plaque be forwarded.

A public meeting about the plaque will now be called.

The Mayor indicated his willingness to stand again if it was the wish of ratepayers.

The other retiring Councillors are also willing to stand again.

Stan Kellaway Jnr was the only applicant for the Rangerâ€™s position and was subsequently appointed.

Willow trees will be planted along the Burra Creek towards Burra North and suitably protected.
