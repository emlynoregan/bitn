Last week the National Trust presented the Goyder Council with a proposal to simplify the administration of the Burra Heritage Passport.  It proposes to revamp the current lease of heritage sites from the Council to the National Trust.  Council is asked to consider handing management and administration of all Burra heritage sites to the National Trust and for the National Trust to be fully responsible for the passport product and the management of all its income.  30% of passport income would go to the maintenance of Council owned sites and 30% to National Trust sites.  10% would go in marketing and promotion and 5% for administration and infrastructure.  The remaining 25% would cover commission, grant applications and other opportunities.  Appropriate boundaries for Council sites would need to be defined (the local rubbish dump is currently attached to the National Trust’s lease).  The National Trust hopes for a solution within a few months.  Concerns have since been raised regarding the Burra Visitor Centre’s role and capacity within the National Trust scheme.  Since 2003 the Centre has been run by BRTBA and has been the sole sales outlet for the Burra Passport Product.  The national Trust’s proposal would see it remain a major player in tourism, but not necessarily the sole outlet for the Passport.  Manager Andrew Glen was concerned about the financial implications for the Visitor Centre and the future administration of the Passport Product – where would commissions on the Passport go?  Burra Visitor Board of Management Chairman, Brenton Greenslade said the Centre operated on a break-even budget.  BRTBA is also concerned and is happy with the present management of Passport sales.  Another worry is that regional tourism in SA has seen a 20% fall this year.  BRTBA took over the Centre in 2003 when the National Trust decided not to renew its lease.  Since then it has doubled its membership fees, sought corporate sponsorship and increased its membership dramatically to more than 70.
