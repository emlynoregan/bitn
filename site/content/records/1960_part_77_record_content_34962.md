Weather.  On Tuesday a severe thunderstorm brought two inches and more of rain and hail in a short time to an area east of Burra.  The area was north of the west end of Princess Royal and the massive run-off went east rather than towards Burra.  Mr George Woodman said that for the short time it took to fall the whole side of the range looked like a moving mass of water.  At Klaebe’s Creek near Studholme a wall of water at least four feet high crossed the spillway.  At Pine Creek crossing where 5 ft pipes have recently been installed the flow was 2 ft above the roadway.  A vast sheet of water and hailstones swept across the road at the four mile corner and through the property of Mrs J. Rooke.  Deep Creek and the Baldina Crossing were flooded when water from Mullaby area cascaded down.  At Mrs V. Bruce’s ‘Armonda’ Mr R. Alderson reported a fall of 140 points in less than 50 minutes.  Roof guttering could not cope and very little of it went into tanks.  He reports a lot of fencing is down and a lot of rubbish and old tyres etc. deposited by the receding water.  The property gained a lot of silt.  During the height of the flooding the Morgan and Eastern Roads were cut and the school bus and other vehicles were held up for some time.  All dams in the area were filled and several burst, causing a further rush of muddy liquid.  At one stage along the main road hail was stacked up two feet high against the netting fence.

Princess Royal recorded 80 points, Mrs J. Rooke 104, Armonda 140, Baldina 70, Mongolata 17 and J. Oates 7.

West of Burra there were isolated heavy falls.  J. Lockett at Springbank gauged 112 and Old Koonoona 53, but Burra recorded a mere 9 points.
