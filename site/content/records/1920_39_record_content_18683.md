Fire damaged the kitchen of a house in Ware St owned by Messrs S. & R. Pearce and occupied by Mrs & Miss Briskham on Saturday.  A duster which had caught fire was placed in the duster bag when it was believed to have been extinguished.  It evidently smouldered for some time before bursting into flames.
