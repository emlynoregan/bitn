Revival.  The movement which began when Dr Torr attended the Redruth anniversary continues and 44 young people at Redruth and 17 at Iron Mine have made a commitment to the church.

Hanson Methodist Church.

Finding that no building in SA was being erected to commemorate the bicentenary of John Wesley’s birth the trustees of Hanson church have decided to name the one they are preparing to build ‘Wesley Bicentenary Church’.  £130 has been received towards the expected £200.
