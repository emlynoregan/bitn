Hallett Railway. The Govt. announces that it is looking at extending the Hallett line to Jamestown. The Ed. considered that a better idea would be to extend it to Gottllieb's, Parneroo, Paratoo, Chewings and thence to the Barrier, as was recommended by the Railway Commission of 1875. Gottlieb's was about as far as Jamestown from Hallett - about 22 miles.

The gauge question was also raised. [The line from Pt Pirie to Jamestown was 3'6" and the Hallett line was 5'3" so that somewhere there was going to be a break of gauge station.]
