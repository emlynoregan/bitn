Letter from W.H. Hardy who reveals himself as the writer of the letter from ‘Rubbish’ in the last issue but one.  He writes re the attack on ‘Rubbish’  [Since this does not seem to have been in The Record, it may have appeared in the abandoned Tandem magazine.]

[Hardy’s letter is excessively wordy and pompous and it is no surprise that after over ½ column of it the editor writes: ‘We cannot find room for any more of this.]
