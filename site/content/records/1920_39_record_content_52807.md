Obituary.  Frank Treloar’s death at his West Croydon home on Sunday [16 September] last came as a shock, as although he had been very ill the recent news had reported an improvement in his health.  He was born at North Adelaide 1 June 1852, the eldest son of one of the pioneers of SA.  His parents had arrived in SA in the early 1840s.  His father after a successful trip to the Victorian gold diggings took up lad at Watervale and with his wife and Frank, then only five months old, left by bullock wagon for their new home, which was a tent until a house could be built.  Mr Treloar was one of the first scholars at Mr Coles’ well-known school at Watervale.  At 14 he went to work for an auctioneer for four years and then went into the wheat trade at Hoyleton, which was then the shipping station for all wheat grown north of there.  He next tried his hand at farming, but unfortunately chose those dry areas near Orroroo.  He was married at that time and for five years he and his wife tried hard to make a success of it, but after losing all their money gave up the idea of fighting nature and went back to the old home at Watervale.  There for six months he acted as a wheat agent before being appointed manager of Gum Creek Station, owned by Sir John Duncan.  At the time the station comprised 32,000 acres and there was also an eastern block belonging to the proprietors who ran from 100,000 to 130,000 sheep.  He held the position for many years.  Mr Treloar, like his wife, knew and loved horses and was a recognised judge of good stock and whilst on Gum Creek had the satisfaction of riding and driving some of the best horses in SA.  While he was manager of Gum Creek the then flourishing Burra Coursing Club had many successful meetings there and in every instance Mr Treloar held the position of judge.  On leaving Gum Creek he came to reside in Burra, now some 35 years ago.  During that period he acted as Secretary for the Burra Hospital, the Burra Agricultural Society [Show Society], Burra Sports Assoc. and was also clerk for a number of years for the Hanson DC.  Mr Treloar also occupied a seat on the Burra Town Council and was one of the most consistent members of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge on whose roll his name occupies second place.  He was also a member of the IO Oddfellows Lodge and of the AOF Lodge.  Up to a few weeks of his death his marvellous energy never flagged.  He left Burra in November 1930 to reside at Croydon, but he maintained close contact with the town until his death.  He was a clever writer and many interesting articles from his pen have appeared in the columns of the Record.  We can truly say Mr Treloar was beloved and esteemed by every person in the town and district for his geniality and honourable manner in which he carried out his duties and his death, even at such a great age, is sincerely regretted by all with whom he came in contact.  He is survived by his wife, three sons and three daughters: Messrs Leonard, Clement & Roy Treloar and Olive Mrs Rossini, Mrs Hartwig & Miss Hilda Treloar.  His second son Percy was taken prisoner by the Germans during the war and never heard of.*  A daughter Ida also died some years ago [1900].  A long cortege followed the remains to the Kooringa Cemetery after the arrival of the East-West Express on Tuesday afternoon.  The service was conducted by Rev. Donald Redding and members of the three lodges provided the bearers.

[*Percy Treloar was reported k.i.a. 11 April 1917.  The Burra Record of 5 September 1923, p.3 reports that his remains have been found and interred, and the identity discs returned to his family.]
