Paxton Square

In the recent debate in Parliament on the Bill to vest ownership of Paxton Square in the Burra Burra DC from the Lewis Trust, Mr Bannon, Leader of the Opposition spoke of his interest in Burra.  He referred to the restoration of the old school buildings, the development of playing fields and of the Community Library, making it a Community Centre, which had become an example to the rest of the state.  He also commented favourably on the work of the National Trust in Burra.
