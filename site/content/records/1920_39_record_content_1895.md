Burra Institute Committee Meeting, 9 August.

Mr Crewes gave notice that he would move that the library not be opened in mornings from 11.30 a.m.-12.30 p.m.

Mr Lester has offered to hire the hall when renovated for the sole right to screen pictures at the Institute for five years every Saturday night for 50/- a night and £50 p.a. for use of the hall on 25 other nights – to apply from the completion of the alterations.  This offer was accepted.
