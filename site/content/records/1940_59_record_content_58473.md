Accidents.  Mrs Pitcher overturned the doctor’s car near Bute when a tyre blew out.  The Doctor got the use of another car and this was extensively damaged when another car ran into it while it was parked in front of his residence on Wednesday.  J. Scott apparently lost control of a utility he was driving, when it hit the culvert at the northern end of the Post Office, ran along the footpath to the Town Hall entrance, swerved left for a few yards and then veered right, striking the car parked in front of Dr Pitcher’s residence.
