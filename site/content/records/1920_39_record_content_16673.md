Salvation Army.  The girls from Fullarton Girls’ Home visited this week as part of their annual visit in connection with the Army’s social work.  The visit was a financial success.  On Friday evening they gave a concert in the Burra Institute, which was well filled and is reviewed at some length.  A collection and entrance money raised about £40.  A similar concert on Saturday afternoon at Hallett was very poorly attended, after which the group was given tea at the Mt Bryan Hall before repeating their performance there in the evening to a full house.  This raised £12.  They also assisted at the two Sunday services at the Burra Salvation Army Hall where they had been billeted for their stay.  Excellent arrangements for the visit had been made by Ensign & Mrs Peek who are in charge at Kooringa.
