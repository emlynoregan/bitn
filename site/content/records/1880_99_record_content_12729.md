Dr Stephens:

His views, he said, were similar to Dr Cockburn’s.

He was for the abolition of newspaper postage charges and for the Government ownership of wharves.

He favoured Government grants for those educated in non-state schools who passed secular examinations.  The education system was, he believed, too centralised.

In taxation he agreed with Dr Cockburn.  If the whole of property, both land and personal was taxed, leaving the first £500 free, the rate could be very low, but if land only was taxed then the rate would be higher.

On the land issue he believed in perpetual leases as the best form of land tenure with leases to be transferable as present titles were.

Duties on daily necessaries should be reduced.

He did not believe in assisted migration.

Mr Rounsevell then gave some of his 30 minutes to Dr Cockburn to expand his views.  This he did, talking of the need for education to be both compulsory and free.

He went on to consider land reform where he favoured allocation of land by lot as better than the auction system and for payment to be spread over 20 years.

He also expanded his comments in favour of free trade.
