Burra Sketch Book

It is expected this book will contain about 24 original sketches by Burra architect Maurice Perry, accompanied by explanatory text by local historian Ian Auhl.  Burra Branch of the National Trust is sponsoring the book and will receive Mr Auhl’s share of the profits.  Mr Perry will be paid a reasonable sum for the use of his sketches.

[The Burra Railway Station sketch is reproduced.]

Burra Railway Station: the first train steamed into the station at 12.45 p.m. on 27 August 1870. [actually 29 August]  It carried eight carriages and 400 passengers, without distinction of class or other distinction.  Fifteen minutes later the select train bearing H.E. Sir James Fergusson, Lady Fergusson and other dignitaries arrived, hauled by a decorated engine.  The engine had made the 100 mile journey in five hours.  Three thousand locals were on hand to greet it and the town was enjoying a public holiday.  Welcoming archways had been erected.  The station and goods shed had been festooned with greenery, which must have occasioned havac [sic] on the trees for 15 miles around.  Feasting went on all day.    The official luncheon with speeches in the goods shed lasted so long that the Vice-Regal party had only time for a quick tour round the town before departing at 4.50 p.m.  On the return there was a delay at Farrell Flat when the train ran over [and killed] a signalman sho was to have waved the red flag at the crossing.

At Burra the celebrations continued with a concert in the Lodge Room of the Burra Hotel, followed by a ball till dawn.  The twelve hotels [?] remained open all night.  Bonfires were lit up and down the street.

The transportation of ores had been a problem for SAMA since the mine opened in 1845, when the colony had no railways.  Bullock drays at first took the ore to Pt Adelaide via Kapunda, for shipment to Swansea in Wales.  Later, from 1847, the road to Pt Wakefield shortened the journey by 30 miles, but was so difficult through the hills that the company tried replacing the bullock drays with pack mules – hundreds being brought from Montevideo with Spanish-American muleteers.  Towns grew up along the route, but both the route and the towns were abandoned by the Smelting Company in 1857 when the railway reached Gawler.  When the railway arrived at Kapunda in August 1860 the old copper road to Kapunda was resumed.  The Burra Burra Mine was almost exhausted by the time the first rain reached Burra in 1870.
