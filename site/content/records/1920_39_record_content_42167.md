Obituary.  The late Mr W.J. [William James] McBride who died 3 June was the eldest son of the late R. James McBride.  He was born at Copperhouse in December 1855 [corrected in the next issue to 6 December 1856] and educated at C.R. White’s School.  [Sic: error for F.R. White.] His father then owned ‘The Gums’ where he worked with his father until he was over 30, along with his brother Robert.  When the station was cut up he bought the unresumed portion from his father and then sold it to Messrs Cockrum & Pearse.  He next took up a block east of Burra then known as North Dam (and now as Kia Ora in possession of his younger brother Mr Norman McBride).  Owing to a run of bad seasons he had to leave this station.  He then purchased Mt Horrocks north of Redruth, from his father.  Later when Outalpa Run near Olary was cut up he secured a portion called Bulloo Creek in partnership with his two youngest sons Lindsay & Robert (Robin) McBride.  Even late in life he would often leave the train at McDonnell’s Hill Siding when visiting Bullo Creek and walk the 4½ miles through sandy country to the station.  He was regarded as a sound judge of properties and of sheep and cattle.  His interests were confined to his properties and breeding fine Merino sheep.  His widow was formerly Miss Florence Stoddart of Woodside.  Four sons and two daughters survive: Cyril McBride (pastoralist of WA), Sidney McBride (Perth WA), Lindsay McBride (Bulloo Creek, Olary), Robert McBride (Mt Horrocks, Burra), Maisie Mrs Jude (wife of Dr Jude of Mildura) and Vera Mrs L. Hogan (Sydney).  Surviving brothers are: Robert M. McBride (Toorak), Thomas McBride (Redcliffe Station) & N.H. McBride (Glenelg).  Surviving sisters: Mrs J.C. Sandland (Kooringa), Mrs W.G. Hawkes (North Adelaide), Mrs E.J. Keynes (Seacliff), Mrs J. Boehme (Ucolta) & Mrs Evans (Adelaide).  The late Albert J. McBride who died in 1928 was a brother.
