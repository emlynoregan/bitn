Helen Richardson has retired after serving 20 years delivering mail on the Hallett Gap-Willalo mail run.  Helen started delivering mail in the late 1950s when the daily train would stop at the Ulooloo Rail Stop.  When this stop was closed in the mid 1960s Helen began working in the Hallett Post Office and Exchange.  Later she bought the building and the garage across the street, where she operated the service for at least 12 months.  At the time five or six girls worked the exchange and the mail centre was a busy hub of activity.  After that she spent her time on road deliveries of mail.  Norma Mayne of Hallett has taken over the road delivery contract from this week.
