Hanson CWA held eight meetings in the past year with an average attendance of six.  On 16 June 1977 the branch held its final meeting after 32 years of operation.  Permission was given by Headquarters to forego the usual one yearâ€™s recess before closing as members had indicated their desire to transfer to Burra CWA.
