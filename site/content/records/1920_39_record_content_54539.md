Waikerie Band visited with bandmaster T.H. Dunstan last weekend.  On Saturday evening the local band promoted a dance at the Aberdeen Lodge Hall with music provided by the Waikerie Dance Orchestra.

On Sunday visits were arranged in the morning to the old Mine, Mongolata, the Lagoon and Clare.  Both bands gathered at 2.30 p.m. at the Hospital for a few selections before marching to the Aberdeen Playground for a splendid program of music.  A visit was also made to Mr James Thomas, Patron of the Burra Band, at ‘Northfield’ Aberdeen.  He has been very ill for some weeks.  Another concert was given in Market Square after church on Sunday evening.  Here the Mayor gave the visitors a belated welcome and in the same breath farewelled them with best wishes and thanks.  Some band members stayed till Monday when a friendly cricket match was played in the morning.
