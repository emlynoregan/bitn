Obituary.  Mr Charles McDonald died a short time ago.  He was Hallett’s oldest pioneer.  His parents, who originally came from Scotland, were shepherding on Mt Bryan Station and when the land was distributed they received a portion known as McViddy’s Flat.  He was born there on 22 December 1864.  The family came to live in Hallett when he was a baby and he was a resident there for 80 years.  He was a good farmer and willing to help anyone at anytime.  He was a lifelong member of the Methodist Church.  His wife and two sons predeceased him, but he is survived by four sons and three daughters.  Charles McDonald, born 25 December 1864 at Mt Bryant [sic]; died 1 February 1947 Beulah Park, residence Hallett.]
