Lawn testified that the defendant had struck him a blow under the eye outside his shop on 7 November.  The attack was unprovoked and the injury required stitches.  His glasses were damaged and his pipe broken.  They had been on fairly good terms until Kuchenmeister went into butchering about two years ago.  Lawn said he did not resent Kuchenmeister going into business, though he did not like the opposition – he did not know if Kuchenmeister was underselling him – did not call him a dirty German or swear at him.

Fred Gebhardt Jun. (who was standing by the Burra Hotel at the time) said he saw Kuchenmeister strike Lawn several times and saw Ralph hill come out and stop him.  He did not hear Lawn speak and thought Kuchenmeister was doing the talking.

Ralph Hill’s evidence (he was employed by Lawn) matched Lawn’s.  He said he did not hear Lawn say anything to Kuchenmeister.

Gustav C. Kuchenmeister gave evidence that Lawn had sworn at him and called him a ‘_______ German bastard’. 

Alan Gebhardt, grocer’s assistant, gave evidence that he had heard Mr Lawn call Kuchenmeister a ‘German bastard’. 

The bench decided they believed the plaintiff’s evidence and witnesses and not the defendant’s and gave judgement for £30.
