Burra Burra Mines. Ed. An extraordinary meeting of shareholders is to be held soon to empower the directors to dispose of the whole property. It is feared that any buyer will be merely a speculator wanting to hold the property and plant until such a time as the copper price rises and enables them to sell to other speculators at a profit. This would not be very reassuring for the town as no jobs would be forthcoming in the short-term.

Some rumours however, suggest that there are potential buyers who would seek to prove the ground in all directions to determine future prospects and find the best portions to work. Indeed speculators seem unlikely to find it attractive in the present depressed state of the copper market as long as the directors are not prepared to sell at an unreasonably low price. The presence of a rich lode at present undiscovered is a much disputed question.
