Burra Yacht Club – Profit and Loss Statement for the 1985 Regatta

Creek Events Receipts	Expenditure

Booths	592.50	Royal Caledonian Pipe Band	610.00

Chocolate Wheel	305.81	Strawberry Competition	111.00

Site Fees	95.00	Tent Hire		309.50

996.31			1030.50

Profit on the Cabaret	613.31

As a loss was made on the creek events, it seems that in the light of considerable profits being made by some clubs, a higher site fee could be charged.
