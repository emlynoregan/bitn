Burra Town Council

At the last meeting 6 small boys and 3 fathers attended.  5 or 6 two-year-old pines had been uprooted.  The boys’ statements were so contradictory that the truth remained obscure and it ended with a lecture from then Town Clerk who emphasized that a conviction would result in a fine of up to £10.
