Burra District Fire-Adjourned Inquest.

On 11 February the inquest resumed with I.J. Warnes JP as coroner.

Patrick Carmody, farmer of Leighton, gave evidence that fires on his property in November 1918 he believed to be the result of S.A.P. poison use.  He had experimented and found that cloth through which S.A.P. liquid had been strained would spontaneously ignite and so would paper dipped in it.  A drop splashed on his trouser leg also ignited.  He had never seen poison pellets burn, but thought a rabbitâ€™s entrails might catch fire.  His experiments diluted the S.A.P. in 4 pints of water, where the instructions were for 12 pints.

Evidence was then taken from W.T. Rowe, Assistant Govt. Analyst.  He had tried experiments in 1911 to get S.A.P. to cause a fire.  He thought it was practically impossible for S.A.P. to cause a fire.  He thought it quite safe if properly mixed, but it might be concentrated in a cloth used as a strainer, which might then ignite.  The S.A.P. should not be strained before use.

Thomas Crompton, general manager for Gollen & Co., who are the agents for S.A.P., also gave evidence of its safety.

William Henry McWaters, Inspector for the Burra District Council gave evidence generally supporting S.A.P. being safe, though he though the empty tins might cause a fire.

The coroner summed up and the jury found no evidence to show how the fire started, but recommended the Government be asked to limit the use of S.A.P. to certain months of the year.
