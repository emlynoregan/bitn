Accident.  Harry Seaford, son of Mr H. Seaford of Kooringa, was injured when lighting an acetylene street lamp on Saturday.  The lamp did not immediately light and he shook the generator.  A flame ran down the pipe and an explosion followed which scorched his face and burnt off his eyelashes and eyebrows.  Considering the force of the explosion his escape without any permanent damage is fortunate and mysterious.
