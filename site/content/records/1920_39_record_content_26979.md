Obituary.  W.H. Halford died recently in WA.  He had been doing missionary work near Bordertown and the River Murray before being allotted a block east of Burra.  When he later sold the property he was one of the first to take cattle from SA overland to northwest WA.  He got out of cattle country there and into sheep and the family finally prospered.
