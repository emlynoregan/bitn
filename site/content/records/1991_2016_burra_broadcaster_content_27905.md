Other sites in the area are also getting some attention.  Mt Bryan East School will be inspected and shelters along the White Hill Road and Caroona Creek will be improved.  The trail comes from Willalo through Hallett to the summit of Mt Bryan and then to the Mt Bryan East School to Tooralie Gorge and south to Caroona  Creek before turning back through the hills along White Hill Road.
