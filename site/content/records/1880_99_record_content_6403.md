Letter from ‘Rubbish’ who says he has received a handbill advising that from1 March a magazine called the Burra Tandem will appear.  The manager/editor is an ‘aristocratic young gentleman, an ex-solicitor, shepherd etc.’

As a professional he commands public interest re advertisements and subscriptions, but I think he is scarcely strong enough to form the sole attraction for such a large literary project and I should think the gentleman’s printers would soon find themselves in financial difficulties.  We await the first issue.
