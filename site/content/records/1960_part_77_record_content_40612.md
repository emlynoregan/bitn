Miss Industry Quest Ball was held at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night and grossed $250.  The profits will help construction of a new building at the Home for Incurables, so easing the waiting list.  The Ball aided local entrant in the Quest, Miss Kathryn White and was attended by the 1967 winner, Raelene Hele.
