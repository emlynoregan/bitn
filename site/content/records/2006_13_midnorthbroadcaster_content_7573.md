Burra Community Service will receive a boost.  [In a flood of acronyms] it was announced by Country Health SA (CHSA) and Yorke and Lower North Health Service (YLNHS) that the town had become a multi-purpose service (MPS).  This means that it will receive direct federal funding with greater flexibility on how it can be spent.  After consultation with the community this could mean money spent on in-home respite, increased hours for the Leisure Activity Group, programs for young people and better access to early childhood services.  There will be no change to the provision of acute services provided at Burra.
