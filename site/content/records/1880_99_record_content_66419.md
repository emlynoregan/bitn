James Tiver JP celebrated his 70th birthday at the Redruth Wesleyan Chapel last Sunday with his surviving children: five sons and five daughters.  The group included 27 bearing the name Tiver.  Rev. W.H. Rofe referred to the gathering and that all the children had passed through the Sunday school and all but one had been married there.  Mr Tiver was Senior Superintendent of the Sunday school and was also many years ago a founder and trustee of the building.  He was born in Bristol and migrated to SA in 1855.  He worked as a mason and builder in Adelaide and then as a mason at the Burra Smelting Works furnaces, becoming a master builder in company with Mr Aaron Cole, now of Port Lincoln.  He had built the original part of the Burra Institute and the Wallaroo Smelting Works (with Messrs Bower and Pulsford), the Redruth Bridge, the stationmasters’ residences between Tarlee and Farrell’s Flat, the Burra Station Yard and original station and many houses in the district.  He built his present commodious shop in Aberdeen in 1870.  About 40 years ago he commenced sheep farming with Mr Cole, but dissolved the partnership and opened a store in Hallett and struggled with drought as a grazier.  One member of the family travelled from WA, two from Broken Hill and one each from Oodla Wirra, Pat’s Well (Yunta), and Macclesfield.  In the afternoon eight of the grandchildren were christened by Rev. W.H. Rofe.
