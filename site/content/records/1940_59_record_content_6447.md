Burra Institute

It appears that when the Institute’s Committee refused to carry on and when its trustees resigned en bloc on 30 June, the Mayor approached the State Bank asking if it would be prepared to accept £2,500 for the Institute.  The bank refused.  The bank evidently considered the difficulties being experienced were temporary, due to wartime circumstances.  The Mayor thought that most people believed the Corporation should take over the Institute.  The present liability on the building is £3,100.  The matter will be discussed at the next Council meeting.
