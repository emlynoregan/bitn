Burra Tourist Office AGM was very poorly attended.  Chairman Mr Frank Ford reported on a very successful and prosperous year.  Volunteers have enabled the office to operate from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.  During the year reprints were arranged for the books:

Burra and District a Pictorial Memoir

Glimpses of the Past

The Burra Colour Brochure

Local and Breaker Morant pamphlets

With the aid of a subsidy it was possible to produce 2,500 Burra Resource Packs for schools.

For the next year to be a success ongoing local support and volunteers will be necessary.

The committee now comprises: Council representative, Cr F.R. Ford (Chairman); Ex-officio Representatives, Council Chairman Cr R.B. Jennison and Mr J.P. Brak (Secretary-Treasurer); Public Representatives, Mr D. Woolley, Mrs L. Neill and Mrs J. O’Connor.
