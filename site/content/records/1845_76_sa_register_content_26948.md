Death from alcoholic poisoning.

[On page 5 there is an editorial column expressing horror and indignation at the death of Robert Burvill at Manoora.  He was drinking there with friends and consumed virtually an entire bottle of gin after other drinks and died in the street.  The friends propped him up against the door of the hotel and left him, uncertain whether he was dead or alive.  The editor expresses his disgust at their behaviour and that of the landlord who supplied the liquor that killed him.  Page 7 reports the inquest.  The jury found: ‘That the deceased Robert Burvill came to his death from the effects of alcoholic poisoning, which brought on apoplexy.  The Jury cannot help expressing their deep disgust at the treatment deceased received at the hands of his companions, Fred. J. James and Alf. Wm. Steer, in leaving him dead or alive exposed to the inclemency of the weather of Saturday night.’]

[SA Deaths CD shows the registration of death as Robert Burrill died 13 December 1875 at Manoora, residence near Manoora aged 26.]

[A letter to the editor on 21 from John Charles seeks to clear him of any involvement in the events of the 13 December.   He says he left the bar at 10.45 p.m. and had nothing to do with the drink consumed after that.  Those in the bar were sober when he left.  He also defends the licensee Mr Thomas Edwards.

A letter on 22 December from Thomas Edwards seeks to defend him from any improper behaviour.  He says the evidence at the inquest proved the deceased was sober when he left the bar and he was not responsible for what happened thereafter.  Also, had he been informed that the deceased had been left on his doorstep he would have got up and seen to him, even though he was suffering from asthma and it would have been at some danger to his own health.]
