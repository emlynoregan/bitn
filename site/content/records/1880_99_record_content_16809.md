Burra Town Council, 2 March.

The Mayor said no loan vote could be carried unless a special meeting had been called, but a discussion of finances would be helpful.

Cr West sought to reduce debt, but also to provide work, which would be much needed in the coming winter.  He also thought they should get the Government subsidy while it was still available.  Using the money they had and leaving the overdraft would involve paying 10% interest on it.  If they borrowed at 6% on the new loan they could pay off the overdraft and pay only 6% on the new debt.  He suggested they take out a loan for £500 to £600.

Cr Ridgway was opposed to borrowing money and said the press had said a good deal that should not have been said.  He would prefer not to have borrowed at all.  Now it took them £250 to pay bonds and interest each year and this was £250 that could not be used to attract subsidy and so meant a loss of £500.

[He then went on to the points raised at the end of the editorial that the editor had challenged.]

He believed the Council was more in debt than was legally allowed.

Crs Tiver and Symons spoke against borrowing.

The Mayor was also of the view that ratepayers had had enough of loans, especially as the Recreation Ground had turned out to be a bad investment.

He held that £275 of the £449-14-4 debt was incurred by the Recreation Ground in bonds and interest with £300 more due in bonds and interest over this and the next two years.

Cr West was not swayed by the Mayor’s argument and pressed for a ratepayers’ meeting.
