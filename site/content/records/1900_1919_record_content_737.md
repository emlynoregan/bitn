The Last Bible Christian Picnic went to Princess Royal last Wednesday, ending a tradition of about thirty years of similar outings.  Mr John Snell has been Sunday School Superintendent for at least 33 years and has been connected with the Bible Christian Church for 47 years.  Only Mr & Mrs William Davey have been members in Burra as long as Mr Snell.  There was a great spread of poultry, hams, tongues, beef, pelony [sic], etc. with an array of tarts and cakes.  Games followed, including drop handkerchief and twos-and-threes.  Swings were in use and a game of cricket was played.  Over 100 people attended.  Thanks to Mr Dawes, the manager of the estate.
