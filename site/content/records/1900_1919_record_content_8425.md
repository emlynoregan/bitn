Shooting Accident.  On Saturday Frank Shortridge and Alfred Hunt, aged 19, son of A.J. Hunt, went shooting rabbits.  On the way home Hunt was about five yards in front when Shortridge changed hands carrying the rabbits and in the process a rabbit’s foot discharged his Winchester.  The bullet entered Hunt’s side just above the hip and passed through.  They were faced with a three mile walk home, but at Ford’s old slaughterhouse on the Baldina Road they were picked up by Mr Truscott.  The lad is making favourable progress after a miraculous escape.
