Burra Conservation Study

In both parts of the study the town has been divided into precincts.

The names of the precincts are not intended to be divisive, merely convenient.

They do indicate a belief that such precincts have a distinctive character, whether that be architectural, natural, industrial or commercial.  It has developed by historical circumstance.

Burra is a collection of originally separate townships, each with its own flavour and the mixture of these ‘flavours’ makes up the character of present day Burra.

A strong architectural link between the various precincts is the presence throughout of a large number of buildings erected in local stone.  The unifying effect of this stone in public buildings, walls, kerbing, homes, mine structures and ruins cannot be over estimated.  Structures unsympathetic to this characteristic of Burra or overpowering to such streetscapes or buildings should be discouraged.
