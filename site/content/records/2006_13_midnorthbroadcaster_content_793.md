Goyder Council

Council voted not to proceed with the Market Square and Best Place redevelopment plan, as a consequence of the recent public meeting on the matter and resolved to negotiate an end to the consultancy contract with KBR on the best possible terms and also to return to Planning SA any unspent contribution it had made to the project.

Burra Christmas Fair Committee was granted $1,250 for Christmas decorations.

Council will investigate the requirements and costs required to make SBS television available in Burra and is applying for funding from SBS and to Broadcasters Australia for the use of its leased site.
