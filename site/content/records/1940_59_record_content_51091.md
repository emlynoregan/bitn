Paxton Square was inspected last week by the Local Health Inspector, E.R. Davey.  Two years ago it was found there was much room for improvement.  Now there has been some progress, but plenty of room for improvement remains.  The call two years ago was for new ceilings, for water to be connected and for a twentieth century sewage disposal system to be installed.  Some new ceilings have gone in, water has been connected and some cement floors added.  Sanitary conditions remain poor and in places drainage is bad.  Some residents have installed electric light at their own expense.  One or two residents continue to live in squalor.  Rents in the Square remain low, at 1/- per room per week, and we can hardly expect the Trustee to provide more modern conditions.  Perhaps it would be possible to raise rents to enable improvements.  The Inspector will report to the next meeting of Council.
