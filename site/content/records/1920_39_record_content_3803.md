Booborowie Memorial Hall.  On 29 March at Booborowie I.J. Warnes JP Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC laid the foundation stone of the Booborowie Memorial Hall.  It is in memory of those volunteers from that centre who laid down their lives in the Great War.  The hall will be 80’ x 40’.  He commented in passing that Dr Steele and the photographer Mr Dix ‘were the only ones present from Burra, though when there was anything in the Burra, Booborowie was always well represented.’  He made reference in his speech to the need for a hall in keeping people in the district and on his recent visit to the battlefields and cemeteries of the Western Front.  There was a speech by Dr D.M. Steele and Mr Fuller the architect also spoke briefly.
