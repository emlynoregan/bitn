Willalo School has no new enrolments this year and numbers have fallen from 14 last year to an initial 10 this year.  Head Teacher is Mr Brian brooks, previously at Wandearah North near Port Pirie.  Although a new portable building was to be ready for the opening, as yet no start has been made and the school continues as usual in the Hall.
