BCS.  Community School Week aims to produce a booklet about Burra and a record and booklet of some of the songs associated with Burra’s history.  The school needs some interesting old photos and information about the songs sung here in the past.  There is a committee compiling information for a centenary history of the school and they would like any photos or other relevant information.
