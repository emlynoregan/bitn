Burra High School held its third Valedictory Service very successfully.  It took place in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  There was also a Valedictory Smorgasbord Tea.  The church was filled to capacity.  Rev. Dr M. McArthur, Associate Director of the Department of Christian Education of the Methodist Church, was a very capable preacher for the occasion.  The High School Choir made a worthwhile contribution led by Mr Peter Morris.
