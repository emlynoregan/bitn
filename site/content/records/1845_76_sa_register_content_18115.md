Kooringa News, 29 December

Monday 26 December was a holiday and the grand picnic that was planned took place.  The weather was ideal.  The spot chosen was a paddock of Mr Reedâ€™s five or six miles from Kooringa on the Adelaide Road.  It was free from dust and the trees afforded shelter.  Commodious tents had been erected by the committee and other arrangements reflected credit on that body.  In all it was a great success and every conveyance in the town was pressed into service.  At one time there must have been fully 200 horses in the paddock and over 100 vehicles.  There were over 1,000 people on the ground and they enjoyed themselves amazingly.  There were tents for refreshments, though no intoxicating liquor was allowed on the ground for sale.  Mrs Reed superintended the tea and coffee department, which was in great demand.  Mr F. Gebhardt had a tent supplying the solids and fruit.  Games and amusements were organised including cricket, quoits, football, foot races, jumping in sacks, wheelbarrow races and hunting a pig.  An efficient band was in attendance all day.  Dancing was popular and kiss-in-the-ring by juveniles.  There was also a rifle match.  Everything went off without an accident or the hint of a quarrel.
