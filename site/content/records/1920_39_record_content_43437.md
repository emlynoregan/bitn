Mongolata Goldfield

Commonwealth Employment Council has allocated £500 towards the erection of the Mongolata Battery.

Byles’ Mongolata Gold Mining Co.  The shaft is now at 98ft and timbered as a two-compartment shaft to 77ft with ladders in the second compartment.  Plats are cut at 52ft & 92ft and the 52ft plat is timbered.  The top tunnel from the surface has been re-timbered and secured where the shaft broke through 20ft from the surface.  At the 52ft level drives have been cleared out and a chamber cut for sinking a winze to the tunnel.  Rails are laid in the crosscut and track installed for handling ore to the shaft.  The tunnel at the bottom of the hill to cut the shaft at 92ft advanced to 341ft and the mouth has been timbered.  Rails laid in it and a stone drain of 70ft to carry flood waters away.  Blacksmith’s shop constructed and an explosives magazine is near the mouth of the main tunnel.  The compressor has been overhauled.  High values have been disclosed in the eastern drive and the south 52ft drive.

Block 8.  South drive at the bottom of the top shaft has reached 28ft and the east crosscut is at 18ft.

Establishment of the battery has commenced with outbuildings being erected.

A two-roomed house is being built by Mr Pearce of Aberdeen for the manager of Byles Gold Mining Co. to be completed in 8-9 days.

A general improvement on the field is expected when the battery gets going.
