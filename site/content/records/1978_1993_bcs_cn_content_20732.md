Burra Day Care is moving from the Hospital into the community.  The cost of relocation is substantial and donations are sought to supplement a proposed Federal Government grant.  Support has been very good so far:

Mrs E.V. Tiver	$500

Burra Picnic Race Club Committee	$5,900

Burra Council	Minimum of $20,000

Burra Hospital	Minimum of $20,000

Fundraising Committee	$5,000

The Lions Club will donate funds and labour, while others have offered labour.
