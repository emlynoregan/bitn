Mr Keutchenmeister’s [sic] Adventure.  His trap and horse were found at Mr Pryor’s on Sunday 9 February.  On Tuesday the police were called in and a blacktracker came from Gladstone on Wednesday.  Keutchenmeister seems to have left his trap after travelling 7 or 8 miles from Burra and to have then made for the ranges.  A man, believed to be him, was seen to pass the eastern side of Princess Royal head station.  He avoided all houses till arriving at Mrs Speckman’s on Monday c. 11 o’clock.  He asked the way to Farrell’s Flat railway station.  She sent him to Jeffrey’s.  There, in conversation with one of the sons, he said he lived at Baldina near Pryor’s and was in a hurry to catch a train at Farrell’s Flat.  Jeffrey’s brother identified the man as Keutchenmeister.  The blacktracker traced him across the ranges and along the Black Springs Road, headed for Farrell’s Flat.  No reasons for his actions have been given, but it would appear that being in straightened circumstances he was fleeing poverty at home.  On Saturday night police received news that he had been at Snowtown, but after that nothing is known.
