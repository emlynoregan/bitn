W.J. Richards had a good time at Morgan after his trip there by motor.  His mare Sunbeam won the Trials and was subsequently sold.  The trip itself was rough and on his return journey he left Morgan at 1 p.m. on 28 May and arrived at ‘The Gums’ for lunch before continuing through the Black Hills to World’s End, arriving there at 3.30 p.m. and staying overnight before coming home in the following morning.  [Nothing here makes it absolutely clear whether ‘motor’ meant a car or motor cycle.  He was an agent for the latter.]
