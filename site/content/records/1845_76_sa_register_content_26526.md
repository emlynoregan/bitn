  Mt Bryan Road.  On 10 August the Register received a letter from ‘Settler’
  
  The writer drew attention to the recent correspondence re the Mt Bryan Road.
  
  As this road is the only route for some 12,000 bales of wool from the interior to the terminus of the Northern Railway a number of settlers guaranteed subscriptions of £200 and an arrangement was made with the Government through the Commissioner of Public works to make a track passable for drays over this piece of road and a start has been made.  An offer from a neighbouring settler to make the road passable for £400 was rejected by the Government and it was supposed they would accomplish the work themselves.  Late last night it was with surprise that a telegram announced that unless a further £100 was guaranteed, the work would stop.  It will be recalled that after a deputation about 12 months ago, it was promised that this piece of road would be repaired.  Now one of the main arteries of the colony is to be left a quagmire unless the settlers subscribe a further £100.
  
  The writer continues to criticise the Government in harsh terms and rather than print this from an anonymous source, the paper asked the Government for its side of the story.
  
  [While giving further detail the Government essentially confirmed that it entered into the above arrangement, and that when Mr Morris, the Superintending Surveyor for the District assessed the cost of repairs at £600, the Government was not prepared to spend more than was matched by the settlers, hence the telegram asking for a guarantee of a further £100.  Since then the Government has been asked for £200 provisionally upon the settlers themselves doing the work for £400.  To this proposal the Government has agreed, though the Government is still prepared to spend £300 if the settlers will match that sum.]
