‘Bushman’ writes 11 December:

I am surprised that ‘C.W.D.’ cannot get shepherds for 18/- a week plus board and lodging and says 20/- is being demanded.

Many have been thrown out of work by the drought in the north.  And in this locality at least shepherds can easily be obtained for 15/- a week, their rations being cooked for them.

Perhaps C.W.D. is referring not to shepherds, but to ‘hutters’.  A hutter takes charge of a flock of sheep day and night, living by himself, cooking for himself and in fact existing like a hermit, seldom seeing any of his race or colour.  His hut will be basic and every item of his rations must be paid for and frequently at high prices.  ‘Luxuries’ like butter, milk or vegetables are usually unobtainable.  It is small wonder such men would expect 20/- a week.  The difference between 18/- and 20/- a week may not be significant to C.W.D., but is not a trifle to the poor working man.  Masters who treat their ‘hands’ as if they belonged to the same great human family as themselves rarely have difficulty in procuring servants.
