Rain.  A severe thunderstorm on Tuesday last week persisted for about 24 hours and deposited 116 points.  Rain was lighter to the west, but there were some splendid falls out east where no serviceable rain has fallen since last June.  Falls were quite variable, but ranged from about 60 points at Woolgangi to 162 at Redcliffe.  Monday this week saw further falls, which continue as we go to press with falls of over 50 points being common.
