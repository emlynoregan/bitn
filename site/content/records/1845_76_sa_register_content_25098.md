The Wheat Glut: A Deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works.

[This is a long report.  There were specific proposals about speeding up the sorting of loads for particular ships and the earlier release of trucks for return to the country.

E.W. Pitts spoke (as an agent) for C.B. Fisher of Farrell’s Flat.  Wheat was lying exposed to the weather and sales could not be arranged because delivery could not be assured.

Much of the trouble seemed to be at the port.

The Commissioner pointed out that the railways contracted to deliver the grain to the port.  They shunted it to the ship, but that was for the convenience of agents; it was not part of their actual contract.

The Engineer-in Chief pointed out that to increase the traffic by 300-440 tons per day would require more engines and more engine-drivers.  They were presently running trains up to 11.45 p.m. and the locomotives had to be cleaned and repaired.  Loading at the port was slow.  The wheat had to be sampled by a man with a long tube and rejected wheat had to be dealt with.  Better labelling of the wheat and more careful loading with a view to easier shunting operations and port handling procedures, would be of some help.]
