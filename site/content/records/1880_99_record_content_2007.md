Entertainment.  The Redruth Band of Hope 2nd entertainment attracted 350 people on Friday and the collection raised £5, which was considered inadequate for the number of people present, and the organisers will consider whether a charge would be a better option in the future.  [The £5 works out to just under 3½d per person.]
