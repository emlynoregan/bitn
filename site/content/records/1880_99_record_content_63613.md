J.F. Warnes of Koomooloo has discovered good stone of some value some 8-9 miles from Braemar.  The reef is 12’ wide and a couple of chains long.  It was first noticed in 1889, but no real work done on it.  It is now to be tested.  [The item doesn’t say tested for what, but presumably gold, or perhaps silver?]
