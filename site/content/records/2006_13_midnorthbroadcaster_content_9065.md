Primary School Students from Burra, Robertstown and Farrell Flat visited Red Banks Conservation Park for Environment and Heritage Conservation Day.  With the assistance of presenters Neil Nicholson, Celie Manning, Ruth Norris, Wally Klau and Aaron Fenner they were introduced to the topics of mega fauna, vegetation, park management and birds and reptiles.  They were asked to report back on how to best manage these issues.  Some well thought out strategies suggested they had understood the problems and were interested in the topics.
