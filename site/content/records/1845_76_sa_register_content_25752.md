Mt Bryan East.  4 August.  The season has been wet, but cold and crop growth has stalled until temperatures rise.  The roads are in a dreadful state and yet some settlers still oppose a District Council.  Most would welcome one.  As the country is fenced travellers are increasingly confined to the appalling roads.
