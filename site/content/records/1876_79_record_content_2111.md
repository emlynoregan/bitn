Hallett railway: Aberdeen Mill Underpass. 20 people attended a meeting at the Institute to discuss the motion `That an under crossing through the railway embankment between the Bon Accord Hotel and Messrs J. & E. Butterworth's mill is absolutely necessary.'

The problems with a level crossing were thought great, but the site of the one proposed was on a steep incline and was made worse because the traffic here would be mainly heavy vehicles from the goods station and in addition to the slope there was a sharp turn. They wanted an underpass like the one at Bowden. Deputation was chosen to see the Commissioner of Public Works.
