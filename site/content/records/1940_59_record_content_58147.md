Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its 1st AGM on 3 March in the Assembly Hall.  The year had been very successful financially and in 1952 they had provided the school with chalkboards, an electric iron, library books, kettle drum, stock for the medicine chest and timber for easels.  With the High School they had purchased a piano and cover for the Assembly Hall and equipment for woodwork.  Wire netting had been bought for the boys’ garden and prizes for the top boy and girl in Grade VII.  They had held a Christmas party for the children.  It was decided to buy a new broadcast receiver this year, at a cost of £300; to be aided by a street stall on 13 March.  Elected were: President, Mrs T. Williams; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Stockman & Lott; Secretary, Mrs Wohlers and Treasurer, Mrs H. Binks-Williams.
