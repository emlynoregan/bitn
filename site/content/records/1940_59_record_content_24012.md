Letter.  M.P. Cowle, H. Hobbs, M. Cox and A.S. Barrett write as the Burra Ministers’ Fraternal, concerning proposed legislation on betting shops now before the House of Assembly.  They believe betting shops to be a pernicious system, highly detrimental to the development of young people and a menace to the economic stability of the community.  The system is also detrimental to the team spirit in all competitive sporting activities. They give their support to the Burra Town Council and the Burra Burra District Council who think as they do.  In withholding their support for a betting shop in the town they believe the Councils will truly represent the majority of opinion in the town and district.
