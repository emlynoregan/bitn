Burra Burra DC

The Council and the Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Organisation are both concerned about increasing fire danger and have been discussing the problems.  Council reminds landowners that using farm-type slashers has been known to start fires in the district and so care is urged with their use.  They must not be used on a fire ban day.  Incinerators must be four metres clear of flammable material and should be constructed not to emit sparks.

A new pound for straying livestock has been built opposite the sale yards at Burra North.  The District Clerk is the pound-keeper.

Football

At the last meeting of the Mid North Football League the President Mr Stan Noske was granted Life Membership.  The clubs reported on their individual consideration of the future.

Riverton said it had decided to seek affiliation with Barossa & Light and if not accepted there it would seek to join the North Eastern League.

Robertstown wished to stay with the Mid North League.

Mintaro-Manoora had not changed its decision to seek affiliation with the North Eastern League.

Saddleworth-Marrabel United wished to remain with the Mid North League.

Auburn would not field any teams in the Mid North League for 1976.

The President then read out conditions governing the disbandment of the League in its constitution.  An application for withdrawal must be in the hands of the Secretary by 24 December 1975.  The AGM will be called for 30 January 1976.  If the League is dissolved a wind-up dinner will be held.
