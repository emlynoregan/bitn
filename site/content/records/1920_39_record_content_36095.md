Fire.  At 3.40 a.m. on Wednesday Master Fred Gregor who lives directly opposite raised the alarm of fire at Wright’s Motors.  His parents had been awakened by a crackling noise and smashing glass.  The brigade responded promptly and the fire was confined to the workshop and the showroom and office were saved.  Fireman Spencer was obliged to retreat due to fumes when he tried to approach the fire and fireman H. Hill crawled in on his stomach to play the hose on the flames until he also was exhausted by the fumes.  Foreman Lee and fireman Byrne also did their best, but a sheet of iron had to be taken off the roof and even then they couldn’t succeed until a second sheet was removed to give access to the spare parts, tyres, and oils section.  One car was completely destroyed and three others badly damaged, including a new Chevrolet sedan.  One of the damaged cars belonged to the Department of Agriculture and another to Harold F. Wright, brother of the owner of the garage.

A car belonging to W.J. Sullivan hairdresser was saved.  Total estimated damage is £2,000.

Mr H. Wright and a friend and Mr W.H. Spier had returned to the garage at 1.30 a.m. after a kangaroo hunt and the single seater car they used appears to have been the seat of the fire, probably from a short circuit.  This car was by far the most badly burnt with almost nothing left and the glass windscreen melted.  Mr Davey JP got the report from M-C Provis and deemed an inquest unnecessary.  After the fire Sid Kuchenmeister thought it too late to go home and went straight to his father’s butcher shop in Market Square to find it full of smoke.  The engine of the Frigidaire had been running all night on two points instead of three and had he not been early at the shop another fire would have been certain.
