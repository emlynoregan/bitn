Obituary.  Mrs Susan Dunstan has died at Mt Bryan East, aged 75 and a colonist of over 53 years.  She was the widow of the late Capt. John Dunstan and was born in Cornwall and came to SA 4 August 1853 with two children, John & Richard William.  Mr Dunstan found work in the Burra Mines and with two others found the great malachite lode, which returned Â£612 per man for 8 weeks.  Later with her husband she went to live at Bundaleer and later still on an exploring trip to the far north.  Capt. Dunstan was near Cooper Creek where Bourke and Wills died.  They then went into business for several years and later farmed near Mt Bryan and Mt Bryan East, living in the latter place about 28 years.  They are now both buried at Hallett.  Mrs Dunstan leaves four sons and two daughters: John (Sydney), Richard William and Benjamin H.K. (Mt Bryan East), William (Broken Hill), Mrs S.W. Cherry (Broken Hill), Mrs J.A. Caldicott (Mt Bryan), 20 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

[Born Susan Sophia Williams April 1831: died 21 January 1907 Mt Bryan East.]
