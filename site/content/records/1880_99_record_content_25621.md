Salvation Army.  At 11.30 soldiers and officers met at the Barracks and marched to the railway station to welcome S.O. Paert & Lieut. Gough, who arrived by train.  At 3.00 there was an open-air meeting at the town pump in Market Square, followed by tea at the Barracks provided by Mr Parks.  Then there was a torchlight procession of nearly 50 officers and soldiers in the main street and an open-air meeting attended by hundreds of people.  Good order prevailed.  Then they marched back to the Barracks in Kingston St to the Jubilee Meeting, which was led by S.O. Paert.  (Lieut. Gough is a coloured man.)  The meeting was followed by supper and the crowd dispersed about 11 p.m.
