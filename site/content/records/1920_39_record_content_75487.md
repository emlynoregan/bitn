Manhunt ‘Out East’: the outcome

There is an extended report of the court case of the woman involved, which takes some 2½ columns.

Alice Ella Dittmer was charged with larceny of certain articles from the home of Mrs F.M. Kellock of Woolamba Station.  Most of the story has already been told.  Additional material:

Dittmer contended she stayed outside when Cooke re-entered the house and stole the goods.  There is a good deal of technical legal argument over the nature of her detention and the admissibility of statements etc.

Dittmer said Cooke was known to her as Alwyn Charles Williams and she had known him for two months and they were to be married on 24 June.  When they left Adelaide she had believed the car belonged to him.  He said they were test driving the car to Clare.  Twenty miles from Clare Cooke got six gallons of petrol by saying he was a doctor going to a dangerous case at Clare.  They then went to Collinsville near Mt Bryan.  At 11 a.m. on the 6th they stopped at the house of Mr L. Collins and were asked to stay for lunch.  She heard then on the wireless that the car Cooke had was stolen.  She wanted to go back to Adelaide, but Cooke said she had no hope of ever going back to Adelaide now.  They drove through scrub on the 7th; she didn’t know where.  On the 8th they got bogged and Cooke walked 10 miles and returned with Mr Wilson who got them out of the bog.  They then got to the property of Fred Collins.  No one was home and Cooke stole c. 4 gallons of petrol, but was then interrupted when he thought a car was coming.  On the same day he cut the phone wires.  That night they drove to the weir and got bogged again and it took three hours the next day to dig it out.  Cooke then got lost looking for the Lilydale Road.  On the 10th Cooke got to Horace Collins’s place and stole about 2 gallons of petrol.  They had breakfast at another property and got a map to Fred Collins’s property.  After the men there left to do fencing Cook returned and stole the items while Dittmer waited outside.  He then went to Braemar and cut the phone line again.  Cooke then went towards Faraway Hill and stole some more petrol when no one was home.  Then on the road back to Burra Dittmer said she tried to get away , but was pushed into the car and told she would never get away alive as she knew too much.  Cooke was cutting fences – at least 30 of them and cut phone lines a number of times.  On the 11th he heard a whistle and saw another car.  He drove along a fence and over a big pipe and into a ditch.  Dittmer hurt her back there.  Cooke got the car out of the ditch and said he was going to Bendigo Station to change cars.  While he was checking a tyre in a lucerne patch Dittmer got out and hid among the lucerne.  Eventually he drove off.  She spent the night unable to light a fire and in the morning followed a track to a fence then along a road and was picked up by a lorry and taken to Salt Bush Station and the police, who took her first to Braemar and then to Burra.

Heard before Justice Jennison JP on 29 June at Burra, who dismissed the case.
