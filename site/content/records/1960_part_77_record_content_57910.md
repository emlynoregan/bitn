Burra Hospital.  The annual meeting was held on Thursday night.

Chairman Mr R.K. Pearse said the board was preparing for a major building program including a new maternity wing, private, share, and children’s rooms as well as a kitchen and toilet block on the same level as the present building.  The Barker Cottage Home Project will be carried out at the same time.  He reported a surplus of $10,424, a credit balance in all accounts of $22,807 and investments of $25,000.  The overdraft had been liquidated.  The daily patient number averaged 20.3 – the highest for 20 years and 52 babies had been born.  This resulted in a better financial position.  The Chief Secretary has advised that a subsidy is available for the building project.  The cropping program had yielded $191.

The Auxiliary again did fine work on maintaining the linen and supplying jams and preserves.  The fund-raising committee donated $1,027 this year.  From 27 July the hospital kitchen had supplied food for Meals on Wheels.  Matron Fyfe’s excellent service had continued, helped by Sisters Moller, Byles, Brown and Ward and by part-time Sisters Carmody and Jones, assisted by a full compliment of nurses.
