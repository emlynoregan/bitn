Prospects for SA Farmers

The approaching ploughing season poses a number of questions.  Many of the usual labourers in agriculture have now left the colony to become consumers rather than producers.  There is to be an expected influx of migrants to the goldfields and an increased demand for flour.  Another complication is that once attracted to the speculative occupation of digging for gold many seem reluctant to settle back into their accustomed practices of labour.  Nevertheless the producers of grain in this colony can confidently expect to receive a good price for their produce in the coming years.  Their principal apprehension is the possibility of imported flour from the US and South America.  We think this fear is unfounded.  It is unlikely to seem profitable to the North American supplier to send flour to Australia at prices that would injure local producers.  The South American product is of inferior quality so that SA flour would always command a premium price.  Competition from Van Diemen’s Land will be reduced due to their loss of labour to the goldfields.
