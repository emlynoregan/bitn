Mr William Dare at Piltimitiappa had at the last lambing a lamb with three ears, eight legs, two loins and two tails.  It was born alive, but starved to death when the ewe would have nothing to do with it.  Mr Dare extracted the entrails and pickled it in brine for a month and then sent it to George Bennett of the Aberdeen Hotel.  He in turn got Mr William West of Redruth to stuff it and surprisingly the result is an interesting curiosity and not unpleasing to the eye.
