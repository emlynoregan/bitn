Cricket

Burra Cricket Club has managed to get through to its fourth successive grand final in the Belalie-Mokota Cricket Association.  On Tuesday the Assoc. management had awarded the second semi-final to Belalie-Mannanarie after ruling that Burra had fielded one unqualified player in the second semi-final.  A player needed to have played three games to qualify for inclusion.  Burra had assumed that his inclusion in a game called off on account of heat would count as a game, in the same way that one that is washed out would count.  The Assoc. ruled him ineligible.  Burra then had to play in the preliminary final to win a place in the grand final and also forfeit the home ground advantage.  On Saturday Burra 3 for 122 defeated Bundaleer 116 and now move on to the grand final, which will be played 27 March at Victoria Park, Jamestown.
