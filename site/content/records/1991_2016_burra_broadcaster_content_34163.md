Jubilee Fountain.  Burra’s old drinking fountain adjacent to the motel has been repaired and protected with a new fence.  Some time ago the top piece was broken off.  Damien Quinn did the precise welding needed to repair it and Jamie Pollard painted it and erected the fence.  A small plate on it indicates it was part of a Children’s Centenary Jubilee.  It is thought to be Victorian in design.  [Photo]

[Note.  To Commemorate Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee in 1887 there was a major exhibition in Adelaide.  A public subscription was raised in Burra for a special train to take 455 children and 175 adults from Burra to the exhibition, which was held in grounds that are now part of the University of Adelaide.  The train was reported to be the first passenger train to pass through the new tunnel under King William Street on the new spur line to the exhibition grounds.  After the event the committee found they had an excess of £31-12-0 from the subscriptions and it was decided that half of that should be spent on a drinking fountain to be placed in Jubilee Avenue – a double row of trees that had just then been planted along the eastern side of the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen as an unemployment relief project.  See Burra Record, 18 Oct. 1887, page 2; 25 Oct. 1887, page 2; 8 Nov. 1887, page 3; 14 February 1888, page 2; 20 April 1888, page 2; 11 September 1888, page 2; 18 September 1888, page 2 and 22 Mar. 1889, page 2.]
