Burra Hospital was visited by an accreditation survey team last Wednesday and Thursday.  The feedback was positive, but the written results of the survey will be some months away.  The hospital celebrated its 120th birthday with a special cake at a celebration with patients, staff and the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  The formal celebrations will be on 6 April, when a fair will be held in the hospital grounds.  The hospital serves a wide area that includes Burra, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Farrell Flat, Hallett & Robertstown districts.  Over the years the board of management has constantly striven for improvements and innovation and in that has been greatly assisted by bequests and the commitment of the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  The amalgamation of the Burra, Clare and Snowtown Hospitals last September saw the formation of the Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service Inc.  Services will be reviewed over the next two years, including the provision of theatre, long stay and short stay beds.  John Brak, Burra Hospital House Committee Chairman said the biggest threat facing country hospitals was the loss of theatre facilities and that will ultimately depend on government funds.
