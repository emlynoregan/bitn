Letter.  Pip Edson, as chairperson of the Burra Regional Art Gallery writes urging support for the spending of a recently allocated $100,000 from the federal government’s Regional & Local Community Infrastructure Program, on upgrading the exteriors of the Burra Town Hall and Regional Art Gallery, to enhance what are already two magnificent historically significant buildings.  A 1978 plan contemplated landscaped and planted areas and access roads.  Consultants in 2003 proposed a plan for loading and disabled access.  Neither plan has been implemented, and the completion of these ideas would fall well within the guidelines of the Infrastructure Program.  Roy Taplin’s work in painting and renovation amounts to $65,440 of in-kind input, so the $100,000 of federal funding seems a fair return for the preservation of the buildings and grounds for the enjoyment of future generations.
