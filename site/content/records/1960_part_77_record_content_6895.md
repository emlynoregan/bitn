Burra Town Council received a deputation on Monday night last week of representatives of the Burra Primary School, concerned about the dangers of crossing the main road.  The Mayor said the Council was sympathetic, but in the end the whole thing would depend on the Commissioner of Highways.  The deputation said their purpose was to get, if possible, a pedestrian crossing connecting the new bridge across the Burra Creek and the Town Hall.  The Welfare Club had sought action some time ago.  The Highways Department had inspected the area and given the distance of the crossing from the school, they could only suggest flashing lights.

It had been understood that monitors would be required, but this is not necessary on advice from the Minister of Roads, Mr Jude.  It was decided to go ahead and the Welfare Club had Â£200 in hand, but the Minister of Education advised that the sum could not be used for this purpose and so a move to press for a pedestrian crossing was considered.

Mr Stockman pointed out that a crossing could be used by other than school children and in the summer period by people going to and from the swimming pool.

It was pointed out that a pedestrian crossing would compel motorists to stop if any pedestrian was using the crossing, whereas flashing lights would merely warn motorists of the possibility of children crossing and slow them down to 15 m.p.h., but as the school was half a mile away motorists could not be compelled to observe the 15 m.p.h. speed limit.  It could be enforced past the playground, but that would not help much.  A pedestrian crossing could be set up by the Council with the permission of the Commissioner of Highways and it needed a prohibition of parking for 30 ft either side.

After discussion the Council decided to apply for a pedestrian crossing.
