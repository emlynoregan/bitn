Burra Early Learning Centre held an open day last Thursday, following extensive refurbishment.  Burra Community School Principal, Tony Maio, Sue Ryan and DECS Regional Director Terry Sizer also attended.  The Centreâ€™s Director Sarah Stoddard welcomed visitors and introduced former Director Brenda Villis.  She spoke about the origins of the centre.  The original plans for the site were drawn up on 21 May 1981, with the opening taking place in December 1981.  For many years the centre provided four session of pre-school, one play group session and one unfunded occasional care session per week.  A community meeting held at the site decided that there was a need for additional care in Burra.  Eventually DECS agreed to fund three occasional care sessions per week and one session for under twos.  The offer was accepted, but the under two session could not be run because of the lack of nappy changing facilities.  Two years later DECS agreed to fund a bathroom upgrade.  The snag was that the centre needed to fund the additional floor space.  Plans were drawn up by Frank Endermann, facilities manager at the Building Management Facilities Services at Clare and Mc Kendrick Builders from Clare began work last year in the October holidays.
