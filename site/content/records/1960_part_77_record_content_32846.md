Accident/Obituary.  Retired grazier Mr Donald Roy McInnes aged 75 of ‘Donara’ Hallett, was killed instantly in a level crossing smash on Thursday.  He was travelling in a car, which was struck at a level crossing between Mt Bryan and Hallett at about 8.45 a.m. by a goods train travelling south.  He had been going to collect the daily paper from a roadside delivery box.  The RSL funeral was arranged by the Hallett Sub-branch for Friday afternoon.  130-140 cars formed the cortege.  Mr McInnis was born in the Hawker District and transferred to Gulnare as a share farmer in 1914.  He enlisted in the First AIF from Spalding.  He was wounded in action in France and returned home, purchasing a property at Hallett in 1919.  He married Miss Clara Scholz.  He worked hard and established his four sons on the land.  In his early days he was a keen and active member of Hallett Tennis Club and a follower of the football team.  Later in life he was interested in bowls.  ‘Donara’ Stud was established in 1945 on the original property, but later in 1958 it was transferred to the old ‘Cartapoo’ property, which still remains the registered stud of ‘Donara’.  Mr McInnis was a keen judge of sheep and was very astute when it came to their value.  He enjoyed a success in the show ring as well as stud breeding in general.  He was a foundation member of Hallett RSL and was about to retire to Adelaide.

[Born 24 December 1892 Willow Plains: died 12 January 1967 near Hallett, residence Donara Station.]
