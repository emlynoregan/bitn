‘Burra Blasts Back’

This saw a number of events over the weekend 30 September to 1 October.

Stalls and entertainment lined Burra Creek.

A grand fireworks display was held on Saturday night at Redruth Gaol.

There was a Sunday morning parade of floats from Commercial Street to Redruth Gaol, followed by a Victorian Picnic.  The parade was led by the Caledonian Society Pipe Band.

A special souvenir edition of the Burra Record was published by the Burra Community Print.

A silent film night capped off a great weekend.
