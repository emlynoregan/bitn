Goyder Council invited community consultation on Monday night concerning planning issues and three BCS students produced a Powerpoint display: Chelsea Evans, Kay Carpenter and Bridget Hallion.  Some of their points:

Concerning the Town Hall – no one knows what is going on.

The railway station is going to rack and ruin.

The skateboard ramp is in the wrong place and would be much better located at the site of the old swimming pool – a site presently not used by anyone.

The Caravan Park would be better located between the old Court House and the Creek/St Just Street.

Another alternative site for the Caravan Park would be the old disused Aberdeen tennis courts.

The public area opposite Peacock’s Chimney is under-utilised because it has no amenities.

The crowd broke into groups to discuss things the Council needed to keep in mind when changing their development plan.
