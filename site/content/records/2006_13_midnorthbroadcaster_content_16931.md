Cornish Convoy.  A group of cars following the overland route from SA to the Victorian Goldfields in the 1850s passed through Burra last week.  While in Burra they spent time at the Burra Town Hall where they heard a brief talk on Burra’s early history from Eric Fuss and followed this up with a driving tour of historic sites led by Julian Ratcliffe.  After Burra they headed to Sod Hut, which would have been the first day’s stop on the 1852 ‘copper road’.  They then went on to Black Springs, Kapunda, Wellington, Meningie, Naracoorte, Horsham, Glenorchy, Talbot and finally to Castlemaine where the Mount Alexander gold rush was the initial impetus for the overland travellers in 1852.  Project leader Moira Drew is a descendent of Thomas and Maria Ninnes who left Burra for the goldfields 3 February 1852.  They travelled as part of a family group with several bullock drays.  Charles Rule left Burra the same day with a group of men.
