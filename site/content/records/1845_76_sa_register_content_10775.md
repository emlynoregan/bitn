Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held before Dr Mayne at the Pig & Whistle last Wednesday on the body of Henry Knevitt.

Joseph Knevitt, father of the deceased – Last saw him about midday Monday when I sent him with two horses to Mt Misery about two miles from Burra, where he was to hobble them and let them go.  He did not come home.  On Tuesday at about 7 o’clock I and my eldest son went in search of him.  We found the horses about where we expected, but no sign of the deceased.  Thinking he had gone to Burra for shelter we returned about midday.  I had a cup of tea and went out directly.  Sent my eldest son to inform the police.  Caught one of the horses and rode as far as the Sugar Loaf before returning to a section I thought I had missed.  Found the body about two yards from a stump.  Went in to tell the police I had found him and hired a cart to bring him in.  He was about 500 or 600 yards from the hobbled horses.  He was aged 9 and sometimes stayed out till 9 o’clock, but never overnight.  He was healthy and not subject to fits.

We expected him back about dusk and when he did not appear we were alarmed.  His mother, brother and sister went in search of him, but did not find him.  I thought he might have gone to Harris’s and was safe.  My wife returned about 9 o’clock.  It did not occur to us it was necessary to look for him or to give the alarm.  He was sent because I and my eldest son went to grind two axes.

[P.T. O’Brien gave evidence of being there when the body was recovered.  He thought it likely the boy had sought shelter at the stump.  There were no signs of a struggle.]

William Knevitt gave evidence corroborating his father’s account.  Though it was fine when the boy went out, the night had been very wet, windy and cold.]

Dr L.J. Maurau gave evidence of examining the body of a healthy child in good condition.  There were no marks of injury or violence.  A slight graze on the nose and forehead appear to have occurred about the time of death, probably by the body falling gently on some grit.  Mostly likely he sat down at the stump, cramped with cold.  On making an effort to move, he seems to have dropped dead from palsy of the heart’s action.  Believe he died instantly.  Two or three hours’ exposure on such a cold night would be sufficient to cause death in such a young child.

The verdict was death due to exposure to intense cold.  The jury added: ‘The jury are of the opinion that that cannot too highly censure the conduct of the father; and that he displayed a great want of parental affection in not instituting an earlier search; and judging from the evidence adduced, believe that, had a proper search been made on the same evening, the child would have been found alive.’

[Born Henry Knevitte 23 January 1848, District of Adelaide: died Henry Knevett 30 June 1857 Sugarloaf Hill near Kooringa, residence Kooringa.]
