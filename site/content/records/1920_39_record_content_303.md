Obituary.  Jane Peak, aged 80 at death, was born at St Just in Cornwall on 20 October 1839 and came with her parents, Mr & Mrs Cocks, to Victoria aged c. 15.  After about 12 months she visited Burra briefly and returned to Victoria to marry John Peak in 1856 at Fryerâ€™s Creek.  John Peak also came from St Just.  After a few years residence in Bendigo where John Peak had a fairly successful gold mine, the couple came to Burra to visit relatives and John Peak bought land four miles west of Burra where he built a hotel.  He carried on the hotel for 25 years, after which he farmed until failing health forced his retirement and he passed the property on to his two sons.  Mr Peak died in December 1899.  Eleven years ago Mrs Peak with two daughters and a son retired to Kooringa.  Mrs Peak died exactly 21 years after her husband and was buried on the 21st anniversary of his funeral.  There are four sons and one surviving daughter: John (Hanson), James & William (Cross Roads), Thomas (Kooringa) & Miss [Jane] Peak.

Miss [Elizabeth] Peak died suddenly on 19 November last.  There are three grandchildren.

[Two other daughters died as infants and another, Mary Ann, married James Johns in 1908 and died in May 1909 shortly after giving birth to a son who also died.]
