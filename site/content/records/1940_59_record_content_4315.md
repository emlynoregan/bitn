Burra High School Annual Break-up was held at the Assembly Room on Wednesday.  The approaching storm brought out swarms of flying ants to the discomfort of those under the lights, but they disappeared with the arrival of the dust and gale.  The entertainment is described.

The acting headmaster Mr Draysey gave his report.

The students worked under some disadvantage with respect to staffing.  Mr W.E. Richards put in a great effort during his time as headmaster in making the school one of the best equipped and in arousing parent and community interest.  In the last four months Miss Koehne, Miss P. Aughey & Mr Womersley have taken added classes and the latter two have taken duties beyond those normally taken by junior staff.  The library now houses some 1,000 books and half that number of periodicals.  Two additional typewriters have been acquired and the sports equipment is ample.  The students have raised money for the Schools’ Patriotic Funds and have also formed a War Savings Group.

In the 1939 Exams 7 Intermediate Certificates were obtained and 2 Leaving Certificates.  This year only 1 sat for Leaving, but Intermediate numbers were up.  Last year Colin Humphrys gained his Intermediate here and this year his 3rd year certificate at Thebarton Technical School with 11 subjects and 7 credits.  Nancy Pearce, who has been appointed to Quorn High School, passed three University subjects with 1 credit.  It appears that 16 old scholars have enlisted for service abroad.  Dr Steele, as Chairman of the High School Council, gave a brief address before handing out the prizes:

Leaving Certificates 1939 to Robert Goble and Bethel Smith.

Intermediate Certificates 1939 to Joan Edington, Joan Bourman, Colin Humphrys, Valerie Phillips, Ken Fuller, Claire Sara (1948) [sic – presume 1938] & Ellen Byles (1938)

[Presumably the last two began their certificates in 1938 and completed them in 1939.]

Dux for 1940 was Bethel Smith.
