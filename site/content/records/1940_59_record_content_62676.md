Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its 16th AGM 2 March.  The Treasurer’s report showed a balance of £314.  Elected were: President, Mrs Lott; Vice-Presidents, Mrs M. Kellock & Mrs Satchell; Secretary, Mrs Phillips; Treasurer, Mrs G. Kellock.

It was decided to hold a ball on 28 May. I. Wohlers, the Secretary for 1953 reported there were 45 members for 1954 and that funds raised in 1953 were to buy a £300 broadcast receiver and following several events, £400 had been raised.  At that stage a Bell & Howell Sound Film Projector had been bought for £315.  Tenders for the broadcast receiver were let in November and it should soon be installed.  A number of other useful purchases were also made during the year and a request has been made for a shed to accommodate 30 bikes.  In August Mrs H. White was transferred to Adelaide after 17 years in Burra and a presentation was made to her.  At the December meeting Mrs T. Williams, President of the Club for two years, was farewelled.  The year ended with the usual Christmas party for children.
