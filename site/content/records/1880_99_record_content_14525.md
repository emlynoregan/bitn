It seems likely that the measure will now pass the assembly and go on to the Legislative Council.  The opponents have fallen back on the cry of economy, but it is an unpaid

House that has brought about the financial difficulty.  Paid members will widen the choice of voters and make it possible for all classes to be represented and make it possible for country electorates to be represented by local men.  The benefits will be cheap at Â£13,000 p.a.
