Burra Racing Club had a working bee last Sunday to replace posts and rails on the inside of the straight opposite the grandstand.  The cyclone fencing that had been damaged during the football season was straightened and re-strained.  The horse stalls were renovated and final arrangements were made with the contractor in connection with the new Membersâ€™ Bar.
