Burra-Adelaide Cycling Race

The winner of the 100 mile handicap event was the 56-year-old President of the Norwood Cycling Club, Ira Steele.  This is the fourth time in as many years that an older rider has triumphed.

1969	Colin Shaw (44)

1968	Vic Dodman (54)

1967	Keith ‘Jock’ Thurgood (58)

Mr Steele lives at Torrensville.  He in fact started 2½ minutes after his co-markers as he had gone off to loosen up and arrived a bit late.  The winner’s time was 4 hours 13 minutes 15 seconds.  The fastest time was B. Gould in 3 hours 33 minutes 40 seconds, which was a race record.  [Details occupy c. 2 columns.]
