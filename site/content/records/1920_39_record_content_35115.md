The American Tea to raise funds for the Burra Benevolent Society was held at the home of the Mayoress Mrs A.B. Riggs of ‘Kabymure’ Redruth last Wednesday afternoon.  It was well attended.  Each person arriving placed a gift on the ‘stall’ in the hall and their sale later raised a nice sum.  The Mayor and President Mr James Thomas gave speeches supporting the work of the society.  About £6 was raised.
