Obituary.  Mary Anna Snell, aged 81, wife of the late Richard Snell, died at her daughterâ€™s residence in Kooringa on 8 August.  She was born near Truro, Cornwall in 1834 and arrived with her father, the late Henry Bishop in 1848 and her uncle the late Richard Boundy, afterwards a captain at the Burra Mine.  They came straight to Burra.  In 1852 she married Richard Snell and they went to the Victorian goldfields and they then lived in various places: Avoca, Daylesford, and Castlemaine, before returning to Burra in 1877.  They lived here until Mr Snell died in 1906.  In 1910 Mrs Snell moved to Saddleworth for four years before returning to Burra.  The surviving children are: Messrs Frederick Snell (Saddleworth), John Snell (Westbourne Park), Mrs J. Hocking (Yackanandah Vic.), Mrs H. Young (Long Plains), and Mrs F.J. Carey (Kooringa).  [Born Mary Ann Bishop.]
