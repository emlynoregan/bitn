Repeated attempts were made in vain to parley with the Directors.

An anonymous letter from the Miners, drafted on the 15th and delivered on 16 September was verbally rejected because it was anonymous.  After that a letter with eight signatures was sent.

The reply was that if all the men return to work the Directors would hearken to the complaints of one or two uncombined men who might come to them.

On Thursday Corporal Brooks was sent with a special warrant to apprehend two men.  When he seized one of them a number of fellows said that if he took that man he had to take them also.  He said that as he could not take them all, he would take no one.  When he reported to the Directors, they said they were perfectly satisfied.

[The other report is from an anonymous ‘Eye-Witness’.]

When I arrived on Friday, I found all the men had struck and that a Deputation of Directors had just arrived.  I enquired into the facts, first ascertaining the feelings of the Directors.  I found they had the kindest disposition towards the men, with a desire to meet them in all reasonable points.  I must say, however, that the workmen are divided into three distinct and separate classes and the business of these classes is carried on by divisions or sets of men of from four to six in each set.

On finding that the whole body had struck, regardless of these classes, I tried to ascertain the true merits of the case from the men themselves.  They refused to discuss the matter with me; saying that they would communicate with the Directors only.

The Directors said they were prepared to receive the complaints of any workman individually, or of one representing a set of men in whose contract he was interested, but that as a whole the workmen had not the same interests because they were divided into sets and each had distinct contracts.  They could not receive an organised body of whole of the workforce because such could not represent fairly each individual case.  Such mobs of workmen were intended to intimidate and the Directors would not submit to that.  Besides, the discontents arose from a portion only of the workforce and they had illegally compelled those who were content to leave their work, and out of fear to join the rest.

So the problem is that a general discontent with the assays has arisen and the miners have formed a committee to represent the whole, but the Directors have refused to recognise any such organised body.

From what I have heard, I feel quite sure that the Directors have been actuated by the spirit of liberality and kindness, but they will not allow themselves to be mobbed and overawed.

The requirements of the men may in some measure be right, but the means they are employing to obtain their end are most improper, and no man, however well he may wish them, could possibly back them in their proceedings.

The two men against whom informations were laid have since given themselves up.  In general the men have been sober and have shown themselves peaceably inclined since it was known the police were coming.

[The paper then continues to report developments.]
