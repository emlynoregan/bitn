Burra Golf Associates held an AGM on 4 October and elected: President, Mrs N. Finch; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames J. Gordon & D. Field; Secretary, Mrs M. Nicholls; Treasurer, Mrs R. Drew; Captain, Mrs J. Oates & Vice-Captain, Mrs L. Higgins.

The year 1976 had a record number of 42 associates.  The new clubhouse has been greatly appreciated and its big windows are a joy to sit by and the hot water system makes a big difference to cold and dirty hands.

[The secretaryâ€™s report of c. 1 column is printed.]
