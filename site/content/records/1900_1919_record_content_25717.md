Characteristics of the 1909 Paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: mainly, but not exclusively local.

Page 2.

Smaller advertisements, though some cross two columns.  Stock sales and public notices, though the latter were less numerous than in some years.  There are only occasional editorials.  Small items on page 2 sometimes get lengthier treatment on page 3.

Page 3.

Longer news items and reports from regional correspondents.  Often fleshed out with jokes.  The ‘Short & Sharp’ column is less cryptic than some of its predecessors, but the news is annoyingly interspersed there with advertisements.  There is little evidence of journalism.  It seems the editor waited for people to drop things in most of the time.

Page 4.

There are larger advertisements, which are generally not local, but include a few local regulars.  On rare occasions some news or reading matter may appear here.  For most of the year there was a useful town directory in column 1.

Overall the paper did a rather poor job at covering local events.  The Town Council gets little space and there are a number of things mentioned in ‘Short & Sharp’ that are of some significance, but do not get further coverage.

The column for 15 December is a good example of this.
