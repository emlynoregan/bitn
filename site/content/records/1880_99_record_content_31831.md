Thomas B. Bosence was accused of assaulting Alexander Forsyth, George Forsyth and Elizabeth Forsyth at Copperhouse on 23 Feb.

Dr J.I. Sangster gave evidence of the injuries to Alexander Forsyth and to his children George and Elizabeth.  The evidence of Alexander Forsyth revealed that there had been a dispute over the state of the handle of a hoe, which had been returned to the defendant after being borrowed.  Bosence had struck him with the hoe handle and when he fell down had then knocked his head on the road.  The two children then ran to his aid followed by his wife and John Thomas who tried to get George away after he had been struck.  He sent his son to the police and next day had to see the doctor.

He said the defendant denied striking him.  Plaintiff did not see him throw the hoe away and did not see Mr Diplock, did not hit the defendant and did not see George hit him.  Also did not see the defendant hit his son or daughter.  Plaintiff was 56 and the daughter was 21.

George Forsyth gave evidence of being hit and seeing his sister hit.  Either one of the Thomas’s or the Sanders pulled me off him.  Defendant lives next door to us and Thomas’s six chains to the west.

John Forsyth, who was in the cart when it all started, gave evidence consistent with the previous.

Thomas B. Bosence gave his version, which claimed that Forsyth was the initiator of the conversation and also of the assault.  Bosence had struck him only in self-defence.  The children had come up and attacked him and if he had struck either it was only in self-defence.  It is seven months since the hoe was borrowed and six weeks since it was returned.

Ephraim Diplock gave evidence, which in essence supported the defendant, though he could only hear snatches of the conversation from c. 55 yards away.

John Thomas saw things late in the scuffle so could not say how it started, but saw the girl with the hoe handle and thought the plaintiff was much to blame in the row.

William Thomas’s evidence was also consistent with the plaintiff being the aggressor as was evidence from Susan Bosence, the wife of the defendant.

Bosence was fined £5.
