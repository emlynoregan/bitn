‘Fair Play’ writes a long letter urging attendance at a meeting to be held soon to change Victoria Park from an eyesore to a pleasure ground.  Complaints are generally that it is too small, the trees are dying and the playing field is on a hill with a rocky base.  But the oval could be levelled using a respectable road plough – the rock is not too much for that.  It does not have to be dead level – Adelaide Oval has a fall of 5ft from southeast to northwest which aids drainage.  Secondly it could in the process be made 15 yards longer and 20 yards wider.  Thirdly the trees could be rejuvenated by lopping them.  Fourthly a grandstand could be erected when enough people attend events.  Improvement moves are supported by both the football and cricket teams.
