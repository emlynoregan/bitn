Burra Town Council, 20 May

Burra Electric Supply Co. will install additional lighting in Market Square, but they thought Chapel Street was as well lit as any.

Cr Kellaway thought the extra light was mainly to benefit those attending the Methodist Church and that the church could hang a light near its entrance.

Council will not take further action until an inspection has been made.

The Council will also support the move to get the Sunday railcar extended from Riverton to Burra.
