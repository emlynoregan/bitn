Public Forum on Paxton Square at Burra Town Hall last Thursday.

The hall was packed with concerned locals in a meeting that lasted almost three hours.  Nemerous people directed questions and voiced concerns to the panel made up of Mayor Peter Mattey, CEO Steve Kerrigan and Finance Manager, Bill Mader.

There was great concern over the future of the square and demands for clarification of Council’s ‘Futures Report’.  The cottages are currently leased to Maswood Pty Ltd and this lease expires on 31 August 2008.  Council’s figures show that maintenance costs have outstripped income and the cottages are in desperate need of renovation.  The Council is considering:

A management arrangement.

A long term lease.

Complete sale of the Heritage Listed site.

The Council wished to get an idea of what should happen from a community point of view.  Would the community for instance be prepared to pay a levy on Council rates to assist in the renovation?  The upgrade was expected to cost at least $800,000 over five years.

Several of the speakers expressed disapproval of the Council’s maintenance of the cottages.  Helen Stockman said that many grants had been received to assist the cottages, which are important to Burra.  Paul Wilson put forward a motion that was carried, to form a committee to investigate the operation and running of the cottages.  Salt damp is a major maintenance problem.  [Photo.]
