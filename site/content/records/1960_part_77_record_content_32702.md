Burra Silos wheat intake is expected to reach 300,000 bushels this season.  The first load from V.G. & M.K. Simpson of Mt Bryan was delivered on 29 November.  The wheat has been of good quality despite the rains in December and has averaged 62 lb per bushel.  The 264, 324 bushels received to Monday is the greatest intake since bulk receivals at Burra.  The second silo has contributed to this.  Very little local wheat has gone elsewhere and very little from outside the district has been delivered at Burra.  Both silos were filled to capacity on 3 January.
