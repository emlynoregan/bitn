Supreme Court Adelaide

Martha Gully aged 19 gave evidence that she had always intended to pay for the hat, but had received a letter from her mother asking her to return to Burra as she was seriously ill.  She gave the letter to a barman at her employerâ€™s shop to explain her departure.  The jury was unimpressed and the case was made a remanet for the next session.  She was found not guilty of the charge of stealing a bag from Mrs Gyss.
