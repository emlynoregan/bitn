Mineral Leases –the Kooringa Public Meeting

A meeting was held in the paddock opposite Paxton Square on Saturday afternoon to discuss what changes were desirable to the present system of selling mineral lands in SA.  Mr J.P. Winchombe was voted into the chair in Mr W.R. Mortlock’s absence.  The Chairman introduced the topic and said that now seemed the time for change.  The Governor, the members of the Legislative Council and the public Press were all in favour of mineral leases.  The problem would seem to be in devising an unobjectionable plan for implementing the change.

The first motion stated that the present system was against the best interests of the colony.

The second said that the meeting viewed with pleasure the steps already taken by the Legislative Council to change the system.

The third motion sought to make suggestions to be included in the changes.  These included:

The benefit to the discoverer of his discovery to be preserved.

That all lands be able to be obtained at any time for working minerals.

Leases be for at least 21 years.

That the party applying first shall be awarded the lease.

That within three months the lessee shall provide such particulars as the Governor may require and pay a 10% deposit of the upset price of £1 per acre before work commences.

That the land be subject to a rent of 2/- per acre per annum and that the continuance of the lease be dependent upon the constant employment of at least three men in bona fide mining for every 80 acres of the land leased.
