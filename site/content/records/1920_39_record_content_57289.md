SNOW

In Burra high wind and driving rain dominated Friday, accompanied by piercing cold.  Just after midnight a heavy fall of hail awakened many people and those that ventured outside to see were shortly greeted with a glorious fall of snow in large flakes.  Everything was soon covered and trees were weighed down with snow, but a heavy fall of rain before dawn obliterated it except in the shelter of buildings and where it clung densely to pines and dense shrubs.

At 8 a.m. light snow again fell and between 9.15 and 10 a.m. it was almost continuous, with neither rain nor wind.  After that snow was mixed with each shower till about 7 p.m.

At Hallett the country was said to be more like Switzerland than Australia and snow was still covering the hills on Monday, especially on Sugarloaf and Mt Bryan.
