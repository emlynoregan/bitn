Boer War.  The Burra component of the Australian Commonwealth Horse went into camp in Adelaide on Monday: viz. Frederick Hornhardt, John Lines and William Knevett.

[Later reports suggest they are likely to have left for South Africa, but that the peace treaty to end the war was signed before they arrived there.]
