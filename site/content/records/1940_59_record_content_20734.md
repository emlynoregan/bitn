Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Fathers Association

[If you want to waste some time, investigate the placement of apostrophes in this title.

In a compound expression only the last word in the group conventionally gets an apostrophe –so argue about whether this is after Airmen or Fathers – the latter would seem sensible to me.  You could argue that all the words before Association are merely descriptive – in which case there would be no need for any apostrophe.  The newspaper reports sprinkle the apostrophes seemingly at random.  If you google the title you will probably find, as I did, that the most common usage is the one that is clearly wrong, i.e. the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmens’ Fathers Association.]
