Decimal Currency

Australia’s dual currency period will end on 1 August 1967.  From that date £.s.d. will have no legal standing.  All retailing must be in dollars and cents and all contracts must be dollars and cents to have any legal standing.  The exception to this is in wills, which will not be invalid simply because it is made out in terms of £.s.d.
