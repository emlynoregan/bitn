St Joseph’s Bazaar.  Rev. Father Kreissl SJ appeals for aid for the bazaar.  He mentions the cost of the church as being £3,300 at its opening in November 1874 and the liabilities were then £2,114, since when the liabilities have been reduced to £1,000.  [This figure was corrected in the next issue to £1,300.]
