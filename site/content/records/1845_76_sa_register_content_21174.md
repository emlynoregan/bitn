Obituary.  Mrs Diana Bagg was found dead in her bed on Sunday morning 15 September.  An inquest was held before Mr MacDermott SM.

Bennett Smith said he lived next door to the deceased and saw her between 5 & 6 p.m. on Friday, crossing the footbridge near the Anti-Butchers with a little firewood in her hand.  Never saw her other than sober.

She lived alone and no one saw her Saturday and not seeing her door open Saturday or Sunday morning, the neighbours notified the police.

Police-trooper John Carley found the deceased lying on the bed fully dressed with one foot on the floor and her boots off.  Under the bed was a bottle with a little brandy and another with some beer.  The house had plenty of food in it.

Dr Dashwood saw the deceased about 3 p.m. Sunday, by which time she had been dead at least 24 hours.  He smelt no odour in the mouth to suggest drunkenness.  She seems to have died while dressing in the morning.  After an autopsy he had concluded from the condition of the brain that the cause of death was a fit of epilepsy and the jury returned a verdict of death by natural causes.

[Diana Rebecca Bagg died 14 September 1867 at Kooringa aged 45.  Her husband was John Bagg (born c. 1807) and they were married 17 July 1854 at Kooringa.  At that time she was a widow and said she was three years younger than the age at death would suggest.  BISA research says she was born Scott and gives Seymour as an alias, perhaps suggesting that was her first marriage or even a de facto relationship.  On her marriage to Bagg she used the name Scott and her fatherâ€™s name is not recorded.  BISA also says her husband was John Diment Bagg and that he died in Dorset UK 29 March 1891.  The couple had two daughters; one in 1853 and the other in 1860.]
