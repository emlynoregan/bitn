Burra Show Soc.  The annual show will be held on Wednesday 23 October.

The ring will be moved to the NW of the present site as a trial.

The finance committee’s proposals re members’ tickets in three levels (£2-2-0, £1-1-0 & 10/6) were adopted.  The £2-2-0 ticket idea was not passed without dissension.  Mr Hawkes thought it would lose them money by giving unlimited entries to the larger exhibiters – especially damaging to the Sheep Show.  Mr Warnes believed increased membership would counter that – entry fees last year brought in c. £20 at the Sheep Show, so not many more memberships were needed to break even.
