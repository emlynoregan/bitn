The existing agreement between the Institute and the Pictures Proprietors was respected.

Application was made to the Institutes Association to get the consent of the Minister for the sale.

The Association replied that the conditions imposed could not be accepted and sent two certificates embodying resolutions 1 & 2 above, without conditions 3 & 4.  These were to be signed by the Secretary of the Management Committee.  Mr Riggs then objected to signing the certificates on the grounds:

The resolutions were only confirmed with the conditions attached and were not confirmed without such conditions.

There was no secretary of the Institute to sign the certificates and no one else could sign them.

The [Institutes] Act appears to be drawn up having in mind that a committee of management would exist in all Institutes.  In our case no committee existed and without it the Act cannot be enforced satisfactorily to both parties.

This meant that Mr A.B. Riggs had informed the Council that for now negotiations had fallen through.

The old officers in January 1941 did not desire to stand again and therefore at this meeting the duty of electing a fresh set of officers and a committee was necessary.

Mr C.D. Wilkinson signified his intention of withdrawing from any active work in the Institute, after many years of involvement in a number of positions.

Mr A.B. Riggs was elected President
