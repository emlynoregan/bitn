Mongolata Goldfield

Rumour says there have been some excellent finds, but only Block 8 presents confirmation where the last crushing produced 4oz to the ton from the battery without tailings.  (Probably the total yield would by about 8oz to the ton.)  If Burra people do not soon take up the shares on offer they will go to Adelaide investors.

E. Harold Parsons replies to H.W. Morgan.  He says the Department of Mines is emphatic that Clause 93 of the Consolidated Mining Regulations requires work 8 hours per day every working day except Saturday when 4 shall be sufficient and also required it be ‘efficiently worked’.  He also denies trying to mislead the public.  The work on the holdings of companies managed by Parsons was according to plans from a noted mining expert.  These companies did not merely employ the minimum number of men to hold the lease.  Except for Byles’ which used machine drills, no other claims on Mongolata show the same work done in the same time.  As for his statement about the ‘dummying of leases’ Parsons restates his position that in many cases men have been held off leases by pegs on claims that are not being worked.
