Magician Scott Mangnosen performed at the Burra Town Hall on Saturday night.  A modest house somewhat in excess of 60 turned out on a cold night to be highly entertained by the performance featuring card tricks, mind-reading, sketch illusions and fork-bending.  A one-time native of Peterborough, Mangnosen now works out of Adelaide.
