[In this article the editor wonders about the dangers inherent in the Council Ward system in promoting parochialism and division.  This can cloud issues affecting the whole Goyder region and also diminish attention given to local issues.  He speculates that it might be better to do away with ward boundaries and perhaps also reduce the number of Councillors from the present 13 to perhaps 9 â€“ a change that might possibly also include some better reimbursement for their labours.
