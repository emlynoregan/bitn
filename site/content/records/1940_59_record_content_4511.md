Burra Town Council, Monday

Lady Muriel Barclay-Harvey wrote appealing for funds to provide warm clothing for Greek soldiers in Albania.

Cr Lott urged another effort be made to get the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry re-opened.  He knew there was trouble in raising ballast at the Sleep’s Hill Quarry and lorries had to be used there.

The Mayor thought there was little chance given responses to earlier efforts.
