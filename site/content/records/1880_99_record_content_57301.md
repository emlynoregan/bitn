Editorial on Cheap Money.

The Treasurer last week raised a loan of £311,200 at 3½% locally without going to London for it.  The term was for 25 years.  How is it that there is such a lot of money around for so low a rate?  Why has it not been invested at a higher rate?  The answer lies in the low price of wool and stock.  There is no margin for the owner.  Farming is in the same position.  Prices are low and no one has the confidence to borrow.  The problem is the worldwide depreciation in prices and till that changes we can hope for no permanent improvements.
