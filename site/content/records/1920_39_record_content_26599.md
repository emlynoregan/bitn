Croquet.  Ladies at Aberdeen have been seeking to form a club for some time.  A group met on the old tennis courts on 12 April and decided to form a club.  The Council has granted a site near the showgrounds, but the promoters are considering two other sites and have not yet made a choice.  Elected were President, Mrs J.G. Sara; Secretary, Mrs H.E. Goble; Treasurer, Miss L. Bartholomaeus.  Nearly 40 ladies have indicated interest and the club wishes to put down two courts.
