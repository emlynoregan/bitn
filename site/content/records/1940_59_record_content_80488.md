Sir Hubert Wilkins visited Burra on Friday.  He was travelling from Antarctica to Alaska and was able to disembark at Sydney and make a visit to his birthplace at Mr Bryan East after a period of seventeen years.  He spent two nights at the Wildongoleche Hotel at Hallett and visited Mt Bryan East.  He visited old acquaintances including Mr Ben Dunstan and Mr Charles Dare and was disappointed not to find Mr E.S. Wilkes at home.  He took movies of Mt Bryan itself, his old home and school and souvenired a piece of an old family plate from the homestead.  He visited the Ulooloo gold diggings in search of specimens for his collection.  He gave the two daughters of Mr Williams, the hotelier at Hallett, souvenir cards of his recent Antarctic expedition and said there was an Antarctic post called ‘Hallett’.  In Burra he visited Mr & Mrs R. McWaters and the old Burra Mine to add to his collection of specimens.  He took the afternoon train to Adelaide and then continued his journey via Alice Springs and Darwin, expecting to arrive in Alaska on Sunday 23 February before proceeding to his property in Pennsylvania.  He intends to visit the Belgian Congo by 1 March.  He is 70 years old and looking fit and well.
