Goyder Council has received a grant of $12,487 to subsidise a Natural Disaster Risk Management Study Program.  The local Government Act requires Councils to have a disaster mitigation plan.  Earthtech Engineering will undertake the study.  They will gather data on the history of natural disasters in the region and seek information, including photos of past disasters from people.
