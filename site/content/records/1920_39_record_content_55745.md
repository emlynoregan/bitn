The 1935 Anzac Commemoration Service was held on Sunday.  It was grey and showery and so the service was transferred to the Institute Hall.  At 3 p.m. the hall was filled.  Members of the RSL met at the club rooms with members of the 18/23rd Light Horse and the Scouts.  Major R.C. Sexton led the RSL men, Lieut. H.S.T. Warnes headed the Light Horse and the Scouts were under their Patrol Leader B. Riggs.  Mr W.F. Pickering President of the RSL was in the front line of the march and Mrs Pickering was the only returned nurse present.  The Burra District Band was led by WO J.H. Murison.  Captain Thomson of the Salvation Army late British Imperial Force presided at the service assisted by Red. D. Redding late AIF & Rev. G.C. Hutchinson late AIF.  Rev. Redding gave a short address as Rev. Hutchinson was a little late after having to conduct a funeral.  Rev. Hutchinson then gave the main address which is printed.  The offertory aided the Tubercular Soldiersâ€™ Fund.  After the service the procession marched to the Rotunda where they formed a square and wreaths were laid by Mr Pickering (RSL) and others.
