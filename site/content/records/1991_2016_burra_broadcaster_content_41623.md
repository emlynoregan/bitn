Burra Stationers, run by Jodie & John Quinn, have celebrated their first year in business.  Recent changes to the shop have seen the closure of the ANZ banking facilities and their transfer to the Burra Post Office.

Jodie has purchased the coin-operated mechanical rocking horse that has been a feature of the town for more than 25 years.  It began its Burra life in the ‘Lucky Dip’ shop of Colleen Spackman.
