G. Barnard writes re the planting of trees in Burra:

It is interesting to note that English medico Dr Robert Brummitt (1851-1927) came to SA in 1875 and was in practice here from 1877 to 1901.  He was a well-known Botanist and obtained significant collections of plants from Clare, Burra, World’s End creek, Black Springs and Apoinga while he was here.  Also well-known writer Hans Minchin describes Burra as having ‘open downs with grassy hills’. 

The hills and ranges once timbered and beautiful have been attacked and ignored, in the pursuit of industrial, pastoral and agricultural wealth.  The only trees to be seen are those that have been planted around homesteads.    Early settlers planted trees and landowners are again becoming more tree-minded, to provide shelter to the stock – much needed in this open country.  Sheoaks and blue gums were culled to provide timber for the mines and what was left was eventually used for firewood.  Original grasses were Silver Grass and Danthonia, Water grass, Bunch and Spear Grasses and wild oats in the hills.  Where the Silver grass grew on the flats, lucerne is now grown.  [The writer then goes on to list many grasses growing in the district and also many of the trees and then the birds that rely upon them.]

Without the continual re-greening program we would see, as we have seen in the past, a great decline in our local bird life.  So now is your opportunity to plant some of the trees native to this area, e.g., wattles, native hop trees, peppermint gums, sandalwood, Sheoak, tea-tree, quondong and mallee.

‘So – Mr Phillips does it really matter what sort of tree we plant, provided we continue to plant?’
