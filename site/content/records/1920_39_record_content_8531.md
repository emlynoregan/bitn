Burra Town Council

Angus E. Marr wrote saying it is proposed to form a public company with capital of £8,500 in £1 shares to supply a lighting scheme for Burra – to cover Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth and power would be available 24 hours a day for lighting, heating and motor services at 1/3 per unit for light and 6d for power.  The cost for street lamps would be £5 p.a. for 50 candlepower, £7-7-6 for 100 candlepower, £8-15-0 for 200 candlepower and £14-16-0 for 400 candlepower – for a minimum of 25 lamps including erection and maintenance.  The company was seeking a twenty year agreement and Council to have the right after that time to take over at valuation or to renew.

The Mayor said they would have to estimate the number and power of lamps required.  Three powerful lights had been suggested for the Farmers’ Union Corner, Market Square and Commercial Street.  They would also have to consider the length of the lease.

The last motion passed said Council was prepared to consider the advisability of granting a company such a monopoly.

Cr Sams thought Council had already passed a motion that it would not do so.

Cr Collins moved that the Council grant a lease to the Burra Electric Supply Co.  Seconded by Cr Harris and carried.
