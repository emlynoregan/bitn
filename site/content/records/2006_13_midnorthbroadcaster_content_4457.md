Clare Valley Aerodrome

Farrell Flat Management Committee is making a final attempt to raise interest and support for an aerodrome in the Clare Valley.  A meeting will be held at Farrell Flat on 13 December.  The idea is to cater for aircraft up to 5,700 kg.  This will be a final attempt after six years.  Last year the Clare & Gilbert Valley Council withdrew their support ‘for more pressing schemes’.  A major problem is finding the land – a flat site at Hanson has been identified, but the owner is reluctant to sell.  Funding is the other obvious hurdle.
