Mrs W. Voumard was 81 on 8 March.  She was formerly Mrs Allan McLennan of Oodlawirra and moved to Burra 38 years ago and her family of eight sons and two daughters is now widely scattered.  Members of her family have served in two world wars.  In her first ten years here she lived in a number of places, but since marrying W. Voumard 28 years ago, she has lived in Roach Street.
