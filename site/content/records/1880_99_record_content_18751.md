The Mayor suggested they should add to the memorial at the beginning a clause asking the Government to insist on the promise to charge only net cost be carried out.

In answer to Mr T.W. Pearce the Mayor said the amount of water the railways were expected to have required was from 10,000 to 12,000 gallons per day in summer and little or none in winter.  There was no need to press the matter as in the coming summer the Railway Department would be obliged to ask the Corporation to supply them and this made the larger engine more important.

Mr Bartle the Engineer at the Waterworks, said last summer the highest consumption was 49,500 gallons per week, but there were many more services now.

Dr Brummitt moved an amendment that a memorial to the Commissioner of Public Works be prepared asking that the promise of the late Commissioner, Mr Playford, that the net cost only should be charged, be carried out.

Cr West could not see the difference between that and the proposition.

Dr Brummitt said it dealt with one matter only and left the others out.

Cr Ridgway was unwilling to let the other matters go and so delay settlement of matters.

Mr Holder 2nd the amendment.

The other matters should not be forgotten, but dealt with in another way and not as a grievance.

Mr P. Lane supported the amendment, which was then carried 4 to 6.

Cr Ridgway said if he were in the deputation he would raise the other matters.

The Mayor would raise the question of the larger engine.

The deputation will be: The Mayor, Cr Ridgway, Hons J. Martin, H.E. Bright, Dr Cockburn & Mr Rounsevell MP.
