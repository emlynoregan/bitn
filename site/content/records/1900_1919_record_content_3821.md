Salvation Army.  Last Sunday was a great day at the Barracks when it was announced that Captain Munro would be farewelled.  He had arrived as a lieutenant, but was promoted after a couple of months.  He has worked alone since February and has been a very energetic and popular leader.  He goes to Strathalbyn and will be succeeded by the lady officers, Captain Keeble and Lieut. Lacy.
