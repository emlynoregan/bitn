Kooringa News, 3 April

The Barrier Ranges gold claims are getting much attention here, but so far conclusive links in the chain of evidence are wanting.  Many people have nevertheless decided to visit the area.  Mr Luke a sheep farmer in the area arrived yesterday and says gold has been found, but not in payable quantities.  An old digger who has returned from the Barrier says 100 men are at Menindie waiting to return on the mail – the diggings having proved a failure.

The Catholic Bishop Dr Shiel arrived here on 2 April, having been escorted from Gum Creek by about 25 horsemen and 15 carts.  He was accompanied by Fr Tappeiner SJ, Superior of Sevenhills College and Ft Polk of Sevenhills.  He was presented with an address signed by:

W.F. Coglin	Jos. Fogg	John O’Leary

John Walsh	Jas. Fitzgerald	Martin Howard

The Bishop responded, addressing the gathering of about 300 persons.

On Wednesday 3 April Very Rev. Fr Tappeiner celebrated Mass and his Lordship baptised 19 postulants.  The chapel was densely crowded.  In the evening the Bishop went to Sevenhills College.
