BCS has three students, Micah Blakey, Steven Haverland and Brendon Hucks, who will go with a teacher Tatiana Anesbury to a dam in the ACT to take part in the Australian Battle Group Inc. Biannual Battle.  Teams from across Australia will try to sink each otherâ€™s WWI & WWII replica battleships.  Teams are required to build radio controlled battleships at 1/144 scale, with a powered cannon and with thin balsa armour.  Standards are exacting, with some 50 pages of regulations.
