Burra Burra Hospital Inc. held its annual meeting of ratepayers and subscribers in the Council Chamber last Wednesday.  Chairman of the Board of Management, F.T. Marston presided.  It was only the second meeting of such a nature.  Before that meetings had not been open to the public.  Mr Marston said that in the past hospitals had often been poorly equipped and staffed by poorly paid nurses.  Now people demanded modern equipment and staff were well paid.  This meant that financial support had to change.  No longer were balls and fetes sufficient to fund the institution.  He announced that each member of the Board had carried out his duties well and the Medical Officers were keen and efficient.  Matron Tscharke had served them well for many years and despite the difficulties posed by rising wages and other costs, had presided over a year of great achievements.  The Maternity Wing was now worthy of any large hospital, with its autoclaves, fresh paint and hot water system.  The kitchen is modern and hygienic.  The operating theatre is good, with new sterilisers and other equipment, but new bathrooms are urgently needed.  A new refrigerator has recently been installed.  The Air Force Association has been helping in a material way and the President, Mr Cliff Lott says this will continue.  Help has also come from the Estate of the late Mrs Thomas, the Booborowie Ladies’ Club, Hallett and Burra Red Cross Branches, the CWA and the Demobilised Soldiers Association.

Despite staff shortages, the Hospital has been very busy.  In 1950 it saw 642 patients and in 1951 there were 832.  [Given the date these figures might be for 1949 and 1950.]  Last year 11 babies were born at the hospital compared with 93 the previous year.  Daily average patient numbers are down because staff shortages have forced shorter convalescent periods.

Nursing and domestic staff have been hard to get and no less than 62 different names appear on the list of staff wages.  The difficulty of getting nursing staff continues.  Presently there are only 3 permanent Sisters, 3 temporary qualified Nurses, 1 temporary Sister and 8 Nurse Attendants. There are no Trainees.  Through the year the overdraft has grown.  Permission to increase patient fees was eventually granted, but by that time wage increases increased the overdraft further.  Wages have risen by about 60%.  Comparisons show the picture

And from tomorrow an extra 13/- per week, to which must be added 32/6 (£1-12-6) for board and lodging.

[The report then goes on the detail costs, showing wages as 56.3% of costs.  The total expenditure was £13,723 and the income only £13,051.]

Maintenace costs had been exceptionally high because they had been neglected for many years.

The Chairman held out little hope that the deficit would be made up from the Governments at any tier of Government.  Functions to aid the Hospital would help for some very specific things, but overall he saw rising costs to patients as the only real outcome and that patients would increasingly have to look to helath insurance.

Expansion of the Hospital would yield more income, but that relied on getting more staff and that, in turn, depended upon erecting good quarters for nursing and domestic staff.  Plans for a new building [for such a purpose] had been discussed with Architect Mr Dean Berry in 1950 and plans submitted to a Building Committee in August.  The plans offered two approaches to the problem and eventually Plan B was submitted to the Chief Secretary.  He scrubbed certain parts of it and after we returned to Mr Berry Plan C was proposed.  The Chief Secretary indicated that he would approve Plan C and we would get a grant of something like £30,000 towards it.  When submitted to the Board of Management, Plan C was rejected.  Dr Heddle then took an amended Plan C to the Chief Secretary, who replied that the Director was not prepared to accept that all parts of the plan were essential.  The original Plan C was then submitted to the Board of Management and approved.  It was then sent back to the chief Secretary and the Board is awaiting a reply.   The estimated expenditure is c. £65,000.  Meanwhile the price of wool has fallen and the costs of building have risen.  The future path looks difficult.

Dr R.C. Heddle as Medical Officer reported that the Hospital had been successfully run throughout the year, that the Maternity Wing was very good and the operating theatre was fairly good, but needed certain improvements.
