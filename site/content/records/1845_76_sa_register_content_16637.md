Notice.  To James William MacDonald Esq. SM, Commissioner of Insolvency.

‘Dear Sir, - We the undersigned, old residents in and near Kooringa having noticed the insulting and unwarrantable attack made by a Mr Parker upon your reputation while a Stipendiary Magistrate of this district, feel compelled to express our disgust and indignation thereat, and to assure you that your removal from among us (although to a more important office) was universally felt as a great loss to the district.  In conclusion allow us to state our conviction that a more high minded, able, impartial and just Magistrate never presided in a Court of Justice.’

[Then follows a very long list of townspeople including many of the most prominent shopkeepers, doctors, mine officers etc.]
