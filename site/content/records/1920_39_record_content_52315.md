Farrell’s Flat Methodist Church.  The new church was opened and dedicated 12 August.  It has been erected on the site the old church occupied for over 60 years.  The material from the old building was re-used where suitable.  It was opened by J.G. Sara of Aberdeen whose late mother laid the foundation stone of the old church.  Mr Sara traced the growth of the church from early days when services were held in his parents’ home.  [Details of this history are not reported.]  Rev. W.J.H. Brasher conducted the morning service.  There was a children’s service in the afternoon with another service by Rev. Brasher in the evening.  The cost of the new building was approximately £147 for erection only.  A portion of the sand and all the stone was given and carted gratis.  All work done was supervised by Mr J. Denton.  Celebrations continued on Monday when a high tea was served in the Institute supervised by Mrs J. Denton.  Rev. G.C. Hutchinson of Kooringa and Rev. E.A. Pederick of Clare also attended.
