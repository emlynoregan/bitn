Grants available for 1988-89 to date are listed.

Major expenditure items are listed.

A proposal has been forwarded to the Local Government Finance Authority to borrow $350,000 over 15 years at 13.2% towards the last wing of Paxton Cottages.  Repayments for the loan ($55,120) will be repaid to Council by the Board of Management of Paxton Cottages and Council will support the Board of Management over the 15 years.

The total amount to be raised from rates for 1988-89 is $673,505 (which is in line with inflation).

Effluent and drainage rates were increased as the CED pumps require major overhaul and a $3,000 breather pipe is to be installed at the north eastern side of the township.

It is anticipated that Council machinery and private contractors will be used on the second stage of the Ludgvan Street deviation.

No decision has been made by Council as to future Council amalgamations in the Mid North.

At present the Corporation of Jamestown is making moves from the north and recently the District Council of Eudunda has proposed the formation of the District Council of Goyder to comprise the DC of Eudunda, the DC of Robertstown, the Hundred of Hutton from the DC of Truro and three hundreds from DC of Morgan.

Electors will be informed later of Councilâ€™s decision.
