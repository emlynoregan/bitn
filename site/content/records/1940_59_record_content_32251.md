Cr Reed Congratulated Cr Kellaway for his input over the years and supported his remarks.

Cr Carpenter said he had no regrets or apologies and felt he had accomplished some of the things he had set out to do.  He knew rates would have to rise.

Cr Baulderstone paid tribute to the Mayor.

Cr S.J. Woollacott said the town was costly to service because it had a relatively small population and was scattered.  The rate would have to be increased.

Cr Lee said the year had been difficult and rates would have to rise, but those living in back streets were entitled to better amenities.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said he believed the Mayor should have presented a printed report to ratepayers.  He was opposed to increasing the rates.  He was surprised at the consideration of handing over the £400 swimming pool money.  The Government’s consent would be needed.  The £400 had been put into War Bonds.  That meant his Council had not left a £300 deficit – with money in the bank it could not be in debt.  In fact he had left the town in credit.  He would want to know where the £400 was.  He said Fly-by-nights had voted the Council’s money away when they turned over the Institute to the Council.  He would like to see the Town Hall mortgage paid off before any Memorial Scheme was launched.  Competition for the Town Hall use now came from the new RSL Rooms.  The racecourse was beautiful and the showgrounds should never have been moved from there.  He would not support the scheme to develop the racecourse area while the Town Hall mortgage was hanging over their heads.  Rents were pegged and had been for years, so it was unfair for landholders to pay more in rates.

The Mayor said the financial statement read was not a balance sheet.  The £400 could only be used for a swimming pool without the sanction of the Government.

The Council had previously borrowed the £400 for other purposes, but had paid it back and the amount now in Bonds did not therefore belong to the Council at all.  The Council and town would soon look foolish if they did not spend it on some project.  A lengthy discussion concluded that the town either had to have a new assessment or the rates would have to rise.

The acquiring of the Burra Talkies by the town was discussed [as a means of paying off the mortgage] and the Mayor and Cr Woollacott were in favour.
