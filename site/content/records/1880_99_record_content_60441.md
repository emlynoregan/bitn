Supreme Court Adelaide, 11 August.

John Matthew Blackwell (31) was charged with stealing between 1 & 17 July 1896, a quantity of clothing from the Burra Hotel sample room with the total value of £4-13-0, being the property of D. & W. Murray.

When arrested Blackwell produced all the goods except for three and listed the places where he had got them.  The prosecution was unable to establish any positive identification of the items and as a result the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
