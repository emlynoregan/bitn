Marriage.  Kooringa Methodist Church, 2 November.

John Leslie Sandland and Elsie Myra Crewes.  They will live at Nackra. [sic]

[Nackara has a confusing nomenclature: at times known as Nackra and Tregu.  Even Manning does not make it very clear.]

A prowler was seen around the Crewes’s house the night before the wedding and it was feared he was after some of the £150 worth of wedding gifts.  He managed to escape, though without any loot.
