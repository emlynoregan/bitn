From The News 7 February 1935

In Parliament Mr Lacey, the Leader of the Opposition, said unemployment had improved less in SA than in any other state and he again placed the claims of Mongolata before the House.

While in SA recently Mr R.H. Jeffery, a director of Exploration Co. Ltd, London, a major investor in mineral developments, visited Mongolata.  As a result the possibility of English capital being injected into this neglected field is being discussed on the Stock Exchange.  He specifically inspected Byles’ Mongolata and spoke in complimentary terms of the work being done there and expressed the view that the field should be tested by diamond drill.

The Chief Inspector of Mines Mr L.J. Winton is presently at Mongolata inspecting operations on the field.

Mr Lacey, Leader of the Opposition, referred to the Government’s neglect of gold mining in SA and predicted big developments in the near future, while speaking in the Address-in-Reply debate.  Today he said he was referring to the English capital to be invested in the Byles’ Co.
