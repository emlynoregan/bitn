Burra Town Council, 3 February

Because of the great amount of work done by the Aberdeen Croquet Club in beautifying the surrounding area, the Council made a grant of £2 to cover water rates.

The Mayor reported sending a telegram to the Governor expressing sympathy on the death of HM King George V.

Council observed 2 minutes’ silence as a mark of respect to the late king.

It was resolved that a message of loyalty to HM King Edward VIII be sent to HE the Governor.

Council resolved to put some concrete backing on the lawns in front of the Burra Hotel.

The wall on the pedestrian approach to the ‘Black Bridge’ by Whitney & Tiver’s is to be placed at a better angle to give the path an open sweep.
