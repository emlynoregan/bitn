T. Swann BA (Hons), Dip Ed. writes for BCS staff.

Mr Auhl should do a little of his own research.  He would find that BCS has no shortage of trained secondary History teachers and that History is well represented in the curriculum.  Chris Collins and myself are both University trained History teachers applying our trade in the senior secondary level.  A group of committed Humanities teachers teach History at other levels.  At BCS students are acquainted with local History from a very early age and have a good skills base by the time they get to secondary History.  Years 8-10 are taught general History, which includes local History.  Year 11 students are required to take Australian Studies and can also elect to do Modern World History.  At Year 12 we offer PES Australian History.

What is disappointing ‘About Mr Auhl’s letter is that he is publicly repeating ill-informed gossip, which tends to undermine the very group he should be supporting.’

‘If anyone has concern about the curriculum delivered at BCS, I suggest their first step should be to contact the school and find out exactly what is being taught.’
