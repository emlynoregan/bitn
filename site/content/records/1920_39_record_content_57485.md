Baldina Mongolata GM 3rd AGM 13 August

In the past year the mine has been worked partly on tribute and partly by day labour.  On 6 July the last tribute expired.  Since then all work has been by day labour with Mr G.F.

The manager advises he has cut Pexton’s Lode after driving 14 ft from Lean’s Shaft at a depth of 93 ft.  The lode is 15 inches wide with low values.  10 tons are at grass and estimated at 8-10 dwt per ton.  Retiring directors A.E. Hamilton and S. Rymil were re-elected.
