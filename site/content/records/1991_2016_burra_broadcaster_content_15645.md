The Drinking Fountain.  Shirley Thamm has uncovered some interesting facts concerning the fountain.  The fountain was erected in 1888 as part of Queen Victoriaâ€™s Jubilee celebrations.  It commemorates a trip of district children to Adelaide by train to visit the Jubilee Exhibition.  455 children were joined by 175 teachers and other adults, leaving Burra at 6 a.m. after assembling at 5.30 a.m. in Market Square.  They picked up 43 more passengers at Farrell Flat.  They returned the same day.
