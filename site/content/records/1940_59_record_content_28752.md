Cr Woollacott wondered if the public would agree to spending £400 on Victoria Park and £500 or so raised by the Centenary Effort on a pool and end up owing money on both.  It was time to force a decision after ten years of fooling about.

If the Council built a weir across the creek and incorporated a swimming pool in it the Under Treasurer would agree.  ‘Even if we might not be able to carry on with the work for two or three years.

The Mayor had in mind a weir incorporating a swimming pool and gardens as a War Memorial.

He would like the meeting to submit a plan to ratepayers and therefore it would be a good idea to go into costs.

Cr Woollacott produced a wooden model of the weir, to scale.

It would reach from bank to bank, with 8 feet in the ground and have a concave surface on the upstream side to prevent floods smashing against an otherwise upright wall.  Floodgates would be provided.  There would be retaining walls either side of the weir and the whole structure would require c. 749 cubic yards of concrete – half of it would be bulldog made from boulders already in the bed of the creek and would also include slag from the heap 150 yards away and be strengthened by 20 old railway irons.  About £300 worth of cement would be used.  The weir would impound about 7 million gallons of water and dam about 4½ acres of creek bed.

He went on to quote rainfall figures, which he said would ensure the dam being filled.  Burra got on average 15 rains a year, any of which would fill it.  19937 saw 19 such falls and 1922 had 22.  The weir could be sluiced out periodically.  The creek would retain very little sediment and a one foot high wall built at the Black Ford would catch sediment.

Cr Baulderstone said they needed constructional engineers’ specifications.

Cr Woollacott agreed.

The Mayor said that the advice of the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department could be obtained.

There would be no flooding danger by a weir in the position proposed.

Cr Woollacott said there would be no upkeep.

Cr Baulderstone said the swimming pool was not really a community affair, but Cr Woollacott’s scheme with gardens and lawns would be.

The Mayor said a war memorial would soon be needed and this was a worthy project.  They has £1,040 in hand that could be used and he felt the public would contribute another £1,000.

Cr Carpenter urged caution and expert advice before commitment and moved that Council obtain the advice of an engineer.  It was a big project, but had his support.  Carried.

It was resolved that a letter be sent to the Under Treasurer explaining the scheme and asking him to receive the Mayor and Town Clerk for an interview on the subject.
