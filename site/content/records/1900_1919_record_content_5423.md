Theft.  Mr Albert Ward’s butcher went to Booborowie on 7 April and bought a pig weighing about 130 lb from one Jenson and got it into the cart for home.  There it was slaughtered, hung and then later transported to the Market Square shop.  The door was left open to allow the pig to get a ‘fresh breeze’.  In the morning it was gone.  No other meat was taken.  The matter was discovered at 5 a.m., but was not reported to police till 2 p.m. as Mr Ward thought a practical joker was responsible.
