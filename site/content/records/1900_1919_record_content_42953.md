Burra Town Council.

J.E.H. Winnall advises the Council is entitled to the rates from Paxton Square while acting as trustee for the property.

J.B. Griffiths is appointed lamp lighter in Aberdeen until the end of November.

There are complaints re the lamp lighting in Kooringa, but nothing was resolved.

A petition was presented asking for the footbridge, formerly behind the Burra Hotel, to be re-erected opposite the Institute.

There was another bridge only a few yards from the hotel and it was not desirable for schoolchildren to go through the back premises of a hotel.  There were 92 signatures.

The Mayor said they had already resolved to erect the bridge opposite the Institute and he could not say whether that would be altered in view of the two contrasting petitions now received, but both would be considered.
