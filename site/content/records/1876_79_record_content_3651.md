The Mayor accused the Commissioner of not carrying out his promise of a trough at the station gate. Now he did not want the trough moved, but another at the station gate. Commissioner Hawker expressed surprise at the mix up and said that as there was already a trough in Burra it would be moved from opposite Ridgway's store to the station gate. He then asked them not to request a water supply for Kooringa until a hydraulic engineer arrived from `home' (England).

On his return to Burra the Mayor was unexpectedly told that the work was already done and he was given two keys; one for the trough and one for the standpipe opposite Ridgway's shop. The town was also placarded with notices for a meeting to condemn his actions. He and Cr Roberts had attended the meeting and were astonished to find the Town Council the subject of censure. He wished to say that he had "never passed any censure on the Commissioner or Mr Rees"

The Government had no right to grant the request of a few memorialists to the extent of £820, while ignoring the simple request of the Corporation for a trough to be erected for the convenience of teamsters. The Corporation felt they had been grossly insulted and interfered with. Cr Robert moved:

"That the Mayor and Corporation of the Town of Burra very respectfully request the Commissioner of Public Works to regard them as the proper medium through which the wants of the town ought to be made known, and with very great deference point out that the recent granting of a water supply to only one portion of the town at the request of some private ratepayers has a tendency to weaken the influence of the corporate and representative body, and, as a matter of course, cause them to be ignored."

Seconded Cr Batchelor, and carried.

The standpipe not having been asked for Cr Roberts thought that they should return its key. The mayor thought that Kooringa was worse off than Aberdeen for water and badly in need of a trough, and they might make arrangements with one of the water carriers to supply Kooringa with water. Cr Batchelor moved that the key be returned as the Corporation consider that the scheme would be a failure financially and otherwise, have never recommended and cannot recognise the erection. Cr Geake favoured keeping it lest it otherwise fall into private hands that might make money out of selling the water. He suggested finding out what the Commissioner in Adelaide might suggest. The Commissioner might suggest some course of action.
