The rush in now to Bendigo Creek for which diggers have left Mount Alexander in their hundreds.

Friar’s creek continues to produce, but is inconvenient for water.

The Golden Gully is nearly worked out.

Along the Lodden the digging is not worth while; the gold being so light and leafy as to float out of the tin dishes.

Salisbury Gully and others too numerous to mention have been failures.

Mr Tolmer’s visit created a sensation at Forest Creek, where most diggers were South Australian and the high price offered and the efficiency of the escort will secure for Adelaide a large importation.

And a description of Ballarat reports that at the end of February at Golden Point and Brown Hill there were 472 men, 52 women and 6 children.  It goes on to detail actual weights of gold obtained by a whole series of parties.

[Given that many of the parties are reported to have obtained more than a pound of gold in a week of less, this report was very encouraging.]
