Last saw his son at 9.05 a.m. on the 5 May before the witness had left at 9.15 to pick up some sheep.

Left his son and Miss June Mattner in the house â€“ she had been housekeeping there since the New Year.

Met Weiss (at about 11.40 a.m.) about a mile east of his gate, riding a bike in the direction of Burra.

Weiss said he was going to Burra to enquire about the Eastern Mail, having heard they wanted a driver.

Witness did not notice if Weiss was carrying a firearm and did not observe any wound to his foot or body.

Witness kept a double barrel shotgun at the head of his bed, but did not notice if it was there when he left home that day.  It was not there when he and Sgt France searched for it, but it was later found in a back room.

He saw the body of his son when he returned home.

He knew Weiss, but Weiss had not been to his home when Miss Mattner was with them.

He would say his son Lance did not know Weiss.

He had employed Miss Mattner without inquiring into her character.

He and Lance were friendly with Miss Mattner and he did not necessarily think Lance and Miss Mattner were going to get married.

He had met Weiss at the Koonoona Field Day on 28 April, when Weiss had been drunk, but Weiss had not asked about whether Lance and Miss Mattner were getting married.
