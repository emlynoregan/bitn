Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce & Miss Annie Pearce left Kooringa on Thursday 9 March for Malvern.  Both Mr & Mrs Pearce were born in Burra, but in her early childhood Mrs Pearce’s parents, Mr & Mrs Andrew Thomas left the town.  At 21 Miss A. Thomas returned to Burra as a milliner for Samuel Drew & Co. and later married Mr C.J. Pearce.  Mr Pearce was born at Springbank near Burra 83 years ago.  A proposed social by Methodist friends was cancelled on medical advice due to Mrs Pearce’s indisposition, but on Tuesday last a presentation was made at home of an Onkaparinga Rug and a handsome handbag for Mrs Pearce.
