St Mary’s has been desecrated by vandals.

Altar vessels, the cross and candlesticks were removed and shoved under the altar in the Lady Chapel.  Pieces of candle were strewn around and the wires of the public address system were broken.  Water was poured on the carpet; glass in historic photographs was broken.  Sunburn cream was applied to a glass case and a door.  Books and magazines were thrown around and some were torn.  The Reserve Sacrament was removed from the Aumbry.  The adjacent hall was also entered and coffee and tea were mixed with the children’s sand tray.
