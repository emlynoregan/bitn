When SAMA decided to sell the creek the Council asked that it be dedicated to the town.

SAMA, as a public company, decided it couldn’t do that.

The area in question extended from Kooringa to the Mine Bridge and on to the rear of the Mill and the Council had no rights to any of that or to any crossing between the Black Bridge and the rear of the Mill, except for Ursula St, near the Burra Hotel.

To maintain access between their yards and the railway station, Bagot, Shakes & Lewis would have purchased the whole length of the creek, but Council thought it should be under municipal control.

Mr Lewis used his influence to get a definite price placed on it of £150 and could have bought it at such a price, but waived his right in favour of the Council, on the condition that Bagot, Shakes & Lewis had the grazing rights and pay £3-15-0 p.a. (5% on half the value.)

This gave the Council the right to plant and fence such portions as they wished.  Three large crossings were to be left in agreed positions.

I consider Council should sign the lease as agreed.  If there had been any thought that such would not be done the registration of the transfer could have been delayed till both it and the lease were ready together.
