Municipal Election Meeting, at the Institute last Tuesday.  The attendance was small and the Mayor, P. Lane, took the chair.

Mr Lockyer presented himself for mayor.  He felt the town should be surveyed, which would cost £400-£500.  A footbridge was needed opposite the Model School.  He did not think they could bear the interest on a loan for £1,000.

Mr Henderson offered himself for Middle Ward.  He favoured a bridge to the school.  Had no opinion on the Smelts Road, favoured a Chapel St Bridge before a Kangaroo St Bridge and was not for a tree rate nor a footpath to Aberdeen.

Mr Geake offered himself for either South or Middle Ward.  He was against a school bridge, but for one in Chapel St.  Was not for a Kangaroo St Bridge until the dangerous south end of the street had been attended to.

T.W. Pearce offered for South Ward.  He was not for the footpath to Aberdeen, nor for a town survey.  He did favour a bridge in Chapel St.

Cr Sampson was for the Chapel St Bridge, a loan of £1,000, a footpath to Aberdeen and a town survey.
