The Lewis Board

An information evening at the Burra Town Hall on Wednesday night brought out a good cross-section of the community to learn about the progress of Paxton Square management.  The proposed Board will take over the role of the existing Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee.  About 35 people attended the meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey and attended by John Brak (Goyder CEO) and Councillors Reilly, Bradley, Mosey and Gill.  Council took over direct control of the cottages in September 2008 and employed Juanita Queissner as manager.  The Operations Committee was also set up.  Membership of the new board will comprise seven representatives and one elected member of the Regional Council of Goyder.  While representatives from the Burra area are favoured anyone living within the Council area may apply.  Another person may be recommended by the committee and approved by Council.  Members would be appointed for three years and would manage, operate and maintain the cottages on behalf of the Council.

Goyder Council discussed the application by Phoenix Copper to have the Burra Mine Reserve lifted and reports on the proposal made by the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee, at their meeting on 22 June.  The diversity of opinion from the elected members led to the decision to gauge public opinion before making a submission to PIRSA on the matter.  This will be done at a meeting to be held on 5 July at the Burra Town Hall.

PIRSA has extended invitations to stakeholders to make submissions on the proposal by Phoenix Copper Ltd to lift the Burra Monster Mine Reserve.  The area was reserved from the operative provisions of the Mining Act 1971 on 10 March 1988 to provide protection to the historic mining heritage and currently precludes any access for mineral exploration or mining within the reserve.  Following this consultation a recommendation will be prepared for the Minister for Mineral Resources Development on whether the Reserve should be varied to allow the granting of an Exploration licence.  The Phoenix Copper proposal can be downloaded from the web.  Submissions must reach the Mining Registrar, Minerals and Energy Resources Division, PIRSA, GPO Box 1671, Adelaide or email junesse.martin@ sa.gov.au by 8 July, 2010.
