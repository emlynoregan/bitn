Burra News, 18 November

Bushfires have broken out in several places, but have done little damage so far.  Most people suspect incendiaries.  A fire was seen on Monday evening on Mr Thomas Warnes’ Run.  Jeffrey Pearce and a Spaniard called Barilla went on horseback and worked with spirit until it was extinguished.  About 1½ acres was burnt.

Three employees of the Mt Bryan Run have each been fined £1 plus £1 costs for assaulting a man named Carson on 9 November in the station kitchen.  Ill feeling and drink seem to be the origin of the affray.

The weather has been very hot.

Hay making is progressing rapidly – though the yield is less than last year.  The wheat crop looks very well.

On Tuesday 10 November the Trustees of the Wesleyan Chapel presented a beautifully engraved piece of plate to Mr A.H. Forder in recognition of his services in association with the choir.  A tea meeting was held and several members of the choir were highly complimented on their achievements over the past six years.
