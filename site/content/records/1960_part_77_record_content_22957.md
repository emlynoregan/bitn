R. Fuss of Burra North reports a strange and interesting visitor at the weekend – a porcupine or hedgehog.  Ian Barry and Chris Bevan were playing in the yard and saw it sunning itself in front of the wood shed, where it seems to have established itself.  It appeared several times throughout the day.  Its appearance is a mystery, as they are not known around Burra, but have occasionally been seen at the Gorge at World’s End.  [Presumably an echidna.]
