Ray Prior was born on his father’s farm in the Springbank-Hanson area and educated at Copperhouse School and Burra High School, where he was a House Leader and Prefect.  He has 36 years experience with the department.  For some years he was in charge of the Planning & Development of Telecommunications across SA and later was Superintendent of the Service Branch – a branch he entered some 25 years earlier as a trainee telephonist.  His most recent post was Metropolitan Manager of Telecommunications Division.  He served at sea in the RANVR in WWII, but was a telegraphist at Darwin in 1942 when the Post Office was bombed.  A more enjoyable experience was serving as Communications Officer on the State Royal Visit Committee for a number of Royal Visits to SA and the NT.  As a result he and his wife (nee Miss Maisie Peters of Riverton) have been presented to royalty on a number of occasions.  He has also for many years been associated with the Postal Institute, of which he is a Life Member.
