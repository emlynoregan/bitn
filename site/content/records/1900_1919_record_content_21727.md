Redruth Court

Luke Day v. Charles Streicher to recover £6 in lieu of one month’s notice and damages of £15 for leaving without giving notice.  Streicher had a counter-claim for £4-19-0 for unlawful detention of a passbook and £2-16-11 in due wages.

Defendant had been employed for c. 10 years with Day and he just stopped coming to work one Thursday.  His mother told Day he had bought a business.  Defendant had been ill and on return to work pay had been reduced to 25/- from 30/-, as he could not do all he had previously.  This was by mutual agreement.  Bert Knevitt, aged ‘over 30’ had taken his place and was cross-examined re his work with Day.

J.A. Knevitt: went to work for Day on 21 Dec. 1907.  Was getting 27/6 a week.

Foster, for the defendant, said that Streicher was a weekly servant and the notice he gave was proper.

Streicher said he went to work at Day’s when he was 16, about 10 years ago and then had got 4/- a week plus board and lodgings.  He said he gave notice on 26 February – giving a week’s notice.  He gave notice on a Wednesday and left on a Wednesday.  Said Day had not treated him as well as he ought to have.  Was asked: when your mother came to Burra about four years ago did not Mr Day give her a house rent free for 12 months?  Streicher was reluctantly forced to agree.

Frank Streicher also gave evidence.

The SM gave a verdict of £2-10-0 to Day in lieu of two weeks’ notice and £3 damages less £2-16-11 due in wages for a total to Day of £2-13-1.  Costs against defendant.
