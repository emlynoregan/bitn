Obituary.  Mrs Maurice Collins died in Adelaide 14 July.  ‘Throughout the district to know the deceased lady was to love her.’  Before her marriage she had resided at Hallett.  She was Miss Effie Patrick, daughter of the stationmaster there.  After her marriage to Maurice Collins of Mt Bryan they went to live at Mallett Station and out there her home was soon famed for the hospitality extended to visitors.  Mr Collins later sold Mallett and the family came to live at Abberton Park near Aberdeen.  Soon after arriving Mr Collins interested himself in municipal matters and later was elected to the Mayoralty, occupying that position for some years with credit to himself and the town.  In this he was most ably supported by his wife who carried out her duties with grace and tact.  Her practical sympathy that was extended to the aged, infirm and the needy of the town is remembered gratefully to this day.  Many important visitors and events occurred while her husband was Mayor including the ‘Back to Burra’ movement.  Among the dignitaries received were the Governor-General and his wife Lord & Lady Stonehaven.  On selling Abberton Park when Mr Collins took up politics, they went to the city to live.  Unfortunately soon after this Mrs Collins’ health began to decline, but as she made several rallies, it was hoped she would recover and though her death was a shock it was not we understand totally unexpected.  She is survived by Mr Collins and two daughters, Jean & Pat.

[Born Effie Elizabeth Patrick 6 November 1883 Alberton: died 17 July 1834 Adelaide.]
