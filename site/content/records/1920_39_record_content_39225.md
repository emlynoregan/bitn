H.J. Button writes that there are rumours that the Town Council will dispense with the service of full-time employees.  He considers full-time workers are more efficient and give better service.  Revenue he says has fallen about 5% and savings have been made by salary cuts, sale of plant etc. and so such a step should not be necessary.
