Obituary.  Sid Scroop, who died recently was made a Life Member of the Aberdeen Tennis Club some 30 years ago and to members was regarded as almost as permanent as the courts and buildings that he had helped to erect.  Few are prepared to devote as much time and energy to both playing tennis and working for the Association as Sid did over many years.  At 62 years of age he was a member of an A Grade premiership team.  For over 30 years he was particularly involved with the preparation and running of the Easter Tournaments.  He only recently retired as caretaker and was mainly a spectator for just the past two years.  His wife Flo and daughter Aileen are also Life Members of the club.

[Sydney Albert Scroop born 4 April 1904 Pt Pirie, died 7 April 1983.  Married Florence Adelaide May Hirschausen in 1924.]
