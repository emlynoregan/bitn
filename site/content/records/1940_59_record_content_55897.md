Rt Rev. B.P. Robin, the Anglican Bishop of Adelaide, and the Rector of St Mary’s, with Mrs Pettet, visited stations east of Burra on Thursday.  They called first on Mr & Mrs J.R. Barker at Baldina.  They also called in at the shearing shed where shearing was in progress.  The Bishop had not seen blade shearing before in Australia and also saw a bale of wool pressed.  They continued to Woolgangi where a service was to be held at 2.30.  Mr & Mrs Reg Warnes welcomed the party to lunch after which more than 50 people assembled in the lounge for the service.  The Bishop was at home, having experience in earlier days as a bush brother in Queensland.  A baptism followed and then all enjoyed afternoon tea.  The following morning Holy Communion was celebrated in the same room before the party moved on to Old Koomooloo where Mr & Mrs Tom Warnes welcomed them and where the old homestead is being transformed.  After morning tea they moved on to Koomooloo, firstly calling on Mr & Mrs Jim Wiseman before going on to the homestead where Mr & Mrs Rex Warnes had lunch ready.  After inspecting the buildings and modern equipment, including a 240 volt electric plant they moved on to Braeside, arriving at about 4 p.m. to find Mignon Warnes’ birthday party in progress.  From there the party returned to Woolgangi.  The following morning Reg Warnes took everyone for a run around the property where emus and ’roos were plentiful.
