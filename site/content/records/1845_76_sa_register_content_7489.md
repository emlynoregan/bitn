Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa 3 November

George Bevan, Clerk for the Patent Copper Co. appeared to answer an information of Richard Bailey who claimed £27-10-0 unpaid for wood cutting in the Murray Scrub.  Bailey said he had an agreement with Mr Williams, Manager of the Copper Works, to cut wood at 2/- per ton and a second agreement for 1/6 more per ton to cut it in shorter lengths.  The Copper Company was to send drays to fetch the wood and the cutters were to load it.  He had 200 tons ready and the company would not send the drays.  Two witnesses corroborated his account.

The company made no defence and was ordered, after some discussion between the parties, to pay £22-10-0 plus 23/- costs.
