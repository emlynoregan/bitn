Burra & District Ambulance Association has increased benefits to members.  Subscription £1 or 10/- for pensioners.  The £1 covers a man, his wife and children to age 16, and gives free transport to the local hospital from anywhere in the district.  The fee to Adelaide is £1 plus 2/- per mile.  This is now reduced from 66⅔% to 50% for members.
