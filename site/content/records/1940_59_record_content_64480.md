Burra Town Council, 19 July

There is a report of a transfer of title Vol. 1637 folio 160 from E.J. Davey to the Corporation of Burra.

Aberdeen Tennis Club sought the removal of a pine tree they said had roots disturbing the court.

Permission was granted.

R. Fuss wrote concerning the road abutting his premises and setting out a scheme whereby it could be widened.  It was resolved that the shoulder there be graded to enable better drainage, and then sealed.

H.J.B. Jennison asks for the approach to his petrol pumps to be levelled, as the slope is misleading when motorists are filling their tanks.  The site will be inspected.

Permission was granted for alterations and additions to the ANZ Bank.
