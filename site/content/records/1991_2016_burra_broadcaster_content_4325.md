Burra Burra DC, through the Tourist Office, will act as a booking agent for local accommodation houses for a 10% commission.  There has been some concern over a conflict of interest, but Councilâ€™s Tourist Executive Officer, Mr Philip Tanner stressed there would be no favouritism when taking bookings for Council or privately run accommodation.
