Bicycling.  A fine display of riding was given on Wednesday afternoon by a visitor, Mr Garden, of Adelaide.

‘He rode fast and slow and even came to a standstill and folded his arms, then after a time gradually moved on again; he got on and off the machine while in motion with the greatest of ease without altering its pace, he rode side saddle fashion, sitting on the step instead of in the saddle and standing on one foot on it, and finally lying down at full length, his feet away in the front and his head over the small wheel.  Then he took another machine alongside, and turned short and made the figure 8, and did other feats; and then to crown all took a third bicycle on the other side of him and manoeuvred the three with wonderful facility riding with arms folded; and then coming to a dead stop and slowly starting off again, with three more easily than most would have done with one machine.’
