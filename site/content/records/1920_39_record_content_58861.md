Stray Dogs are a big nuisance to local farmers at present and several reports of mauled sheep are to hand.  Roy Humphrys of ‘Blink Bonnie’ found three sheep horribly mauled one day recently and they had to be put down.  Two nights later the dog returned about 5 p.m. and another group of sheep were savagely mauled.
