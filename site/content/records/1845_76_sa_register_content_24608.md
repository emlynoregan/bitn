Accident/Obituary.  An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel, Aberdeen by Mr G.W. Goodhart JP following the death of Robert Brown aged 10, the son of Mrs Jane Brown, a farmer near Ironmine.  William Taylor, a brother-in-law of the deceased said he was in charge of two loaded wagons he was driving to Buttamue.  He was with the front team and the boy was sitting on a cement cask in the second wagon, but was not in charge of the horses as the reins were out of his reach.  At creek crossings or bad patches in the road he stopped the front wagon and guided the second one past the difficulties.  At about 3.30 about three miles from Buttamue they were travelling at a fair walking pace when he looked around and saw the boy all right.  A couple of minutes later he missed the boy and stopped the wagon and ran back.  He found deceased five yards behind the wagon on his hands and knees trying to get up.  He was badly injured with one eye and the side of his head.  Taylor carried the boy about ¾ mile to a shepherd’s hut, which was empty but for a dog.  The boy died there and Taylor carried him back to the wagon and wrapped him in a blanket and tarpaulin.  He brought him into Burra on Sunday.  Taylor had no idea why the boy had overbalanced.  Perhaps he had done so when trying to whip the horses and in falling was kicked or trampled by them.  The wheel of the wagon had not passed over him.  Taylor was greatly affected while giving evidence and the jury was most sympathetic for the trying circumstances in which he had been placed.  The verdict was accidental death.

[Robert James Brown born 3 February 1862 near Templers to Robert & Jane nee Ross: died near Buttamuc (sic), residence Iron Mine.]
