Booborowie WWII Honour Roll was unveiled at the Booborowie Institute on Tuesday night last.  The ceremony was performed by Mrs W.J. Shattock and Mrs C.A. Bruce, who both lost sons in the conflict.  The roll was delayed by the difficulty in finding the names of those who enlisted in WWI, as the roll contains the names of 130 who enlisted from Booborowie in both World Wars.  It cost £85.  Supper takings at the following ball are expected to bring the donations of £79 up to the total required.
