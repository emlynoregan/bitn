Weather.  Last Saturday a terrible dust storm raged from early morning till 3 p.m. when the wind changed and thunder and lightning was followed by a short heavy shower.  The creeks were already running from rain further north on Friday.  They were cleared of the accumulated rubbish.  Much further north heavy rain caused floodwaters to sweep away a mile of the railway near Mernmerna in the Flinders Ranges.
