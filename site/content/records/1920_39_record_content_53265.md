Obituary.  Mrs Edith Burns relict of the late Samuel Burns died at her home ‘Kia-Ora’ in Dulwich.  Her late husband was born in Chapel St 22 June 1858 and died 4 June 1916.  In conjunction with the late James Harry he carried on a wheelwright’s business for over 30 years.  He was also Mayor and a member of the Town Council and took a lively interest in all public and church matters.  He married his late wife in 1883.  She was born in the Wakefield District in 1859, the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Oates.  After the marriage they lived in Chapel Street until Mr Burns’ death.  The deceased was a large hearted and sympathetic woman who despite caring for 9 children gave her husband every assistance in his town life and especially in his church interests.  Before Methodist Union they were staunch supporters of the Bible Christian Church and after union they continued their enthusiasm with the Methodist Church.  They extended hospitality to visiting ministers and to a wide circle of friends.  They were also the centre of a social circle of young folk especially those moving in musical circles.  After Mr Burns’ death and her removal to Dulwich Mrs Burns led a more retired life.  Nine children survive: Louie Mrs A. Murrie (Torrensville), Norman & Jack (Melbourne Victoria), Garfield (Crystal Brook), Lydia Mrs Frank T. Treloar (Baratta Station, Far North), Robert, (Toorak) and Miss Melva Burns (Dulwich).  There are 13 grandchildren.  Two sons Garfield & Robert served in the Great War and the latter is an invalid as a result of war injuries.

[Born Edith Oates 2 April 1859 near Watervale: died 20 October 1934 Dulwich.]
