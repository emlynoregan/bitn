The Burra Hospital is particularly short of staff and girls wishing to become nurses have had to wait till the age of 17.  The Government has now created a category of Nurse Assistants which is open to girls under 17.  They will receive the salary of a 1st year Trainee Nurse.  Their period of employment will in no way form part of the recognised training period.
