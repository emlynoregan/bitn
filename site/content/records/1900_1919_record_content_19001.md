Captain J.A. Watt DSO has been awarded the long-service medal.  He moved to Quorn about 6 months ago.  He joined the SA Infantry Volunteer Corps as a corporal in 1864, [Check date: this is clearly wrong and 1884 would be closer.] was promoted to colour-sergeant and was instrumental in forming the Burra Rifle Corps and the Wallaroo and Kadina Volunteer Force.  The latter he commanded up to 1901 when he was appointed to command a squadron of the 5th SA Imperial Bushmen, and served in South Africa.  Later he commanded the 5th & 6th contingent and was mentioned in dispatches by Lord Kitchener for bravery.  On return to Adelaide he was presented with an illuminated address by his contingent.
