18 May.

The District Council of Burra advises it is willing to join with the Town Council re the road to Princess Royal with both councils paying expenses within their own boundary.

Burra Football Association applied to use the oval and the shed and charge admission with ⅓ of the gate to go to the Council.

R. Reed applied for permission to fence the piece of road between allotments 72, 73, 74, 89 & 90 in Aberdeen.

There is a need for rates to be paid now as bonds and interest fall due in July.

The Waterworks are going well.  The engineer reported on the Leigh Creek coal sample given him and said it was deficient in oily hydrocarbons, is practically flameless and leaves a great deal of ash.  It would not do for winter, but would be satisfactory in summer if used with wood.
