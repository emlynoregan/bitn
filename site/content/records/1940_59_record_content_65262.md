Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Organisation held its AGM at Koomooloo 28 September with a good attendance.  A lecture was given by Mr F.L. Kerr, Director of Emergency Fire Services, on map reading as an aid to fire location.  Chairman Rex C. Warnes reported no fires in the last season, good rains having turned much of the area green last summer.  This year is drying out however, and fire is a real danger, especially in the south of the district.  We regret losing Messrs Howard of Morgan Vale and H.L. Riggs of Bazentin, but welcome Messrs Klem Bros to Bazentin and Mr Heinrich to Morgan Vale.
