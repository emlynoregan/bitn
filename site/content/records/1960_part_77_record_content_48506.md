Burra Hospital has been advised by the trustees in the estate of the late John Robert Barker that there is a bequest to the hospital of $70,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of cottage homes for the aged.  They are to be known as the Barker of Baldina Cottage Homes and are to be erected on land adjoining the hospital.  The suggested model to accommodate 16 persons is ten motel type single units comprising a bed-sitting room, small kitchen, bathroom and private verandah.  Two motel type single units slightly larger with the possibility of an additional bed or divan and two double units for couples with a bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and private verandah.  Communal facilities will include recreation-living room, laundry, storage and boiler rooms etc.  Each unit would have a small flower garden and there would be seven vegetable plots.  There would be areas of lawn with shrubs and concrete paths.  Each unit would have reticulated hot water radiators and air conditioning.  The estimated cost of the project is $108,000.

$90,000 for land and construction costs, eligible for a two for one subsidy.

$14,000 for furnishings and equipment, eligible for a one for one subsidy.

$4,000 for lawn and paths, which would not receive a subsidy.

Of the total the subsidy would amount to approximately $60,000 and the cost to the Hospital would be approximately $50,000.  The late Mr Barkerâ€™s will also provides for a special donation of one nineteenth of the balance of his residuary estate after certain bequests, to be made available to the Hospital for building or an addition to such Hospital property.

The Burra Benevolent Society has also been advised it will benefit from the J.R. Barker estate.
