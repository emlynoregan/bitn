Channel 7 Television sent a team to Burra last Sunday to film a segment for State Affair.

The main purpose of their visit was to investigate the effect of off road vehicles on the Buddle Pits in the Burra Mine area as reported in the press last week and to cover historic and tourist aspects of the town.  Scenes were shot in Market Square, Paxton Square and the Brewery Cellars.
