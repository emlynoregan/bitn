Redbanks Reserve c. 15 km east of Burra has been formally gazetted as a Conservation Park managed by National Parks and Wildlife SA, Mid North District, Burra.

The reserve contains open grasslands, mallee scrub, saltbush scrubland, deeply eroded creekbeds and deep rock pools.  Recently fossil remains of a Tasmanian Tiger and a number of diprotodons have been found there.  In the past the area has been intensely grazed as four stock routes converge there and it also saw a period of use by off-road recreational vehicles.  The deep gullies were used to dump car bodies.  Following a serious accident and the threat of possible litigation Council decided to prohibit motorbikes and off road recreational vehicles.  Since then the vegetation has recovered dramatically and with considerable improvement in habitat and wildlife diversity.  The former Burra Burra DC spent considerable money clearing the area of old car bodies, with a crushing plant based there for several weeks.  The area has been fenced and walking trails created and an informal camping area established.  Motorbikes and off road recreational vehicles remain banned.
