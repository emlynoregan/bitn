Public School Concert.  The wet weather would have defeated any other concert on Friday, but the Public School concert filled the Institute Hall.  The items and performers are all listed.

[Master B. Fuss brought down the house with ‘How Jimmy tended baby’.

R. Fuss and J.E. Ewins performed the dialogue: ‘Brutus and Cassius’.

R. Fuss is presumably L. Robert Fuss, but B. Fuss is a mystery unless he is also Robert = Bob in another guise.]
