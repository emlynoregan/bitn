‘Fairplay’ writes wondering why JEHW was content for the time he was a member of the Local Board of Health with an inspector lacking formal qualifications.  The Central Board of Health inspects milking cows so he need have no fears there, backed up by an inspector under the Local Board of Health.  AJM accuses the Local Board of making a mistake, but disease is not likely.  Only one beast has been condemned for many years past – and that action must have cost the Board £50 in legal fees.
