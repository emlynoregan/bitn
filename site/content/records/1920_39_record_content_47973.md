‘Old timer’ writes about Johnny Green, which stood as a weather cock on Morphett’s heads for over 60 years with pick and gad in hand, miner’s hat and candle.  It can be seen overlooking where the old mine weighbridge once stood.  Some will not notice and others will be glad or thrilled to see him re-erected in such a conspicuous position.  We appreciate the Town Council for completing the work.  The writer vividly recalls carrying pasties and oggans to his guardian parent past the iron man representing a weathercock on a pivot.
