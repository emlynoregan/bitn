It is on record that when the motion was first put the Chairman was in favour of it and was so reported.

The chairman said he corrected his decision immediately it was possible to do so after the first motion was declared carried.  On the second occasion he had no alternative but to uphold a valid technical objection.  He understood all the representatives of Councils had a mandate except Cr Riggs, who was given a free hand.

The motion was then put and seven voted in favour.  The Chairman overruled Mr Davey’s objection that a full Board had to be present and he abstained.  Messrs Collins, Morgan and the Chairman were opposed and Mr Lee was absent.

The third motion on notice was to appoint a subcommittee to revise the rules and Mr Warnes moved that it comprise the Chairman and Messrs Sandland, Melrose, Riggs and Warnes.

The Chairman did not wish to act, as he regarded the day’s actions as being virtually a vote of no confidence in the chair.  He thought things could not go on harmoniously now and it might be better if both he and Mr Warnes retired, as this matter would seriously injure the hospital.

Mr Warnes then withdrew the names from the motion that then passed without stipulating who was to serve.
