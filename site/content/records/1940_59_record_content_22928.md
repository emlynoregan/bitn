Burra Rifle Club has been in recess for some years as a result of wartime restrictions.  Recently a letter from Headquarters asked for the state of the range and the names of committee members, etc.  A general meeting was therefore called for last Saturday in the RSL Rooms.

There was a good attendance of old and intending members.  E.C. Collins was elected Chairman of the Club.

He said no word had yet been received of when shooting was likely to start again, but it seemed likely not to be far off.  Also elected were: Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt; Treasurer, P.W. Hogan; and for the committee: F.T. Marston, F.H. Reed, W.G. Woodman and J.H. Schwier.
