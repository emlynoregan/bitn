Geoffrey Buyrn

Married with three children and have owned land at Mt Bryan for 12 years and lived there for 9

A major concern is that Council has not adequately addressed the issue of flood mitigation in the district

Also concerned about unsealed road, both in rural areas and the townships

Interested in improving the Council gardens in Burra and seeing more trees planted, especially on the approaches to towns

Last summer was honorary manager of the Burra Community Swimming Pool Canteen

As a pensioner am well aware of the issues confronting pensioners and the unemployed.
