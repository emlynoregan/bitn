Milton H. Edwards writes to explain the necessity of suspending the Church Youth Programme, but his letter fails to make the cause clear at this distance in time, though presumably it was well understood when he wrote.

He speaks of the difficulties which have existed from the first instance that the group was formed and which it has not been possible to resolve.

‘This action is symptomatic of a deep-seated social problem which exists at the very heart of the Burra Community.  Different expressions of the same problem are occurring at every level of social activity.  It is not only the youth who are irresponsible.’

[Rev. Edwards refers to the circular he sent to parents in September, apparently spelling out the problem.  He does not now make it more explicit than in the sentence quoted above.]
