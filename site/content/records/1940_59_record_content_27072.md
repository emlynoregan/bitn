Burra Town Council, 17 June

Davies Motor Co. was granted permission to install two petrol pumps on the kerb in front of its garage at the usual fee of £3-3-0 per pump.

A.D. Carter was granted permission to erect a petrol store at his service station and to move a culvert at the entrance and replace it with pipes to allow vehicular access.

Booborowie Ladies’ Club has been formed so that co-operation, comradeship and social intercourse provided by the FFCF and the Red Cross during the war years should not be abandoned.  The FFCF has been disbanded and the Red Cross activity greatly reduced.
