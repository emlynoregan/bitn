Obituary.  Mrs Albert Brandt who died 16 October was born at Redruth in 1852 and spent all of her life in the town.  In 1873 she married Albert Brandt who came from Germany aged 2.  She was a prominent worker in the Bible Christian Church, but relaxed her efforts after Methodist Union, as she felt keenly the closure of the church she had loved.  Of her six children only two survive: George Brandt (Adelaide) and Henry Brandt (Broken Hill).  There are 13 grandchildren.  Augie Brandt of the 3rd light Horse who died recently was her youngest son.
