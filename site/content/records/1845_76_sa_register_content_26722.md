Re-opening of the Burra Institute

Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal reopened the Institute on Thursday evening 14 October.  The building covers about 5,000 square feet and consists of a main building with two wings.  The entrance is by eleven steps of Mintaro slate, with a terrace 10 ft x 30 ft covered with very large Mintaro slates.  The entrance Hall, which is also intended for a museum, is 20 ft x 35 ft and 20 ft high.  The Lecture Hall is 54 ft x 34 ft and 20 ft high and is entered by sliding doors 12 ft x 12 ft, so as to throw the entrance hall into the lecture hall if it should be crowded at any time.  To the right of the entrance hall are two doors opening into rooms set apart for committee and class rooms; one 24 ft x 16 ft and the 24 ft x 13 ft, and 14 ft high.  To the left is one door leading to the reading room and library, which are of the same dimensions as the rooms on the right.  The Lecture Hall is lighted with four chandeliers, the entrance hall with two and the other rooms with one each.  The doors of the rooms are grained oak colour with the exception of the reading room, which is painted.  The land is a gift from the SA Mining Association and has been conveyed to trustees.  The frontage is 204 ft and the depth 219 ft and its value is estimated at over £800.  The gift should therefore be appreciated by the residents.

The first contract and extras for alterations to the left wing amounted to £166-10-4.  The present contract, including extras, conveyance of land, seats, etc. is for £1,416-11-8.  Blinds, lamps etc. have cost £65-12-0.  The cash received to this time has been £551-4-10 and the Government grant amounts to £750, while the ordinary grant in aid is £136-1-4.  There will remain a debt of about £230.  The trustees are Mr A. McCulloch, Captain I. Killicoat and Messrs T. Bath, P. Lane & A. Bartholomæus.  At the opening Mr Lane, as Chairman of Trustees, handed the keys to Mr McCulloch, saying he had done so much to support and aid the Institute.  Mr McCulloch said he would continue to do all he could to forward the interests of the Institute.  He felt that they would not long be in debt.  They now had a fine building and a nice reading room and he hoped young people would spend many useful hours there.  He had pleasure in declaring the building open.

Mr McCulloch chaired the entertainment that followed.  Mr T. Bath said he was not about to glorify himself or the others who had energetically set about erecting such a fine building, but he hoped to impress upon those yet young in life the advantages of contributing to the general welfare of the community.  He reflected on his connection with the Institute, saying he recalled meeting at the house of their secretary, Mr Wells about 19 years ago at a meeting called by the late Rev. D.J. Ibbetson who was the first to start a subscription list for an Institute in Burra.  It was now well established and was the oldest in the colony outside the metropolitan area.  He hoped it would become the best in resources and offerings as well.
