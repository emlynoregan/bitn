A Shooting.  On Friday night between 9 and 10 p.m. at the rear of Charley Morgan’s baker’s shop a shot passed close to Mr H.A. Bohme, a recent arrival in Burra.  It came from a point between Bridge St East and Kingston St and lodged in the roof of an opposite house.  Mr Bohme says he has private reasons for suspecting a particular person.  The matter is being investigated by M-C Clarke, but in the absence of witnesses it will be a difficult matter to sheet the offence home.
