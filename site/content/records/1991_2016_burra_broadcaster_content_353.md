An issue numbered 33 and dated 18 September 1991 was filed between Issues 36 and 39.  It was quite different from the issue also numbered 33 and also dated 18 September 1991 as noted above.

From the advertising copy it seems likely to have been Issue No. 37 and should have been dated c. 30 October 1991.
