Local Board of Health, 7 July

The Inspector reported that the Manpower Authorities would probably forward a report on bread delivery later.

Cr Fisher thought the local proprietor had been dealt with unfairly in that only the Council’s side of the matter had been published and his letter to the Council had not been printed in full.

Crs Harvey & Fisher thought the proprietor should be invited to give his side when a reply was received from Manpower.

The Mayor was strongly opposed, but a motion to that effect was carried.

The ladies’ public lavatory had been inspected and found to be filthy.  It was resolved that the Overseer clean it every Saturday morning.
