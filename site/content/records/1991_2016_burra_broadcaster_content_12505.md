Booborowie Swimming Pool has a chlorine emergency on Monday when chlorine was found to be bubbling out of a large storage drum in the pool shed.  Police, CFS and HAZMAT officials conferred and ICI safety expert Ray Tyson was called in.  Eventually it was decided to tip the contents of the 44 gallon plastic container into the pool to be broken down by sunlight.
