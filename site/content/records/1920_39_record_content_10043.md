Bowls.  Last Monday a team from Jamestown played two games.

In the morning Burra 146 defeated Jamestown 75.

In the afternoon Burra 179 defeated Jamestown 113.

A croquet team from Jamestown also visited and the Burra ladies won that game too.

Lawn Tennis.  At Aberdeen: Aberdeen 13-96 defeated Clare 7-88.

Cricket.  At Victoria Park, Saturday & Monday:

Booborowie-Kooringa United 178 defeated Hallett-Mt Bryan United 144.

Donald Voumard of Drew & Crewes Ltd was presented with a dinner service on the occasion of his approaching marriage, by E.W. Crewes on Friday.

Fire spread through grass on W.H. Sandland’s Koo-owie 10 miles south of Burra on Monday morning destroying fencing and 1,200 acres of grass.  The fire was virtually confined to Koo-owie.  Mr Sandland had just brought in 2,100 sheep from his Balah Station due to drought.  They were on the road near the station and during the fire Mrs Sandland took charge of them for five or six hours.

Night Reaping.  H.E. Bradtke, a farmer near Albury NSW, has been making successful trials of the use of electric lighting on his header to enable night reaping.  He has done in 5½ days the work of 8.

Jack Finch, the youngest son of William Finch, got his foot caught in the harvester, smashing his big toe etc. on Saturday.

Will Hardy of Drew & Crewes had his leg broken on Sunday when knocked down and trodden on by one of their horses.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic was held on Mr B.C. Sandland’s property at Sod Hut.  Mr I.J. Warnes again lent his lorries and driver, Mr Laver.  Sports were organised.  Although the men went to fight the fire on Koo-owie, the women stayed on.

Bicycle Races on Monday.  7-mile sprint was won by Syd Kuchenmeister with B. Broad second.  The route was to Heinrich’s Hut on the Adelaide Road.

A 1-mile sprint was won by Jack Broad with F. Allen second.
