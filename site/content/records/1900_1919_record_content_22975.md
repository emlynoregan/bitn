W.T. Truscott writes complaining that Cr Ockenden had advised people only to shop at a certain butcher’s in Kooringa because the others were not inspected by the Town Council.  This is because they slaughter in the District Council area.  Not only is there nothing wrong with Truscott’s meat, but Cr Ockenden has been a customer of Truscott’s for as long as the business has been in the town!
