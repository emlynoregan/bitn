Council then turned to the request that they exchange the Council Depot site next to the Bowling Club for that of the former Bible Christian Church.  Cr Kellaway said he was prepared to exchange the depot, but not for the site suggested, which would be more unsightly and a greater nuisance if used as a depot than the present site.  After discussion the matter was allowed to lapse indefinitely.
