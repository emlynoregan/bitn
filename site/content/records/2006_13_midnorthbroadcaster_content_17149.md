A Burra Menswatch Committee headed by Burra farmer Bill Stockman has been set up in the district in response to the number of men taking their own lives in the area.  The first program is sponsored by Princess Royal and Les Warnes and will be held in the Burra Complex.  It will give three nights of training in skills and knowledge to take out into the community.
