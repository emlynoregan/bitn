Florence Scroop also writes to take up the ‘Hoodlum’ remark.  She has a husband, two daughters, one sister, three brothers, two sisters-in-law and a son-in-law who are members of the Aberdeen Tennis Club and she defies Mr Stan Woollacott or anyone else to class any of these persons as a hoodlum.  ‘He should be made to publicly apologise.’
