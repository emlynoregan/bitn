Country Public Houses.  A letter to the editor says that while there are many good country hotels, far too many are terrible and an efficient system of inspection is badly needed.  Relying on the police is not a good system because circumstances often mean the police have to eat at hotels and the nature of their business also means they frequently need to develop a relationship with licensees in order to obtain information etc.  This compromises their ability to also be inspectors of the premises.

All too often the only interest of the licensee is in the bar trade and accommodation for travellers and the travellers themselves are only seen as nuisances.  There is often an absence of cleanliness in bedrooms, sitting rooms and table appointments.  One does not penetrate the kitchens and it would be unwise to do so.  The horses fare as badly, with dirty stables and poor provender.  The ostler is too often merely a hanger-on from the bar, or a loafer picked up on the cheap.  Closets are generally simply disease traps.
