Burra Town Council, 4 December

Council decided it was not in favour of superannuation at present.

A.R. Downer MHR will support efforts to improve the Black Springs Road.

A letter will be sent to the Peterborough Council seeking their support for improvements to the Black Springs Road.  Another letter on this subject will be sent to the Broken Hill Council.

The War Memorial Committee asks Council to consider guaranteeing interest payments on capital outlay for a new main to Victoria Park.  It was decided to let this lie on the table.

Fire breaks are to be burnt around the rubbish dump at the rear of Victoria Park.

The constitution drafted by the Pictures Committee was adopted.
