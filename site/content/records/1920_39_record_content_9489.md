Charles Coppers aged 26 was struck by lightning on Friday afternoon while on a stripper at Cappeedee.  At first he was believed to be dead: his shirt was on fire and his face and body blackened, but after 10 minutes he stirred and others then applied artificial respiration for about half an hour.  They could not get him to hospital before c. 9.30 p.m.
