Stock Brands.  All brands will be cancelled from 31 December.  The existing register has been used for over 40 years and is difficult to interpret because of the number of cancellations and transfers and there is a problem with many brands not being officially transferred.  Persons wishing to keep their existing brand need to write to the Registrar of Brands or complete a form and lodge it before the end of the year.
