The SA Mining Association

The Association presented its Fourth Annual Report and a statement from the Board of Directors to shareholders at the General Meeting on Wednesday last.  Both were intelligible, candid and satisfactory.  Though an early resumption of handsome dividends is not promised, it is shown to be very likely.

Financial soundness has been re-established and when arrangements have been settled with the Smelting Co. a new career of prosperity can be expected.  From what we can infer the arrangements with Messrs Schneider & Co. of the extensive smelting works near Burra Burra, now partially in operations, will prove highly beneficial to both parties.  The Association will furnish the Smelting Co. with 10,000 tons of copper ore, of 15-25% produce, during the first year of the contract, and 30,000 tons annually for the following six years, provided so much be raised.  This will allow the Association to export the richer ores, should it be found advisable to do so, while providing a vast market at their door for the ores of which the percentage is not such as to bear the heavy transport costs.  They will deliver the ores and take as payment merchantable copper at a price proportioned to the current market value.  Some have criticised the long term commitment made, but some such arrangement was surely needed to convince the smelting company to invest their capital and skill in the vicinity of the Associationâ€™s mine.  Consequently the amendment endorsing the contract was carried by a large majority.
