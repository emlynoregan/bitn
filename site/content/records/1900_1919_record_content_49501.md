A Scandalous Proposal.

Parliament has passed an Act demanding the closure of German Schools in SA by 31 December next.  Now the Education Dept. intends to hire German teachers provided they are qualified and attest their allegiance.  ‘It will be justified calling a public meeting of protest if this latest and most scandalous proposal is allowed to come into force.’
