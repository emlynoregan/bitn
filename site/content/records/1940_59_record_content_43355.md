The Minister of Agriculture advises amendments to the Bushfire Act that will soon provide penalties for owners of any vehicles driving through or near inflammable material without a spark arrester.  A filled knapsack spray will also have to be carried.  Council have asked that only oil-burning locomotives be used in the fire danger period.
