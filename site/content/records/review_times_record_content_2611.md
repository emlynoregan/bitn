Greg Drew, a geologist from the Department of Mines & Energy, presented an illustrated talk to about 40 people at a National Trust social evening.  He spoke on his recent visit to the tin and copper mining areas of Cornwall.  He said that Burraâ€™s pumphouses were probably in a better condition than the hundreds in grey granite in Cornwall.  The Burra Mine had been virtually untouched for [almost] a century before the Samin Company re-opened the mine in 1969.  Branch President Mrs Wright said the old open cut had been quite picturesque with the pool being used as the local swimming hole.  Mr Drew had slides of the old open cut and of the old chimney before its relocation at the mine entrance and the blowing up of its associated pumphouse.  Mrs Wright said the stone from the pumphouse had been used in other restoration work around the town.  Mr Drew led a tour of the mine the next day.  About 40 people took part.  Mr Drew said it was a myth that the round chimneys were built by Cornishmen and the square ones by Welsh.  He had proof that the square chimney at the mine site was built by a Cornishman.  The tour included the buddle pits and the smelting area.
