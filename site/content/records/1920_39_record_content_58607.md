Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 16 November

The tunnel across Lean’s Hill advanced to 60 ft.  Not much is expected until the tunnel is under the open cut 90 ft in from the face.

Farnden’s Hill.  The open cut has been sunk to 19 ft.  A small shoot of gold-bearing ore was taken out 12 ft from the surface.  Gold is showing by pan test in the face and floor of the open cut.

There will be 15 tons of ore for the battery when it can take it – estimated at 2½ to 3 oz including tailings.
