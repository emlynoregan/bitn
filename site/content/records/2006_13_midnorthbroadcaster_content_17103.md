A Burra Menswatch Committee has been established after a group of men in the district became concerned about the number of men taking their own lives in the area.  It is headed by Bill Stockman and has raised funds for three suicide prevention programs through its Ski for Life event earlier in the year.  The first will be sponsored by Les Warnes and Princess Royal and will involve three nightsâ€™ training.  The program develops skills to help people watch for and identify other men who are struggling.  It aims to help them in their times of need, to provide skills to know how to refer someone for professional help and what to do if someone you know says they are thinking about taking their own life.
