Another yard some 203 acres in size is walled in stone and contains the timber used in the Mine and copper received from the Smelting Works.

On top of the surrounding hills may be seen the flues of the different engines and also the magazine, containing usually five or six tons of powder.

Schneider’s Engine is a beautiful piece of workmanship, made by the Perran Co., large Cornish manufacturers.  It has an 80 inch cylinder with a 12 foot stroke.  The steam is supplied by three boilers.  The fuel used is wood and coal together.  The engineer, Mr Congdon, was formerly engaged in the South Carron Mine near Liskeard and came to Australia as the Chief Engineer of the steamer Omega. In the week ending 10 March the engine performed 71,196 strokes and raised 9,682,656 gallons.  The water is conveyed by troughs and cuttings for the convenient washing of the ore and eventually finds its way into the Burra creek, of which it makes a complete rivulet.  The water, as it comes from the Mine is perfectly clear and wholesome, but that usually used for drinking is generally drawn from wells about 60 ft deep.

Our correspondent was arrayed in proper dress and accompanied by Captains Henry Roach and Richard Goldsworthy, ventured underground.  Both Captains are Cornishmen, the former from Redruth and the latter from Bodmin.  They have been at the Mine for 9 and 8 years respectively.  Captain Roach went from England to Columbia in 1832 as a miner for the Bolivar Co.  He became Captain in 1834 and continued in that position till 1842, when he returned to England.  He came to Sain 1846 in the Hooghly and was almost immediately engaged at the Burra Mine.

The party descended by ladder in Waterhouse’s footway for four fathoms and then through various galleries, passing Peacock’s No. 1 & No. 2 shafts and reaching Schneider’s engine shaft at the 20 fathom.  There the 20 inch plunger makes the second lift, the lower plunger having raised the water from the 40 fathom.  They then descended to the 30 and 40 fathom levels by Peacock’s ladder winzes.  In the latter the deeper plunger works.

They then visited the various galleries and shafts on the 40 fathom level, which is kept dry by another level running from Schneider’s to Roach’s and called the deep 40, two fathoms lower.

Ayer’s No. 2 shaft has a level at 50 fathoms containing malachite, but nothing is doing in it at present below the 40 fathom level.  The shaft itself is sunk 5 fathoms deeper (the deepest miners have so far gone) and there are now 10 fathoms of water in it, which will be pumped out by the No. 2 engine.

Then they returned to the 30 fathom level by Ayer’s ladder winze.  It is at that level and the 40 that the principal work is going on at present.  At the 30 there are many galleries as well as Kingston’s, Graham’s and several other shafts.  The tributers here seem to be doing well.  The 20 fathom may be reached by Graham’s ladder winze, which also conducts to the 12, the 6 and the surface.

[The article them reports on current operations in each shaft.]

The number of hands currently engaged on underground and surface work is about 450.

The effects of allowing the water to rise were greater than many may have imagined.

Most of the 30 and 40 fathom levels were blocked up with soft slush at least breast high.  All that had to be removed.  The wooden slabs were generally forced inwards, so that the greater part of the mine has had to be fresh timbered.  About 20 or 30 men are still engaged in preparing slabs for this purpose.

The average of the ores now being raised does not exceed 20%, though some in the 40 fathom level is far richer.

The company’s property around the Mine has a very desolate and barren appearance.  It has lately been entirely denuded of trees by order of the Directors, who finding they could not preserve them from depredation, determined on using them at once.

The present high prices of provisions militate against the successful working of the Mine.  The lowest wages upon which the men can live and the high transport costs mean that profits are less than in former times.  There are no sulphurets in the Burra Mine, or the ore might be reduced to regulus.  The only course that can be pursued with the lower grade ores is to smelt them in the colony.  This has been done for some years at the neighbouring smelting works, but the high cost of fuel is a great discouragement.

A walk around the smelting works shows them to be in a lamentable state of inactivity due to the want of labour.  Of the nineteen furnaces capable of smelting 80-90 tons of rough copper per week and which have at times turned out 95 tons, only five are presently at work.  The rest do not have men to attend them, nor at present are there men to cart the fuel to support them.  Only four or five furnaces have been in use, and those for only four months of the year during the past two years.  The want of men is somewhat surprising as steady men have been receiving 30/- to 35/- per week.  As a result about 6,000 tons of copper ore are lying idle.  No wonder, when we find that instead of the 1,000 men whom the Smelting Company at one time employed, there are nor only 200 including carters.  Formerly 400 teams were yoked up and the number of bullocks was 3,500.  At that time employment could have been found for 600 teams.

The establishment is in every way complete in itself.  There is a 35 stall stable, but the beasts of burden now principally used are mules, of which the Smelting Company has at present a stud of 470.  These are chiefly worked in shaft and 10 of them are able in eight days to carry three tons of ore or copper to Port Wakefield and to return with a similar quantity of coal.  They are able to average three trips per month.  200 mules arrived lately by the Malacca, from South America and all are in perfect working order.  The Smelting Co. has 12 wagons weighing 18 cwt each.  These were built upon the ground and 50 more with suitable harness have been ordered from England.

The Company has been lucky in holding a large stack of last year’s hay.  About 100 of 175 tons remain.

Each furnace consumes from £120 to £130 worth of coal per week.  There are at present about 1,200 tons of coal and patent fuel on the ground and the stock is being constantly replenished from Port Wakefield.

The only skilled work is in the maintaining the fires and the drawing off the slag without wasting copper.

Sixteen Chilean labourers have recently arrived, making in all 22.  These with a few women and children form a happy-looking little community.

At present from 120 to 130 tons of ore per week are being smelted, yielding an average 23% copper.  The principal fluxes used are iron with manganese and lime.  The former are found within 10 miles of the works.

The large consumption of fire bricks had induced the Company to make them on the spot and an excellent supply of fire-clay has been found, at a distance of 10-15 miles on the Murray Flats.  A 40 horse-power condensing engine has been erected, with two pairs of rollers, for the purpose of crushing the clay and old bricks and there are suitable workshops, kilns etc. for carrying on the work.  The same engine crushes the fluxes.

The establishment includes a general store, a weighbridge, smiths,’ wheelwrights,’ and saddlers’ shops etc.  As an example of the shortage of labour; for some time only two wheelwrights could be obtained, though there was a need for twenty.  The two were earning nearly £1 a day each.

Mr Williams, the Manager, has a commodious residence, with tastefully arranged garden adjoining the Company’s offices.  There are several houses for the Company’s agents and at a short distance is springing up a little township called Llwchwr, where allotments have been sold to workers at £5 per acre.

The Smelting Company, known as the English & Australian Smelting Co., began operations in the colony in 1849 and to the end of 1854 had smelted 7,597 tons of fine copper, the average value of which can be taken at £95 per ton.  The present price is £120.  During the same period it has shipped 21,000 tons of ore and consumed 27,000 tons of coal.  In the six months commencing October 1851 the amount of cartage between Burra and Port Wakefield was about 10,000 tons each way.  (About 10,300 tons of coal up and 9,600 tons of ore down.)  During the season which may now be considered at an end the quantity has been about 3,000 tons each way.  The 70 miles of the Port Wakefield Road have been kept in repair at the Smelting Company’s expense, with but a solitary grant of £500 from the Central Road Board.  The total traffic which has passed over it during the last five years has been 48,730 tons or an average of more than 9,700 tons per annum.
