Prohibition Campaign.  There is a report of a meeting held on 4 February chaired by Mayor A.B. Riggs and addressed by Hon. W.F. Finlayson.  The Mayor had long advocated temperance, but thought that prohibition was unlikely to succeed at present and that other reforms should come first.  He spoke in support of 1 o’clock closing on Saturdays.  He regretted the demise of the local Bands of Hope.  Finlayson’s address is reported in over 1 column.
