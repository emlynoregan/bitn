F.H. Burslem, Surveyor of Morphett Street, Adelaide, 2 September, writes on the Northern Districts.

[Burslem begins by saying he was retained by the SA Mining Association to investigate a possible railway route to the Burra Burra Mine, while taking into account the desirability of opening as much land to public competition as was possible and also considering the best route to facilitate branch lines to other mines etc. along the way.  As a consequence of this experience, he disagrees strongly with Mr Chauncey’s proposal, at least as deduced from his description; a viewing of the plans not as yet being possible.]

Chauncey’s route goes too far west of Gawler.  He had also better crossed near the junction of the Light and the Gilbert and then to the Gilbert up the valley and over a low saddle to the Wakefield, and then over another low rise to the endless flat.  This line offers no engineering difficulties at any point and throws open a great deal more available land than his proposed route.

It is a matter of surprise that he stops short of Kooringa.  The impression generally was that the line would run to Kooringa, it being generally acknowledged that no line would pay without the traffic to and from that neighbourhood.

The Mining Gazette of 31 August confirms my views, though the writer there has not discussed the line proposed by Mr Chauncey.  All those to whom I have spoken on the subject agree.

[Burslem also dismisses the likelihood that artesian wells will supply the needed water along the route.]
