Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF will celebrate its centenary next Saturday.  A social will be held and has had an overwhelming response.  The original eight members in March 1849 were:

Thomas Jones	James Thompson	William Coate

John Dixon	William Williams	John Bennett

Charles Ware	G. Stewart

The first Noble Grand Master was Bro. Kemp of Adelaide and J. Thompson was first secretary.

There are now about 400 members and a junior lodge.  The present spacious and well-appointed lodge hall in Burra North was built in 1933.  Mr P.W. Hogan is the present financial secretary.  There will be a Juvenile Sports Meeting Picnic at Burra North Playground on Saturday afternoon.
