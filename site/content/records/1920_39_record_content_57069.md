Mr & Mrs Fred Dew celebrated their Golden Wedding on 19 July.  It took place 19 July 1885 at the residence of the bride’s parents, Mr & Mrs James Cullen of Hampton.  The couple lived first at Hampton, but on the death of Mr Dew’s father they went to live at the old family home, Bluebell Farm, at Springbank, where they remained till 1923.  Mr Dew then retired from farm life and they made their home at Redruth.  Mr Dew has always had a keen interest in the Show Society.  Three daughters attended the celebrations:

Mrs Elliot Wise of Jervois

Mrs Arthur Przibilla of Strathalbyn

Mrs Bob Motherall of Hanson

Two sons were unable to attend due to distance:

Gordon (Bob) of Konnongoringa WA
