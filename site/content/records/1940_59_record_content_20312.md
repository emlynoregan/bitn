Obituary.  Mr Tom Ford, and old resident of Burra was going to a meeting of the Retired Railway Officers Association in Adelaide on Tuesday afternoon and was asking directions of a policeman at the corner of King William and Hindley Streets, when his heart failed and he dropped dead.  He was the son of the late Mr & Mrs Frank Ford of Burra and was born here 71 years ago.  He worked and lived here as a railway ganger and was later district foreman at Mile End.  He married Miss Gracie Collins at Burra, a step-sister of Mrs S. Kellaway.  While living in Burra he was a great supporter of the old Aberdeen Football Club.  Later he was transferred to Birdwood and did a lot of patriotic work there during WWI and played a large part in the erection of that townâ€™s war memorial.  He was buried at West Terrace cemetery and is survived by his widow, two daughters; Mrs Jacobs of Semaphore and Mrs Letton of Renmark and one son, Mr W.V. Ford of Hilton.  There are six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.  [Thomas Pedlar Ford.  BISA evidence suggests he was born in England and came to Burra as an infant.  He died 30 January 1945 at Adelaide, residence Mile End.]
