Burra Mayors.  There is a ¾ column article in the form of a humorous mock Biblical text outlining the ‘reigns’ and times of the Mayors of Burra to date, by ‘Aquarius’.  The following summary can only give a bit of a taste of the original.  The article is headed ‘Copperopolis’.

In the days when copper mining ended came one Lockyeri of the tribe of Breweryites.  He was elected Chief of the Great Council.  [His achievements are listed.] He paid the men of the Psaraan for making bridges and ‘commanded the men of the Psaraan to build a great wall round a plot of ground for the tribe of the Recreationists which ground is known to this day as the White Elephant.’

In his second year he sent out spies to seek water, but before they could report he was replaced by Brummitti, son of White Chokeri of the tribe of Sawbones.  He commanded Jobson the chief of the tribe of Aquaites to make water channels and cause it to flow from tent to tent.  He caused trees to be planted.  In turn he was replaced by Dunstani son of Wapstrau of the ironheads and timbersides.  He was the first native born to be made Chief of the Great Council.  He summoned Jobson and said make more water channels so that the children of the hilltops may no longer cry out for water.  He called Bismarki the strong and commanded him to plant trees in the street.  Then came Packardi, son of Parsoni, of the tribe of Lawyerites, to be replaced in turn by Holderi a scribe, son of Inkslinger of the tribe of Printerites, who declared ‘I will make trees grow in the rocky ground and will call the place Jubilee Avenue.  Then did come Killicoati the squatter, son of the great Chief Copperitus and had flocks and herds, but he forgot the doings of the kings who had reigned before him and the wise men of the Great Council said we will no longer gather the taxes from the people, but send our servants to the Great King called mighty Catt, who doth rule over the tribes of the north and south and east and west and ask him to collect the taxes from the people.  An Mighty Catt did so and increased the taxes fourfold which made the people wroth and they sent three wise men from them to the King and one of them from among the people, Ridgwayi by name, a great speaker, ‘bowed down to the King and said people no longer want thee O King to gather the water taxes, but command that the shekels may be made less in number and we will do it in thy stead.’
