Burra Town Council, 2 October

The Masonic Lodge was granted the use of the Council Chamber on the night of the Installation Ball, for the convenience of distinguished guests.

The Ministers Fraternal sought some Council finance towards the cost of a Thanksgiving Service when hostilities in Europe cease.  The Mayor thought this was premature.

The other Councillors disagreed and it was decided to pay half the cost of necessary printing.

Mr Opperman wrote asking Council to forego his rates if he looked after the garden in [St] Dye St.  Granted.

£1-1-0 was granted to the Minda Home Appeal.

Burra Institute Committee wrote saying subscribers have approved the sale of the Institute to the Council.  The consent of the Minister & secretary of the Institutes’ Assoc. will now be sought.
