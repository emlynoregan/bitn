Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports.  A successful meeting was held on 26 December at Victoria Park.  A shower of rain about 11 a.m. cleared the air and a day favourable for sports followed.  The committee had much trouble to prepare the bicycle track this year, but with judicious expenditure they made it rideable.  The gate takings of £48-8-0 were up on recent years.  Secretary was H.W. Pearce, F.J. Carey was President, and the judges were W. Neville & C. Fuss.  M. Rabbich was starter.  The results are printed.  [The day was dominated by the cycle events.]
