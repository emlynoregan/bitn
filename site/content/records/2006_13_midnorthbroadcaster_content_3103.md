Goyder Council, April

Council gave the National Trust 30 days to provide a copy of the final draft of the lease and joint venture agreement of the Burra Passport product.

Council resolved to make SBS television available in Burra and allocated $2,500 for technical advice and will seek a grant towards a maximum cost of $18,000 for the project.

An extra $110,000 will be given to the evaporation ponds construction project.  Council will take out a loan up to $300,000 dollars for ten years to cover upgrading of the Burra Community Waste Management System.

Council is investigating connecting the remainder of households in the southern end of Burra to the existing service and also the costs of a separate system for Burra North.
