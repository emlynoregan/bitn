Burra Burra DC, 5 January

A request to the SAR to use oil burning locomotives has received the response that due to rising oil prices their locomotives are being re-converted to coal.

Passenger locomotives have a greater potential to start fires because they develop a greater percentage of their horse power.  Oil burners will continue to be used for passenger trains.

G.S. Hawker advises that at this stage it seems Burra and Booborowie are likely to benefit from any duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline.
