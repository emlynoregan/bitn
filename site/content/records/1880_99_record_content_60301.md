Cr W.T. Rabbich was given a farewell at the Institute on 14 July.  He received an illuminated address signed by over 80 citizens and another from his Council colleagues.  The Mayor was unavoidably absent and Mr A. Harris presided.  Mr Harris made a few well-chosen remarks, having known Mr Rabbich nearly 20 years and found him ‘pushing and energetic and at the present time Burra could ill-afford to lose one of its residents of so much importance.’  He was sure that if Cr Rabbich had been as well known outside Burra as he was in it, he would have won a seat at the last House of Assembly elections.  [The texts of the illuminated addresses are printed.]
