Postal Employees Picnic

A picnic for postal employees and their families was held at Gum Creek Station over the weekend.  Most official and non-official post offices between Terowie and Saddleworth were represented and a bus load came from Clare.  Total attendance was about 120.  A committee from the Burra office organised the event.  Mr J.A. Stewart, Burra Postmaster, welcomed all and hoped it might become an annual event.  Not only was it an enjoyable day in itself, but it enable the renewing of old acquaintances and the forging of new ones.  Other speakers expressed their thanks to the organisers and gave their views of the value of such outings.  A sporting program was carried out in the afternoon, the results of which are printed.
