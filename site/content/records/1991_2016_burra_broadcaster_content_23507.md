Burra Mine

The National Trust has secured a World Wildlife Fund/National Heritage Trust Grassy Ecosystems Grant to help conserve and manage the unique biodiversity of the patch of grassland on the Mine Hill.  This diverse area includes many native grasses, lilies, daisies and other forms of vegetation.  The grant will assist the Trust to undertake a botanical survey and mapping.  A field botanist will be employed to carry out the research and field surveys.  This will produce a species list and maps showing the condition of the vegetation, the plant communities and species composition, including species of conservation significance, and management zones.  This will lead to an action plan to guide management decisions.  A draft interpretive nature trail will be designed for use by school groups and the community. The last aspect of the grant is to help provide modest support for further research by subsidising travel funds and accommodation for a postgraduate student.
