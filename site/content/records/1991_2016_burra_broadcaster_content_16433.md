Fire.  MFS & CFS units were busy in Burra last weekend with two house fires.  The first was in Crowan Street, Burra North on Saturday 4 July.  The house has back to back fireplaces and it is thought bricks between the two fell away, allowing fire to fall through into the other room and ignite materials there.  There was extensive smoke and water damage to the two front rooms.  The sole occupant suffered from smoke inhalation.

On Monday 6 July a timber framed farmhouse near Mt Bryan, the home of Andy and Robyn Thomas, was extensively damaged by fire.  The origin seems to have been from an inbuilt slow combustion heater and the fire spread through the ceiling space.  The fire was confined to the eastern end of the home, but heat, smoke and water damage was extensive.  [Photo.]
