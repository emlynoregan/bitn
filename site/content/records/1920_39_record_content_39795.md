Rev. J.C. Jennison writes to the Mayor as Secretary of Historical Memorials Committee which is preparing for the stateâ€™s centenary in 1936.  He urges Burra to consider how to celebrate and draws attention to the importance of the discovery of copper there on 19 May 1845.  The committee aims to supply necessary historical information and advice.  The committee has recommended a Centenary Period for events from 27 July 1936 (the Buffalo arrived at Nepean Bay Kangaroo Is. 27 July 1836) to 28 December 1936 (Proclamation Day).  If the Council will pass a similar resolution organisation can begin.
