Burra Racing Club’s Autumn Meeting was very successful.  The gate was up on the previous meeting with about double the number of entries in the races.  The course was in good order, if a little dusty in part (because the guarantors of the old club had sold the water pipes).  It is intended to have two meetings a year.  The main race was the Burra Handicap won by W. N. Brodie’s b.g. Collector ridden by F. Brodie.
