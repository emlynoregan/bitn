Burra School Board.  The Board has been visiting country schools under its care.  Miss Snell and the 16 children under her care were seen at Daviestown [Hanson].  At Leighton there were 32 children under Mr Angove in a wooden classroom that was all too small to accommodate them.  Repairs etc. are badly needed.  Miss Willow had 37 children at Copperhouse.
