Aberdeen Tennis Club held a Victory Ball in the Burra Town Hall to celebrate winning the Premiership for the 1947-48 season.  The Catherine Orchestra provided the music and Mr G. Heinrich was MC.  The Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston presented the shield and also congratulated the club on gaining a 21-year lease on the reserve where the courts are located.  Mr Marston was pleased that this would enable the club to carry out improvements there.
