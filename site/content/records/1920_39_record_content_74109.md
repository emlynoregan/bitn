Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight to 25 February.

Adit extended to 140ft in hard quartzite.  Discontinued.

Now driving south 8ft on a 9” face towards old workings.

Will have to sink a winze with intention of hauling through to the old workings for ventilation.

Also started drive north 7ft on 9” face.  Will drive about 20ft and sink a winze to try for another slate bed.
