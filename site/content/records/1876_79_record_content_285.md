Burra District Council, 4 July

John Humphries was elected as Councillor for Redruth Ward and Robert Stevens as Councillor for South Ward.

‘Nemo’ writes about the Burra District Council Election.

He says the election of Councillors and auditors last Monday must be invalid.  Notice for nominations was given only four days before and under the District Councils Act No. 10 1858, ten days’ notice is required.   Furthermore notice is required to be placed in the SA Government Gazette and by posting hand written or printed bills on every post office and pound in the district.  Notices had only been placed at the Kooringa Post Office.  The remedy under clause 24 was to hold another meeting and under clause 33 if this were not done within 14 days, a JP may give public notice of and call such a meeting.

[Nemo then goes on to elaborate on the complications caused by the declaration of the Burra Town Council and the consequent changes (yet to be gazetted) to the District Council of Burra.]
