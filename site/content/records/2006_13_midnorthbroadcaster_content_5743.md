The Burra Cemetery

The headstone of the man who gave his name to Robertstown is to be repaired more than 100 years after his death.  The project is part of other works at the cemetery, which is eligible for assistance from the Council’s Heritage Fund and from the State heritage Fund.

John Roberts was a storekeeper who traded from a wagon and then in 1874 opened a village post office.  The mail was stamped ‘Roberts Town’ and this evolved into Robertstown.

[The article contains mention of Emu Flats, Apoinga and Emuville and seems to imply they were the same town, when they were quite separate entities.  Oddly the accompanying photograph shows the headstone already repaired.

John Robert’s obituary in the Burra Record, 24 May. 1893 gives a neater summary of his life:

Mr John Roberts, a very old Burra resident died last Saturday.  He came to Burra in 1850 and carried on a grocery business for several years.  He moved to Robertstown about 26 years ago and set up a store there.  That town is named after him.  He died from mortification setting in following cutting his toenails.  The funeral was largely attended in the Kooringa Wesleyan Church with Rev. R.S. Casely officiating.

He died 20 May 1893 aged 76.]
