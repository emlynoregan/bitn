‘Welcome to Burra’ night was held in the Town Hall last Saturday and attracted about 150 old and new residents.  Old residents were given black name tags and new were given red ones.  With food and drink supplied people mingled in a convivial manner.  Lisa Murphy welcomed everyone and showed the ‘Welcome’ folder, which was given to new residents.    Steve Kerrigan spoke as CEO of the Goyder Council and Craig Wilson spoke as CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board.  Four Burra Councillors attended.
