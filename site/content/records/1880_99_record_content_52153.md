SAMA’s Assessment

In the court case where SAMA appealed against the assessment the Association gave evidence via Mr W. West, that the property in question was earning only £50 p.a. from mining plus £50 p.a. from depasturage and the outside value of the land would be £3 per acre for 382 acres.  But the engine and workshops were included.  Mr Bartholomæus had assessed the property at £20,000 in 1890, giving an annual value of £500.  In current terms he felt it was about £2,500 less.  In 1885 J.D. Cave had assessed it at £1,000 and there was no appeal then.  The valuation was upheld.
