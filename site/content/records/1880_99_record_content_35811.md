Mr Egeson predicts that seasons in the late 1880s, being similar to those of 1823-24 and 1825 being very wet, as were the early months of 1826, then we may find that as in 1827, 1890 is the beginning of a prolonged drought.  The drought of 1827-29 followed a very wet period and so did the drought of 1837-39.  A drought may then be expected from mid-1890 to 1893.
