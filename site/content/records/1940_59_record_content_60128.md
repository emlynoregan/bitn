Superphosphate.  Further complaints about ironware contamination are cited.  One farmer had £14 worth of repairs and time lost after three ⅜ inch and one ½ inch nut tried to get through the cogs of his drill.  Also the super was setting as hard as a rock in the bags and had to be broken with a sledge hammer.  Old super, up to four years old, was still soft.
