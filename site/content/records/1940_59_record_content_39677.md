Burra RSL

When the RSL decided upon new Clubrooms, an appeal was made to people of the district to donate to the cause and the RSL promised to place a record of those donations on display in the Clubrooms.  A dinner was held last Saturday evening to mark the second anniversary of the opening of the Burra RSL Clubrooms and about 200 returned men attended.  The promise of a record of those who donated was kept then with the presentation of an illuminated scroll bearing all the names of donors.  The artist was Mr Norman Potter of Adelaide, who has done the work as a gesture of appreciation to the returned lads.  Arrangements will now be made to have the scroll suitably mounted and placed in the main hall of the Clubrooms.

The dinner and toasts are reported in about ½ column.  On a sadder note, The President, Mr M.G. Dobson had to be farewelled.  Mr A.L. Bence was visibly moved as he outlined Mr Dobson’s contribution to the branch over a period of years and he made a presentation of a well-filled wallet of notes.

Burra Lawn Tennis Courts were opened last Saturday afternoon.  Since the war a number of attempts have been made to open the courts, but each till now had failed, with some contending they were beyond repair and that the club would not be able to raise the funds required.  A small committee has persisted and after a great deal of weeding, rolling and mowing eventually three courts have been made fit for play and it is hoped all five will be in playing condition next season.  Much is due to the efforts of the Secretary, Mr L.P. Bence.  Dr R.C. Heddle, President of the Club, commended the work of the Secretary and the Committee, asked the Vice-President Mr M.G. Dobson to hit the first ball over the net and then declared the courts open.
