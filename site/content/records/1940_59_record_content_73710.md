Salvation Army.  Following six months in the Clare and Burra District Lieutenant J. Cutts has been moved to Pt Augusta to be replaced by 2nd Lieutenant E. Wilson who will also reside at Clare.

The Holden Ball organised by Messrs L.L. Fiebig Ltd to aid the Burra Hospital was extremely successful on Friday.  Door takings were £95 and an auction raised £15.  (All of which it is expected will qualify for Government subsidy.)  Mr M. Lane of5KA was compere.  Reg. Scarborough’s Rhythm Dance Band provided the music.  [Details in ⅔ column.]

Burra Rural Youth has won the 1955-56 Club Service Shield for best support of town and district organisations.  Presidents in this period were Avis Stockman and Malcolm Pettet.
