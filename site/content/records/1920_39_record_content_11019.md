Mrs Annie Howell, well known as ‘Granny’ turned 84 last Friday.  She was born in North Wales, the daughter of John Lewis once a well-known Welsh temperance orator.  She came to Australia first with Lady Bathurst and later made a second visit with her.  This time she stayed in charge of Dr Wheeler.  Receiving a remittance she went to America to marry a cousin to whom she was engaged, but changed her mind, returned and married John Howell.  In the early years of her marriage she visited England seven or eight times, staying for three years the last time.  Mr Howell suffering from malaria, they returned to Australia.  Mr John Howell Sen. settled his son in The Acacias later owned by Sir E.T. Smith.  When his father died her husband took land at Pt Lincoln and later tried sheep farming in the north, but this venture failed.  They spent a couple of years in Adelaide before taking land at Thistlebeds where they lived till 1909 when Mr Howell died.  Mrs Howell lived at Mt Bryan till 1912 when poor health drove her to Kooringa.  She had ten children of whom five survive: G.L. Howell (Manunda Station via Yunta), Harold Howell (WA), Mrs Lethbridge (Jamestown), Mrs O’Connor & Mrs J. Rowe (both of Burra).  ‘Joskin’ (John Lewis Howell) a well-known jockey who died about ten years ago was a son.
