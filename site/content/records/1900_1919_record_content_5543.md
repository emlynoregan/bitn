Obituary.  Edward Gallagher slipped on a banana skin while drunk, fractured his skull, and died.

[But there is no further indication of who this Edward Gallagher was or where he lived.  SA death registrations show no Gallagher dying in 1902.  The closest name is William Galagher who died 4 May 1902 at Avon Downs in the NT.]
