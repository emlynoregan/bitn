References to its operation as a temperance hotel continue through to at least 1894.

The same paper records the destruction of the building by fire 14 March 1916, when it is said to be owned by James Reed and to have then been used as the home of Mrs A. Sara and also in part to have housed the Boy Scouts.  James Reed was a son of Richard Reed.

Mrs A. Sara (1859-1931) was the widow of George Sara (1839-1903) and a sister to James Reed.]
