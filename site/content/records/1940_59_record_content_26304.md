The Governor, Sir Willoughby Norrie spent a week sightseeing  at Mutooroo Station and other outlying areas in the company of Mr & Mrs T.E. Barr-Smith and visited Burra last Thursday evening and Friday morning.  On Thursday evening a civic welcome was extended to the Governor in the Burra Town Hall by the Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott.  A guard of honour was provided by the RSL under the command of Mr M.T. Fuller.

[The Mayor’s address of welcome is printed and also a brief address by the Mayor-elect Mr H.J.B. Jennison, followed by His Excellency’s reply.]

On Friday morning the Governor laid a wreath at the Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square.  Although it was school holidays, a considerable turnout of school children formed a guard of honour and His Excellency stopped to chat with them.

The Governor then visited the Burra Hospital, where he met the board and inspected a guard of honour formed by the nursing staff.  He toured the hospital before having morning tea served by Matron McNeill and then travelled to Mt Bryan.
