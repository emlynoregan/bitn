Vandals in a series of attacks damaged the public toilets in Burra Creek recreation area and set fire to bark chips in the adjacent playground area, smashed a security light near the Kindergarten and broke a school canteen window.

Most concerning, toilet paper was poked through the book return slot at the library and then ignited, but fortunately burnt out.  A rubbish bin nearby was also set alight, but was extinguished by rain.  A youth and a young adult male have been reported for some of the above.
