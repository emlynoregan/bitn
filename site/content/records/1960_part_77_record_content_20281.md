Burra Town Council, 18 May

ETSA will be advised the Council will negotiate the sale of the land they require at valuation price.

It has come to the Council’s notice that the Swimming Pool Committee is withholding £464 of the Filtration Plant contract price and this could interfere with the Government subsidy.  Council will try to arrange a committee meeting as soon as possible.

The Highways & Local Government Department is to be advised that the Council is prepared to make Reserve No. 5 available to them. Council is prepared to negotiate the sale of land to G.R. O’Connor as soon as it is valuated.

Resolved that the matter of a shed for the jinker and other relics be left in the hands of the Mayor.
