Burra Hospital

Tenders for the Nurses’ Home and other renovations closed last Friday.  The Appeals Committee was formed at a public meeting at the Burra Institute in August 1950, when, in preparation for the adoption of any satisfactory rebuilding scheme, a fund raising committee was decided on.  It comprises representatives from Burra Town Council and the District Councils of Burra Burra and Hallett along with representatives of the Eastern Stations.  The Committee has met monthly at the Hospital and is quite separate from the Board.  The plan adopted is for new quarters for nursing staff – a long overdue need.  It will be incorporated into any new hospital scheme, when the room can become private rooms.  An appeal was made to the public for funds.  A comparatively small number of residents have donated almost £10,000.  Trading tables, fetes and dances have contributed too.  A Government grant has been promised.
