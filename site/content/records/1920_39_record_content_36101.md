President is S. Dowling and Secretary E.J. McKenzie.

The club has acquired the court recently owned by the Kooringa Club in Bridge Terrace and they have leased a second court on the same block, but nearer the Black Bridge.  Mr R. Brinkworth opened their first game last Saturday.  Afternoon tea was provided at Mrs E. Bass’s residence which is in close proximity.
