Letter.  Steve Boyes writes opposing the proposal to spend $8 million on a sports centre at Eudunda.  It would, he believes, be more beneficial to invest in promoting tourism, in upgrading Paxton Square and urges people to think about something big that would attract tourists to the whole region and SA generally.
