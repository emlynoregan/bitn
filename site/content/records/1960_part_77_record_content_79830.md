Burra Burra DC

The wall on the downstream side of the Burra Creek dam was not constructed as a walkway.  It was not planned as such and is not envisaged as such in the future.

The trees in the area were not planted to provide an anchorage for ropes swinging over the lake.

The wood supplied for barbecues is not to be removed for other purposes.

Littering is a problem in the creek area.

The Art Galleryâ€™s Travelling Exhibition will be at the Town Hall in Burra on 18 & 19 August.
