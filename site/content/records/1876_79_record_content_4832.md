Burra Town Council. 
Cr Wilkinson asked if the council would do anything about the water supply. 
Cr Batchelor said the article in last Friday’s Record was to the point. 
The Chairman (Cr Bartholomæus in the absence of the Mayor) said most residents in Kooringa were merely tenants and that was a difficulty. Also if the mine started work again all the pipes laid would be useless and they could not get the water for a fixed term. If water was wanted in Market Square it could be left to private enterprise. 
Cr Batchelor said it was often hard to get water from the carters and he often had to carry it himself He did not think private enterprise was the best supply; besides the Govt. had promised a supply, so why not get them to keep their promise. The article in the Record was just what they wanted and many more would take from such a supply if it were convenient and the water carts would get supplies from the standpipe. He did not want anyone else to pay for his water and he was willing to pay 20/- per 1,000 gallons for a regular supply. Cr Geake said something had to be done even last summer there would have been no water for stock if the Council had not cleared the springs. 
Cr Sara said if mains were laid either all would have to pay or the Council would. The Chairman thought that at Pt Augusta the charge was 20/- per 1,000 gallons. Cr Sara thought it would be closer to 9/- per 1,000 gallons, whereas now it was 2/- for ‘a very small load.’ 
Cr Wilkinson moved that a letter be sent to the Govt. reminding them of their promise.
