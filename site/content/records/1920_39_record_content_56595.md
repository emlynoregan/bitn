Mongolata Goldfield.  A Review by the Department of Mines

Byles’ Mongolata controls three leases: Byles’ Mongolata, The Golden Harp and Block 8.

Block 8: little work has been done here in the recent period.

Golden Harp.  The lower tunnel has been extended and connected to the upper workings, improving ventilation.  Patches of low-grade ore were passed through in the tunnel.  Best values are being followed in the upper workings.

Byles’ Mongolata.  Work is being extended at 50 & 92 ft levels.  No workable values have so far been found in this work.  The main crosscut west at 92 ft has been driven to a point c. 50 ft beyond the ventilating shaft.  From this crosscut a drive 30 ft long connects with the shaft, making a passage for air.  25 ft west of the airway a formation was cut in the crosscut with traces of gold.  A drive started a little east, and put out 30 ft from the crosscut, met the same formation pinched down to 6 inches wide and a winze, now 10 ft deep, has been started near the face.

Some patches of ore have been broken between the 50 & 92 ft levels south of the crosscut and two men are engaged in prospecting in that section.

136¼ tons of ore were treated at the battery for 103 oz 6 dwt of gold by amalgamation.  Only 25 tons of the tailings from this parcel were treated by cyanide for 8 dwt 18 gr per ton.  The rest assayed at 20 gr and was not treated.

Total tonnage treated from this mine is 1862 tons for a return of 2918 oz.  23 men are engaged in mining operations.

Eastview Mine (Rampton’s).  Three men are engaged continuing the south drive, now at 310 ft and expected to break through to the surface on the south side of the hill.  The last 40 ft is in low grade ore.  25 tons of the old dump have been treated at the battery for 2 dwt per ton.  In total, 144 tons here have produced 252 oz.

Terry’s Mine.  Some driving has produced poor results.  A portion of the shaft timbers have been removed at the 30 ft level and preparations made to re-open an old drive north of the shaft, from which payable ore was won.  25½ tons of underground and dump material has passed through the battery for 5 dwt 16 gr per ton.  In all, 62 tons of ore have been put through the battery from this mine for 51 oz 7 dwt 19 gr.

Mongolata North Area.  [Maps from the Department of Mines show that claims farther north than those mentioned here as the extreme north end, were worked in previous years.]

Reynolds and two men are extending a tunnel close to Terry’s boundary.  Results so far are disappointing.

Mr Feltus, at the extreme northern end of the field, has exposed a ferruginous quartz formation about 14 inches wide, by open cut.  A parcel from this is at the Battery for treatment.

Mr Fayre has abandoned his most northerly working and made an open cut on a small vein adjoining Mr Feltus on the north side of the hill.

Rosewall’s Show, nearby, has a small vein that has been followed into the hill about 40 ft in low values.

Evans & Shipway are working two parallel quartz formations by drive and open cut and have been said to obtain values in panning.

Curlew Mine.  Activity is confined to extension of drives north and south at the adit level.  Some rich patches of ore were encountered, but values are very erratic and all appear to be at one side of the levels.  This property is a very difficult proposition to follow.  Values can only be detected by constant use of the dish.  The main tunnel, in my opinion, should be driven further west to prospect country in that direction, in the hope of picking up veins carrying gold that are known to exist on the surface.  34½ tons of ore were treated recently and returned 2 oz 5 dwt 6 gr per ton and from a total of 226¾ tons treated 736 oz 10 dwt 20 gr of gold have been recovered, plus a considerable amount of specimen gold not put through the battery.

Central Mine. Three men are engaged in driving and the 92 ft level has been connected with the vertical shaft.  Only low grade ore has been found.  10 tons treated returned 6 dwt 7 gr per ton and tailings assayed at 1 dwt 15 gr were not treated.
