BCS.  Staff Profile: Paula Elsegood

I am teaching one of the R-2 classes.  I was trained in Junior Primary Teaching at Magill SACE.  My home was at Ashton, a market gardening area near Norton Summit in the Adelaide Hills.  I am the youngest of five children, having four sisters and one brother [sic!].  I have worked a great deal as a relief teacher in Adelaide and in the Hills Area and last year taught at Bordertown Area School and Coomandook Area School.  I think Burra is by far the biggest and prettiest place I have taught in.  I have a variety of hobbies â€“ anything related to Art and craft, Aerobics, social tennis, squash and badminton, losing my keys and putting things on lay-by.
