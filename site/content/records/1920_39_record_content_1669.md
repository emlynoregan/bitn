Burra Institute.   Only about 11 subscribers came to the meeting.  The idea was to move the back wall of the hall 10 feet out taking in the present ticket office and a portion of what was once the library.  This will increase seating by about 100 seats.  Above that to erect a gallery to accommodate about 80.  Seats are at present 338 and the alterations will bring that to 518.

Also to erect an awning along the front of the building to protect the woodwork.  A side door will be made to give access to the lodge room and the hall will be entirely renovated.  A new ceiling will be placed in the passage.  The lowest tender for the changes is £1,199, plus the cost of new seating to bring total outlay to an estimated £1,500.

The meeting approved the changes, as did a subsequent meeting of the trustees.
