Mr W. Trestrail was in Burra last Friday and despite passing his 84th year on 18 January he was looking remarkably well.  He has a notable record of working 52 years with the Warnes’ family on their various stations; first with Mr T. Warnes, father of Mr I.J. Warnes, then with Mr T. Warnes’ sons as a stockman and boundary rider and now with Mr Reg. Warnes, a nephew of Mr I.J. Warnes, at Woolgangi Station.  This week he celebrates his 52nd year of service with the family.  He is still capable of a few days work with light duties.  He seldom comes into Burra.
