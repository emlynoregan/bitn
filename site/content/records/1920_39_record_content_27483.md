W.H. McWaters writes a 1-column long letter concerning a petition to the Burra DC asking for commonage rights to be restored for six months of the year.  He presented the petition on 6 July to the Council and moved that the wished of the ratepayers therein be granted.  Despite the four men voted in by those same ratepayers being present, he could not get a seconder from either Baldina or King Ward.  Cr Tiver of Kooringa Ward (which has no commonage available) eventually seconded it.  There were no amendments and the motion was put and lost without discussion.  Mr McWaters says that a few years ago he managed commonage for Â£90 and brought in nearly twice that in fees.  Now they earn nothing.
