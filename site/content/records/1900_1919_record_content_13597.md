School Concert.  The Burra School Children will put on an entertainment called Princess Tiny-tot in the Institute tonight.  The concert will raise money for the sewing machine, manual material, and piano funds.  Dr Sangster, as Chairman of the School Board, will preside.

[The title referred particularly to the second half where a host of Nursery Rhyme characters appeared in a Nursery Rondeau.  The first half included some items that would now be very politically incorrect as follows.]

Overture

Third Class to give a gavotte

Fourth Class: the Chinamen

Juniors give a Military Drill

The Nigger Squad will sing Kingdom Coming

Miss Barkley will recite

The gun squad will be put through a gun drill.
