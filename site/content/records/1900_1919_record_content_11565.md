The Burra Record appeared in a new format and with a redesigned masthead.  The old Gothic curved heading was replaced by a straight one over a series of pictures appropriate to a rural area: a horse and bullock, kangaroo, dogs, Morphettâ€™s Engine House, a ram, geese and fowls.  The size of the page decreased in height and to five columns, but there were eight instead of four pages.

A regular feature on page one was a business directory.
