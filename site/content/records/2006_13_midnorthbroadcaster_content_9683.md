Breaker Morant

Petitions for the pardons of Harry ‘Breaker’ Morant and fellow Bush Veldt Carbineers Peter Handcock and George Witton have been referred by Australia’s Attorney General to the British Government for consideration.  Efforts to get their convictions quashed commenced in October 2009 when petitions were lodged with the House of Representatives by Australian Defence Force Lawyer, Commander James Unkles.  Mr Unkles has been invited to appear before the Petitions Committee in Parliament House Canberra and present his submissions on the case for quashing the convictions and granting pardons.  Morant and Handcock were executed on 27 February 1902 at Pretoria, South Africa.
