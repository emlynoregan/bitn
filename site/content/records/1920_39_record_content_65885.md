In the Booborowie district patchy falls varied from 1” to 3” with considerable local flooding, loss of fences and top soil.  The latter problems affected Messrs G. Parker, Godfrey Williams, Jack Williams & Doug. Keynes.  G. Williams was well washed in and his windmill damaged.  Palace Creek about a quarter of a mile north of Booborowie flowed three-quarters full: the highest for several years.  Flooding also occurred at Koonoona, but west end rain was more soaking.  The Burra creek flooded around Mt Bryan on Friday and in Burra there was a brilliant electrical storm between 9 and 10 p.m. on Friday.  Jack Terry was driving some young ladies home when a huge ball of fire hit the roadway in front of them in Thames St by Mr A. Moore’s house.  Grass and feed is springing up rapidly in the pastoral country and already blue and green blowflies and grasshoppers are appearing.
