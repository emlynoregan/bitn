Burra Kindergarten.  A meeting on Tuesday to consider forming a kindergarten in Burra elected a strong committee with Rev. M.P. Cowle as President and C. Fuller as Secretary.  The Mayor presided at the well attended meeting.  Miss Mellor as Supervisor of the Kindergarten Union addressed the meeting on toys used and the work and history of SA Kindergartens.  Fees were not fixed, but parents gave from 1/- to 10/- per week towards maintenance and the Government was assisting financially.  The first requirement was for a suitable building to be found.  In Burra the Scout Hall or the Kooringa Methodist Sunday school were possibilities.  Funds would have to be raised by community effort.  A person of experience would be needed to run it and she suggested that first they set up a Play Group in the charge of an assistant who would receive a six month course of training.  The Kindergarten could grow from that.  A Play Group Assistant’s salary was about £130 p.a. and the course cost £4-4-0.
