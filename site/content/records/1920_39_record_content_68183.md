Obituary.  Mrs Martin nee Rose Jacka, youngest daughter of Mr & Mrs Jacka of Melrose died in Adelaide on Thursday.  When widowed her mother came to Kooringa to live and while they were here Rose married Mr A.G. Martin.  Her son Rex Martin works for Messrs Wilkinson & Co.  The late W.J. Jacka brewer who resided here many years ago was a brother of the deceased.  [Born Rosalie Blanche Jacka 1 March 1871 Auburn: died 9 September 1837 Adelaide, residence Goodwood Park.]

[Of the five brothers readily identifiable none have the initials W.J. so while the above may be correct, it should not be assumed true.]
