Goyder Council

The Council has agreed to facilitate a Working Party to work on short, medium and long term solutions to problems associated with youth activities in the area.

Council will upgrade the Australia Day Honour Board in the Town Hall.

Council staff are investigating the profile of Thomas Pickett for consideration in making a recommendation for his inclusion on the Burra Walk of Fame.

Dennis Hillman kicked two goals from the penalty line on 3 September to win $4,000.
