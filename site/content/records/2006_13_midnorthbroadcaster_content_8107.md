St Mary’s Burra celebrated the 130th anniversary of the laying of its foundation stone on Sunday 28 June.  The church was officially first used for worship in January 1880.  Fr Michael Hillier stood beside the stone to read prayers on Sunday last.  After the service the morning was rounded off with a shared lunch.  [Extracts from E. Fuss’s summaries of the Burra Record concerning the events of 1879/80 are included.]  [Photo of Fr Hillier & crucifer Pam Shipard by the foundation stone.]
