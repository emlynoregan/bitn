The dumping if old car bodies within the town is also a concern.

Council will proceed with a deputation to the Mines Department in regard to Royalties.

No objections were voiced re the proposed damming of the Burra Creek and a loan for this has been negotiated.

Council has granted Samin permission to pump water from the Mine into Burra Creek in order to de-water the Mine.  Water will be conveyed in an 8 inch pipe under the main road near the old Mine entrance.

SA Housing Trust has allowed the Council to fence off part of the new housing settlement on Smelts Road for tree planting.

Walkerville All Cars Club will conduct a rally through the district on 28 & 29 July.

Bridget O’ Connor has entered the Princess of Industry Quest for girls 10-13, in aid of the Home for Incurables.
