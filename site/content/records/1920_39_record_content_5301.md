Initial expenses and upkeep in the first year c. £200.

Cr Radford said water supply was a problem.

The Mayor was strongly in favour.

In the recent fire the ‘alleged’ reel was taken to the fire, but with no way of fastening it to a car someone had to hold it and they had proceeded at the furious pace of 10 m.p.h.

On arrival they had trouble connecting the hose, only to find there was no water.  The present reel might serve the City of Copperhouse!

The Town Clerk was ordered to gather all information.
