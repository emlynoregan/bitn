Court.

There were a series of cases in 1902 involving men not giving proper notice of moving stock or of not moving their stock the required distance.

One trick was to take sheep to market and not be successful at selling them and then walk them back.  One could also arrange to sell them to another family member with like results.  The lack of feed in a bad season no doubt encouraged such ruses.  The lawyers were also involved in finding technical flaws in the documents drawn up etc.
