Market Square – Best Place Changes – Public Meeting

More than 60 residents attended the meeting to discuss the plans that have been on display.  Douglas Alexander, Heritage Adviser led the discussion.  Concerns included the need for trees no to obstruct businesses, better footpaths, improved lighting, better signage and some wanted business façades improved.  Overall they wanted little physical change to the square.  Some better organisation of parking, more colour and some more trees.  Generally people left calmer, with fears of wholesale change allayed.
