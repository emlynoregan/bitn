YMCA.  A delegation from Peterborough came to Kooringa on Thursday to make arrangements with the Provisional Committee for opening work in Burra.  Rev. Lee took the chair.  The delay in getting going was due to a delay in getting the building in Peterborough completed until two weeks ago.  It was decided to organise classes in Burra at once, beginning 9 June.
