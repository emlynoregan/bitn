Bon Accord Bridge.  In February 1891 the Bon Accord crossing occupied the attention of Council.  It is a continuation of the road from the north to the Burra Railway Station and in winter it has been almost impossible to cross the Burra Creek with loads.  The Council prepared a memorial for the Government asking for a bridge.  It was presented to the Hon. T. Playford.  The immediate response was not encouraging, but they kept on about it and eventually the Superintendent of Main Roads, Mr Hargrave, investigated and said a suitable bridge would cost £1,500.  The Government would at first find only £1,000 and the Council decided to go for a year’s main road grant, but Mr Playford thought that inadvisable and eventually found the £1,500.  Messrs Braidwood & Wise were tenders for £1,504.  It has taken longer than expected due to delays in getting ironwork from England. The bridge was opened by the Mayoress, Mrs W. West.  Local MPs, F.W. Holder and G.H. Lake arrived on the midday train for the ceremony.  The Treasurer, Hon. W.B. Rounsevell and Mr Hargrave, the Chief Inspector of Roads and various other dignitaries were present.  Mr Holder gave a speech and then Mrs West Christened the bridge, naming it the Bon Accord Bridge and then Mr West, the Mayor declared it open.  Short speeches followed from Mr Lake, and the Hon. W.B. Rounsevell.
