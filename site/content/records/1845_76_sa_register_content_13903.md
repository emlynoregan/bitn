Burleeyung Cave near Kooringa

This is located about 16 miles south of Kooringa between Mr McDonald’s Cave and the Adelaide Road.  The entrance is on top of a hill and, being insignificant in appearance, might easily be passed by unnoticed.  The mouth is a hole about 5 ft long and 2½ ft wide and some 20 feet deep.  On descending we found ourselves in a tolerable chamber extending about 20 ft to the northwest, the sides and top being of jagged stone and the floor strewn with loose rocks.  At the end of the chamber was a steep slope to the westward.  The roof sloped similarly and was very low, obliging us to lie close to the rock and edge our way some 10 or 12 ft.  We then encountered a passage running north some 20 yards.  In some places we could stand, but in others we had to crawl; an unpleasant experience given the jagged rocks above and below.  This led to a small chamber, which allowed us to stretch out rather more.  Here the top and sides were covered in beautiful white stalactites.  We procured some beautiful examples and proceeded to look into various other chambers via small apertures.  As we proceeded the chambers seemed more beautiful, but the progress grew increasingly difficult and eventually we found the apertures too small to allow further progress.  In all our explorations took an hour and we were glad then to breathe the purer atmosphere and regain the light of heaven.  Every part we visited was perfectly dry; there was no trace of water anywhere.
