Burra Town Council, Monday night.

A letter from the Commissioner of Public Works saying that on application from the Mayor a special grant of £100 had been given.

Cr Lane complained that the Mayor had not been part of the deputation.

Cr McWaters explained that when Cr Lane met the train in Adelaide Mr Crewes had not been there because he had received a wire saying that work had been found for the unemployed at Oodnadatta and there was no need for the deputation.

Cr Lane said he had kept the appointment and had met Mr Butler.  Cr McWaters had been introduced as Chairman of the District Council and the deputation had resulted in a special grant of £200 to the D.C. and £100 to the Town Council.

The Mayor said he had not shirked his duties as a wire had arrived from the Commissioner beginning ‘Deputation Unnecessary arrangements made with the Railway Commissioner . . .’

Cr Lane clearly thought the other Councillors should have attended as the work of the deputation extended beyond the finding of railway jobs.

Cr Radford thought that a public meeting could not appoint Councillors to act: only the Council could do that.

The mayor agreed that strictly speaking the actions of Crs Lane and McWaters were illegal, but he agreed the deputation was not confined to the reinstatement of the men.  The action may have been illegal, but it was a good thing and their action must now be endorsed.

And so it was.
