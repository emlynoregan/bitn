Kooringa Methodist Church.  The new building was opened Saturday 12 December.  The new church has been erected on the site of the old which served for upwards of 60 years.  It is a handsome building.  Designed in English Gothic, it is built in local bluestone, finished with cemented buttresses, dressings and mouldings with spinets.  Inside it is 64’ x 40’ and almost 53’ hight to the top of the external gable.  In front two flights of steps lead to two entrance doors and a fine vestibule.  There is a window either side of the vestibule and a triple window above.  All are glazed with lead-lights in a chaste and beautiful design.  There are six windows on either side.  Two are glazed with lead-lighted memorial windows.  The hammerbeam principals are of red pine and the ceiling of fibrous plaster.  It is well ventilated and acoustically good.  The pulpit & choir platform are in blackwood and at the rear are two vestries.  All is surrounded by a substantial retaining wall and handsome cast-iron railing and cast-iron folding gates to match.  The builders were Messrs J.T. Quinn & Co. of Hamley Bridge and the architects were Messrs Cowell & Cowell of Adelaide.

The weather on Saturday was hot, windy, and dusty.  The Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Way, arrived and the scene was photographed by Messrs Page, Penrose and Muller.

In 1859 Sir Samuel’s father, Rev. James Way, was in charge of the Bible Christian circuit in Burra.  Present also were Rev. Samuel Knight, now of Melbourne, Rev. W.F. James and Rev. G. Hall, the President of the Methodist Conference.  Also the present town ministers, Rev. J.H. Nield and Rev. J.C. Jennison.  The doors were opened by two of the churches oldest workers: Mrs Sleep and Mr William Davey.

Mrs Sleep was a member of the first Wesleyan Church in Burra.  Mr Davey was remembered for being in charge of the services of song in the old Bible Christian Church.  He had been the first organist of the Bible Christian Church and his sons Will & Arthur had succeeded him until the union of the churches.

The two memorial windows were unveiled.  One is to the late Philip Lane – representing the Good Samaritan.  The other is to the memory of Alex. Harris and bears the figure of St Barnabas.

Tea was followed by a public meeting.  In the building of the church £3,315 had been spent and of this £2,451 had been raised by donations and the sale of property which had brought in £700.

Mr Quinn was presented with a bonus of £100 in gratitude for the way he had fulfilled his contract.  Mr Quinn said he was speechless with surprise.  Sir Samuel Way remembered the opening of the Bible Christian Church in 1860.  He related some of the history of the town and hoped Dr Brummitt would do justice to it by writing it up.  The town, he said, was the birthplace or abode of many able men, among them:

Dr Williams – now important in Victoria

The late Dr Stevens – President of the Victorian Conference and General Conference

Dr Burgess – three times President of the SA Conference
