Burra Choral Society has resumed after its recess.  Since its inception in 1949 it has raised £96 and hopes to continue to bring a better class of artists to the town.  President Mrs Jennison was re-elected.  The society hopes to combine with the Clare Gilbert & Sullivan Society to produce Handel’s Messiah either at Clare or Burra or both in December.
