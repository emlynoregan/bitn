The costs were estimated at annual rent of £27, renovation cost spread at £19 p.a. over four years, ongoing maintenance at £15 and the wages of a caretaker of £50 for a total of £111.  This suggested a credit balance of £40-5-9 p.a.

Outside butchers would not be allowed to sell in Burra.

Only meat killed in Burra and inspected by the Burra inspector could be sold in Burra.

Mr Rabbich could see no reason why butchers should not go on killing at their own slaughterhouses and have the meat inspected there.

Cr Williams moved that in the opinion of this meeting it is advisable to take over the old slaughterhouse.

Cr Cox and Cr West supported the motion.

Cr Hardy said he had been a mover for the meeting because the Council had been divided.  The cost of a new slaughterhouse could be as much as £700.

The motion when put was carried unanimously.
