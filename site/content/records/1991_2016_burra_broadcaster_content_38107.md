Goyder Heritage Fund is fully funded once more with the State heritage Fundâ€™s $5,000 being matched by the Goyder Council to total $10,000.  Owners of State Heritage listed properties can apply for assistance for works that conserve their properties.

Changes to the Heritage Act.  The Heritage Act is soon to be known as the Heritage Places Act 1993 and will be supplemented by the Development (Sustainable Development) Amendment Bill 2005, which will make it simpler to change places from State to Local listing.

Goyder Council does not have any Local Heritage Places.  The new system will see the State Heritage Authority replaced by a new SA Heritage Council and the State Heritage Fund by the SA Heritage Fund.  The new Act will contain one central register to include Local Heritage Zones and it can now include movable objects.  Fines for breeches of the new Act have risen to $120,000.

Really nothing changes for Burra because the State Heritage listing covers archaeological sites and artefacts, but will affect the rest of Goyder because a permit will be required for archaeological work anywhere in SA and there will now be reporting requirements for finds.  Trade in artefacts illegally removed will be prohibited.  Currently owners of State Heritage properties can benefit by having a reduction in the valuation of their properties and the new Act extends this to Local Heritage Places.
