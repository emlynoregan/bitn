As we go to press reports are coming in of big rains to the east, with many falls so far between 50 and 110 points.  Koomooloo reports 10 ft in the house dam and Braeside has 4 ft in a dam.  At Collinsville the house dam is full.  At ‘The Gums’ the south paddock dam, which has been dry for months, is now 6 ft deep and King Dam has 9 ft. Hogback is rumoured to have 18 ft in the house dam.  Most phone lines are now out.
