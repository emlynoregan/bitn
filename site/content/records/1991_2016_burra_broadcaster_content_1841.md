Burra Show

Sheep Counting is expected to be a popular event at the Burra Show this year.  Old Burra boy Tom Wardle and Andrew McInnes are both counting in the state championships at the Royal Adelaide Show.

A new competition this year will be the Bon Accord Three-way Sheep Drafting Competition.  Sheep drafters split the sheep into mobs using complicated earmarks, brands etc.  One drafter at Gepps Cross drafts three ways, counts one of the mobs, swears at his dogs and holds a conversation simultaneously.
