Kooringa News, 3 November

Last Thursday there was a violent thunderstorm with heavy rain.  The storm lasted a few hours and the rain fell nearly all night.  The creek ran strongly and continued high for two days, though not doing any damage.

On 27 October the bachelors amongst the tradesmen gave a return ball at the [Burra] Hotel.  Despite the inclement weather there was a large attendance and dancing continued till 6 a.m.

On Tuesday 1 November there was a political meeting at Lamb’s Aberdeen Hotel.  There was a large attendance as it was believed two of the candidates for election would be there to reveal their views.  Mr Simpson was called to the chair and then Mr W. Dale explained that the object of the meeting was to form a branch of the SA Political Association.   He moved a motion: ‘That the meeting pledge themselves not to vote for any candidate who will not give a written pledge to vote against any of the funds of the colony being expended on immigration.’  Mr Tiver seconded.  Carried unanimously.  At the close of the meeting people were invited to come forward to join the Association and a number did so.  It was said a member from the Adelaide branch would attend another meeting to be called in a few weeks.

The Court of Revision sat at the Burra Hotel this week when one name was struck off the roll for the Legislative Council and one from the roll for the House of Assembly.
