Burra Town Council.

There is further on the matter discussed in the 2nd leader.

After the objection of Cr Sampson to the wood account Cr Harris signified his surprise at his conduct and his audacity in opposing the account.  Cr Hardy however, found a clause in the Act and showed it to Cr Harris, to the effect that his seat could be declared vacant if it could be shown he received any benefit from Council.

When the Board of Health’s business had been dealt with Cr Hardy tried to bring forward something concerning the Inspector, but the Mayor said the Board’s business was completed and he would not entertain further reference.

When Cr Hardy persisted the Mayor told him firmly to take his seat and then explained why he had decided not to allow the matter to be brought forward.

Cr Hardy displayed vexation and told the Mayor that he would not be snuffed out by him or anyone else and went on dealing with irrelevant matter, to which the Mayor calmly listened till the speaker completely ran down.  Then His Worship quietly dressed Cr Hardy down and told him bluntly that if he (Hardy) meant what he said in reference to the snuffing out, it was a falsehood; he (the Mayor) claimed to be an impartial chairman.  This remark brought forth hear, hear, from all the councillors, who were of the opinion the castigation was richly deserved.  The Mayor continued to give Cr Hardy words of advice and a lecturette on etiquette and truthfulness, and the meeting adjourned.
