Burra Burra Mine.

Mr J. Ford continues to work his lease at the mine.  The old well between Kooringa and Redruth has been cleaned out and jiggers are at work washing ore, some of which is said to be of good quality.

The bore is proceeding smoothly under Mr Leahy, but there are no startling discoveries yet.
