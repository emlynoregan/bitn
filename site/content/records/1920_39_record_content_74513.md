Rev. & Mrs Tilbrook were accorded a farewell social on 3 April after a term of three years.  Rev. Tilbrook now goes to Archer St Methodist church in North Adelaide.  There was a very large attendance as Rev. Tilbrook had endeared himself to the circuit.  Also following the death of Rev. A. Dyer he took over the Redruth Circuit for nine months and so was close to those at Redruth, Hanson and Ironmine as well as those in the Kooringa Circuit.  So large was the gathering that it was held in the church rather than the Lecture Hall.  Speakers are reported.  They were: Mrs Clem Pearce for the Ladies Guild, Mr H. Jennison as Steward of Redruth Church, Mr W.H. Lloyd for Ironmine Church, Rev. Andrews for Redruth Circuit and Mr J. Drew for the congregation and Sunday school.  Miss G. Pearce read Mr Edgar Pearce’s tribute as Treasurer of the Trust to both Rev. & Mrs Tilbrook and also conveyed the good wishes of the choir in the unavoidable absence of Mr G.E. Dane.  Capt. Prosser spoke for the Salvation Army, Miss Connie Crewes for the Girls’ Club, Mr M.G. Culley for Hanson Church, Mr S. Kellaway as senior steward, Mr C. Pascoe & Mr J.G. Sara also spoke.  Rev. Tilbrook responded giving thanks for the several presentations of the speakers and Mrs Tilbrook also responded.  Mrs Tilbrook received a crystal salad bowl from the ladies of Farrell’s Flat Methodist Church and on Sunday last Rev. Tilbrook received a fountain pen from the congregation.  He was also farewelled by Redruth Christian Endeavour Soc. on Thursday and Mrs Tilbrook was given a pottery vase by the Ladies’ Overseas Auxiliary on Wednesday.
