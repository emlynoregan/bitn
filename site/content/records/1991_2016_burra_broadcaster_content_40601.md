Mr Jay Weatherill, Premier of SA re-opened the restored Burra Railway Station on Tuesday 31 March, following five years of hard work.  The event coincided with a luncheon organised by the State Government as part of their Country Cabinet event.

The station was erected in 1883 to replace the original wooden structure of 1870.  Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986 and the last grain trains ran in January 1999.  The last passenger train was an Australian Railways Historical Society special steam train on 19 September 1992.  The last movement on the line was a light engine on 12 March 2004.  The line beyond Burra was taken up in 1992-93.

In February 1999 Goyder Council applied for State Heritage Branch funding for urgent repairs to the building, which was vested in the Minister for Transport and Urban Planning after services ceased and then leased out.

By 2009 Pip Edson had begun the arduous process of writing to the State Government for funding.  In 2006 Peter Harvey and Roger Cross had secured the lease through the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  In March 2010 Pip’s efforts bore fruit when the Government announced a $200,000 grant to begin conservation and restoration work.

Roy Taplin and his wife Brenda had come to Burra in 2004.  Roy was a retired master painter and decorator and he became involved in the restoration.  The building had been vandalised and was inhabited by pigeons.  It was also badly damaged by termites and salt damp.  Roy worked every morning for years on repairs and restoration, replacing floors, repairing ceilings, restoring woodwork and making cupboards from salvaged flooring, as well as painting the interior and parts of the exterior.  He also managed the whole project, which involved local tradesmen.

By History Month May 2011 the building was safe enough for part of it to be opened to visitors and by May 2014 the major work had been completed and the station has been open to visitors from 11 a/m/ to 1 p.m., with a guide from ‘Friends of the Burra Railway Station’ in attendance.  It was decided that to generate funds for the ongoing maintenance of the building bed and breakfast accommodation would be established at the eastern end of the building.  It is intended that the building will house displays and will be available for special events and several weddings and parties have already made use of it.

A plaque marking the re-opening was unveiled by the Premier in recognition of the work done by Roy Taplin and Burra community volunteers.
