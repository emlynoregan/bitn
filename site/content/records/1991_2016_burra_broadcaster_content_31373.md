Story of the Redruth Church

The first mention of Redruth is in the circuit minutes in 1859 and later that year Redruth received from the Government an allocation of 20 acres of glebe land and half an acre in the township in Tregonning Street.1

On 2 February 1851 the cornerstone of the first Redruth Chapel was laid.

The Chapel was opened on 4 May 1851.  The building cost £260.

The exodus of men to the Victorian gold rush caused the chapel to fail and in 1854 it was dismantled by the trustees.  The roof, floor, windows, doors, pulpit and seats were transferred to the new chapel at Spring Farm near Clare.

In 1856 the Burra Burra Circuit was changed to the Kooringa Circuit, of which Redruth was a part.

There was no chapel at Redruth 1854-57.

In 1857 the Kooringa trustees decided to restore the Redruth Chapel by using old windows, seats, the pulpit and part of the roof made available when the Kooringa Chapel was enlarged.  This cost £150.

This second Redruth Chapel was opened on 22 April 1857.

In August 1873 the trustees resolved to build the existing chapel in Ludgvan Street at a cost of £1,310.

The front section of the building was added to the existing building,2 with four foundation stones being laid on Thursday 23 April 1874.

On the Sunday services were held in the Lutheran Church at Redruth by Rev. G.W. Patchell in the morning and afternoon. On Monday a tea meeting was held in the old Redruth Chapel, followed by a public meeting in the Lutheran Church.

At the stone laying and opening ceremonies £400 was raised and the rest was borrowed.  The building measured 42 ft x 24 ft and would seat 200.  The architect was Mr R. Rees and it was built by Mr James Tiver and Mrs Ann Pearce & Sons.

The trustees then decided to build a Sunday school behind the chapel.  This was completed in September 1875 in the form of a T-piece at the back of the chapel at a cost of £300.

For want of room this building was annexed as a transept for the church at a later date.3

The Sunday school was transferred to Jubilee Hall 4 – the former Primitive Methodist Chapel.

In 18765 £200 was paid for land near the chapel for a Sunday school and this was opened 7 February 1925, free of debt much to the credit of Mr James Reed.

In 1889 the Redruth Circuit was created – cutting links with the Kooringa Circuit.

The first Redruth minister was Thomas M. Rowe, 1889-90.

United Methodist came in 1900.

The first Methodist minister was Rev. W.H. Rofe, 1900-01.

In 1940 the circuit became Burra-Redruth when Rev. Neil Usher was incumbent.

Rev. A.S. Barratt 1943-46. (Father of Mrs Olive Oates.)

Rev. C.L.H. Pitman 1947-50.

1951 Rev. C. Christopher was followed by Rev. D. Haydon, Rev. R. Jenner and Rev. M. Edwards.

Redruth Church closed as a centre for regular worship in 1970, since when all services have been at the Kooringa (Burra) Church.

The Redruth Trust Committee then decided that the property would become a conference and camping centre and additions and changes were made.  The church building was made available as a worship centre for campers.

[1. Tregony Street.

2. This makes no sense.  The two buildings were on different sites.  All the evidence suggests that the second chapel was on the site of the first.  The cost cited alone suggests the original walls were reused.  The Tregony street property was sold only in 1876 and circumstantial evidence suggests it was used as a private school.
