Kooringa News, 8 November

On Sunday 4 November William Albe a bushman staying at a friend’s house in Aberdeen complained of being very ill and believed he had taken poison in mistake for salts.  When he was worse two hours later John Robertson, his friend, questioned him and obtained an empty bottle labelled Strychnine Poison. Information was given to the Police who laid a charge of attempting to commit suicide.  This broke down when Dr Dashwood said if he had taken 4 grains of what had been in the bottle he would have died within 20 minutes.  It is presumed he lied about taking the poison and that the illness was overindulgence in alcohol.

William Isilin was arrested at Oulnina and charged with being a dangerous lunatic, but after a few days in custody his mind improved and he was discharged.

A three-year-old daughter of John Beckwith, teamster, late of Redruth went missing about three weeks ago on Grampus Station and despite an extensive search neither she nor her remains have been found.

[Jane Ann Beckwith born 14 October 1863, Redruth.  There is no registration of death.]

Rev. L.W. Stanton entertained with his readings on Tuesday evening and Mr Ullman sang some songs, while the Messrs Moody also sang and Miss Stanton played some music.  £6 was collected for the piano fund.
