Sydney Hampton Warren has been elected President of the SA Public School Teachers Union.  His maternal grandfather was Edward Hampton, assayer for the Burra Copper Co.

[Caution: this may be meant to be the English and Australian Copper Co. or it may be the Burra Burra Copper Co.  The former dating from the time of the old mine and the latter just being wound up.  The information that follows makes the former more likely.]

His father, John R. Warren, was in business in Burra and Sydney and Warren was born here.  He was educated partly in Mr Stanton’s school at Kooringa and partly in Mr Harry’s school at Saddleworth.  He was in business in Adelaide for two years and a pioneer farmer at Willowie before entering college aged 22 and was first appointed to Kulpara in Jan. 1882, since when he has served at many schools – and is presently at Hindmarsh.
