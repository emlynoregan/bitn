A.C. Woodgate opposed this, as it would do nothing to aid farmers whose crop had failed.

W.J. Cousins supported the bounty system.  He believed that at present 80% of farmers could not pay their way and farmers were entitled to receive at least the cost of production and should retain their wheat until they got it.

B.H. Woodgate said primary producers must fail unless they got 4/- a bushel.  Any practical solution would suit – whether pegging the exchange rate, placing a sales tax on flour, moratoriums or reducing freight rates.  Effective organisation was essential.

P.A. Kilderry supported him and said a reduction in the tariff was also required, as some 500 items were tariff protected, but this would take time and relief was needed urgently.

A.D. McDonald was for a flour tax and pegging the exchange rate.

The Chairman was for a bounty.

F.C. Catt favoured a bounty – other industries received such.

The final motion that was carried unanimously urged the immediate introduction of a bounty of 1/6 per bushel for wheat.
