The Unemployment Relief Fund is dealing with a number of very necessitous cases.  Boots are the worst problem.  The Trix Pearce Knitting Circle handed over 20 pairs of socks, twelve singlets, one jumper, three pairs of baby booties and other woollens for babies.  Mrs Day has been given 30/- worth of wool to continue and others have donated wool too.  [The knitters are listed.]
