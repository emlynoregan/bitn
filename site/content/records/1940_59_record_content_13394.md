The Burra Mill

Until a month ago the Burra Mill was standing with its practically new machinery intact.  Today the machinery has gone.  The fine old timbers are piled up in neat heaps for sale and it is but a gaunt and empty skeleton.  Soon not even its four high walls will cut the skyline.  Local citizens were prepared to keep the mill going with their money and energy and offered to buy it lock stock and barrel.  They say they were met with a refusal to sell of they were going to grind flour in SA.  The owners gave various reasons why they could not work the mill, but were not prepared to allow Burra men to try to surmount the alleged differences between profit and loss on the mill.  It is another case of the city making a grab at the expense of the country.  The town loses the employees as residents and as customers.
