1933	J. Ryan		(60 miles: Adelaide-Templers-Adelaide)

4.  In the 1950s the picture is more complex.  The race was held 1950-52 and in 1953 the Burra-Adelaide race was stage three of the three-day ‘Advertiser Tour’.  In 1954 & 1955 The ‘Advertiser Tour’ passed through Burra, but the local paper’s report suggests it was not a Burra-Adelaide race.  The Adelaide-Burra event was revived in 1956 by the Goodwood Cycling Club.  The Norwood Club’s involvement came rather later.

5.  The finishing point in or near Adelaide did not just move to Elizabeth when traffic lights appeared in the city centre.  Work is needed on this, but it had a number of finishing points – one Burra Record report has an end point at the Windmill Hotel at Enfield and another ended at Modbury.

6.  A bit of research could probably establish the routes and winners and very likely the times and distances too, but until this is done we will just have to beware of accepting unchecked reports.]
