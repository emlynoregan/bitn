Burra Town Council, 20 Feb.

The Council met to consider tenders for 600 yards of metal for the north end of town.  Cr Rabbich moved that the tenders for 400 yards go to the lowest bidder: Cox & Son.

Cr Sampson amended this to 200 yards at 2/1 and this was carried.

Cr Rabbich then objected to tenders going to other than the lowest bid, further objected to staying to deal any further with the matter, and then left the room.

Cr Watt then moved that at the next Council meeting Cr Rabbich be asked to explain why he took such steps.

The remaining tenders were of the same value [2/3 per yard from the editorial] and were disposed of by ballot.
