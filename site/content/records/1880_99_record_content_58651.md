Cr Rabbich trotted around the hall relieving himself of a whisper to one and then another.  When he said he had often run away from his tea to get to a Council meeting it could not be swallowed by the audience.  ‘Whoever heard of the infatuated Tom shying clear of good things to eat.  Not Much!’

‘Cr Hardy filled the part of “Can Can Billy” in a creditable style and evoked considerable laughter.  He said he had nothing to say about half a dozen times, and as often told the ratepayers he was reserving his most mysterious and sensational antics until a more convenient season.’

Mr T.P. Halls, who is running for West Ward almost, brought the house down when he told ratepayers they would see his views when he got into Council.

Mr Winnall made a favourable impression.

Cr Harris was subjected to cries of ‘That Wood’ from the floor: indeed he is often referred to by that epithet.  He said he would not again trouble the ratepayers.

Cr Sampson had a minor altercation with one questioner, but escaped uninjured and the meeting dispersed about 9 o’clock.
