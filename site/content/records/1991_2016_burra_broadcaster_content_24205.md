Burra Hospital will farewell Noreen Hallion after 12 years of service.  Noreen has been in the forefront of many initiatives including the commencement and co-ordination of ante-natal classes and the palliative care group.  She has steered the hospital through its successful accreditation process and has been an active member of the new health promotion team.  She has been very community orientated and spent hours of her own time visiting patients in their homes.  The patients, nursing home residents, their familles, staff and general community all thank Noreen and wish her well.
