Another dispute arose over another paddock of 80 acres of good feed for which the defendant paid £5 for its use till the plaintiff wanted to plough it.

The defendant, through Mr Winnall claimed he had bought the feed for £50, provided he didn’t start ploughing before 1 October.  On other paddocks paid £5 – because the plaintiff said he would start ploughing in two to three weeks.  £50 cheque was paid in front of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s office in Kooringa on 7 October.  If the judgement is that I have to pay for October, November and December that would not in Warnes’ opinion have been worth more than 50/-.  Warnes had no recollection of any function at Leighton about 1 October.  The cheque had not been handed over at Leighton Hall.

The verdict was for the plaintiff for £15 plus costs.
