1932

There were no staff changes.  Enrolment was 57.  On 13 February a working bee was organised for improving the Mine Pool.  A path was cut to the edge of the pool and dressing sheds and a safety fence were later erected.  A cricket pitch was prepared for the girls.  On 26 April Lyall Turner broke his arm when he fell from his horse while riding to school.

(To be continued.)
