Booborowie Hall

Recently it was decided to raise funds for the Hall by cropping.  M.S. Hawker loaned 33 acres.  G.R. Shattock & J.W. McKeough did the ploughing, harrowing and cultivating.  G.S. Williams & P.C. Brook attended to the seeding with plant operated by Colin Robinson.  Seed and super were delivered by F.L. Hogan and Pearce Bros loaned the seed barley.  A.C. Woodgate, W.J. Shattock & H. Dawson assisted at the sowing.  [A long list of people who contributed super is printed along with the names of those on the committee.]
