Burra Community School children from years three to five gathered at the Burra Railway Station to mark the beginning of this year’s SALA Festival.  The station was wrapped with yellow ribbon and bows as part of this year’s ‘sun and wind’ theme.  This follows the decorative theme elsewhere in the town, with its yellow Balinese flags and yellow coolie hats.  The children arranged themselves in front of the station to spell out SALA.  The festival will be launched in Burra in Market Square on Sunday between 2 and 4 p.m.  Local artists will sketch along the street.  The Sing Australia Choir will perform with student band ‘The Sore Foot Effect’, the African drumming band ‘Tumbarum’ from Clare and the Burra dancers ‘The Burra Bootscooters.’  SA’s entry ‘Kelly’ in this year’s Solar Challenge Race from Darwin to Adelaide will also appear.  There will be food stalls and a parade of children in hand made hats.  The art gallery will have an exhibition called ‘Throwing Light’ and will host a SOLSA Salsa party featuring a demonstration of Latin dancing.
