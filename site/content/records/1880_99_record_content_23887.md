‘A Wanderer’ complains of the younger generation:

‘the more we see of the present generation the more apparent is their degeneration, for minds seldom go beneath the surface for instruction.’

Few care to attend a lecture or a debate, or even an election meeting.  Places of worship are rarely filled ‘except by some special attraction.’

‘often are the congregation so small that it must be a punishment to the minister to deliver a sermon.  But let a circus come to town or a Christy minstrel entertainment and crowds attend.’

‘A Wanderer’ finds that if Rounsevell was a good servant earlier, of late he has been found severely wanting and self-serving - ‘of late he has been seeking to employ the public force in the service of his individual ideas and desires.’  He disapproves of the banquet proposal and considers it is ‘the destiny of such great men to be merely a burden and a useless wonder to mankind.’
