Burra Town Council, Monday.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis advise a contract has been let for the verandah in front of their premises.

New tie-up posts are to be placed at the cemetery.

The Mayor advocated the introduction of the Building Act to prevent the erection of unsightly structures.

‘At present anyone could disfigure the streets as they saw fit.’

To be further considered.

The Mayor said steps should be taken to get a hydrant and reel.  A 3d rate could be struck.

Cr McBride said at present it wouldn’t be much good as two or three nights a week there was no water.

Cr Lane moved they write again to the Department.

Cr Radford thought the Railways Department’s reservoir at Firewood Creek should be big enough to supply the town.

A wire is to be sent to the Department and a deputation to follow after the holidays if there is no action.

Cr McWaters said three or four people had complained that they had been told by the overseer that if they raised more metal than their allocation it would be taken over by the corporation.  About 100 yards had been so raised and the overseer said it could not be taken over.

The overseer said he had not given anyone authority to raise over their allocated quantity, but it was common practice by tenderers on the off-chance that it would be taken over by Council.

Cr Killicoat asked if the metal from the big Aberdeen Quarry was worth the extra money paid for it.

The overseer said it was worth an extra 1/- [a yard?] for its wearing qualities.

Cr McBride said the street lights were unsatisfactory and it was decided that the overseer would overhaul each lamp and then supervise their lighting for one month.
