Regional Council of Goyder; Burra Office Open Day

The recently refurbished Burra Office drew a good crowd on Sunday 17 November.  Chairman Denis Keller welcomed visitors who included the recently elected President of the Local Government Association, Mr Max Amber, representatives from neighbouring Councils, Councillors and their wives and members of the public.  When amalgamation formed the Council in 1997 the need to upgrade the Burra office was on the agenda of the first meeting.  A safety audit revealed several areas of concern: there were problems with access, fire safety, staff safety and a lack of storage facilities.  A sub-committee visited other Councils to gather ideas and also consulted with staff and with the Burra RSL.  Designs were drawn up and fee proposals were invited.  Shannon Architects were selected to manage the project and Partek Industry Pty Ltd won the contract, with work starting on 19 March 2002.

In Stage 1 the old RSL room and the rear Council offices and old Council Chamber were gutted and rebuilt to house the administration area.  This meant considerable adjustment by staff who for a time had even less space and a good deal of noise and dust to contend with.  During this phase Council meetings were held in the Burra Town Hall.

Stage 2 began on 1 July 2002, with staff now relocated to the new administration area and work began on the new Council Chamber, kitchen facilities and foyer.  This was completed on 8 November and is expected to come in within Council budgets.
