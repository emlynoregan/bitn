Local Board of Health.

Education Department says it has no funds to install septic tanks.

Cr Woollacott says private individuals could not get away with such a reply.  If a septic tank is required they have to find funds.

The recent action ordering widows with one cow to install milking sheds with concrete floors was an example.
