Burra Town Council

J.H. Smith sought to buy a small section of road at the side of his mother’s house in Ayers Street and offered £5.  An inspection will be made before any decision.

R.J. Fairchild offered £1 for the portion of Fore St in Redruth between allotments 116 & 117 and desired also to exchange part of allotment 117 for part of allotment 118 which would straighten out a street.  He also sought permission to enclose about 10ft of Illogan St opposite blocks 115 & 116 to plant a row of trees.  The offer was accepted and the request granted.

H. Morgan was allowed to erect two verandahs on lot 23 Redruth.

The lighting of Market Square was poor, but a light in the Rotunda was being considered.
