Kooringa News, 29 December

The Christmas period passed with pleasantly cool weather and threatening thunderstorms on Christmas Day passed on.  Messrs Ware and Chapman of the [Burra] Hotel had a bullock roasted near the hotel and games were played.  There were wrestling, blindfolded races with wheelbarrows, jingling the bell (a variety of blind-manâ€™s-buff), climbing a greasy pole and quoits.  Mostly the games were confined to juveniles.  Everything passed of quietly till the evening, when beer got the better of some, but despite a large amount of noise the interference of the police was not required.
