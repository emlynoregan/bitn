Obituary.  Thomas A. Fairchild died 25 January at Burra Hospital.  He was a resident of Ironmine and Booborowie District and was born at Morphett Vale 21 February 1863, the second son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Fairchild.  In 1875 the family moved by bullock team to Ironmine.  As a youth the deceased learnt blacksmithing from James Scott the Ironmine blacksmith just past Blink Bonnie.  He then went as a blacksmith to Broken Hill and also worked on stations in the area.  He returned to Burra and worked for a time with James Henderson blacksmith of Kooringa and later with Samuel Burns.  When Booborowie Station was cut up in 1895 he bought a block and started farming and grazing.  He was a keen sportsman and was especially interested in horse racing.  In 1903 he married Emily, a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs George Finch of Leighton who survives.  Of a large family six sons survive: George & Albert (Booborowie), Stanley (Andrews), Lewis, Norman & Walter (all Booborowie).  A daughter Phyllis died a few years ago.  There are three grandchildren.  Mr R.J. Fairchild of Aberdeen is a brother.  [Birth CD shows registration of Albert Thomas Fairchild as 21 January 1863 at Morphett Vale SA.]
