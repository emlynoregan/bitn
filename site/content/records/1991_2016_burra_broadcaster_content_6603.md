Anzac Dawn Service

More than 200 people gathered at the memorial in Market Square.  Members of the 8th Transport Squadron brought 35 personnel and army vehicles; adding to the parade of honour.  The service was led by Rev. Kelvin Benn and Fr John Devenport.  MPs Barry Wakelin (Grey) and Rob Kerin (Frome) attended and Mr Wakelin presented a $350 cheque from the Australia Remembers Program to go towards the breakfast and other costs.  Veterans and their guests enjoyed breakfast at the Burra Hotel after the service, while the army provided a cuppa from their mess van in the car park for others attending.  Burra RSL President Mr Bill Kearney was pleased with the turn-out.  [Photo page 1 and 3 photos page 8.]
