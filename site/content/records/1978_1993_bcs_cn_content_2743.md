A window was forced at the Burra Library last Wednesday/Thursday night.  Three internal doors and a desk drawer were forced open.   About $5,000 worth of audio and visual equipment was stolen.  All equipment was marked and engraved and serial numbers were on file.  Police from Holden Hill CIB detained two people and advised that the return of the equipment could be expected in due course.
