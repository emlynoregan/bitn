There is no record of this womanâ€™s birth or first marriage in the SA CDs of Births and Marriages.  The birth registration of some of the children give her maiden name as Bloomfield or Bloomfield-Patrick.  Her husband Allan McLennan died at Oodlawirra 21 December 1915 and she married the widower Mr William Voumard in 1927 at Burra.]
