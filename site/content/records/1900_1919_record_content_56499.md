I.J. Goodridge writes pointing out that the duties of the DC Ranger are not as ‘Ratepayer’ implies.  He has to see that cattle on the road are licensed and don’t loaf about.  He cannot see to every beast that strays into adjacent properties.  Property owners have to keep their gates shut and be responsible for broken fences.
