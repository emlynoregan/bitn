Playground.  A public meeting to consider using surplus Seaside Trip funds for a children’s playground was held in the Institute 21 April.  S. Kellaway took the chair.  Mr Marston reported on two sites: on either side of the creek opposite St Joseph’s.  He favoured the school side site where there was room later for a tennis court and cricket pitch.  The other side had a number of trees that would have to be removed or crated and was too steep for other than young children’s games.  The meeting favoured the latter site because the trees offered shelter.  The Seaside Committee will be asked for £50.
