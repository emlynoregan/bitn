Burra Town Council, 7 December

Mrs Sampson was asking £15 per acre for land adjoining the Burra Cemetery, which the Council had thought of purchasing.

A.B. Riggs on behalf of the Institute Committee clarified that they were offering the Council sole use of the Council Chamber and use of the Hall for three nights per year for £65 p.a.

Advice from the Municipal Association was that Council would not have to pay more rent under Section 15 of the [Fair Rents] Act.

Cr Marston said it was not now a question of raised rent, but a new proposition – they could continue under the old conditions without increase of rent.

His Worship said it was the opinion of the [Institute] Committee that there was too much messing about on the part of Council in its desire to purchase the Institute and the Council did not want to buy it at all.

Cr Kellaway said whoever told the Mayor that was a liar.  The Committee had not assisted the Council to obtain permission to buy it at all.

Cr Marston moved that Council pay £50 p.a. for sole use of the Council Chamber with three nights’ use of the hall.  The present £36 was less than 15/- a week and was ridiculously cheap and unfair to the Institute Committee.  Cr Fisher seconded and the motion was carried.

Cr Fisher moved that the fence along the plantation in Railway Parade be removed as it was in bad repair and removal would improve the site.  Carried.

LAC Alan Walker, youngest son of O.G. Walker, received a presentation in the Council chamber on Thursday evening before departing for a Training School.  The Mayor said Alan had begun his career in the Burra Post Office and when old enough had volunteered.  His brother LAC Laurie Walker was a POW in Malaya.  Also on that day Miss Margaret Pearce and Sheila Fairchild had left Burra North to take up WAAAF work and other girls to go were Signaller Ruth (Peggy) Dollman and June Jesser.

Christmas greetings had been received from Ptes Ivon Wohling, Clem Davey and Alan Kemble, all of whom were overseas.

Pte Alick Kotz had won the Military Medal – the first Burra boy to do so in this war.

Pte Ogilvie of Booborowie had also been awarded a Military Medal.

A.B. Riggs, Dr Steele and S.C. Genders also spoke before presentations were made.

LAC Geoff Rosman RAAF, elder son of Mrs & the late P.L. Rosman, left for a training station.  His gifts were posted to him.
