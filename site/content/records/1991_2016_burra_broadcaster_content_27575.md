Burra North Red Phone Box.  Last Burra Show day the old red phone box at Burra North was destroyed when a car crashed into it.  A petition with 200 signatures asked the Goyder Council to assist in replacing it, but the Council has rejected the plea – neither interceding on the petitioners’ behalf with Telstra nor making a claim against the owner of the vehicle that destroyed the old box.
