Political Meeting at Kooringa

About 100 people attended a meeting at the Institute on Thursday night to consider the present political situation.

I. Killicoat JP presided.  He said he believed the Government was go-ahead and was acting in the best interests of the colony.  He referred to the proposal to extend various railway lines to open up the country and provide facilities for settlers.  He acknowledged that this would require more revenue.  The Government had proposed stamp, legacy and succession duties, which had passed the House of Assembly, but been blocked in the Legislative Council.  The Government felt that this was a vital part of their policy and had asked for a response from the electors.

Dr Stephens proposed that the meeting supports the policy proposed by the Government for the construction of railways and other reproductive work.  He spoke of his recent visit to the USA where the spread of railways was essential in the development of the country and its resources.  [His argument is reported at length.]

Thomas drew seconded and Mr Owen Harvey spoke in support.  He supported the bold move to borrow £3 million to build 500 or 600 miles of railway.  He had originally signed a petition against the Stamps Duties Bill without due consideration and now supported the Government’s proposals.

Captain Sanders thought that if the policy had a fault, it was in not being bold enough.  He was confident that the railways would open up agricultural land and bring rich mineral resources into production.  The cost of borrowing £3 million would be only 12/- per head of the population and was an investment about which future generations would rejoice.

W.R. Ridgway also endorsed the policy and the proposal was carried without dissent.

Henry Dawson moved that the meeting consider the passing of the Stamps and Succession Duties Bill an essential portion of the Ministerial policy.

He said that with the income the Bill would provide the Government could go with confidence to the English capitalists and borrow the sums they needed for the development of the colony.  He spoke too of why an income tax at this stage was both unnecessary and inefficient.  He was surprised at the negative reaction of bankers and merchants.  The latter in particular would surely benefit from the development of the colony that was proposed.  People in Burra hardly needed it explained to them how towns benefited from the telegraph and railway.

Charles Lowe seconded.  The Government had acted unencumbered by party intrigue or sectional obligations and was taking a wider and longer term view of the benefit to the colony as a whole.

Philip Lane spoke in support.  The Stamps Bill would affect mainly the wealthy and money-lenders, some of whom were in the Legislative Council.  At Burra cartage by road had been £8-£10 per ton and was now 23/- to 30/- per ton by rail.  The Burra district’s development would have stopped, but for the railway.  The new Bill would shift taxes from the working class, who were unfairly imposed upon while Government income was reliant upon import duties.  He also supported the proposal of the Government to grant contractors for public works £15 per man they introduced into the colony.  [He developed his argument at some length.]

‘He regretted that the Bill had been thrown out by the Council.  He certainly thought that Sir Henry Ayers, whom he considered to be an able politician, would have acted differently; but it seemed he had missed his mark and the members of the Council followed where Sir Henry led them, like little puppies.’

This motion was also carried without dissent.

Mr E. Lipsett thoroughly supported the Government policy and moved that the Memorial to both Houses of Parliament, recently adopted at Port Adelaide, be also adopted by this meeting.

P. Jane seconded, W. Pearce supported and the motion was carried unanimously.

Mr Rees MP had come from Adelaide at some inconvenience to attend the meeting, but on hearing that it was a local affair, he refrained from attending.  At the end of the meeting Joseph Roberts moved a vote of thanks to Mr Rees for making the trip.  J.D. Cave moved an amendment that no such vote be recorded as Mr Rees should not have come without an invitation and the idea of the meeting was not to be influenced by what their Parliamentary representative might say, but rather to influence their representative.  James Waters seconded the amendment.  After animated discussion in which several speakers regretted anything like disrespect being shown to Mr Rees, the motion was heartily carried.
