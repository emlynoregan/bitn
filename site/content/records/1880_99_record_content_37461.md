Silver Find.  The acting Inspector of Mines, J.V. Parkes, has been inspecting the silver find on sections 603 & 604 Hd of Hanson, the property of J.J. Duncan.  Test smelting of 6½ cwt has yielded 7 oz silver & 33% of lead per ton of ore.  The veins so far discovered are too small to be of any value.  I cannot, he says, recommend spending much money, but advise those interested to sink two 50’ shafts at the places I marked which for a cost of c. £80 would prove whether the veins make large or not.
