Burra Mine

Heavy machinery used by Roche Bros has disclosed the main access tunnel from the ore body to the outside from the pre-1870 operations.  The tunnel would be approximately 600 ft in length from the ‘fall in’ to the top and several hundred feet back to the lower levels of the open cut.  About 400 ft along the tunnel there is a turntable of approximately 4 ft 6 inches diameter in perfect working order.  Beyond there is a section of rail track and a set of points.  The very solid timbering of the tunnel is in good condition with some nails not even rusty.  Mine workers had been into the tunnel prior to the visit.  The writer was accompanied by Mr Lewis Moore who photographed the turntable.  The foul air in the tunnel did not permit a long stay.  A series of pulleys along the roof of the tunnel (as seen on either side of the turntable) are still positioned and these were used to draw the rail trucks and loads of ore from the lower workings.  The positioning of the pulleys etc. would suggest that while a loaded truck was being hauled up, the weight of an empty truck going down was used to help the upward pull.  The access tunnel would have been in use long before the open cut method of mining was adopted and a considerable portion of it would have been destroyed on the lower end.  Apparently an unsealed entrance on the top side existed some time ago and persons had been into the tunnel.  Several names were written on the underside of the underside of the turntable.  One was Rex Walker Bridge St Sunday 17/8/1930.

[There are photographs; one of the turntable suspended from the overhead timbers and showing the solid timbering of the tunnel.  Another is a close-up of the turntable with the spliced rope attached, on which the steel worked.  Animal fats were used for lubrication and are still evident around the central spindle.  There is another on page 7.]
