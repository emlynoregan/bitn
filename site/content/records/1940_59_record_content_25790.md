‘Let Him Without Sin Cast the First Stone’ writes re betting shops.

The Ministers Fraternal in speaking to the Council thought a betting shop would lead to young boys betting.  This is misleading because at present lads of 15 & 16 may bet without much fear of detection, but on licensed betting premises no person under 21 could enter and this could easily be policed.  I never bet or believe in it, but there will always be gambling and to have it controlled is better than to allow illegal betting at will.
