Burra Swimming Pool

The Finance Committee of the Town Council has recommended financing the pool by the issuing of debentures on the security of the general rate.  The matter will need to be discussed with ratepayers at the forthcoming meeting of them on Thursday night next.  The market Square well is to be tested to see if its flow is adequate to supply the pool.

Cr Kellaway objected to the cost of that (estimated at £12-£15).

The Mayor assured Councillors that the site chosen was the best possible and that excavation would not be difficult.
