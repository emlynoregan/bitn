SA Gold

We regret to say that the reported gold field at Mitchell’s Flat [Lenswood] whence Mr Stephen was said to have procured gold, has turned out not to exist.  Some 400 to 500 persons went there and on Saturday Mr G.M. Waterhouse, Mr Babbage, the Crown Ranger and Mr Stephen appeared there.  Many set to work with vigour, but not a grain of gold was discovered.  Mr Stephen was addressed in terms more plain than polite and it is feared the whole thing was a hoax.  When apparently credible authority then said gold had been found near Lobethal by some Germans, none of the men at Mitchell’s Flat could be induced to go there.  The Commissioner of Crown Lands is yet to report on a second visit to Sixth Creek and we have no authoritative report on claims that gold has been discovered on the Light.
