Election Meeting at Burra Hotel 8 April with W.R. Ridgway presiding.

Captain Hart addressed the crowd.  [He began with a conventional lot of platitudes before any policy statements.]  He favoured a tramway to unlock the mineral wealth of the Far North.  He wanted a more liberal Land Act to reflect the depressed economy of the times.  He was against changes to the Real Property Act.

He thought the present system of education was subsidising the wrong students.  He also addressed the question of port facilities and the need for taxation reform.  [The speech is reported at length.]
