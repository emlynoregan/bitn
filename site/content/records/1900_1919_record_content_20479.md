On Saturday a fairly large crowd gathered in Market Square to see off the riders in the bicycle road race to Adelaide.  It was reported that tacks had been strewn over the road about a mile from town and as there were a number of punctures just about there, it was probably true.  42 riders left Burra.  All went well and the worst injury to a rider was to McDonald, who was so fatigued he fell getting off his bike after finishing and cut his hand badly.  Fastest time was A. McDonald (WA) in 6 hrs 10 59 3.5 [three fifths of a second?] and the winner on handicap was H.G. Williams in 6 hr 14 5 2.5 with a 33 minute handicap.
