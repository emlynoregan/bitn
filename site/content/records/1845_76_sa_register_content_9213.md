20 July 1855, page 3

The Kapunda Mine is progressing very satisfactorily.  About twice as many are employed as at the start of the year.  Smelting has been resumed under Mr Thomas Hitchins, thus allowing the exploitation of lower grade ores.  A handsome roof of corrugated iron has been erected over two of the furnaces.  It is believed to be the largest in the colony at 83 ft by 52 ft 6 inches.  The centre is a curved 27 ft 6 inches span with two wings of straight metal 12 ft 6 inches.  The mine is in fork to 50 fathoms.  The promise of ore is abundant and the main problems are the want of cartage and the high price of provisions.
