Alma & Victoria Gold mine at Waukaringa.  After the investment of much effort and a great deal of money for little result it has finally produced 371 oz in four weeks and it appears that profits are about to flow.

[The adventures of this mine were reported consistently week after week because Burra people owned much of the stock, but I have not charted its ups and downs in this summary.]
