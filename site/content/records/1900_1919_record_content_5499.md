Burra Mine.  The first balance sheet for the Burra Burra Copper Co. is reported.  Elder, Smith and F.H. Snow have an agreement to erect a plant to treat the tailings and the waste heaps.  A six ton sample has been successfully treated in Germany, having been sent last November.  A Mechernich plant will shortly be sent from Germany and the boilers and driving plant will be bought in Australia.  Until this plant is in operation no other work will be undertaken by the company which has placed Â£5,000 on fixed deposit.  Current expenditure will be more than covered by the interest and receipts from tributers and rents.
