Burra National Trust AGM was held in Burra Civic Centre last Tuesday 4 March.

President Maureen Wright said they were one of 57 branches in SA (the only state with a branch system).  In Burra the Trust owned six properties and was responsible for three others. (Leasing the Paxton Square Cottage No. 11 and caring for the jinker and Powder Magazine.)  This was a large job and the income came from key hire, bus tours and fund-raising.  Most of 1985’s objectives had been realised.  The J150 $30,000 allocated to the Bon Accord had been spent.  An application has been made for a $21,000 CEP grant to work on the Bon Accord surrounds and re-fence and define the car park.  $5000 was being spent on a case to house Pam Marlow’s mine model and a History Trust grant of $8,500 will be spent on display and interpretation.  Lock-up restoration work is almost complete under the care of architect David Gilbert, using a National Estate grant of $12,000.

A small committee has worked to prepare scripts for signs for the sites and liaison with the Department of Mines, Department of Tourism and the Burra Burra DC will allow special enamelled signs at Trust sites at the same time as signs are done for the J150 project at the mine.

Volunteers will photograph all buildings in Burra on the same day within the next two months.

A dramatic event is planned for Redruth Gaol in association with the Arts Council and Flinders University drama students.

In 1985 the Trust became involved with several issues including the redevelopment of Market Square.  I am disturbed that Council seems reluctant to consult with us over issues of major importance.  The Council’s recent decision to form a Burra Heritage Advisory Committee is a good one.

[Mrs Wright then went on to thank all those who had helped the Trust throughout the year.]

Elections: President, Mrs Maureen Wright; Vice-President Management, Helen Stockman; Vice-President Works & Buildings, Barry Wright; Vice President Funding & Catering, Cheryl John; Secretary, Robyn Page; Treasurer, Avian Pink and Curator, Colin Fidock.

The guest speaker was Jeff Daniels, development officer from National Trust Headquarters who spoke on Heritage in Trust.
