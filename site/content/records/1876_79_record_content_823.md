Mt Bryan Correspondent wonders if the Burra-Mt Bryan road is well placed in being at the bottom of the valley.  He says he has been told that 100 tons of stone were placed in a small section of it near the Mt Bryan Hotel without stopping that part being a creek after rain.  It may be better when the railway reduces road traffic.  He also complains that the wholesale immigration going on is depressing wages.  They have fallen from about £1 a week to 15/- when the former will scarcely support a wife and family in these times of high prices.
