Burra High School & Burra Primary School celebrated Arbor Day on Friday.  31 tamarisk trees were planted.  They were planted in the former air raid trenches, which had been filled in by the students on Arbor Day in 1944.  Rev. H. Hobbs gave a talk on trees.  The trees had been given to the school by the Pt Pirie town gardener.
