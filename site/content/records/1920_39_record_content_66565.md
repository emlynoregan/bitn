Obituary.  George W. Willmott who died 26 March was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs George Willmott and was born at Mintaro in 1865.  From an early age he assisted his father in farming.  The family later moved to Ironmine where Mr Willmott farms for Mr Hastie.  There he married Miss Agnes E. Moore, second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs E.A. Moore of Kooringa and they went to Arkaba and took up sheep farming.  From there they became sheep farmers at Yatina, Oodlawirra, Pinnaroo and finally Peterborough.  Failing health forced his retirement and eight months ago they came to Kooringa.  A widow survives.  There is no family.  Mr Willmott was a consistent member of the Salvation Army and Captain Cresswell conducted the funeral service assisted by Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook.  [Born George William Wilmott 22 December 1864 at Mintaro.]
