Redruth Land Sale

Despite bad weather an immense number of Kooringa people assembled at the Police-barracks on Wednesday morning at 11 a.m.  The bidding for the first lo9t was spirited until it reached £100, when it was knocked down to Mr Ayers, for the SA Mining Association.  The same result followed for No. 2 at £150, No. 3 at £200.  A similar battle ensued for No. 5, which eventually went to Mr V. Solomon for £400.  This was the highest price paid for any allotment.  It soon became apparent that the Mining Company was determined to buy the whole township if possible.  Mr V. Solomon contested many lots, but in the end could buy only 15.  The Burra Burra Company secured 77.  With only 120 lots, this left just 21 to go to other bidders [seven being reserved for Government use].  The lowest price was £5-1-0 and the total for the whole sale of 120 lots was the enormous sum of £5,067-9-0.
