Kooringa News, 17 August

A meeting was held at the [Burra] Hotel on Monday to hear the response of the Directors to the proposition sent to them from a former meeting relative to forming a Corporation in the township.  The Directors replied that they could not see their way clear to valuing the allotments according to their position rather than according to the improvements thereon.  Neither could they do away with the restriction on the number of public houses in the township.  They would negotiate with individual tenants on the renewal of leases on the terms proposed in the former letter.  There being no basis for any negotiation, the meeting decided to take no action and the question of a Corporation is taken as settled.

Mr Ewbank gave two readings and recitations in the past fortnight at the Burra Hotel and the Institute respectively.  Both were thinly attended.

The news of the wreck of the Admella has created great interest here.

The weather has been extremely cold lately with sharp frosts at night.  Rain now threatens.
