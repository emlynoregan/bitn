Salvation Army.  The events in Clare are reported.

Captain Carr, wife and family arrived in Clare on Friday.

Two eggs were thrown at him in open daylight.

Lieut. Phillip arrived to a similar reception on Saturday.

Staff Officer Baker on Saturday evening fared better.

Some hundreds turned out to see the events on Sunday, but a relatively quiet meeting followed at the old Government School buildings in the afternoon.

The evening proceedings outside the Barracks were however, disgraceful.

Stones were showered on the roof.  Eggs were hurled through open windows and the Army was showered with rotten eggs all the way to their homes.  Many others were also pelted.  The Army had provoked some of this by giving such a bad account of Clare in other places and at Adelaide.

[The editor adds: ‘The perpetrators of the outrage should be severely punished.’
