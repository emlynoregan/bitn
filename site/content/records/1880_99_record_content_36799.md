Mr Holder has returned from Queensland.  The Register says he is hopeful of good outcomes on the question of reciprocal reduction of tariffs.  It also says ‘it is incredible that the [Queensland] Government or any member of it can have given Mr Holder any grounds for believing that his preposterous proposals can be seriously entertained.’
