Jim Isaac Jnr, son of James Isaac of the Burra Waterworks, left some two years ago to become an engineer on a ship.  He writes to his father re the running aground of the ship the TSS Tresno-Star while negotiating ‘Curtain Pass’ in Magellan Straits.  There was considerable damage, but no loss of life and the ship limped into Puerto Bories in Chile.  Details in just over 1 column.
