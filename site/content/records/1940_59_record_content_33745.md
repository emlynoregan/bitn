Burra Town Council

It was resolved to inspect the corner at Best Place now occupied by L.L. Fiebig before deciding or granting him right of way.

The Clerk advised the public would be admitted to the Eisteddfod on 14 November.

Charges will be adults 1/6 and children 1/-.

The Under-Treasurer advises that a loan for improvements to Victoria Park had been approved and work can be carried on.

The Mayor said that sounded like a new loan.

[Presumably they had asked to be allowed to use the Â£400 granted before the war for the swimming pool.]

Clarification will be sought.

DC of Burra Burra was given permission to erect a building for the storage of oil in Kingston Street.  The building in concrete will be 12ft x 9ft.

Holder & Lane Gardens will be cleaned & tidied.

Kooringa Masonic Lodge.  Bro Carl F. Pearce was installed as Worshipful Master for the coming year last Wednesday night after which a ball was held [presumably at the Town Hall] with dancing till 2 a.m.
