BCS.  On Monday Year 4-5 students and some parents went to Wildildie Mongolata Gold Mine.  They didnâ€™t find any gold, but discovered the poppet-head, winch, shafts, battery, slime dumps, dugout shelters and ruins.  They had lunch near the site of the old eating house and enjoyed themselves despite the prickles, hay fever and grass seeds.
