[Rev.] W.O. Harris also takes up the issue of who are the wowsers.  Mr Harris pushes the line of individual liberty.  Those who favour a pastime are at liberty to pursue it and equally those who do not are free to abstain.  Despite objecting to the letter, Mr Harris acknowledges Mr Pearseâ€™s courage in signing his name.
