Obituary.  Thomas C. Parks has died after a long and trying illness.  He died at his Semaphore residence 11 June.  He was born in Kooringa in 1894, the third son of Mr Charles and the late Mrs Parks and was educated at the Burra School.  After school he worked in his father’s bakery business before enlisting with the 27th Battalion in 1916.  He fell ill at Suez and was invalided home.  He never recovered from the effects of the illness.  He married Miss Millicent Blott, second daughter of Mr & Mrs W. Blott of Kooringa.  After some time in Burra they moved to Semaphore for health reasons.  He is survived by two daughters and one son.  His eldest daughter, Ivy, died last year.  He is also survived by his father and one surviving brother, Mr Joseph Parks of Kooringa.

[Thomas Charles Parks born 23 June 1894 Kooringa.  Note that Ivy Parks’ death is registered as 26 September 1933: not in 1935 as suggested here.]
