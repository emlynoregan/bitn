Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting

Mayor’s Report for 1895 by Dr Brummitt.

The year began with the general account in debt £22-4-1 and at present it is in credit £4-12-1, though that will be expended by the end of the year.  The desire to provide work for the unemployed has seen each ward account end in debit.  £435-0-4 was received in rates and the Government subsidy was £112-14-3.  £226-7-7 was spent on public works and £230 went on the redemption of a bond and on interest.  Two bonds remain to be paid, each of £200: one due in 1896 and the other in 1897.  Interest will be £20 in 1896 and £10 in 1897.  After that it will be possible to reduce the rates materially.  A new assessment has been made by Mr A. Bartholomæus at a cost of £25.  This reduced the rateable value of the town by £539 to £8,736-19-0.  Wards are overdrawn as follows:

North Ward	£21-16-8

East Ward	£7-1-1

West Ward	£11-13-7

Park Lands and Oval

This year gaps in the street trees in the town were filled and the avenue near the cemetery was extended.  Unfortunately the dry year saw most of the open rooted pines die.  The buckthorn, white cedars and gums have been more successful.  Gross vandalism to trees has been a problem with many of them simply ripped up and others have been cut or barked.

At the oval a large show shed has been erected for £91, of which the Show Committee paid half.  An attempt to find the other half through concerts etc. has so far been financially disappointing, but efforts will continue.  The overdraft on the Park Lands account is £91-4-5.

The cemetery account is £43-9-7 in credit.

Waterworks.

The problem here is that the income is based on the assessment of the town and this has fallen from £12,132 in 1888 to £8,736 at present.  This seriously affects the income of the Waterworks.  Expenditure has been cut to £704 from £800 last year, but the capital account debt remains immoveable.  Mr Lapidge replaced Mr Littlejohn as engineer early in the year and has proved a valuable officer.  The present balance in the bank is £86-17-9.

Main Roads.

The Government grant this year was £217 compared with £275 the previous year.  The grant has been usefully expended very nearly all in labour at a time when work was scarce.

Local Board of Health.

The town is in a satisfactory sanitary condition.  A new rubbish depot has been secured and a shed built.  By increasing the rate to 3½d the debt on this account has been reduced from £16-18-2 to 10/3.

The report was adopted.

Thomas Davies asked questions about the awarding of work to higher priced tenderers and the giving of work to certain favoured ratepayers.

The mayor said that in the particular case referred to the highest tender was accepted on his casting vote and he believed the money was well spent.  He would repeat the choice.

He would not elaborate on why Mr Bartholomæus got the assessment job over Mr Snell.

Mr Davies said that only a year or so ago the court had upheld the value of SAMA’s assessment as being c. £100 higher than the new assessment.  He queried whether the assessor had done a good job.

Mr C. Fuss warmly protested Mr Davies questioning of the Mayor’s honesty.  He believed the Mayor had done his work in a straightforward and conscientious manner.

The retiring councillors were invited to speak.

Cr Hardy said that he had little to say and would address his own ward in a day or two.

He defended the North Ward overdraft, saying they had got value for money.  He believed the Mayor had acted conscientiously in voting for the highest tenderer.

Cr Harris thought the Mayor’s Report was good and explained the workings of the Council well.  Had there not been a new assessment his ward would have ended in credit.

[The £25 cost of the new assessment was split evenly between the wards.]

He expressed concerns about the increasing cost of the Waterworks in the future.
