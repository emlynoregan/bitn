Editorial.  The phenomenally bad season last year was followed by a year of depression which we could only be thankful hasnâ€™t been any worse.  1897 began promisingly with good opening rains which caused wheat heads to begin growing well, but failure of the follow-up rains in October and subsequent hot weather has resulted in heavy losses and in some cases not a grain will be reaped.  We can at least be glad of the activities of the Benevolent Soc.
