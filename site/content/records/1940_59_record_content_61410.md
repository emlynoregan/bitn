Hanson Methodist Fete & Jubilee Fair netted £63.

[The paper says the Jubilee of the Church was celebrated last May – the 60th Anniversary of the Church.  Once again the paper gets it wrong about this church, as it had done also when the Jubilee was celebrated.  It was the 50th anniversary, not the 60th.  It was celebrated with Jubilee services on Sunday 7 June 1953.  The first services in the church were actually held on the 20 December 1903.]
