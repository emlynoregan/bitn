Kooringa, 11 November.

The anniversary services of the Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School were held last Sunday and continued on the following Tuesday.  Rev. G.W. Patchell preached on Sunday morning and evening.  In the afternoon there was a Service of Sacred Song: Life of St Joseph.  John Roach presided at the public tea.

On Tuesday evening in the Institute Hall O. Harvey presided at a concert in aid of the Roman Catholic Church.  The hall was comfortably filled.  [Performers are listed.]

Hay is being harvested.

The wood market has been and remains brisk.  Large supplies are being taken to the Burra Mine and to the two flour mills.  157 wood licences have been issued at Redruth and about 700 tons are delivered weekly, chiefly from scrub east of Kooringa.  The amount received from timber licences in one month is Â£59-17-6.  The Crown Ranger is indefatigable in seeing that all teamsters have licences and it is gratifying to see the friendly terms that exist between him and the men.
