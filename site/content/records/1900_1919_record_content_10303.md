Aaron Lewis is a name well known in Burra.  About nine years ago he took action against a Salvation Army Captain and a member of the corps, charging them with slander.  His charge was not substantiated and the evidence adduced at the trial led to his expulsion from the Army’s ranks.

[See Burra Record XV, 242, 3 May. 1893, page 3.]

Some time later he charged a woman with detaining his clothes box.  Evidence showed he ‘boarded’ there, but did not pay for his maintenance.  When this verdict went against him he was practically driven from Burra and went to Pt Adelaide, though he visited the town on some subsequent occasions.

At Adelaide Criminal sittings last week Lewis, a West Indian, was charged with criminally assaulting Amy Elizabeth Maxwell aged 14.  Some shocking evidence was tendered and Lewis was sentenced to 15 years hard labour and 50 lashes.
