Redruth Court, 22 January.

Straying stock caused each of the following to be fined 7/6.

John Pearce	W. Gebhardt	Thomas Bevan

H. McCullam [sic]	Jane Gully	T. Woollacott

23 January.

Walter James, aged c. 20, a lazy and indolent young man, was charged with entering Roach’s Mill on 21 January.

H. Roach reported leaving about 10.30 p.m. on the evening of 21 January and locking up securely.  In the morning he found a window broken and noticed some stamps on the floor.  Nothing had been taken from the safe, but 1/- worth of coppers was missing.  There were footprints in flour whish corresponded exactly to those of the prisoner.

L-Cpl Noble, stationed at Redruth, gave evidence of questioning the prisoner and of matching his footprint to those at the mill.  The prisoner comes from Clare and his real name is John Walker.

W.R. Ridgway, storekeeper at Aberdeen, said the prisoner had paid for a box of figs with nine single pennies at c. 9 a.m. the following morning.

The prisoner was remanded till 24 January for medical examination.

When the case was resumed on 24 January it was dismissed.

John Walker was then charged with being an idle and disorderly person and having no visible means of support.  He was sentenced to 14 days hard labour.
