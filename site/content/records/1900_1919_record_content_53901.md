Membership:	1916	double  25	single  148	total  173

1917	double  22	single  202	total  224

This was mainly due to the Choral and Orchestral Classes memberships.

Commercial classes continued another year, but membership is disappointing with 16-12 in the different quarters.

An architect will report on enlarging the hall in the New Year.
