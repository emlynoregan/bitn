Local Board of Health

The horse dray and harness has been offered to the scavenger for £33-10-0 on terms or for £28 cash.  The horse was refused and the rest accepted at £13-10-0 at 10/- a week.  Council accepted this offer if a deposit of £3-10-0 was paid.

They will try to sell the horse at the Booborowie Experimental Farm Sale.
