The Mayor, Mr H.J.B. Jennison presided.  The town could only afford one effort and four had been suggested:

A swimming pool for which about £1,000 could be made immediately available.

The levelling and beautifying of Victoria Park.

Development of a Community Sports Centre at the Racecourse with the co=operation of the Sports Syndicate.

Liquidate the debt on the Town Hall.

Mr A.B. Riggs moved that the town have a Memorial.  Carried.

Mr T.H. Woollacott moved that the Town Hall debt be liquidated and the Town Hall be the memorial scheme.  The debt was something over £3,000 and he could not recall when anything had last been paid off the capital.  The State Bank valued it at £10,000 and once paid for it would be an asset against which an overdraft could be raised at any time.  Last year it lost £68 and with the days of Red Cross dances etc. gone this would only increase in the future.  Cr Marston said the recent rough statement of income and expenditure showed a profit of £68: not a loss.  Further the Council was not charging itself rent on the Town Hall, which would cost them £65, so in reality the building last year made a profit of £133.

Mr R.C. Lott moved as an amendment that the creek be dammed.  Cr S.J. Woollacott seconded.

He estimated the cost at £2,000.  There was no intention to make the whole creek a swimming pool, but a small portion could be given a cement floor.  Mr Morrison said there was no current to keep the creek from being stagnant.  Cr Woollacott detailed a method of keeping it clean by the force of erosion, but after further debate the amendment was lost.

Mr L. Hawk/Hawke [depending on where you look] moved an amendment that Victoria Park be the Memorial.  The Victoria Park Committee had not intended the work there to be the Memorial, but had sought to have the £400 from the swimming pool fund freed for the oval improvements.  The site was hardly large enough for all the town’s sporting facilities, but would be used mainly for football and cricket.  They envisaged:

Grading and levelling the oval.

Installing a turf wicket.

Installing a saucer track for cycling.

Removing dead and useless trees and the erection of a grandstand in the northwest corner.

The existing shed would be removed and the iron used in the new grandstand roof.  The committee believed that if the £400 were used to liquidate the Town Hall debt it would not attract the two-thirds rebate which was only available if the money were spent on capital works.  The racecourse option was not sufficiently central to the town and was a very windy site.  It was also doubtful if the £400 could be spent there, as it was not public property.  The cost was estimated at £650.  Seconded by Mr C. Radford and carried.

Cr. F.T. Marston moved a further amendment that a Community Sports Centre be developed at the racecourse, as he considered the site at Victoria Park to be very impracticable.  The ground was stony and infertile and seven acres was too small to accommodate all sports.

Even if it could be enlarged that would mean money taken from improvements to purchase more land.  The E & WS were not willing to lay water to the site.  The Sports Syndicate had not met to finalise any action, but he was confident something could be worked out.  The land there was 69 acres for recreational purposes.  The soil was fertile and a number of buildings already existed.  The Local Government Act permitted Council to acquire a 50-year lease and all sports could be accommodated.  Mr T. Fuller seconded and as secretary for the Sports Syndicate saw no reason why Council could not have a 50-year lease.  The Mayor thought it a good idea.

Mr S. Kellaway was concerned about spending on improving private property.  When put the further amendment was carried and the original motion was lost.

A.B. Riggs then moved that permission be sought to transfer the £400 from the swimming pool to Victoria Park and further money be raised by public subscription.  Carried.

Mr Kellaway moved and Mr W. Carpenter seconded that money raised by the Centenary Committee towards the swimming pool go to the Council to assist in liquidating Town Hall debt.

[Note that the above account of proceedings does not make sense.  In reading the article I formed the conclusion that the Racecourse amendment was passed and the Town Hall scheme, which was the original motion, was lost.  The headline makes it clear that the Victoria Park scheme was the amendment that was finally carried.  The confusion arises because the Victoria Park move is described as a ‘further amendment’ and the racecourse scheme as ‘a still further amendment’, but immediately after the racecourse discussion there is no mention of the fate of this ‘still further amendment’, but a statement does say that ‘On being put the further amendment was carried and the original motion was lost.’  It seems irregular that as the report reads, the Victoria Park option is carried and then a further amendment is accepted.  In any event it is the Victoria Park Scheme that goes ahead.]
