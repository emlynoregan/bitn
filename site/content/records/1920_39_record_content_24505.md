Burra Town Council, 17 October

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to build for W.S. Field of Kooringa.

Retiring Councillors: Mayor, Crs Woollacott, Kellaway & J. Allen and also Auditor F. Treloar.

New Assessment.  At present the rate is struck on 5% of improved value of land in the Corporation, which totals c. £480,000.

Cr Bednall moved the Town Clerk obtain from Land Tax Office the unimproved value of the land in the town, which he believed would be about £60,000 and a rate of 9d in the £ would bring in about the same as the present rate.  Many experienced men, he said, favoured the unimproved land value system.  The figures required would always be available from the Government when a new assessment was needed which would save money.  A man would not be penalised for improving his land, while owners of blocks held in speculation would contribute their full share.  A change to this system would need ratepayer approval.

Cr Riggs seconded, believing it was a fairer system because it would make absentee owners sell or improve.  The system of more improvement leading to more rates seemed unfair.

Cr Allen moved an amendment that last year’s assessment be adopted.  He could see no gain for the Council and some people would probably be hit who were not in a position to be hit.  Cr Harris seconded.

Cr Riggs urged that it was not an amendment and the Mayor agreed that it was a different motion.  The amendment was withdrawn.

Cr Bednall said it was too late to affect this year, but the facts and figures could be ascertained before deciding on the 1928 assessment.  Motion carried.

Cr Allen then moved that last year’s assessment be adopted.  Carried.

Cr Kellaway urged the removal of certain gum trees as they were drying off and becoming dangerous.  A limb had fallen in Bridge St.  Gum trees needed to be replaced by more suitable street trees.  Seconded Cr Allen.

Cr Riggs thought that an inspection of the town was needed as approaches for tree removal are inconsistent.

Cr Kellaway pointed to problems with roots growing right under houses and the threat of others to phone lines.  The motion was lost.
