Burra Town Council, 5 October

The Hydraulic Engineer pleaded that owing to pressure of business in preparing annual returns the particulars of the cost of the waterworks could not be ready for a little time and that as soon as the land was arranged the new machinery would be placed.

The Mayor reported that the surveyor had ‘found [it] impossible to accurately define the yard boundaries’ at the railway station.

Cr Ridgway pointed out the contradictory nature of the letters received from the Government on this subject.

Cr Symons called attention to the damage done to footpaths by the water from the eaves of cottages overhanging them in Market Square, Kingston St and elsewhere.

The Mayor said it was an evil that could only be overcome by a by-law.

Cr West objected to certain placed being singled out [by which he meant places owned by SAMA] when the problem was general.

Cr Symons said he simply mentioned places with much traffic.

Cr Sampson said ‘everyone asked to fix guttering had done so except the SAMA and except [one?] other person’.

The Council had only asked for guttering where the footpaths had been formed.

Mr West, as agent for SAMA had long ago promised to do the work and proposed to call tenders, but had never done it.

The Mayor said there were dozens of houses in North Ward besides those of SAMA doing the damage.

Cr West said it would cost £200 and lead to higher rents.  It was absurd to ask for it to please a fad of two people.
