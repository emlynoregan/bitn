Accident/Obituary.  At 3 p.m. on Tuesday Billy Marcus aged 10, the only son of Mr & Mrs B. Marcus of Aberdeen was drowned at the Mine Pool.  He was away from school due to an outbreak of chickenpox in the home and with Bob Goble and a little friend from Adelaide, visited the pool.  Bob is a High School boy and had the afternoon off because of a rehearsal at the Institute.  They were not swimming, but while Bob and his friend were on the west bank, Bill went to the north side and waded out to the old raft used when the pool was leased by the Swimming Club.  He climbed onto it, but it was waterlogged and capsized.  Seeing him struggling in the water Bob raced round the pool and pushed a plank out for him to grasp, but he missed it and went down.  The lads then raced off to get help.  Ken Walker, J. Clark, Rod Wilson and Paris Fuller dived to try to find him, but without success.  M-C Armstrong arrived with grappling irons and Mr Milton Tiddy took them out and at about 5 p.m. the body was recovered.  He had been a popular and capable student.  The funeral on Wednesday followed a service at St Mary’s.  Bearers were Ron Carpenter, Norman Allen, Joe O’Connell and Ted Fuss.

[William Marshall Marcus born 30 December 1926 Penola: died 15 December 1936 Kooringa, residence Aberdeen.]
