Kooringa News, 16 February

No one else has come out as a candidate for this district yet.

Mr Butti* from Adelaide has come to inspect the reported discovery of copper on Ware & Chapman’s Run.  He reported favourably and says there are also signs of gold in some of the specimens.  A rumour here says it contains 16 ounces to the ton, but as it has not been tested yet there can be no truth in such a statement.

[*In another place Butte.  SA Births, Marriages & Deaths do not record Butti and only a couple of instances of Butte.]
