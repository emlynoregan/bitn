Thamm’s White Hart Garage is marking its centenary this year.  It is believed to be the longest serving family operated business in the town, with current operators, David & Travis Thamm being the 4th and 5th generations respectively.  Formerly part of the White hart Hotel, the building was purchased by Emil Thamm, a wheelwright, in 1915, after operating for a year as a machinist working on the site.  Ron and Brian Thamm took over the business in 1950 and adopted the present name.  [2 photos.]
