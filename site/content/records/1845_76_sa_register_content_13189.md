Kooringa News, 4 April

Patriotic enthusiasm for the volunteer movement has evaporated and the election excitement has waned.  Now the only subject of interest appears to be the Snowy River diggings, for which it is expected many will leave after the next pay day at the Mine.

The Kooringa Wesleyan congregation farewelled Mr Flockart last Thursday at a tea meeting.  Mr T. Lloyd of Adelaide is expected to succeed Rev. Flockart.

The election for vacancies in the Legislative Council took place yesterday in the Burra Hotel, but it was all very quiet with only those voting attending.

Weather.  We have had several welcome showers and the surrounding plains have taken on a brighter appearance.  A considerable fall today has rendered the streets almost impassable and the creek has risen so as to oblige the hasty removal of the inhabitants of the creek huts.
