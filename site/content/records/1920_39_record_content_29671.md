The 1929 Seaside Trip.  The weather on 2 February was perfect.  The first train arrived at Semaphore at 8.45.  The two trains carried over 1,400 drawn from an area from Hallett to Merilden.  A train left Hallett at 5.09 a.m. and the Burra train left at the same time.  Many visitors to Adelaide went to the Test Cricket match.  Many old Burra residents came to meet friends at the beach.  The return journey went without a hitch.
