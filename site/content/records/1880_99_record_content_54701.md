Cr Linkson said the engineer was stated to have been in a certain place for four hours and on this charge had received a month’s notice.  Since then he had received three letters.  There was some discussion about whether the three letters should be read.

Cr Linkson then said Littlejohn was on duty:

11-12 at Hosking’s, 12-1 at Miller’s and 1-2 at J. Edwards’s and yet it was from11-2 that he was supposed to be neglecting his duty.  Further the statement he was neglecting his duty was made by one ratepayer and one non-ratepayer and the latter was a person who had been after his job for a long time and would do anything to get it.

Cr West said he would 2nd the motion as he had also found out the engineer was not guilty of the charges.  He now believed an investigation should be made.

Crs West, Walsh and Linskon voted for the motion and Crs Parks & Harris opposed.  Cr Sampson was absent so the required four were not voting.

The mayor expressed his sense of insult to the Council that Cr Sampson should have just walked out at this point.  He declared the motion carried, three Councillors and the Mayor having supported it.

Cr Walsh also said he was surprised and disgusted.

Cr Parks moved dissent from the Mayor’s ruling and asked permission to leave for a moment, which was granted.

When he returned Cr Harris 2nd the motion under clause 48, but the motion was lost with only Crs Parks and Harris supporting it.

Cr Parks then moved that Mr Littlejohn’s letter be received and his request granted.

Cr Sampson [apparently having returned un-noted] 2nd and it was carried unanimously.

Cr Sampson then moved for a public hearing at a special meeting on 25 September.

Council then squabbled over the reading of the minutes or not and when they eventually were read Cr Linkson moved their confirmation which was carried with the dissent of Cr Parks and three abstentions.

The Mayor put the question again and this time three were for and three against and it was declared carried.

Other business:

Cr Harris moved ‘That applications be received from persons willing to fill the position of engineer of the Burra Waterworks at £2-10-0 per week.’

The Mayor objected to put that motion – it was noted and not put.

Cr Linkson then tendered his resignation as he was leaving for WA.

Cr Walsh moved the resignation be received and the fine be not imposed.

It was resolved that nominations for a replacement Councillor be received on 1 October.
