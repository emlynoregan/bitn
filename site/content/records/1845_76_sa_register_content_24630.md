Ulooloo Diggings.  The Northern Argus reports a visit to the diggings.

A mate and I travelled on good roads from Mintaro to Ulooloo Creek on Mr Braylie’s Station.  We passed through the most romantic places possible called Hell’s Gates.  It is a narrow pass some 40 ft wide with towering rock standing perpendicular 90 to 100 ft and quite bare of soil.  This leads to a basin where the ore is washed and most of the diggers are encamped.  Water has to be carted up to three miles.  This hinders prospecting and those busy digging have not the means for real prospecting.  It is time the Government invested some money in prospecting; there are plenty of men who would avail themselves of the opportunity.  There can be no doubt that a large field exists here.  Mr John Rose has started a prospecting party at his own expense.  The diggings have not been carried out in a proper manner and there is no system evident.  The most likely place is Black’s Creek north of the Scrubber Mine.  This has not yet been prospected.  The digging has been confined to Coglin’s Gully.  During my stay I saw good nuggets and nice rough gold.  Some parties are doing well and some are unfortunate.  For those with time on their hands it is worthy of a try.  Provisions are cheap.  Many are now talking of leaving for shearing, but say they will return when they have some funds.  Last Saturday William bray, one of the diggers, lost his left thumb while our possum shooting when his gun burst.
