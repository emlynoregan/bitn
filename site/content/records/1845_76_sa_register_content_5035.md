Accident/Obituary.  An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel on Monday 30 September on the body of Martin Trebilcock, who was accidentally killed while working underground at the Burra Burra Mine.  William Lang, the Resident Magistrate, was the coroner.

His mate, who was working with the deceased, said that on Saturday afternoon they were working together with Trebilcock being in front, when some other miners gave the alarm that the ground was cracking.  Before the deceased could get out of the way a mass of ore fell from overhead, striking him on the back and almost burying him.  The ground had been propped that morning and every precaution seems to have been taken.  Deceased was taken out insensible and carried home.  Doctors Chambers and Bull attended.  The whole of the ribs on the right side were broken and he had severe spinal injuries.  The ribs had penetrated the lungs and Trebilcock died about an hour later.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.  Deceased was a respectable young man of about 24 and leaves a widow and one child.  He was a member of the Manchester Unity IOOF and was attended to the grave by members of the Burra Burra Lodge.  [Martin Trebilcock died 28 September 1850 aged 24.]
