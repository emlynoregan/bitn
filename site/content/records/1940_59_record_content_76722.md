Terowie Water Supply

At a public meeting on Tuesday 26 February Mr O’Halloran, Leader of the Opposition, spoke on a water supply for Terowie.  Alternative routes were suggested.  Figures from him show that about 26 million gallons of water were carried by rail from Burra to Terowie each year and the cost from 1 January 1955 to 31 January 1956 was £20,653, not counting repairs, maintenance etc. on railways.  Speakers suggested the mains should run from Hanson through Burra, Mt Bryan, Hallett and Whyte Yarcowie to Terowie, increasing the productivity of towns along the route.  The meeting adjourned to 5 March when Mr O’Halloran could attend.  He said the cheaper alternative would be for a six inch main from Belalie North to serve the 151 houses in Terowie, but he admitted the Hanson route, while much more expensive, would be better from a national development point of view.

[In addressing the question Mr Owen-Smyth of Ulooloo said the annual cost of transporting water from Burra to Terowie was c. £30,000.]
