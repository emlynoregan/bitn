Hanson Methodist Church held its Anniversary on Christmas Day.  Rev. T. Weatherill preached and the new Estey organ [of which details are printed] cost £72 and was opened on Christmas Day free of debt.  The tea meeting on 28 December was very successful when 120 came from Burra by train with many more by other means.  About £12 was raised.
