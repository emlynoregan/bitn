Burra Hospital Report

Dr Heddle & Dr Mellor have responded to the Board on the needs of the Hospital.

They have concluded that the renovations and reconstruction needed to bring it up to date are so extensive that the option of building a completely new hospital should be considered.

They suggest a two storey building   to the east of the present hospital, adjacent to Mr Sanderson’s home.  The top floor would be on a level with the Maternity Block and would comprise administration, X-ray, secretary’s office etc. with probably one ward on the ground floor.  Of the existing buildings, only the Maternity Block and Isolation Block would remain.  Included should be the building of a new Nurses’ Wing on the site of the present hospital, in the area of the eastern end of the Women’s and Men’s Wards.

Dr L.R. Mallen, of the Advisory Board of Hospitals, estimates a cost of £1,000 per bed and the new hospital would take in 28 beds, divided between 5 private rooms, 3 double rooms, a Men’s Ward of 6 beds, a Women’s Ward of 7 beds and a Children’s Ward with 4 beds, for a cost of £28,000.  An 18 bed Nurses Quarters would cost about £18,000.

If the community feels that this is impossible then the following are the recommendations, ranked as very urgent, urgent, and needed in 1 or 2 years.

Very Urgent

The kitchen is presently in a poor state of cleanliness and inconvenient.  The floor is rough and dirty.  Wash-up board is filthy and collected dirt between it and the wall is a breeding ground for flies and disease.  Flies crawl all over surfaces and food.  Screen and fly-wire doors do not work effectively.  We (the reporting doctors) feel if this is not acted upon within a month a report to the Central Board of Health must be made.

Women’s, Men’s and Private Rooms’ “Backs”

Paint work is rusty.  Bathroom and lavatory facilities are broken, the flush sink is cracked and the cistern is leaking.  Bed pans have to be emptied here and the whole place gives a feeling of nausea.  The whole of the “Backs” should be completely reorganised and rebuilt with sufficient lighting.  Lavatories and bathrooms need new flush sinks and cisterns.  Steam cleansers and sterilisers must be obtained.  Minor repairs and painting are also required.  The creek is a breeding ground for mosquitoes and urgency must be given to the satisfactory working of the new pump and to keeping the creek clear of weeds.  Rubbish has been allowed to accumulate under the Maternity Wing, around the woodheap and mortuary, providing a breeding ground for vermin.

Urgent

Floors.  New rubberoid flooring is needed in the Labour Ward.  Moisture getting onto the wooden floor and between the boards will sooner or later produce a severe infection problem.  New rubberoid was promised 12 months ago and needs immediate attention

New waterproof walls are needed in the Labour Ward, so they can be washed down and carbolised.  This ward also needs better lighting.

Sterilising tanks in the Labour Ward are leaking and should be replaced by electric sterilising tanks similar to those being installed in the main theatre of the Hospital.

The kitchen is far from hygienic and needs a new wash-up sink and board, preferably stainless steel.  The chimney needs improving and the room needs painting.
