Burra Town Council, 18 October

British Imperial Oil was given permission to lay a pipe from the station to the depot (Butterworth’s Mill) and to build certain buildings on the site.

The Local Govt Dept is to investigate roads re a request for a £600 grant.

New Assessment:	North Ward	£4,901

West Ward	£5,249

East Ward	£7,032

£17,182

This is an increase of £228 on 1925, mainly due to new buildings.  There are about 700 assessments.

Retiring Councillors are the Mayor, Cr Harris for East Ward, Cr Kellock for West Ward and Cr Riggs for North Ward.

Cr Woollacott gave notice of a call for a vote of ratepayers to readjust wards.

The Mayor said he would stand again to see the completion of projects started.

Funds in hand are: West Ward £400, East Ward £281 and North Ward £10 debit.

Cr Kellaway said the problem was that East and West Wards had a great deal of approved work that had not been done.  More work should have been done by putting on workers instead they had stuck in North Ward.  His ratepayers accused the Council of being absolutely controlled by the Chairman of Public Works [Cr Riggs].  He was inclined to agree.  As a member of the committee he had been asked about matters only twice in 12 months and he moved six casual men be employed to catch up on East and West Ward work.  This was carried with Cr Woollacott opposed.
