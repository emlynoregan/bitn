Youth Week in Burra began with a combined service in the Town Hall on 12 October.  School Children from Burra & Burra North & Salvation Army gathered with a number of parents and visitors, though there were still a number of spare seats.  The Mayor gave an introduction to the week and welcomed everyone.  Rev. C.L.H. Pitman gave the address and was assisted by Capt. McDonald.  [Report in just over 1 column.]
