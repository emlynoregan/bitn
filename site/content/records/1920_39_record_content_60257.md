Redruth Methodist Church held its annual Christian Endeavour Rally on Saturday & Sunday 29 February & 1 March.  Visitors from Adelaide joined locals in the rally. [The visitors included Miss Joyce Fairchild.]

A song service was held at 7.30 p.m. on Saturday with the rally following at 8 p.m.  On Sunday the visitors unofficially visited Redruth Intermediate & Junior Societies and the Kooringa Society.  Then they attended the Redruth morning service.  In the afternoon the group divided: one section attended Redruth Sunday School and the other two went to services at Hanson and Ironmine.
