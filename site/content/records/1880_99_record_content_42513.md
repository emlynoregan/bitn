Editorial on the Burra Waterworks.

A special meeting of Councillors on Thursday made some important decisions.

Last year the unworkable condition of the pumps and collapse of the well caused consumers to pay for what they could not get.  The meeting called for renewal of the lease for three years, the purchase of a boiler, and the reduction in value of the Capital Account.

We believe Burra is the only Corporate Town that runs its own Waterworks.  We commend the Council’s moves.
