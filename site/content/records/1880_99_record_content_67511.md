Karculta Mine.  The venturers could not get access to the land as the mining rights were held by SAMA which demanded £100 for a 20 acre site and 5% of the gross value of all metals obtained.  This was discussed in Parliament as an unreasonable demand.  Moves were made in Parliament to allow prospecting on privately owned land.
