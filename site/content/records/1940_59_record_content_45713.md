Burra Town Council

At the meeting on Monday it was suggested there was a lack of facilities for tourists to view the townâ€™s points of interest.  Many buses of tourists seldom went beyond Market Square and all too often did not even get to Burra North.  Cr Jennison thought they should ask the Tourist Bureau if they thought it a good idea for them to provide a local guide, who could point out the various points of interest.
