The size of the planned accommodation has been based on primary enrolments in Burra and district schools.  Secondary enrolments should exceed 200 by 1975, which justifies providing for 220-250 students, which would allow for the possibility of a 5th year class in the future.  The existing Burra School is a well-known landmark and is among the finest buildings of its type in SA.  It has, however, outlived its usefulness for modern educational conditions and needs extensive modifications to meet the requirements of modern educational programs.  The large rooms with high ceilings are hard to heat and cool and also present acoustic problems.  Little has been done in recent years to modify the original accommodation.  Administration facilities are inadequate.  The library is far below modern standards and the classrooms do not accommodate modern teaching methods.

The site has made development difficult and the outdoor areas fall far short of requirements.  Sports facilities are limited and in need of upgrading and development.  The site has also become cluttered by the erection of a multitude of wooden classrooms, a canteen and toilet blocks for both schools.  Many of these buildings have outlived their economic usefulness.  The plans prepared provide for upgrading of the main building to house a primary school of 350 in modern open-space accommodation.  This provision anticipates the eventual closure of Leighton (28 children), Farrell Flat (17 children) and Mt Bryan (36 children).  The plan groups buildings around a central courtyard at the rear of the old building and they are functionally linked by the resource centre, while the existing building will be extensively remodelled internally.  Planning and design is based on the open space principle.  All new buildings are single storey and are stepped up the rising ground so as not to distract from the appearance of the existing building, especially as seen from the town.  The relationships of the buildings and their uses allow for the separation or integration of the two schools as required.
