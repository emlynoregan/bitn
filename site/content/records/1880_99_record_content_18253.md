Letter from the Mayor, John Dunstan Jun. in response to a requisition to call a public meeting re the footway to Aberdeen.  He declined to call such a meeting and asserted that:

‘no possible good could come from such a meeting, as it could not interfere with the action of the Council, which is perfectly constitutional.’  It would provide a bad precedent.  He is confident he has the support of the majority of ratepayers.
