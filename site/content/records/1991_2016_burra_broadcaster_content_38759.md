Variety Bash SA will come to Burra on 16 August.  More than 300 ‘bashers’ will stay overnight with catering by the BBH Football and Betball Clubs, Burra Bowling Club and the Men’s Shed.  The local entrant is Car 66 ‘The Bravehearts’: John Gibson, Simon Drew, Ben Marshman and Peter Hayes.  They have raised $77,000 this year and are only about $8,000 short of raising $1 million in the more than 20 years involvement with Variety SA.  Their car is a Ford Galaxy.
