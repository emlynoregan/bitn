2nd leader on the Mayoral election. The editor comments that the Mayor stated at the outset that he had been misreported, but he did not say what was misreported — presumably nothing of great moment then! Mr Lipsett had our report for four days for any corrections before publication. Mr Lane also objected to the report in the Record — as the paper is merely ‘a party organ’. But in all cases but one on local matters the Record has been altogether on the side of Mr Lane. Letters from the public have been published from both sides. One letter was refused and that from the side opposed to Mr Lane. It was very personal and was only admitted as a paid advertisement.
