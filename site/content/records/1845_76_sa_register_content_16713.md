Mintaro News, 14 July

The roads are in a poor state and are unsafe for wheeled vehicles unless in broad daylight.

In the last few days we have lost our two schoolmasters; one accepted a better paid position and the other died.  It is to be hoped we will not be long without one as there are many children in the locality.  Also three out of four shoemakers left the village last week to proceed to a new town further north.

[The only death registered in this period was that of Patrick O’Connor 9 July 1863 near Mintaro aged 28, but the death may not have been registered as the correspondent also reports that they were without an agent or deputy registrar of births, marriages and deaths and the nearest was ten miles away over very bad roads.]
