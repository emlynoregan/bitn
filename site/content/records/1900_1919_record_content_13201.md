Burra Hotel.  C.C. Heinrich has effected considerable changes since taking over the Burra Hotel [in 1904].  Extra doorways have facilitated table service.  Extra parlours have been established, better ventilation in rooms and skylights to throw more light on food and drink.  Acetylene gas lighting is installed.  The bar has become a picture gallery and wall papering is under way now.  A saloon bar has been fitted out and there are couches and chairs as well as desks for correspondence by letter or telegram.  Yards, loose boxes and stables with feeders to accommodate the needs of teamsters and others.
