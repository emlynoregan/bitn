St Mary's. Subscriptions for the new church, which is of excellent design, are coming in. Mr McCulloch of Princess Royal promised £500 if others matched that and that condition has now been met. Promises and donations now £1,500 with costs estimated at something over £2,000. [McCulloch later denied having made any such promise.]
