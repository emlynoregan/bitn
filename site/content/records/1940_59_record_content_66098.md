Burra Town Council

At the last meeting the Council voted to receive a recommendation from the Picture Committee that a small committee of five members be formed to conduct the pictures.

This would involve rescinding a motion of 25 September 1950 that set up a committee of 12 comprising the Councillors and Mayor (7), Town Clerk, 2 representatives of the Institute Committee and 2 members invited by Council.

Cr Lehmann gave notice of his intention to move to rescind the 1950 motion.
