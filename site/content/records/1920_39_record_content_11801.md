Boz Pearce	promise

A.B. Riggs	seat

E.F. Marston	10/-

C. Bevan	concrete work

He had practically made arrangements for the Wireless Broadcasting Co. in Jamestown to give a concert on the night of the opening.

Rev. Ingamells spoke strongly in support – though he was doubtful of the wisdom of a water pond which would be dangerous for very young children.

Mr C. Bevan moved that Mr Foote’s actions be endorsed.  Carried.

A general committee was then elected with an executive of five: A.B. Riggs, J.R. Johns, D. Van Senden, M. Collins & R.P. Simpson.
