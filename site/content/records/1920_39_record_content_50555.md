Water Supply

A.D. McDonald has received a reply from the Commissioner of Public works concerning water quality from the government tank at Mongolata.  The water is discoloured due to the material used in half the catchment.  A bacteriological examination shows it safe to drink.  The matter is being taken up with the contractors who advised on the material used.
