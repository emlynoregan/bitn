Grasshopper Plague.  The locust plague this season is shaping to be a ‘biggie’.  They are best sprayed when they have all hatched and come together in bands.  Some spraying has been done on the Blyth Plains.  Spraying began east of Whyte Yarcowie on 23 October.  Planes are ready to attack the areas east of Burra, but so far weather conditions have been unfavourable.  Activity should increase this week.
