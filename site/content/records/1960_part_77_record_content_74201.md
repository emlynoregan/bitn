The ratepayers’ meeting on 10 February drew a representative gathering.  A resolution was passed approving the lease of a site for the planned new club house.  The procedure of the club borrowing money through the Council can now go ahead.

Over twelve months ago the Council received a loan of $7,000 for the purpose of constructing a dam across the Burra Creek.  The questions of possible flooding and of pollution have been taken into account by the E & WS Department and work has now been started on creating a shallow lake stretching from the Caravan Park to just north of the Burra Hotel.  Pumping from the Mine is expected to begin soon at the rate of about 2 million gallons per day.  The dam should be an attractive addition to the beauty of the town.

Following a deputation to the Minister of health it seems that the Burra Common Effluent Drainage Scheme will be constructed in 1976-77.

The Grants Commission has invited applications for funding to upgrade sports facilities.

BHS.  The year began with 172 students, slightly down on 1974 due to fewer 1st year students.  A new staff member Mr Colin Baker was welcomed.  Art teacher Mrs Schultz is unfortunately still on sick leave.  From now on year levels will be referred to as Grades VIII, IX etc.

The Meaning of STOP SIGNS will change on 1 March.

From that date you must stop and give way to all traffic from the right and the left.
