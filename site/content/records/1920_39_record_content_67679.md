LCL Burra District Committee met for the second time at Hallett Institute on Wednesday chaired by S.H. Robinson of Burra and with A.J. Melrose, State President present.

S.H. Robinson was re-elected District President with H.K. Moore & Mrs I.J. Warnes as Vice-Presidents.  Rules for the district were adopted.

Nominations were called for candidates for the State election for 8 September.

There was a discussion on the pros & cons of pre-selection.  Some thought it unnecessary now there was preferential voting, arguing that multiple candidates for a party maximised votes under this system and the press was running a campaign against pre-selection.  The outcome favoured pre-selection.  Details in just less than 3 columns.
