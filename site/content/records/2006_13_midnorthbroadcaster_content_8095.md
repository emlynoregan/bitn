SES assistance is only a phone call away.  Last week volunteer Wendy Williams hit the streets of Burra to publicise the availability of emergency services, by calling 132 500.  She was handing out brochures telling people the best ways of preparing for storms by cleaning gutters and downpipes and keeping roofs in good repair as well as securing loose items.  Tuesday s storm saw wind speeds reach 115 kph and Burra was lucky to escape with only minor damage.  [Photo]
