Burra Rifle Club shot the 8th stage of the Kookaburra Trophy on Saturday when best scores were by C.H. Dixon & H.L. Riggs.

Mt Bryan Methodist Fete on Saturday last week at the Institute Hall saw the ladies from the two Methodist Churches combine on the effort.

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held in the Institute 21 November and took nearly £60, which was deemed highly satisfactory.  It was opened by Mrs P.J. Pickering who is due to leave shortly for Albury NSW.  [Personal interest: Miss D. Fuss served on the Flower Stall.]
