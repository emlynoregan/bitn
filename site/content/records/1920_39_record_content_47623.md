Crown Lands Act Amendment Bill

A speech by G.F. Jenkins MP is reported at length her and is concluded on page 4.

[The essential problem being addressed was that many lands in SA that were held on either agreements to purchase or on perpetual lease had been initially valued very highly in prosperous times in the past and this had produced payment schedules that farmers and pastoralists could not meet or could not meet if they were to remain viable.  Jenkins also mentions properties along the Booborowie stock road which when resumed in 1919-20 and cut up a few years later were values at up to £32-10-0 an acre.  These men would not be aided by this relief proposal and needed other means of help.

The amendments proposed to allow agreements to purchase to become leases so that interest alone would be payable, not purchase money in addition.  Jenkins was concerned for those whose efforts to date had seen them pay off a substantial part of the purchase price.  He had an amendment which would preserve the right to purchase at some later time if circumstances improved – and to protect the portion of purchase price already paid and to maintain the original price as fixed.  He felt the Government would in any case have to reduce the purchase prices of many lands, however reluctantly.  In looking at the prices fixed far too high, he refers specifically to the mallee areas of Eyre Peninsula.  [Much more detail is included in the report.]
