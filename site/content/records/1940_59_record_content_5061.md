Christopher Gray [Rector of St Mary’s] writes a letter protesting against the desecration of the Sabbath – even for patriotic efforts and local defence training, unless they could absolutely not be held on Saturdays.  His specific complaint this week related to a case on the previous Sunday for which he considered there was no excuse.

[Though not named here, a subsequent letter showed the offensive behaviour to have been a cricket match.]
