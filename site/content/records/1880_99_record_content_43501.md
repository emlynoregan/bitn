At Baldina creeks and dams overflowed and saltbush was stripped to twigs, destroying essential summer feed.

J. Morgan lost his roof from three rooms with the iron carried ¼ mile away.

But the storm was very confined with very little rain at Shafton or at Mongolata.

Correspondents reported hail and storm damage as follows:

Mt Bryan - severe with a fall of 1.10” in a short time

Hallett - severe crop damage

Koolunga - severe crop damage with hail the size of pigeon eggs
