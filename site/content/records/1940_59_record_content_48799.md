Burra Talkies.  The new equipment for showing pictures at the Town Hall will be installed in two or three weeks and the first show is scheduled for Saturday 10 February.  All funds raised will pay off the new machinery and then the Town Hall debt.  Competition to supply film has been keen and we understand twelve monthsâ€™ supply of first class programs have been purchased.  The present lease expires on 29 January.  The proprietors have shown pictures in Burra for more than 30 years.
