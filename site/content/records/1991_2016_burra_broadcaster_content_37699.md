Tiver Reunion

Over 250 descendants of James Tiver came to Burra Town Hall for a reunion on Sunday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of James Tiver in Burra.  There was a brief thanksgiving service and a group photograph as well as the expected speeches etc.  Then the James Tiver Walk of Fame plaque was unveiled.

James Tiver of Bristol was one of four children born to Hugh Tiver and Rebecca nee Godwin.  He had little schooling and went to work when aged about 8.  He and his brother Charles learnt the trade of mason, though their father was a baker.  James married Elizabeth South and had a son James Hugh, born at Newport and the young family sailed from Plymouth in the barque David Malcolm, arriving at Port Adelaide 30 April 1855.  They were met by an uncle, James Rosser.  A daughter Margaret Malcolm was born on the voyage.  They came to Burra by bullock dray and put up a two-roomed wattle and daub hut near the ford [now a bridge] in Young Street.  Elizabeth died of tuberculosis [29 November 1856] and James later [7 February 1858] married Emma Price, who had come from Plymouth in the Alloquis in 1856.  James built the middle house on the row [on the north side of Truro Street] in Redruth and most of the ten children of his second family were born there.  With Emma’s help he added houses either side of the first to make a row now known as Tiver’s Row.  He did contract work for the Burra Mine for about two years and carrying business between Pt Adelaide and Burra.  In 1870 he built the house and store in Aberdeen where the family then lived.

Emma and James Hugh ran the store, while James continued with contracting work, having up to 100 men employed by him at times.  He helped to build the Wallaroo Smelting Works, macadamised roads in the Burra district, the Aberdeen Ford, Redruth Bridge, the Burra Institute, the station yards and station and railway houses from Tarlee to Farrell Flat.  James opened a branch store at Hallett after the railway reached there in 1878 and later took up land at McVitties Flat, Hallett, Banbury, and with his sons, Pat’s Well, Yunta (later known as ‘Tiverton’).  James was a Town Councillor [December 1883 to November 1887], a JP, Superintendent of the [Redruth Wesleyan/Methodist] Sunday School and an office bearer in the [Redruth Methodist] Church for many years.  He was also connected with the Oddfellows and Masonic Lodges for most of his life.

[The list of buildings etc. attributed to James Tiver should not be taken at face value.  They need to be checked carefully.  Two observations indicate the care needed:

The Redruth Bridge that is still there, although disused, dates from 1879.  It is a steel bridge and was erected by Duncan Grant.  It replaced a timber bridge erected in 1861, for which Tiver constructed the masonry abutments.  It may be that these abutments were used again for the replacement bridge.

James Tiver got the contract for the last half mile of the railway line into the Burra Station and associated work.  He seems to have been responsible for the platforms/wharfs and may well have been responsible for the 1870 railway station.  BUT the existing railway station was erected only in 1883 by Sara & Dunstan.]
