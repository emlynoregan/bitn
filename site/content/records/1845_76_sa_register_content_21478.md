A sheep farmer less that 50 miles away, hearing about the amount of distress in the area, generously offered 25 fat sheep to be distributed as a New Year’s treat.  In response a committee was formed and about £20 collected.  As a result this morning about 55 families were furnished with a good supply of mutton and groceries.  The general ration per family was:

½ sheep

10 lb flour

7 lb potatoes

½ lb tea

2 lb sugar

2 lb currants

1 lb raisins

2 oz candied peel

1 oz spice

Watch Services were held at 10.30 p.m. last night at all chapels.

A New Year’s Ball was held at the Burra Hotel.

Messrs Cobb & Co had 250 acres of wheat in crop, most of it being cut for hay and 60 acres left for wheat.  One patch of 10 acres yielded 65 bags and another 12 acres averaged 22 bushels per acre.  Reaping is general now with no rust to speak of.
