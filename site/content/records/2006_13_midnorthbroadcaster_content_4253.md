Letter.  Julian Ratcliffe responds to the article on Burra’s ghosts.  He takes issue with heading such stories as history – ‘rich stories’ they may be, but not history.  Halloween is an American phenomenon that we could well do without.

‘How can one possibly estimate the percentage of haunted houses in Burra?  Well I can.  My estimate is far more accurate, scientific, reliable and credible.  None.’

He then tells the history of the Kooringa Hotel site.

The early building on the site was a Congregational Church and later a Welsh Chapel.  It became a Church of England Grammar School in 1864 – conducted on principles similar to the Collegiate College of St Peter in Adelaide.  It closed in 1873.  It was demolished in 1884 and the stone stored at the Unicorn Brewery, whose owners then built the Kooringa Hotel on the site.  In 1912 the stone was used in the new residence for the Primary School Headmaster.

‘The Kooringa Hotel [is] a grand hotel that doesn’t need a ghost to promote it.’
