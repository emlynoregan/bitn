Snow at Burra.  On Wednesday 10 September the morning was intensely cold, but those who were up early saw a healthy fall of snow.  Snow began to fall at about 11 p.m. on Tuesday night.  From about 2 a.m. to dawn there were further falls and some showers of rain, but by dawn the ground was covered by about two inches of snow.  Snowballing was indulged in and snowmen were made.  At ‘The Gap’ Mr A. Tenant reported 4 to 6 inches of snow and heavy falls were also reported from Princess Royal, Mt Bryan Hills, Mallett & Pandappa Stations and also from World’s End.
