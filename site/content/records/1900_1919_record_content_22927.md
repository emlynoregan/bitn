Obituary.  There is a report on the memorial service for the late William Prior at World’s End Church last Sunday.  He was born at St Ostle in Cornwall 78 years ago and came to SA with his parents in 1854 and worked at the Burra Mine until it closed some 30 years ago.  He then took up land in Baldina.  About 45 years ago he joined the Primitive Methodist Church under Rev. Joseph Warner, then in charge of the circuit.  He was at his death Superintendent of World’s End Sunday School, as he had been for 12 years.  He died 22 October.
