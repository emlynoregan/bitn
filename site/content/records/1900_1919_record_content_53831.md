Fire.

On Monday a large grass fire started on A.G. Gebhardt’s property at Mt Bryan in the paddock known as Develaing’s to the east of the railway on part of Boolcunda Station.  The origin is unknown.  Help soon rushed to the site and fighters were helped by the lack of wind.  The fire ran through both A.G. & L.W. Gebhardt’s and into Mt Cone – O.R. Robinson’s and thence towards James Reed’s Wandillah. 500 acres of this was burnt to check the oncoming flames.  After midday the wind rose, but by 4 p.m. the fire fighters had it contained to the edges of a creek when a whirlwind spread it to another 4,000 acres of splendid feed.  Control was established about 8 p.m.  It was about 6 miles east of Burra and every available man had gone.  Miss Clarice Reed worked tirelessly on horseback moving sheep from the line of fire and wasn’t out of the saddle till 10 p.m. except to change horses.  A.G. Gebhardt has lost almost all feed on the run and with W.L. Gebhardt has seen about 6,500 acres of feed burnt.  Mr R.O. Robinson’s [sic] Mt Cone loss is c. 800 acres and Mr R.M. Hawker’s c. 50 & James Reed c. 1,000.  It is believed not more than 12 sheep were lost and the fire moved too rapidly to burn fences.
