A.J. & P.A. McBride advise they do not want to let the slaughterhouse as a pound.

Mr Robert Fuss wrote an indignant letter in response to the Council’s censuring him for late application to build the Bon Accord verandah.  He said he had been given permission by the inspector.  A letter is to be sent to him explaining that the inspector had been absent from the Council meeting and so the Council was unaware he had indeed given permission.

RSA replied that they are gratified that the Council is keeping the guns in the square, though they regretted that both the Rotunda and the Memorial will not be enclosed.  They included a plan to give a circular end to the enclosure instead of a square one, to make it safer.

The Bon Accord Bridge requires new metalling.

Various road and path matters were dealt with.

The Playground Committee is to be given a year’s lease on the playground.  [Actually the paper says ‘a years’ lease, but . . .]

The Mayor said he had talked to Dr Steele, President of the RSA and believed he was essentially in favour of Cr Riggs proposal for the Square if the enclosure had its square corners removed.  After considerable discussion it was decided to call tenders for the work.

Cr Kellaway then gave notice that at the next meeting he would move to rescind Cr Riggs’ motion deciding on the scheme.
