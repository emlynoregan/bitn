Obituary.  Mr E.A. (Ted) Beckwith died at the Burra Hospital on Easter Sunday aged 81.  He was born at Mt Bryan and was the son of the late John & Elizabeth Beckwith.  In 1907 he married Miss Harriet Ann Dixon and went to live at Belalie North, where the couple made their first home.  He took up farming there and later at Canowie until his enlistment in the First World War.  After a severe illness in the army Mr Beckwith and his wife came to live in Burra where he became a contractor and dam sinker.  This took him all over the northern and eastern parts of the state.  He continued this work till 1930 when he left Burra to take up farming once more at Kangaroo Flat.  In 1942 he retired to Burra where he remained till his death.  He is survived by his wife, who is at present in a City Hospital and by two foster children: Mrs Moreland of Loveday and Mrs Stone of Gawler.

[Page 2 adds to the above, saying that they lived in East Street and that he was an uncle and foster father to Dulcie, Mrs Moreland and Joyce, Mrs Stone.  Dulcie Patricia McDonald and Joyce Lorraine McDonald were the daughters of E.A. Beckwithâ€™s youngest sister, Ethel Beatrice Florence Maud, who died in 1923 about two and a half years after the death of her husband William McDonald.

Edward Arthur Alfred Beckwith born 16 July 1873 Ulooloo: died 10 April 1955 Burra.]
