Obituary & Inquest.  The funeral of the late Mr Charles Daulby took place last Friday.

Mr Daulby was killed in a quarry accident last week, leaving a destitute wife and two children.

Mr W.R. Ridgway JP conducted an inquest into the death of Charles Daulby at the Redruth Courthouse on Wednesday afternoon.  Deceased had died from injuries received while working at the Aberdeen Quarry.

John G. Midwinter:

Was present when the fall occurred about 4.15 p.m.; had cautioned the deceased about the danger of the spot, but the latter thought it safe.  About a ton of stone fell and deceased was alive when Midwinter left to get a doctor.

William Diplock:

Was also present and confirmed Midwinter’s evidence.  With Mr Camp’s help had got the deceased out and wrapped him up and sent for a doctor and conveyance.

Dr Brummitt:

Visited the deceased at his home three times in the evening and believed his back was broken, though this could not be confirmed without further examination.  Deceased had died about midnight.

Morris Jenkins could add little to the above.

Verdict was death by accident and the jurymen handed over their fees to be given to the widow.  A subscription list has been set up.  [Born 16 November 1863, died 20 April 1892.]
