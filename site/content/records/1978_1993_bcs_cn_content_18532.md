Paxton Square

The public are invited to inspect the recently completed Paxton Square row of cottages on Wednesday 3 May from 2 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  With this work the square has now been completely restored and adapted for family holiday accommodation.  The cottages are proving very popular and an asset to Burra.
