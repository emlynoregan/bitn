Letter from W.H. Hardy, taking issue with W.R. Ridgway over the Waterworks.  When Ridgway says ‘one reason for the aforesaid failure is that water has been consumed for public purposes for which no payment has been made’

‘Surely Mr Ridgway has a brassy front to make such an assertion knowing as he does that he has used water in the reserve near his property in growing tomatoes, pumpkins, melons, &c. which has been sold in Mr Rayner’s store, and for which he personally has reaped a benefit, and when he was presented with the account for such water he objected to pay for it.  I take it, if every other ratepayer had been as honest as Mr R - - the waterworks would have been much more in debt today than it is.’

[Following this Ridgway threatened a libel case.  While no doubt the law was on Ridgway’s side in not paying the water account because there was no individual meter for the reserve concerned, the facts were essentially as Hardy stated and were public knowledge, having been previously reported in the paper.  The aspersion on Ridgway’s honesty is, of course, another matter and no doubt would have been the crux of any case brought.]
