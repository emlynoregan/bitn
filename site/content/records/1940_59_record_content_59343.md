Coronation Celebrations

On Tuesday a procession marched through the gaily decorated streets to the War Memorial Oval where the Children’s Sports Day was held.  The Marananga Band led the two ‘B’ Platoons of the 27th Scottish SA Regiment in a column of threes, marching in kilts with fixed bayonets, among them Burra’s own local boys.  Captain Foster of Bungaree was in charge with CSM WO II McFarlane, Permanent Army, from Clare.  Next came members of the Burra Sub-Branch RSL, Air Force Assoc., Fathers’ Assoc. and Demobilised Soldiers’ Assoc., children of Burra High and Primary Schools and then those of Booborowie, North Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Farrell Flat, Hanson and Gum Creek Schools.  The procession marched first to the Hospital and then back, picking up the children at Market Square on the way to the War Memorial Oval.

On a dais to take the salute were the Mayor W. Carpenter, Major C.P. Tracey (OC B Company), Mr M.N. Gibson (President of Clare RSL), Mr C.H. Griffen (President Burra RSL), Mr W. Young (President Burra Air Force Assoc.) and Mr A.G. Woodman (Burra Demobilised Soldiers’ Assoc.)

At the Oval Rev. Christopher conducted a short religious service in which Pastor B. Ashdown led the people in prayer.  Major Tracey gave a short address, as did the Mayor, who then inspected a guard of honour formed by the 27th SA Scottish.

Sports then followed.  [Organisers are listed and sports results printed.]
