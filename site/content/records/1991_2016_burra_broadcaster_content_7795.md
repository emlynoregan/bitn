The Quilting Exhibition ‘Needles Through Time’ was opened by Judy Walkington (nee Pritchard) who in 1986 held the first quilting class in Burra.  President Moira Miller, on behalf of Burra Quilters, presented a wall hanging celebrating the Jubilee Year to the Burra Burra District Council.  In the work, landmarks and sheep drawn by Leonard Bence were incorporated into a ‘crazy’ patchwork depicting early Burra in colour and photographs.  The Quilt Competition was won by Karen Blunt of Farrell Flat.
