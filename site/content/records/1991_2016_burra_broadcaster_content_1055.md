Burra Real Estate has been selling ‘like hotcakes’ over the past few months.  People from within the town have been investing, retirees have moved in and AdChem employees have taken up residence.  The demand has been across all types of houses – old, modern, stone and timber framed, as well as for farmlets and building allotments.
