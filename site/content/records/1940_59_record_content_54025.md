Burra Caravan Park

Mr Carpenter says he has £10 in hand and a promise of gates for the park.  The Town Clerk said that some time ago the Director of the Tourist Bureau had said that if plans for the park were approved by himself and the Minister of Works, there could be a Government subsidy of £ for £.  The Mayor believes quite an attractive park could be made for about £150 and with a subsidy only £75 had to be raised.  The £10 in hand and the gates reduced this still further.  The intended site is near the Children’s Playground opposite the Post Office.  At present the playground is not in very good condition.

The Burra Cemetery needs a clean-up with high grass in places.  It is beyond one man to keep it in order and a working bee is suggested.
