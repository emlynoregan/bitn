Burra Town Council, 17 December

The Highways & Local Government Department has granted a loan of £256-10-0 over five years for the purchase of a concrete mixer.

An invitation for Council to attend the Buffalo Lodge’s Christmas Tree Festival was accepted.

Crossings are to be made to effect entrance to each new Housing Trust home in Queen St, with owners to pay half the cost.

L.L. Fiebig applied for entrances to be made to the building and patrol pumps at the new site in Best Place.  A plan was called for.

The Overseer will inspect the swing bridge and make it safe.
