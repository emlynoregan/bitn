Burra Town Council, 2 September

The newly formed Ladies’ Hockey Club was granted the use of Victoria Park.

The Aberdeen Croquet Club sought help in beautifying land recently acquired.  The Mayor felt that Council finances at present precluded any aid.  North Ward Cr Jennison also regretted that finances prevented Council assistance and after discussion the matter was dropped.

Cr Kellaway again raised the question of the need for a second horse for Council work.  The present one was not up to the work required of it.  In any case, at present it had a bad foot and needed a spell.

[With the Mayor opposed to any purchase, the debate seems to have meandered somewhat and the subject of a truck was also raised.]

Eventually it was resolved to hire a horse when necessary and that the present animal be spelled when possible.

The Commissioner of Public Works advised there was no intention of sealing the road to Burra as a centenary project and no prospect of doing it at all for at least three years.

The Mayor thought the road east from Mr Bednall’s (corner of Ludgvan St and Smelts Rd) should be taken over by the Main Roads Department.

Cr Jeffery said, if it were not, the Council would have a big job and the dust was also bad there.

Kooringa Methodist Church and Trust benefited from a fair held on Friday afternoon with the theme of an Australian Bush Fair.  It was opened by the Mayoress, Mrs T.H .Woollacott.  With gross takings of £108-12-3 and a nett profit of just over £102, it was a most satisfactory affair.  [Details in c. 1½ columns.]

Mr S.E. Stewart was farewelled on Friday 6 September.  He is leaving Burra to go into business in Adelaide.  He will be missed in sporting circles, especially at the Burra Golf Club.  He was presented with a travelling rug.
