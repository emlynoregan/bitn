Witness 9.  H.J.B. Jennison

Tyre & Service Station Proprietor

Town Councillor for eight years and incoming Mayor.

Betting shops would encourage betting by minors.

Sports had flourished in the town before betting shops.

In the days of betting shops it had been difficult to get young people interested in sports because they wanted to listen to the races.

Illegal betting was better under any circumstances because young people would not be encouraged to go into betting shops.
