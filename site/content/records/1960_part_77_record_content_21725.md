Kooringa Methodist Church will celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the present building next Sunday 4 October.  Rev. G.C. Hutchinson, a former minister of the Kooringa Church, will return as guest speaker.  He was stationed at Burra 1933-36.  The first Wesleyan Methodist church was built on the present site in 1847 by Rev. John Harcourt and enlarged under Rev. H.A. Wilson who was in charge 1854-58.  A gallery was added in the time of Rev. R.C. Flockhart, who followed Rev. Wilson.  The building served for 66 years before being replaced in 1914 under the direction of Rev. J.H. Nield.  A capacity crowd of 400 filled the church to commence the three day celebration of its opening.  Guests at the time included the President of the SA Conference, Rev. G. Hall, the Rev. Samuel Knight (a former minister), Rev. Henry Howard (a notable preacher from Pirie St Methodist Church, Adelaide) and His Honour the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Way, whose father was a Primitive Methodist Minister in Burra.
