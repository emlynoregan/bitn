Burra High School.  A recent report recommends the closure of Burra High School and the centralising of secondary education at Peterborough.  The Burra High School Council sent a deputation to meet the Minister of Education to argue for the retention of the school.  The Mayor raised the matter at the Council meeting on Monday and deplored the prospect of 60 young people being thrown onto the street with no prospect of work.  If they were sent to Peterborough it would cost at least £60 p.a. plus school fees suggested at £9-9-0; quite beyond the means of most parents.  The Council unanimously endorsed a motion of Cr Button that the rural areas not be penalised every time economy is proposed and that country schools not be closed unless all the city school are also closed.
