Sunday Sport – Letters

‘Have a Guess’ considers the town’s in a bit of a mess.  Having interfered in the price of milk question, there are now no deliveries.    Then there is Sunday Sport.  ‘Tommy’ wants to invoke unwritten law – ‘Lex non Scripta’, under which a man can slit his wife’s throat, or worse still, a woman can club her sleeping husband’.

And who are these Hoodlums Stanley refers to?  The mayor seems a bit perplexed and Bauldie wanted to hide behind a smoke screen.  Only Bish put up a wall of logic against Tom’s time worn blusterings.

‘Perhaps we are a bit too wowserish…Above all let the churches keep out of this fight.  At time like these, they should sing “Peace, perfect peace” perhaps they could tune into “Fight the good fight” later when the mists have rolled away.’

‘The Man Who Sees’ considers that to say the Council is impotent to prohibit Sunday games, can at best be a half truth.  The light of Sunday Observance has been burning brilliantly too long to allow any interference to either diminish or extinguish its power by any individual, group or society; in any community; and can anyone be so unwise to believe that communities have been left without any protection from intrusion of their Sunday Observance.  The writer says the Municipal Act gives the Corporation power to act in all sorts of emergencies and in particular one clause gives it the power to act ‘For the better observance of Sundays’.  Furthermore only the Council has the right to exercise full control as set out in the Act and not the leaseholders.  Also the lease can only be granted for 21 years and must be approved by the decision of the Ratepayers.

‘The very essence of the 40 hour working week in the light of reason is an added safeguard to strict Sunday Observance.’

A.L. Bence writes takes issue with being categorised by Mr Stanley Woollacott as ‘Hoodlums’.   He outlines the meeting of the Tennis club that led them to write to the Council seeking clarification on the matter of sport on Sunday.  He points out that the meeting was chaired by their Patron, Mr Frank Reed, a gentleman, well known in the town and who has himself and his family before him done a lot of good for Burra.

Those attending the meeting included a number of ladies who were the ones during the war were in the forefront, when it came to working for our lads overseas and the majority of the men were returned boys, sons of well-known townspeople.  He says everyone is entitled to their opinion as far as Sunday sport is concerned.  He refers to Rev. Donald Redding, one of the town’s most popular Rectors, who made a special early time to attend Holy Communion on Sunday mornings so we could go to golf afterwards, his contention was that healthy sport harms nobody.  The letter, he affirms, expresses not just the opinion of himself and his family, but those of a number of the ‘Hoodlums’ referred to and he thinks the only decent thing would be for Mr Stanley Woollacott to apologise to the ladies and gentlemen for his thoughtless remarks.

Florence Scroop also writes to take up the ‘Hoodlum’ remark.  She has a husband, two daughters, one sister, three brothers, two sisters-in-law and a son-in-law who are members of the Aberdeen Tennis Club and she defies Mr Stan Woollacott or anyone else to class any of these persons as a hoodlum.  ‘He should be made to publicly apologise.’
