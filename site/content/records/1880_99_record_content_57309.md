3rd Leader:  Acting on the Quiet.

After the closed session of Council last week the Councillors have said: ‘Oh we don’t care if you call 50 ratepayers’ meetings, we won’t resign.’

They are unfit to represent ratepayers.  ‘The Council was never in a worse position than now, and a change is absolutely necessary.’
