Burra High School.  The seventh High school Ball was an outstanding success with over £104 taken at the door.  Mr I. Burdon was MC and Johnnie Green’s Dance Band supplied the music.  The nett result is likely to exceed £80 to be spent by the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. to benefit the scholars.

Burra Electric Supply Co. franchise expires about the end of November.  For how long will it be extended?  When will ETSA take over and will its supply match the good record of the local company for uninterrupted supply?

Burra Homing Club.  The third race from Tailem Bend was won by E.J. Reed, making three in a row.
