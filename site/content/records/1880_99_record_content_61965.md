Sir Richard Chaffey Baker, writes another article on Federation: Its Disadvantages, but he finds few and instantly seeks to disarm them.

Cost: but the economies to be achieved in many areas like customs, postal services, telegraphs, etc. should match or exceed costs.

The loss of prestige for the local Parliament.

Injury to the present capitals, but this has not been the experience in Canada, USA or Switzerland.

Customs tariff decisions will be made federally and not by the SA people, but the only ones with something to fear might be those local manufacturers disadvantaged by internal free trade.  Surveys suggest few in SA fear this.

There will be a transfer to the Federal Government of certain subjects, but it will all still be democratically decided and only three areas of social importance will move to federal jurisdiction:

a.) Customs tariff & excise

b.) Naval & military affairs

c.) Aliens and coloured races
