Kooringa News, 1 August

On Friday 27 July Messrs Everard MP and Bright MP, two Commissioners of the Road Board, visited Kooringa.

Just before they arrived news had been received that more than 100 men were to be discharged from the Mine.  As a consequence the local SM and several other residents waited on the Commissioners in the hope that some of these men might be employed on improving the wretched roads in the neighbourhood.  Mr Bright said tenders would immediately be called for making a piece of road between MacNamaraâ€™s contract and the metalled portion near the Burra Hotel.

As for the Kooringa-Redruth Road, the surveyor would look at it in the morning and the subject would be considered at the next meeting of the Board in Adelaide.  He was sorry to learn so many were out of work, but believed several road contractors were looking for workers. He added that the Government would only give piecework.  He urged the propriety of forming District Councils and he thought it was a scandal that the northern areas had not taken advantage of this method of making roads.
