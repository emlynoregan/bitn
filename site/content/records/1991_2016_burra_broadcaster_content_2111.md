Main Street Program

The Burra Burra DC needs the co-operation of main street traders and residents to carry out this program.  Burra Traders President Jenny Field expressed enthusiasm and urged all shopkeepers and members of the public to participate in the public meeting later this month.

The regeneration process has already started in parts of the US, Canada, NSW and Queensland.

The main objectives of the program are:

Develop or redevelop centres suffering downturn

Create jobs by carrying out necessary work or in consequence of improved trading

Improve the appearance of main streets

Encourage self-help development and community involvement

The local community must decide whether to proceed with the proposals.

For many country centres business growth depends on attracting outside trade.  Local buying power is already stretched to the limit and probably declining as commodity prices fall.
