Meals on Wheels Burra has received a subsidy of $437 for the meals served in twelve months.  The service started on 26 July 1971, since when 4,600 meals have been served.  Subsidy for the first six months was $100, so it would appear to have been doubled.  A doctor’s certificate is required to qualify for the service.  Hospital kitchen staff cook the meals and volunteers deliver them.  Miss P. Jones and Mrs M. Anderson do additional cooking.  Contributions from patients [clients?] reimburse the hospital.  Helpers to deliver and drive are needed.  Christmas hampers are also needed.

The Crippled Children’s Door Knock Appeal raised $224 at Burra & Farrell Flat.
