Central Road Board: The Main Road to Burra

A memorial from 70 inhabitants of Black Springs, the Wakefield and Farrell’s Flat called for the adoption of Mr Macaulay’s No. 6 line of road.

Mr McEwin wanted the matter adjourned in the absence of Mr Kelly, but the Chairman said the Government was waiting for a decision and all works on the toad were stopped pending that decision.
