'T.B.' of Mt Bryan writes:

I call the attention of the Government to the state of the road north of Burra on what is known as Middle Camp Flat, which is at present nothing but a quagmire and all but impassable.  It is almost level and could be fixed with little expenditure.  It needs a drain on the west side and a deepening of the drain on the east side.  A little spent now before the wool season commences would save a large expenditure in the future.
