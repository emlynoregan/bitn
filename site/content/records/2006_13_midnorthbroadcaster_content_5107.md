Michelle Osborn & Bruce Gundersen have joined the Mid North Broadcaster as reporters and are about to take over editorial coverage of the paper.  [Photos of each and further details in a half-page report.]

Bruce and wife Heather have left behind two adult children in Adelaide and moved to a farming property between Mt Bryan and Hallett last November.  Heather is working part-time at Saltbush.  Bruce brings 20 years of managerial experience with Detmold packaging and has a passion for photography.

Michelle Osborn has lived in Burra since she was 4.  After a stint in Adelaide and elsewhere in SA after Year 12, Michelle returned to Burra in 1991 where she lives with her partner Steve and daughters Amy (nearly 11) and Kloe (almost 5).  She is a veteran of basketball and coach of the Burra based Wildcats for 15 years.  For the past year she has been the Burra correspondent for the Flinders News.
