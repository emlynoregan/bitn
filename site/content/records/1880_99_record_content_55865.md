Burra Town Council, 15 January.

Moved Cr Harris and 2nd Cr Rabbich that Council go into committee.

Cr Sampson objected, saying that they were sent to attend to ratepayers’ business in an open manner.

Cr West also objected to the move, but the motion was carried.

The press later learned that in committee Cr Sampson moved that Council proceed with open doors.  Cr West 2nd.  Motion lost, but after further consideration a similar motion moved by Cr Rabbich and 2nd Cr West was passed.

Consideration of Joseph Snell’s letter was deferred.

The rates were declared: General 1/-, Health 3½d (down ½d), Parklands 2½d (down ½d).

The Town Clerk is to procure assessment books for the Waterworks and make arrangements for the transfer of the Waterworks property to the incoming engineer.
