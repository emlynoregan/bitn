Man Missing.  News was received on Monday morning that Mr Keutchemeister [sic] of Baldina was missing.  He went with his daughter and a lady friend to the train on Friday morning, when the two women took the train to the north.  He stayed in town till Saturday night and then started for home from Redruth, but failed to arrive.  The horse and trap were found on Sunday at Mr Pryor’s and a search revealed no trace of Mr Keutchenmeister [sic].  The search so far has not found him.  He is 51 and has a wife and 11 children.  Some time ago he put his friends to similar trouble when he got out of his cart in a ‘sleepy’ condition and selected a small creek in which to pass a few quiet hours to refresh himself.  On that occasion he was found peacefully asleep.
