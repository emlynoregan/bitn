Local Board of Health

The Central Board of Health wrote asking what action had been taken to obviate the offensive odour from the Burra Bacon Factory refuse pit.  The Health Officer had reported on the matter and ordered improvements, failing which the factory and its pit should be closed.  The Mayor said the problem was difficult, as the factory was an asset to the town.  Cr Bevan and Cr Lee had inspected the soakage pit on the banks of the creek and a pool of black slime was being formed where water was soaking through the bank.  Cr Bevan agreed the factory premises were good, but that was no reason to allow water therefrom to run into the creek.

The present state of the drainage and septic system at the hospital was also quite unsatisfactory.

A special meeting with the Burra Bacon Factory proprietor and the Chairman of the Hospital Board has been arranged for 30 January.
