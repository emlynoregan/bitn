A Pot-Pourri

February 1999 saw some 1500 people attend the sale at Denton’s General Store in Farrell Flat.

Burra recruiting drive for ambulance volunteers netted ten.

At Adchem production records reached a new height for copper oxide.

Burra Visitor Centre gained accreditation.

Burra collected a swag of awards at the Classic Country Mid North Tourism Awards:

One for the Visitor centre

One for the Passport

A courtesy award for staff member Elly Nicholls.

But the Town Tour Bus was stolen and wrecked.

About one third of the region’s schools opted to join Partnerships 21.
