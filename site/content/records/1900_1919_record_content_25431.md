Burns and Crewes were also engaging in some inaudible, but apparently frank exchanges and eventually Cr Crewes got up and seated himself on the opposite side of the Chairman.

Mr Ockenden then moved Mr Burns be allowed to explain.

Cr Crewes demanded the same right.

There was general hubbub and eventually the chair called on Cr Lowe to speak as candidate for North Ward.  He said he would do his best if elected.

Mr Hardy was then called to speak as East Ward candidate, but he wondered how his name was listed as he was not a candidate – yet.

S.M. Lane then spoke briefly followed by C.A. Lott and then Mr Ockenden, who spoke at great length about the desirability of mayors not serving longer than two years, but regretted that Dr Sangster had not continued for a second year.  He spoke in favour of protecting Victoria Park.  The Council should also own a quarry of its own – in 30 years it had paid some £900 in royalty.  It had also paid some £1,000 for use of the Council Chamber and should have a room of its own, or else own the Institute.  He then had to stop on account of a pain in his heart.

Mr Hardy then rose to say he had decided to stand and denied the suggestion that he and Mr Crewes had concocted the petition calling on the latter to stand.  He favoured tree planting, Market Square improvements and improvements at Victoria Park and a new fence to Jubilee Avenue.  And a fire hose for the town – a matter that had still not been brought to a head. Tar paving of footpaths was needed and more work done in the back parts of town.  A public abattoirs was needed.

A. Harris briefly called on voters to ‘give him a vote on December 4 and never mind the other fellow’. [i.e. Hardy]
