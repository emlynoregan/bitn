Kooringa News, 28 August

Last Sunday the anniversary of the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel was celebrated.  Preachers were Rev. H. Cole of Strathalbyn and resident minister Rev. J.D. Whittaker.  There was a full attendance on each occasion.  On Monday the usual tea meeting drew so many that four sittings were needed.  About 400 were catered for.  At the public meeting many were compelled to stand.  Rev. Whittaker announced that this would be his last anniversary here as he was leaving the colony for New Zealand in about eight weeks.  The amount raised during the services was £55-17-11½, reducing the debt to £210.

Last evening a meeting was held to consider the advisability of petitioning the Governor to dissolve the present Parliament on account of their recent decision regarding Mr Justice Boothby.  Unfortunately the weather was so inclement during the afternoon and evening that very few attended.  The meeting resolved to adjourn till next Tuesday and asked Chairman Mr H. Corey to advise their three representatives and Messrs Forster and Barrow, if they should be disposed to attend.

On Monday there was a public holiday for the Prince Consort’s birthday.

Times here are bad with little business activity.  30-40 hands have been discharged from the Mine.

Parliament has refused to grant £3,000 for the repair of our streets.

Mr Opie has announced that he intends to carry passengers between Burra and Kapunda.
