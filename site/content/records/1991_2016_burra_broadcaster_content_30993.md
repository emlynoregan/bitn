Doug Wiltshire

After requests from many ratepayers, careful thought and legal advice, I offer myself for Hallett Ward

If elected my priority would be to see the Council is proactive in worthwhile community projects and undertaking its mandatory obligations to ratepayers

I will make myself available on alternate months in Hallett and Terowie to hear ratepayersâ€™ concerns

Mt professional career includes: senior management positions and consulting in the accounting profession in a wide variety of company areas

I am semi-retired
