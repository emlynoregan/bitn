The Burra Demonstration Committee following the railway opening has a cash surplus and has decided to donate £10-10-0 to the Attenborough Fund and £5 to the United Sunday Schools Picnic.  The Government has promised a special train for the picnic to take the children to some wooded spot near Mintaro ‘when many of them will for the first time see a tree and have ocular demonstration of a forest’.  Each child is to take its own provisions and the Government will be asked to carry teachers and other adults at excursion prices.  All places of business will be closed and a general holiday declared.  If the Government agrees to these proposals the event should be held soon.
