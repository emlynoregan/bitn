Central Road Board: The Main Road to Burra

A memorial from 70 inhabitants of Black Springs, the Wakefield and Farrell’s Flat called for the adoption of Mr Macaulay’s No. 6 line of road.

Mr McEwin wanted the matter adjourned in the absence of Mr Kelly, but the Chairman said the Government was waiting for a decision and all works on the toad were stopped pending that decision.

Mr Macaulay said a Stationman on the North Road said a person had commenced fencing his land and if he continued it would stop traffic on the road presently in use.

Mr Hallett regretted Mr Kelly’s absence.

Mr Everard suggested the question be resolved before any other business at the next meeting of the Board.

A memorial was received asking that the north road branching off at Forrester’s be continued vis Riverton, Saddleworth and Chinkford to join the Kapunda-Kooringa Road at the point where the middle line of road forms a junction with the Kooringa road vis Black Springs and with the North and Aberdeen Road via the Long Hill and Springbank.  Consideration was deferred.
