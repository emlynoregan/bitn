Mr Woollacott has carried out a great deal of work not only on four of the houses, which have had the attention mentioned above, but in cleaning up the central area at the rear of the houses.  Quite a number of old toilets have been removed.  Mr Woollacott has certainly shown that as far as he is concerned he is not going to let it deteriorate further.
