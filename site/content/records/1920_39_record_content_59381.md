Burra Town Council Chamber.  The newly renovated and refurnished chamber will soon be reopened.  The walls and ceiling were renovated and photos and pictures all cleaned and re-hung on brass rods and a handsome suite of eleven chairs and a table grace the room.  The one thing lacking is a suitable floor covering to match the massive and ornate furniture.  Surely there are some gentlemen who could outlay the £13-£15 necessary to complete this very fine room.
