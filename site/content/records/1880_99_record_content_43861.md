Editorial on the Old Year.

1891 brought many changes to the town and district.  The good old days when Burra was prosperous have gone.  When the landed estates are broken up and mining begins again Burra will boom.  Many have died and many have left the town.  Businesses have changed hands.  The stock agents continue to be the least affected, but even they have had a year of low prices.  Last summer was cool and the winter very dry with an extraordinary frost in September and the great storm of a fortnight ago.

An influenza epidemic has wreaked havoc among young and old in the final weeks of 1891.

Improvements have been few, but the Institute has been transformed and is now second to none.  Elder, Smith & Co. have new offices and have built new sale yards in New Aberdeen.

The railway crossing remains unprotected, but a new bridge at the Bon Accord will soon be built.

The season has been against tree planting success.

The Eastern Road has been removed from the schedule of main roads, which places a heavy burden on the District Council.

The international financial crisis in England, USA & Germany will influence the borrowing powers in Australia.  War has for now been avoided and famine rages in Russia, while anarchy prevails in several of the smaller American Republics.  Troubles seem to loom in China.  The Irish question remains unresolved and labour troubles continue around the world.  In Australia the federation movement has failed, at least for now.
