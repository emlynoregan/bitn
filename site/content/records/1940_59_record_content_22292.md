Mr & Mrs A.D. Sellars & Family were given a farewell at the Burra North Lodge Hall on Tuesday night.  They will in future reside at Keith.  The Mayor presided.  Speakers were Dr Steele and, Mr H.J.B. Jennison.  The latter said that Allan Sellars had been a most caring and popular Eastern Mail deliverer and that without petrol rationing many from the east would have been in to farewell him.  Allan had tried hard to enlist in the present war and when that was impossible, had carried on Mr Jennison’s business in Burra, enabling him to do his bit.  Other speakers were R.H. Smith, K.R. Crewes and the Mayor.  His Worship handed over a wallet containing £60 in notes.  Mrs Jennison on behalf of the ladies of Burra North presented Mrs Sellars with a handsome wall mirror.  She said Mrs Sellars had been one of the best patriotic workers in the town.  Mr Sellars responded and supper followed, after which the evening was concluded with dancing.
