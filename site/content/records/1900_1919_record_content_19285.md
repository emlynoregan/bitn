Burra Smelts.  There are still some heavy pieces of machinery to be lifted into place, but so far the progress has not been anything like satisfactory, but with the change in managership the work is being done in a more systematic way under Mr T. Kittell.  He comes from the Blinman Mine where the smelters turned out c. 180 tons a day.  Tenders are called in The Record today for carting the uncrushed slag in the vicinity of the works and as soon as possible the furnace will be blown into.

[The tender notice gives the name of the company as the Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.]
