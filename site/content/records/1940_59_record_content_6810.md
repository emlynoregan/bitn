Aboriginal Rock Art.  18 months or so ago the Government set aside £25,000 for the study of soil erosion in SA.  Mr F.W.T. Phipps, a mineralogist of Glenelg is accordingly making investigations in the  district.  He says some of the finest examples of soil erosion and Native Carvings are to be seen near Burra.  Redbanks has chasms 8-10 feet across and 25-30 feet deep – some half a mile beyond the Mongolata sign and to the right.  Native carvings can be found in the creek on Mr Mann’s farm about half a mile along the creek towards Burra.  The same site has fine examples of soil erosion.  These sites could be of real interest to tourists and it is possible that Burra does not make enough of such attractions.
