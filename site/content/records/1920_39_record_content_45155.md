Obituary.  George Hann of Kooringa died 24 February after a short severe illness from kidney failure.  He was born in Adelaide 25 March 1869 the youngest son of the late Asher Hann then residing on the corner of Currie St in the former home of the early SA Judge Cooper and Mr Hann is believed born in the room where the first death sentence was pronounced in SA.  He was educated at Whinham College and later at Way College.  He studied for law and later went to Victoria as managing clerk for various solicitors.  On 6 September 1893 he married Miss Dora Schultz of St Arnaud Victoria.  The family joined the gold rush to Coolgardie and [he] wrote the first official history of that place, afterwards holding the position of Government draughtsman.  He was a gifted penman and artist.  He produced the illuminated address sent by the citizens of Perth to Queen Victoria on her Diamond Jubilee and also did one in Chinese for the Chinese citizens of Perth for presentation to the Duke and Duchess of York on their visit.  He had produced a number of illuminated addresses presented in Burra.  In the war many of his drawings were auctioned on the Bugler system to raise patriotic funds.  He was a noted musician and composer and a producer of plays and musicals: many in Victoria including HMS Pinafore and Maritana before the Earl of Hopetoun Governor of Victoria.  In Adelaide when young he appeared at Garner’s Theatre and the old Academy of Music.  After six years in WA the family returned to SA.  In the meantime Mrs Hann died and in 1911 he remarried Miss Mabel Hoffman of Oakleigh Victoria and soon after they moved to Balaklava SA and in 1915 to Burra where he acted as manager for Blight & Blight solicitors.  He was then briefly in partnership with his son-in-law Mr H.J. Button of Kooringa and for some time has carried on various agencies and other business with his son Mr Nelson Hann.  In Burra he has helped in many causes, especially in a musical way and has at times been secretary of the Burra Racing Club, Burra Bowling Club, Burra Sporting & Athletic Club & the Burra High School Council.  He was also a member of the Boy Scout movement and a JP.  He was a member and lay reader of the Anglican Church and a member of the choir.  The funeral on Saturday was largely attended.  Rev. J.S.W. Coles of Salisbury, but late of St Mary’s Burra officiated.  He is survived by his widow and from his first family: Martin (Jack), Nelson, Mrs C. Prowse of Adelaide & Mrs H.J. Button of Kooringa and from the second marriage, Bill, Laurie, George & Joan.  There are two granddaughters.
