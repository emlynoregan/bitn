Burra Police Officers Matthew Hall & Andree Dredge competed in the SA Police & Emergency Services Games in Adelaide recently.  Constable Hall won a gold medal in the U30s singles and open men’s doubles championship and silver in the mixed doubles and men’s championship.  [Can we assume tennis?]  As a result he will participate in the 2007 World Police & Fire Games in Adelaide in March.  Brevet Sergeant Dredge won bronze medals in the international practice shooting competition, where his team won silver medals.
