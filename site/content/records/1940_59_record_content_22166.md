Last night Mr A.B. Riggs as President of the Institute Committee and Secretary to the Trustees, waited upon the Town Council and produced the Deed of Conveyance, to which the Mayor and the Town Clerk affixed their signatures and the Council Seal.  The Trustees of the Institute had already affixed their signatures.  The document set out that the Council would take over the management and assets connected with the building from 1 July and the necessary transfer of the property and the finalising of the whole business would take place at the end of the current quarter â€“ 30 September.
