A 24 hour Swimming Marathon is planned for Burra Pool, starting at 4 p.m. on 15 February.  A marathon held two years ago raised over $6,000, which was shared between the pool and the Royal Life Saving Society.  The pool benefited with a verandah for the amenities block, which will shortly be installed.  This year’s event will be spent on fencing and a pergola in the toddlers’ paddling pool area.
