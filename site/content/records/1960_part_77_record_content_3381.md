Theft.  A safe containing c. £25 in cash and various papers was stolen from the Burra Motor Co. on Thursday night.  The safe was recovered by police at Hanson on Sunday.  Papers from the safe were found scattered over a wide area and the safe drawer was about two miles from Hanson on the Farrell Flat Road.  The opened safe was found about a mile this side of Hanson on a side road.  The rear door of Aldam’s garage was also forced, but the burglars found nothing worth taking.
