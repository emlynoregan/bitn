Goyder Council has budgeted for an increase in rates this year of 6.8%.

Property values have risen by an average of 4% and the rest is generated by an increase in the rate in the dollar.  The Council is moving towards rate parity for rural areas:

Hallett and Eudunda rural areas are rated at		3.819 c in the dollar

Robertstown rural areas are rated at			3.986 c in the dollar

Burra rural areas are rated at			4.616 c in the dollar

Burra Town area is rated at 			7.8 c in the dollar

Waste Collection charges have dropped from $65 to $58 due to the reduced dump times and the introduction of wheelie bins.

Llew Jones, Burra Town Hall manager used a social evening in the hall (with a magic twist) to unveil a comprehensive set of aims on Saturday night for the development of the hall as a centre for entertainment and activity.
