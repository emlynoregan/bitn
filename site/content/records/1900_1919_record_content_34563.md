Electric Lighting.

The firm advising on the cost of lighting the town with electricity has promises totalling 450 lights in Kooringa, which it is believed would pay 8% depreciation, 6% interest and sinking fund and still return Council a profit of at least £20.  To extend the scheme to North Ward would require some 300 lights and this number has not been forthcoming.  A ratepayers’ meeting will be called when the report is presented.
