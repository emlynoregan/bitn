Burra Show Soc. met last Friday.  They resolved that the 1916 show be on Wednesday 25 October.  Debentures of £195 have been taken up to cover the new luncheon room cost.

Details of rules etc. are reported in 2 columns.  Section Fours were deleted ‘so that young fellows who would not enlist would at least not be allowed to play toy soldiers on the showground.’

W.H. Lloyd moved that ‘German cake’ be struck off the prize list.  Carried unanimously.

The President, I.J. Warnes, asked permission to invite the Governor at his own [Warnes’] expense.

‘It was his last year of office and he desired to make it one upon which he could look back with pleasure.’

He was supported by Messrs Winnall, Harcus and Laidlaw and the move was carried by applause.
