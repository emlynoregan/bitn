‘One of Them’ writes concerning the Town Council’s decision to enforce section 2 of by-law 7 concerning obstruction of footpaths.  They claim it is because boards placed outside business premises are a grave danger to public safety.  He can’t see that, as they are only there in the full light of day.  He says more serious obstructions are the verandah posts outside Cr Hardy’s office and Mrs Pressick’s shop, which people have walked into at night.  Stray cattle camped on the footpaths at night are another danger with people falling over them and yet the Councillors ignore such glaring obstructions and centre their attentions on a few boards offering no obstruction at all.
