Burra Town Council has enlisted the support of the Broken Hill Council in getting g some Government action on the Black Springs Road.  The Commissioner of Highways contends the trouble is speed, but Mr C.N. Bushell, of Mid-North Car & Tractor co. of Burra, says that since more gravel has been placed on the road at the behest of the Highways Department, it has become more dangerous than ever.  He recently had great difficulty in controlling a truck that sustained a quick puncture, even though he was only travelling at 30 m.p.h.

The Council has approval to borrow Â£1,700 for modern sound and projection equipment.

Investigations suggest the Town Council should be able to make a good income from the picture shows and use it to pay off the Town Hall debt and then go on to aid other facilities in the town.

The SA Symphony Orchestra will be invited to include Burra in its tour itinerary.
