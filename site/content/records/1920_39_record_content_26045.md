Elias Wilks, who today is 78, was born in ‘Sunday Row’, long gone, but once on the hill behind where Alfred Riggs house now stands.  Apparently they were an incomplete row intended for some smelters and when they arrived the buildings were completed on a Sunday.  He went to White’s School and Stanton’s Grammar School and was for many years employed by the Corporation of Burra.  He married Miss Edwards of Kooringa who since an accident a few years ago has been unable to get about.  Only two daughters survive: Mrs Arthur Davey of Kooringa and Mrs S.R. Davis of Mannahill.  [Actually Mrs S.D. Davis.]
