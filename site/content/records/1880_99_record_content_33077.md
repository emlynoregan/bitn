Burra Literary Soc.  The 1st Entertainment of the Society drew a fair attendance to the Institute on Friday evening last.  The review suggests a dullness in presentation and lack of life in some performances, which produced a kind of monotony.  The farce was far from as amusing as it should have been - still ‘it was not the worst farce we have witnessed’. 

[Personal interest: The Alarm, a recitation by Mr Fuss, was rather monotonous from the absence of life and action necessary in good reciting.]
