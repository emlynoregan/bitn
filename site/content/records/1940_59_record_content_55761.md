A copy of the Illustrated London News of 2 December 1848 was sent to the Mayor by a soldier pensioner, J. Crisp, 74, of Bournemouth, UK.  The paper tells of the life of Mr J.B. Graham, one of the original investors in the Burra Mine and there are four pictures of Burra: two surface illustrations and two of the underground workings.
