Burra District Advisory Committee

At its September meeting Mr B. Polkinghorne was re-elected for another term as Chairman, with Mr J. Hirschausen as Deputy Chairman and Mrs E. Carpenter as Publicity Officer.

Projects presently being sponsored:

Burra Creek beautification

Swimming Pool improvements

Actions following on from the Conservation Study Report.

‘Burra Record’ Microfilm Appeal has raised the sum of $1,550.  Burra National Trust on Monday night decided to contribute the amount yet to be raised – a sum less than $200.  Work can now begin on the project.

[When first discussed a sum of $1,450 was seen as the target.]
