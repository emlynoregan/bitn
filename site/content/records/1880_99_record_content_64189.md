Thomas Pearse of ‘The Gums’, Bundey, writes on behalf of the graziers to the east of Burra.  He lists their woes as he writes in the midst of a dust storm.

They have had no lambing for three years

Prospects for lambing this year are poor

Rents are high

Wild dogs are out of control

They have huge losses of soil blown further east in storms.

He calls for a series of remedies:

Vermin proof fencing

Lower rents so that feed can be conserved

Security of tenure – all should be on perpetual lease

The present rent of £2-13-6 per mile[2] is one half too much

The rent should be £1-5-0 per mile[2]

He calls a meeting at the Burra Institute for 4 o’clock on 3 June to discuss these issues.
