Burra Mine.

‘It is Said’ column

It is said that it has been suggested some relics of the Burra Burra Mine should be preserved by Council.  The old fire engine was mentioned at the Council meeting on Monday night.  The idea was not favourably received by the majority.

That the ‘statue’ of the ‘discoverer of the mine’ is mentioned is also very interesting.

[Is this perhaps a reference to ‘Johnny Green’?]

‘That some day these relics will be regarded as being of historical interest and will be valued.’

[See below for the report from the Council meeting.]
