Burra Town Council, Meeting 20 April.

Cr Rabbich objected to the minutes being signed, saying those with reference to the extraordinary vacancy were illegal and should be struck out.

Cr Watt said they were merely a record of the last meeting.

Cr Rabbich believed illegal minutes should not be confirmed.

After a little more skirmishing on the matter they were confirmed, as were those of several special meetings on the subject.

The Mayor hoped the matter re Cr Rabbich might be settled tonight.  He hoped for an amicable resolution.

Cr Watt moved the suspension of standing orders to deal with matters related to Cr Rabbich.  Carried.

Cr Watt then moved that the whole of the proceedings dealing with Cr Rabbich be expunged from the minute book and that the work of the Council be proceeded with as before.  (Cheers from the ratepayers.)

The town was not in a position to go to law.

Cr Parks agreed that it was important to have the matter settled amicably and without recourse to the law, and he 2nd.

Cr O’Leary asked in what way Cr Rabbich would meet the Council.

Cr Sampson said the whole of the minutes including Cr Rabbich’s explanation must be expunged or he could not support the motion.

Cr Butterworth asked who was going to pay the legal costs of Cr Rabbich and Mr Neville.

The mayor said that could be discussed later.

Cr Rabbich said the matter required serious consideration.  Cr Sampson wanted him to be a party to having his explanation expunged.  He had been badly treated, insulted and put to expense.  He had been persecuted for telling the truth.
