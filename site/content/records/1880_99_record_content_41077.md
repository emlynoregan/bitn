Obituary.  Thomas William Powell of Glenelg died on 7 April aged 84.  In 1848 he arrived in Kooringa and opened a chemist shop in Commercial St where he also kept the post office.  As well as post-master he was clerk of the Local Court, taking this on when the first clerk, Mr Grant, went to the Victorian diggings in 1851.  He also became then District Registrar of births, deaths and marriages.  He resigned as post-master in 1858 when his eldest son took over briefly before William Pearce took the job, until the telegraph office was built and the post and telegraph offices were united.  He remained Clerk of Courts and Registrar of births, marriages and deaths till 1860 and then went to similar positions in Clare.  In old age a comfortable independence left him by a relative in England allowed him to retire to St Leonards, Glenelg, where he died.  He leaves a family of five.  His second son is Mr S.S. Powell of Glenelg, eldest daughter Mrs G.B. Yeates of Jamestown and his second daughter the late Mrs Andrew Young and his youngest daughter are some years deceased.  His wife died before he left Clare.  He was a prominent member and lay reader of the Anglican Church.
