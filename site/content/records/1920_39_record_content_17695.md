Main Roads

The road from Kooringa to Aberdeen was badly in need of attention.  From the post office to St Just St (55½ chains) it was scarified and re-metalled.  No special grant was provided and the Council carried out the work for £647.  £246 was taken from the Government Grant and the rest from the general account.  This amount we hope to have refunded at a later date.  The Council now intends to tar-dress the whole length of the roadway.
