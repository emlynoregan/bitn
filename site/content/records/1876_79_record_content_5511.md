Inquest at the Miners’ Arms by J.D. Cave JP as coroner with T. Bath as foreman of the jury, into the fire there. 
Thomas Richardson, landlord, returned from the Corporation meeting on Monday night c. l0.45 and closed the bar about ii p.m. Mr Adam got four glasses of beer for the billiard room. Went to bed. Some time later someone knocked for more beer, but told him to go about his business — he said he thought the house was on fire. Got up and found much smoke with the fire mostly in casks under the bar parlour and cellar under the tap-room. Sent for the mine fire engine. There was an explosion from the other cellar to the east, sending flame right through the floor and roof. [The next lines are illegible, but seem to say £40-50 in cheques, banknotes and coins were lost in the bar.]  A portion of the roof was removed to gain access. He thought a fire a few months ago was caused by matches falling through the floor and this fire might also he so caused. There was a half case of matches and a small lot of kerosene in the cellar. Cellar could be got at by any ill-natured person. Have had threats, but thought nothing of it. The place was insured for £4,500 for the building & stock, and the stable for £500. 
Henry Skewes, who was sleeping in Room 10, said by the time he was roused and dressed and got out the older part of the building was beyond saving. The effort was then on saving furniture etc. from the unburnt portions. 
Matthew Adams was lodging at the hotel at the time. About 2.30 a.m. he heard Annie Garland in the passage and she asked me to see her room which was full of smoke. Vivian and I went to see and found it suffocating. Roused Mr Richardson then went to front and found the whole of the cellar on fire and also at the back. Roused everyone in the house. Annie Garland noticed smoke when a little girl of Richardson’s who sleeps in the same room, woke and asked for a drink. Met Harry Vivian coming out of the billiard room and asked him to see about the smoke. 
Edward Shoard was also in the billiard room and confirmed the above. 
James Colman, constable, was roused between 2 & 3 a.m. on Tuesday — he thought by John Vivian, and found the cellars strongly on fire. He told them to send for the fire engine and the furniture from the new section was taken into the street. Sergeant Bentley and two other constables arrived about 4.30 am. Shortly after 11 p.m. on Monday I passed the verandah and the bar lights were out and no one was loitering. There were people in the billiard room. The verdict was that there was no evidence to show how the said fire originated.
