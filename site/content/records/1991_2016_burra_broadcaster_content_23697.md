Burra Community School hosted an employment breakfast last Wednesday to explain the opportunities available through the school in apprenticeships and traineeships.  School Deputy and Liaison Officer for the project, Gus Wenzel, saw this as an exciting program for the local community.

Apprenticeships and traineeships can be part of SACE in Years 11 & 12.  Burra Employees heard from speakers from training organisations about the range of options offered.  Trainees and apprentices are paid for the time they spend in the workplace, and receive structured training that is competency based.  Employers receive payments for taking on school-based apprentices and trainees and can benefit from the flexibility of taking on a school-based apprentice or trainee, if they are unable to employ a full-time one.
