Vandalism at Mt Bryan East on 17 February.

John Quinn’s Fordson tractor was moved, the oil drained and dirt and grass put into the fuel tanks and other minor damage was done.  Insulators were shot from the main 20 ft telephone pole on the branch line to Messrs George Lomman and Les Thomas’s and the pole then pushed over, breaking the line.  The Collinsville line and party line to Rol Dare’s was also put out of action for a time.  The best part of a packet of 50 22 bore bullets was shot through the sides of the shelter shed erected for the convenience of children waiting for the school bus by Messrs G. Lomman & Rol Dare.  Police are investigating.
