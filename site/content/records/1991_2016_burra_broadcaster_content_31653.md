Tourist Railways

An article on how the public liability insurance problem is causing these to close across the country.  For example, Steamtown Peterborough ceased operating trains in 2002, Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society is threatening to close, the St Kilda Tramway Museum stopped public rides on 1 May 2003 and is confined to static exhibits and the Limestone Coast Railway in the South East ceased operations last week.
