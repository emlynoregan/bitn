Burra Burra Hospital Inc. AGM

Frank Ford and Allan Baulderstone were welcomed as Members of the Board of Management.

Chairman R.K. Parse read the 98th report of the hospital.

Financially the hospital is very sound.  A credit of $60,000 is invested.  Expenses rose 71% and receipts by 63%.  Bed cost rose by $5 to $22.46.  We were able to show a surplus of $59,298.

Improvements included air conditioning the Nurses Home and a carport there and a new piano.  TV sets were placed in private rooms and handrails in toilets and bathrooms.  The Secretary’s residence was renovated.  The hospital’s interior was renovated and repainted.  Average daily patient numbers rose to a record 27.8 and 24 babies were born.  The auxiliary has maintained linen etc. and restocked the storeroom with jams and preserves.  In the year we lost the services of Sister Goode as tutor, to be replaced by Sister Wall.  After ten years the Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer resigned on 30 June and his place has been taken by Mr Hank Heitbrink.
