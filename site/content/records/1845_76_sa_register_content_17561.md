‘Traveller’ writes re the Redruth Bridge

Allow me to call attention to the dangerous state of the Redruth Bridge due to unwarrantable neglect.  On the Aberdeen side directly adjoining the pier a deal plank has been inserted instead of gum.  This naturally gave way and the hole has spread to about four planks wide, occasioning a serious shock to light vehicles, there being barely room to pass if the horse is at all skittish.
