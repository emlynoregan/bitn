Burra Rifle Club

On Saturday the second stage of the Championship & Handicap Championship was fired over 600 & 700 yards.  The best in the handicap event were J.E. Pearce, E.R. Pexton & T. Cornelius.

B. Cornelius now leads the handicap Championship.  [T. & B. Cornelius seem to have been the same person: T.B. Cornelius, known as Bruce.]
