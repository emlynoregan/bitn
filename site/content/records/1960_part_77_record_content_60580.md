Burra Mine

Poseidon has announced it is going into the copper chemical field using Saminâ€™s product, copper oxide.  The Burra venture was acquired late in 1970 when Poseidon successfully bid for Samin Ltd.  The copper chemical venture with Vermont Chemical & Seed Pty Ltd of Melbourne (largely owned by protein and fertilizer makers H.C. Pannifex & Co. Ltd) aims to make a range of chemicals for use in primary and secondary industry throughout Australia.  The initial product, copper oxychloride, is used for spray cropping [crop spraying?].  The local market is approximately 500 tons p.a.  Poseidon is about to begin stage 2 of the Burra project, which should lift production of copper oxide five fold to about 6,500 tons per year, worth $6-$7 million.  This expansion of the works at Burra is expected to be completed next year.  The market in Australia for cupric oxide has turned out to be larger than expected.  [Photo of Burra leach tanks.]
