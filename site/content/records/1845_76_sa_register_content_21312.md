The morning HRH arrived was marked by rejoicing among the inhabitants.  Captain Killicoat was informed at 6 a.m. and the Smelting Works bell was rung for an hour, awakening the inhabitants of Kooringa, Redruth, Copperhouse and the other townships to the fact.  Flags were raised at the Works, the Telegraph Office, Drew & Co.â€™s and most other principal buildings in Kooringa, though this was not the case in Redruth either at the Gaol, the Police station or the Court House.  Schools were closed for periods varying from three to fifteen days.  In the evening the bonfire blazed on the Mine Hill and fireworks were let off.  At Redruth some pretty rockets donated by Mrs Branch were discharged from the bridge.  On Wednesday at 9 a.m. a special mail conveyance was well filled with people anxious to see the procession [in Adelaide].  Thursday was observed as a public holiday.
