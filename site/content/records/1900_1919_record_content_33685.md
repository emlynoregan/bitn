Redruth Court, Wednesday.

Frank Griffiths sought to recover £290 from Minnie Escott of Koonoona for breach of promise.  The verdict was for the plaintiff who was awarded £30 plus costs.  [Details occupy 1¼ columns.]

[This seems an odd case, as there was a report in XV, 1013, 16 Oct. 1912, page 3, running to a similar length where Frank Griffiths made the same claim and was awarded £150!]
