Central Road Board

W.H. Challoner wrote on behalf of a meeting at Kooringa and transmitted a copy of a resolution passed to the effect that it would be a gross injustice to the people of Kooringa to alter the present line of road after they had laid out large sums on the faith of its continuing as the main line.

A memorial from 489 residents was received opposing the petition sent in favour of the middle line of road being adopted as the Main North Road and advocating the line adjacent to the present road from Springfield, through Apoinga by Logan’s Gap to Sod Hut Ranges and into Kooringa.

[Springfield was about one mile north of Marrabel.]

Mr Macaulay reported on six possible lines of road:

Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Logan’s Gap-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen.  35 miles.

Springfield-Steelton-Long Hill-Springbank-Bon Accord-Aberdeen.  32 miles.

Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Bon Accord-Aberdeen.  32 miles 33 chains.

Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen.  34 miles 42 chains.

Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Aberdeen.  32 miles 42 chains.

Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen.  33 miles 65 chains.

Comments:

2 is the shortest, but with two steep gradients (one of 1:14 for 19 chains and one of 1:22 for 65 chains) and it leaves Kooringa off the main road.

5 is the next shortest, but has the same objections as No. 2 except for taking in Black Springs.

3 is the next shortest, but with the same objections and it leaves Black Springs to the west.

6 avoids Long Hill and passes through both Black Springs and Kooringa.

1 & 4 are almost the same length.  1 has been the road usually used as the main road and c. 2¾ miles is already metalled with side ditches for drainage from Springfield to Apoinga.

The old road is best for water and the middle or western road takes in the largest amount of agricultural land.

The plans were presented.

The matter was then adjourned to the next meeting.
