Burra North Red Cross held its AGM 2 July.  The Secretary reported a membership of 58, but not all were regular attenders.  They had helped with the supper at the Air Force Assoc. Ball and also with the Buffalo Lodge Ball supper.  The branch had a float in the Jubilee Week celebrations.  They had sent Â£35 to Headquarters as part of the March Appeal.
