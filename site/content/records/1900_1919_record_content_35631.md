Cr Wilkinson said it was thought the Government was making a large profit from the Waterworks.  If this was true they should not be.  Members of the District will be asked for receipts and expenditure figures.

Fear of the creek at the back of Vivian Lewis’s garage being obstructed was raised and the Mayor will take it up with the firm.

It seems that Mr Bewley has fenced 5-6’ of the plantation near the hospital onto the road.  If so the Council fence could be carried inside.

Cr Harris said it had been suggested that the old fire engine at the Mine should be preserved as a relic of the mining days.  Cr Lane agreed.

Cr Wicklein thought ‘there was no necessity to have anything to remind the people of the generosity of the Burra Mining Co.’  [Black and white print gives no certain indication of whether he was being ironic here, but it seems very likely that he was.]

Cr Parks did not see where it could be put and the matter dropped.

Mr Winnall, who was present by request, said if he was to fill up the application to the minister for permission to raise a loan he needed to know if they intended to extend the electricity scheme beyond Kooringa.  Cr Wicklein said no.

Mr Winnall said in that case £2,200 should be sufficient.  He also considered the estimated burning time of two hours per lamp was too long.  If the estimate was correct he did not see how the scheme could pay as it only allowed £70 for wages.

Cr Wicklein said the driver would only be an improver and the plant would only be working three days a week.  [This would suggest some type of battery storage system was contemplated.]

He moved a loan of £2,300 be procured.  2nd Cr Lane and carried.
