Burra National Trust held its AGM recently and Chairman Maureen Wright presented a report of the Trust’s activities over the 2002-02 year:

This has been the final year of our lease agreement with the Goyder Council during which we have managed the Burra Visitor Centre, the Council’s Heritage Sites, the Heritage Trail and our own sites.  A total of about 20 properties and buildings.  Being solely in charge has in some ways been easier, but it is also a great responsibility and our committee feels it is time to give the community a greater chance to become involved with the Burra Visitor Centre.  The Council’s working party has devised a strategic plan for the Burra Visitor centre and will be recommending to Council that BRTBA is the best body to take over management of the Burra Visitor Centre.  Being freed from Burra Visitor Centre management will allow the National Trust once more to focus on conservation and preservation issues and development of the properties for which we are responsible.
