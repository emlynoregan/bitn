Editorial on Municipal Government.

What are needed are not popular men, but men of experience, men who know the nature of the jobs to be done and can see they get done in a proper and economical manner.

Grasshoppers are stripping the country bare to the east of Burra.  Several large consignments have been brought into town - one bag containing about 1 cwt has been on display for several days.  No doubt the town will soon see the effects.

Postal Charges to other countries are to drop on 1 January 1891 to 2½d per ½ oz letter to most countries and all will now go by the fastest means rather than by the all-sea route.  (The fastest route presently costs 6d per ½ oz.)

Salvation Army Guards Brass Band of over twenty performers from Melbourne visited and was much appreciated.  They played in Jamestown Friday, travelled to Yarcowie on Saturday to catch the train to Burra, arriving at a few minutes to five.  They marched to Kooringa and had dinner at the Barracks.  Then there was a huge meeting in Market Square and on Sunday the usual meetings drew large crowds.  They left on Monday for Clare.
