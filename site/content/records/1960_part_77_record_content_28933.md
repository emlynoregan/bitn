Burra Kindergarten

The new building will be opened on Friday 13 May.  A Devonshire Afternoon Tea will follow the opening and a trading table will be convened.  The new building adjoins the present building and entrances will be constructed between the two.  On completion there will be an L-shaped playroom and a washroom with toilets.
