‘Left Wing’ writes condemning the actions of the Aberdeen secretary and chief delegate on Saturday when they tried to get the captain of the Aberdeen team to abandon the match.  The writer says the umpire, Mr Waters, was ‘a man of so little knowledge and experience of the game’ that he should never have been chosen, but that choice was the responsibility of the delegates and the consequences are theirs to bear.
