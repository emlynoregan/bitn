Obituary.  Mrs Robert Bell died at Burra Hospital on Friday last.  She was born at Sod Hut, near Burra, on 12 February 1858, the second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs William Broad, pioneers of Burra.  She spent the whole of her life in the district.  She married Mr Robert Bell of Marrabel in 1879 and they lived first at Baldina.  Later her husband was employed by Mr Carl Gebhardt of Mackerode, where they lived for some years.  Mr Bell later took up land near Mt Bryan, where they made a permanent home until Mr Bellâ€™s death in 1932.  Afterwards failing health drove Mrs Bell to live with her children at times.  She had a family of nine, of which three predeceased her, one as an infant and Robert and Clem Bell as adults.  She is survived by Messrs Reuben E. Bell of Hallett, W.T. Bell of Willunga, Mrs J. Clare of Cowaramup WA, Mr Lyle R. Bell of Hallett, Mr C.S. Bell of Cowaramup WA and Mrs Reg. Kellaway of Adelaide.  There are also 28 grandchildren and several great grandchildren.

[Born Elizabeth Broad 12 February 1858 at Happy Valley, District of Burra.  Died Burra, 16 May 1941.]
