The Annual Anzac Commemoration Service was held on Sunday at the Memorial.  A large crowd, including many returned men, assembled.  The procession from the RSL rooms was led by the Bowden Salvation Army Band.  H. Hill was the standard-bearer and Stanley Hawker as RSL President and Sister Keynes led the men.  Then came the Red Cross Emergency Transport Co. under Mrs Andrew Tennant, then the Girl Guides and Brown Owls.

Captain Thomas of the Salvation Army gave the address, assisted by Rev. C. Gray (Anglican) & Rev. N. Usher (Methodist). (Rev. V.R. Secombe was absent with similar duties at Farrell’s Flat.)
