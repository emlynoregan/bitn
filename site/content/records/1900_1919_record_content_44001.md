Court of Appeal

The Railway Commissioner said railway residences were not subject to rates under the Act and cited Mr Justice Murray in 14 Nov. 1914.  The mayor said that notwithstanding that the Dec. 1914 Municipal Corporations Amendments Act provided residences used by the Government were subject to rating.  A test case being conducted by the Mitcham Council might decide the issue and the matter was adjourned pending that decision.
