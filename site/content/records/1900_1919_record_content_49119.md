Literary Supplements 19161

1 Only a few of the supplement for 1916 are preserved and most of those only in the hard copy.

2 The dates for these supplements are unclear because the bound hard copies and the microfilm disagree.  The problem stems from the first of those above which is dated 29 December 1915, but no paper was issued on that date.  It is omitted from the microfilm, but bound with 5 January issue in hard copy.
