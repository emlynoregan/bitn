Inquest at the Kooringa Hotel 9 January into the fire at T. Warnes’ paddock on 3 January.

J.D. Cave was coroner and W. Bentley foreman of the jury.

W. Rodda:

I was in the paddock employed to skim the grass from around fences and was about 300 yards from the outbreak of the fire at about 2 p.m.  Believe the fire started when the feet of cattle trod on a match.  Tried to extinguish it and was helped by F. Carey & a boy also assisted.  Mrs Hunt came with some water.  60-80 acres of grass were lost.  Half an hour later a second fire sprung up behind Mr Sandland who was on a horse.  Matches were then found and I am of the opinion this fire started when Mr Sandland’s horse trod on a match.

J.C. Sandland gave corroborating evidence and said 19 matches were eventually found – they were not found together, but singly about four feet in from the fence.

Other evidence came from J. Harvey, M-C Sydney Benham, L-C Daniel Thomas & H. Vivian.

The finding was that the fire was caused by matches ignited by the feet of cattle, such matches having been maliciously and feloniously placed there by person or persons unknown, for that purpose.
