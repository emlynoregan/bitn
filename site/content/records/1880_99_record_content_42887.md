Burra Town Council.

The Waterworks inspection showed a fractured pumping rod and orders have been made for its repair.

The need for a new boiler at the Waterworks was raised by Cr Rabbich and in the end a letter was to be sent to the Engineer-in-Chief re the lease renewal and a new boiler.

Retiring members this year are the Mayor, Mr W. West, and Crs Sampson, O’Leary and Butterworth.

The Mayor, in commenting on the useful work done in the year, attacked the frequent carping attacks made on the Council in the Jamestown Review.

Cr Rabbich agreed, saying the reports were ‘mean, despicable and untruthful’.

Cr Sampson agreed that the Council had been vilified in the Jamestown paper which had published statements which were utterly untrue about the Town Council.  They should be made known and the Burra Correspondent to that paper be made an example of.

[It is very likely that this was W.H. Hardy]

Cr Rabbich believed the reports on the Jamestown paper should be treated with contempt.

Mr West indicated his willingness to stand again if ratepayers indicated that such was their desire.

The new wall at the cemetery was proceeding.

The lamp glass on the [Kingston St] bridge was broken on Saturday and this resulted in a £5 reward being offered.

Cr Butterworth said the bridge near Mr Packard’s was unsafe owing to the stones being washed away.  [Perhaps the bridge on Smelts Rd?]

The meeting ‘which was very warm at times’ then adjourned.
