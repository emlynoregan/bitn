Christmas in Burra 2004

The pageant will commence later this year, at 6 p.m.

Father Christmas will arrive at the end of the pageant and then see the children in the rotunda, which is also where they can begin to collect their bag of treats on the Burra Trail.

The Christmas colouring-in competition winners will be announced.

Burra Golf Club will organise a barbecue tea, and drinks and ice creams will be on sale.

Carols by Glowlights will conclude the eveningâ€™s events.
