Recruiting Rally

On Wednesday evening a large crowd at the Burra Institute listened to Lieut-Col. Waite, Captain Pellew, the Mayor T.H. Woollacott and Mr G.S. Hawker appeal for recruits for the AIF.  The appeal was organised by the Local Defence Committee, which was first formed on 14 May 1938.  The meeting was attended by the local VSDs in force and was opened with the singing of the National Anthem and the Song of Australia.  Guests included Lieut-Col. Waite, Captain Pellew, Major Archer and Lieut. Black.  The last three being of the Mobile Recruiting Unit, which had unexpectedly arrived in Burra.  The speeches [which are reported in full] were interspersed with musical items from Mrs Bence, Miss Halliday and Messrs Dollman and Rosman as well as Department of Information Films.
