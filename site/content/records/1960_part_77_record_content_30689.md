Burra & District Ambulance Association has been granted a subsidy of $1,000 for the purchase of a new ambulance.  Headquarters has allowed the old ambulance to be retained as either a second vehicle or a mobile first aid room.  A fully equipped new ambulance will require the branch to find $2,000 from its own funds.  A site for a new ambulance building has yet to be decided.  Until a decision is made Dr L.G. Miller has offered the facilities of his double garage.
