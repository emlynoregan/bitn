Was in Bollmann’s house yesterday when the child died about 2.30 p.m.  Deceased had then taken a nobbler of brandy.  Deceased then went into the next house, and lying on the ground, went into hysterics.  Gave him a drink of water and deceased then said he had taken poison.  Asked Mrs Bollmann if they had any poison.  She had said they had arsenic, but it was locked in her workbox and she did not believe her husband had taken poison.  Sent for the doctor as she feared it was something serious.  Did not send for the police, as there was no one to send.

Robert Bevan:

Last night at about 7.30 went to see deceased after Mrs Watkins said he was dying.  Found him lying on the floor on his face and took his hand and turned him onto his back.  He neither moved nor spoke afterwards.  Mrs Bollmann came in and shook him, but believe he was then dead.

Henry Snooks:

Had known deceased two or three years.  He was a very quiet and steady man and worked with him on Marchant’s Station.  About three weeks ago he left and had since been driving a mule team.  He was not destitute.  Deceased had said if the child died he would leave his wife.  Went to see him between 2 & 3 o’clock and found him lying as though he had fainted.  Got him onto the bed.  He told the witness he had taken arsenic.  Witness then went next door and told them to send for a doctor, as Bollmann had taken poison.  Had to leave then, as he was very poorly himself.

Joseph Parker, chemist:

Deceased had come in with another and asked for poison to destroy his dog, which he said was howling and disturbing the child.  Gave him 10 grains.  Deceased was sober and he and his companion were talking about the dog all the time they were in the shop.  Also made up medicine for the child.

James Symonds gave evidence of seeing deceased at about 2 p.m. the day before.  Deceased had gone to Nankervis’s for some wine and witness had gone on to work at the Mine.

Dr L.J. Maurau:

Got home at about 6 p.m. from visiting patients.  Was told a little girl had been for him to see Mr Bollmann who was very ill.  Nothing was said about poison. Had a number of patients waiting and saw them as quickly as possible.  Was hurrying with his dinner when a boy came to say a man was dying at Mrs Watkins’ at Hampton.  Went immediately, but found the deceased had been dead about half an hour.  Knew deceased.  Was satisfied from what he had seen and been told that the deceased had died from strychnine.  Had visited the dying child about 1 p.m.  Deceased was then much troubled about the child.  He did not think he could possibly have saved the deceased even had he been home when sent for.

The jury returned a verdict of suicide and expressed their opinion that the neighbours had been grossly negligent in not taking more energetic actions to get medical help.  They also thought the Government should take actions to restrict the sale of poisons.

[Charles Bollman died 19 March 1861 at Hampton aged 1.

Christopher Bollman died 19 March 1861 at Hampton aged 35.
