Burra Floral Float won third prize in a state-wide competition.  The display of flowers in Adelaide last week was magnificent.  All business places had glorious displays.  The floral pageant on Friday took place in glorious sunshine and Burra took third prize in its section and its lovely float was only one point behind the second prize winner.  It appeared about halfway through the procession and was greeted with great enthusiasm.  The four local girls Melva Bourman, Margaret Steele, Marcia Collins and Maxine Whittney appeared to appreciate fully the important and dignified part they were playing.
