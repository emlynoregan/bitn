The Ayers School teacher Mr Huppatz said that three boys had sat for their QC and each had performed very creditably: Colin Lloyd (600), Ross white (600) and Bill Byles (525).  The scores of 600 were the highest gained at Ayers School.

Mr Huppatz was also being transferred for 1942.

Prizes were presented, Father Christmas distributed gifts of Christmas Stockings and balloons.

Ice creams were consumed and the older folks danced until supper concluded the festivities.
