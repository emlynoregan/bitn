Burra Bowling Club.

The Club obtained establishment costs from the Strathalbyn Club.  The Town Council has offered to sell a frontage of 40’ to Thames St for £30.  Mr Sampson has offered the adjacent block (Known as Carey’s) for £150.  Mr Ruthven moved acceptance of the two offers, but Mr Crewes thought the number of members should first be ascertained.  An advertisement for members is to be inserted in The Record.  A pro tem committee was appointed comprising Messrs Gebhardt, Halliday, Ruthven, Crewes, Wilkinson, Rosman & Chambers.  100 £5 debentures will be issued and £250 was immediately promised.  Mr Gebhardt is the chairman of the committee and Mr Chambers the secretary.  Since the meeting promises for debentures have reached c. £400.

[The large supporters with 10 debentures each were: Messrs Gebhardt, Chambers, A.J. McBride & I.J. Warnes.]
