Accident.  As Rev. Stanton was leaving St Mary’s Church today the wheel of his carriage caught the corner of the bridge fence on the road.  Mr Stanton was thrown out with great violence and the shafts and traces were broken.  Mr Stanton lay unconscious for more than fifteen minutes and serious fears were held for his safety.

Dr Peel attended and the victim recovered, though it was several hours before he could be taken home.  He is badly bruised and the extent of his injuries will not be certain for some time.  One report speaks of a broken arm.

No other members of the family who were with him were injured, though the children were frightened.
