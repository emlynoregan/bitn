W. Young had a strange experience at 3 a.m. last Thursday morning when going on duty at the power house.  A ball of light green fire in a strange misty formation came from the west and rolled over him.  It felt like a heat wave and had a flinty, sulphurous odour.  It continued northeast after the slag heap.  Perhaps a meteorologist can explain the phenomenon.
