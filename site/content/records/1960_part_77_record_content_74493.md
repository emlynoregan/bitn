Burra Show Society held its AGM 11 March.  Ron Shipard of Hanson replaced Graham Kellock as President.  Other officers: Patron, Rex C. Warnes; Senior Vice-President, Neil Hurst; Junior Vice-President, Peter Stockman and Secretary-Treasurer, Darrell H. Field (re-elected).  The society was in credit $122.50 after having new toilet facilities erected.  The toilet project was made possible in large part due to the Rural Youth, who ran a Lottery Cabaret to assist.  D.T. Jacka & Co. erected the new toilets.

The show was held on the Saturday of the October long weekend and coincided with the Burra Copper Festival.  As a result gate takings were a near record.  Mr Bert Kelly MHR opened the show.  The day began with showers, but cleared as the day progressed.  Entries were good in most sections.  More entries in shearing would be appreciated.  Miss show Girl was a huge success.  The Dog Section was not held for lack of a convenor.  A pony club has been formed in Burra in the past year and has been given permission to use the grounds.  The Boy Scouts have permission to use the halls for their meetings.  Thanks to Roy Humphrys for keeping the grounds weed free and to Secretary D.H. Field and his wife and to other members of committees.
