Burra World Heritage

Supporters  of World Heritage Listing for the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape have approached the SA Heritage Council, which is now preparing a nomination to have the Sa Cornish Mining Site – incorporating Burra & Moonta Mines – on the National Heritage Listing with the view of then proceeding to the World Heritage Tentative List.  The Cornwall & West Devon Site was World Heritage Listed in 2006.

Abandoned Mines Project senior geologist Greg Drew said such recognition would bring tangible socio-economic benefits to the region.  It would draw conservation funding and international tourism.  The ultimate aim is to have a Transnational World Heritage Listing including Cornwall-West Devon, South Australia, Mexico, Spain and South Africa; all of which have Cornish mining sites.  National listing is a necessary first step.  After that national government support would be necessary.  A Mining Heritage Working Party has been set up.  Heritage officials will visit Burra and Moonta Mines 3-4 November and community meetings will be included.  Keynote speakers will be two English experts on Cornish mining heritage:

Professor Phillip Payton, Professor of Cornish & Australian Studies and Director of the Institute of Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter.

Barry Gamble from the Cornwall County Council.
