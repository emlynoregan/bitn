Showgrounds

The Flower Pavilion at the showgrounds has been greatly improved by the addition of tables right around the pavilion.  These will relieve the committee of much trouble in getting and erecting trestle tables etc.  Mr R. Fuss erected the tables free of charge and the society provided Â£40 worth of timber.  He also carried out many minor repairs to the pavilion.  Mr Fuss has now offered to donate the labour necessary to build tables down the centre as fixtures, 40 ft x 4 ft if some person or persons will donate the timber.
