Demolition in Historic Burra

Heritage Advisor, Douglas Alexander, writes calling on people to consider the value to the town of ruins, trees, stone walls, fences, etc.  All contribute to the character of Burra and should be carefully considered before any removal.  Maintenance and repair or restoration keeps local tradesmen busy, maintains the townâ€™s integrity and aids tourism.
