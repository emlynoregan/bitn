Burra Hospital Board of Enquiry.

[As explained in Dr Ashton’s letter, the enquiry reached its conclusions without hearing from him.]

[The conclusions of the Board were very strongly against Dr Ashton, but it also found that the Hospital Board was at fault in allowing the situation to develop and in not acting firmly early.  Practices that had developed over many years were inappropriate and the Board should have known that and acted.  A thorough revision of hospital rules was required.]

Findings on allegations against the Hospital Board

The Board was justified in passing a resolution on 15 August 1915 declaring Dr Ashton’s accusation of neglect by nursing staff in the Riese case unfair.

The Board was justified in not granting leave of absence to Nurse Mosey, as the course she wished to take could be of no benefit to the hospital.  The insult alleged to have been made to Dr Steele was in circumstances now unclear and if it occurred does not seem intentional and did not appear to make him specially aggrieved.

Under the circumstances of the time the Board was justified in asking Dr Ashton for written instructions, if that was taken to apply to orders concerning operations.  [Though the enquiry admitted that the definition of ‘instructions’ was not clear.]

Concerning advising Dr Ashton on 16 June 1917 that only emergencies were to be admitted, that was also justified in the circumstances.

In supporting the desire of the hospital matron to have hours for operations fixed, the Board was not unreasonable.

The resolution of 5 July 1917 terminating Dr Ashton’s appointment as a medical officer ‘was proper in the circumstances’.

There was no evidence that a nurse revised or countermanded a surgeon’s instructions about an operation.  [They added that to have carried out the operation at the time requested would have been unsafe.]

There is no evidence of personal animosity to Dr Ashton, or of a desire to strip him of remuneration.

The Board did not find ‘in the constitution of the hospital or in any agreement with the medical officer of the hospital that Dr Ashton possessed any right to charge for operations on his own patients at the hospital, such patients paying the ordinary hospital charges’. 

[While this finding is no doubt true in a legalistic sense, this finding would certainly appear to fly in the face of long established custom and certainly it was not only Dr Ashton who was involved.  Dr Ashton says in his letter that he was told when he came to the town in 1910, by the Chairman of the Hospital Board ‘doctors could charge private patients fees just as if they were in their own homes.]

The evidence shows that Dr Ashton charged a non-fee paying patient for attendance on her while she was a patient at the hospital.

[The statement by the patient included in Dr Ashton’s letter, while not making things quite clear on this, does raise doubts about this allegation.  She says the £17 was ‘for private and hospital attendance together’.  She was never told the £17 was for hospital attendance alone.  She further says she was never asked to pay the bill after explaining the circumstances.]

There is no evidence of the Board seeking to humiliate medical officers.

Evidence shows the hospital was never left without a medical man to conduct operations.

There is no evidence to show that the appointment of Mr P.A. McBride to the Board was unsuitable.  [The objections by some at the time had been on the grounds that he was rather young and that his appointment gave the McBride family too many connections on the Board either by blood or marriage.]

There is no evidence that the Board did anything to discourage subscriptions.

There was no need for patients to be sent out of town for treatment as a result of the way the Board treated Dr Ashton.

The Board was not responsible for people travelling elsewhere for treatment (often in unfit conditions for travel).

There is no evidence the Board charged excessive fees.  The Board is not responsible for Dr Ashton’s refusal to work at the hospital.

Meetings of the Board are open to the public.
