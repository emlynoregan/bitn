Obituary.  At 20 minutes past 4 oâ€™clock 22 June Mr J.M. Stacey on entering Adelaide Railway Station saw someone lying apparently in a fit.  On being raised the person was recognised as W.K. Elphick, late of Kooringa.  Dr Phillips was sent for, but Mr Elphick died before he arrived.  The deceased apparently walked from his home to buy a ticket for Freeling and while in the action of securing his ticket he fell down in a fit.  He had not been unwell and had not been subject to fits.  He was a colonist of many years and had once carried on business as a chemist in Rundle Street and then was for a long time assayer to the SA Mining Association.  His services had been dispensed with upon the stoppage of the Mine.  He had been living in Gilles Street.  He was a most respected citizen and a man of unblemished character.  An inquest will be held.
