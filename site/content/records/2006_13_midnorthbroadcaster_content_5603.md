Shane O’Bryan of Burra has been involved in the shearing industry for more than 30 years, having started as a young teenager.  He made a career of shearing sheep by travelling all over the state, but said the season had now dropped to eight months from eleven.  Expenses in living away from home range from $20 to $35 a day so no one is keen to work away in contract sheds.  Fewer young people are taking up the job.  Roustabouts are even harder to find.  It is hard physical work and not well paid.  There is no holiday or sick pay or a guaranteed weekly income.  The money is very appealing for young workers, but when they get older they can earn better wages.  To keep men on the job you need to find them jobs when work is short.  Mr O’ Bryan started at 16 and became a gun shearer, going from 40 wethers a day to 200 or more.  His best was 333.
