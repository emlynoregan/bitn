Weather.  Dust!

On Saturday the town experienced one of the worst dust storms in its history.  Other storm may have carried more dust, but the duration of this storm made it unusual.  It lasted from early morning to late at night and was not entirely over on Sunday morning.  Farmers lost considerable grain shaken from heads of wheat and vegetable gardens were very badly damaged.
