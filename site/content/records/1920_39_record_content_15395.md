Anzac Tweed.  An article outlines the origin of this cloth.  It was the product of hand looms operated by returned disabled soldiers.  It began under the auspices of the Victorian State War Council in 1915 and has been continued under the RSL.  The cloth is available to the public and can be obtained direct from the factory.  Suit and costume lengths are available for £2-2-0 and £2-5-6 + 2/- freight.
