St Mary’s Jubilee.  The old church was originally built on Limestone Hill and opened in 1848, but this was demolished some years ago and a new one built on a suitable site between Kooringa and Aberdeen.  Many old parishioners are expected to attend the celebrations.  Rev. R. Bagshaw was about the first minister who conducted services in the old church and we understand the Rev. Pollitt was the first rector stationed here.

[According to St Mary’s Church Burra: The First 150 Years, by John Devenport (1997) Rev. Bagshaw was the first resident priest, arriving in 1847.  A slab building was erected for a schoolroom and also served for services on Sunday.  He was invited to Penwortham in 1850.  Old St Mary’s was not built till Rev. James Pollitt’s time.  He was appointed on 3 April 1850.  Money was being collected for a church building and by 1849 over £700 had been raised.  The SA Church Society donated £150.  Old St Mary’s would seem to date from 1852.]
