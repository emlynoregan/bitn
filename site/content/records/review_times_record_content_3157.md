Bon Accord Museum

Although the Jubilee 150 grant of $30,000 had been spent, there was still much work to be done at the Bon Accord buildings and grounds.  Over three days recently members of the National Trust held a successful working bee to help with the project.  Moonta artist Mr Peter Stitt is arranging the displays.  Curator of the National Trust and local librarian Colin Fidock is preparing interpretive information.  Former Burra teacher Mrs Pam Marlow is completing her model of the 1860 view of the Burra Burra Mine.  Over the weekend the interior of the corrugated iron shed which houses the mine shaft was painted.  This shaft has recently been cleaned and illuminated.  The interior of the stone building will also be painted in time for the official opening of the museum on the October long weekend.
