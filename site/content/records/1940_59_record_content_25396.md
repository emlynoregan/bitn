Old Burraites met at the Botanic Gardens in Adelaide on 23 February.  It has been customary to hold such a meeting on the last Saturday in February for many years.  The oldest person present was probably Mr C.J. Tiver (85) [But see Bill Fitzgerald!].  Mr Tom Nevin (79) the first schoolmaster at Copperhouse was present.  Mr Bill Fitzgerald (88) learnt his trade as an apprentice printer at the Burra Record. Until he retired he spent 40 years in the Government Printing Office.  [Others who attended are listed.]
