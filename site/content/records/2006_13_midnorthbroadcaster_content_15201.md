Burra Motor Inn manager Paul Henley has been behind the petition to see the Gawler-Burra railway line re-opened.  At a meeting in June at Burra Dan van Holst Pellekaan said he would be happy to table the petition in Parliament.  Mr Henley said there are investors ready to invest in the Mid North rail project, which raised the real possibility of trains running to Burra in the near future.  This investment would be beneficial to the Mid North region and to the townships along the route.
