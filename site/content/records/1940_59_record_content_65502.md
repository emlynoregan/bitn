Burra Town Council, 18 October

Mr M.W. Bednall is to be interviewed concerning a by-law for stands for street hawkers in Market Square and Best Place.

It was resolved the fee be £5 per day or part thereof with provision for a penalty not exceeding £25.

Burra Electric Supply Co. says street lights are checked regularly and asks for a list of lights that are ‘out’ with a date and position.

Approval was given for the ‘Austin’ neon sign to be moved from Mr L. Fiebig’s Garage to Mr C.N. Bushell’s Garage.

Alterations and additions to the premises of H.J. & J.B. Topsfield were approved.
