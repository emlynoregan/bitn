Election Meeting.  Burra Institute, Thursday

This meeting was disappointing both because of the lack of interest from voters, but also because the candidates were all such as were stuck in the past and with such members the Council will continue to be a heavy drag on progress.  They offered nothing for the future.  In education they were particularly out of touch and would follow policies creating class distinction.  Bosworth thinks Bible reading is unobjectionable, when we know it to be highly controversial.  There is little to choose between the three, who are equally uninspiring.
