[Page one of this issue is a good example of how in this year there may be no local news on the first page.  There were just four column centimetres relating to Burra on page one: the local LCL dinner was cancelled and the Burra weekly rainfall was reported.  The rest of page one had features on:

A teacher surplus in SA

A superphosphate price rise

How to tackle soursobs

Commonwealth Government Cash & Conversion Loan

A State Library Display in Adelaide

Army recruiting.]
