Obituary.  Mr William Birt of Hampton arrived in the colony in Sep. 1847 and came to Burra in October 1849 where he became foreman carpenter at the Burra Mine.  In the Victorian Goldrush of 1852 he went with the rest, but was not very successful and came back to his old job.  Later he worked at the old smelting works and at the Bon Accord Mine as well as working on his own account as a builder.  One of his last jobs was the large store occupied by James Tiver in Aberdeen.  He died in his 84th year.  [Died 24 February 1890 aged 84.]
