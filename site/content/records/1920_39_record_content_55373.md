Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. 28 March to 6 April

25ft level: small seam giving 4 to 6 dwt per ton.

50ft level: drive to 271 ft on a trace leading to a seam yielding c. 4 dwt per ton with good prospects.

92ft level: south drive to 367ft, turning to miss a solid quartzite bar & entered country with traces of gold.  West tunnel in the last 5 ft has attractive ore with one sample of 10-12 dwt, but further testing is needed – cannot advance here without air.
