Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Concluded)

Darlington’s report led to drastic changes in both the management and operation of the mine.  Controlling management was handed over to Messrs John Darlington and Co. of London to whom the Directors sent monthly reports.  Mr Challoner had full control locally and sent reports on via the Directors.  It was decided to work the mine by open cut and accordingly machinery was sent from London.  Almost all work was stopped except for preparations for the new machinery.  Water rose to its natural level.  The central area of the mine that had been covered by whims, shafts and a series of buildings was completely cleared.  The general body of men were either unemployed or sought work elsewhere.  By now some of the early leases on land in Kooringa, taken for 21 years, were expiring and on enquiry applicants for renewal were offered 31 years at a rental to be arranged after inspection or they could buy the fee simple.  The blocks in Market Square area were re-surveyed and then Kooringa.  In every case as properties were inspected the rents were raised.  Many now chose to purchase their blocks, but always mineral rights were reserved.

Among the first, if not the first, to purchase was Mr W. Batchelor who bought the property now owned by R.D. Pascoe and Philip Lane’s house and land in Kangaroo St.

1869 was very quiet.  The mine activity was mostly clearing, stocktaking and sorting out unwanted material for sale.  Mr Swansborough was being sent out to erect the new machinery and superintend operations.  He was expected in October.  A new dressing tower was among the main jobs.

Captains White and Paull resumed duties and in December 1870 the machinery was ready to start the open cut.  Morphett’s Engine was started to lower the water to 30 fathoms.  After pumping for 57 hours and making 20,621 strokes or 6 per minute and raising 4,165,442 gallons and forking 24’ 10” the bottom clack of the 20” at the 30 fathom level went off, but it was later found something more serious had happened.  The 14” lift was set to work by itself with 18ft of water to fork which was expected to take nine days at 8 lifts per minute (the safety limit of the engine).  After a day’s pumping they reached a stage where the pump was making no impression on the water level.  They had to put down a 20” lift alongside to help it.  This took several weeks and then another start was made at 7 lifts per minute and no further problems were encountered.  Trials followed of the hauling portion of cables and tracks worked off Peacock’s and Morphett’s Shafts.  It took some time to regulate the speed to allow the long cable time to run the trucks safely over the line, but eventually it all worked well.  Material passed over by tributers was worthless now showed 30% ore under the new system.  In six months to October 1871 29,330 wagons of stuff weighing 36,762 tons were tipped; an increase from the 15,000 of the previous six months.

In 1871 W.H. Challoner resigned after 24 years in the mine, having come in 1847 as a clerk and rising through accountant to manager.  His family necessitated his return to England.  Mr Furniss, who later was manager of the National Bank in Kooringa, replaced him for three years.  Mr W. West replaced Furniss after three years and stayed to the end.  The new machinery certainly shifted large volumes of material, but failed to find much more than small quantities of ore missed in the earlier working.  Captain Roach had not missed much above the 30 fathom level.  The management in London allowed the mine to continue while it paid expenses, but by about 1876 the end was in sight and further development would require the input of capital.  The Directors refused to raise capital and this brought about the closure of the mine in November 1877.  Shortly afterwards a 2 or 3 day sale got rid of horses, plant, etc. for over £5,000.

During the period of the Darlington scheme care was taken to let or sell as many blocks in Kooringa as possible.  When the mine closed few people wanted to buy land in Burra and the town entered upon some of its darkest days.  Farming and pastoral interests were also struggling and things drifted until the introduction of drills and manures in the late 1890s, when agricultural returns began to increase wonderfully.  Burra once more became prosperous and eventually the Mining Association saw their chance to sell and in the end a clear-up sale was held at which Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride bought the mine property and still lease it.

I have often been asked if I think the mine still has workable copper and secondly if it will work again.

[Treloar then disclaims any expertise before giving his opinion.]

To the first question he thought that there was workable ore below the controlled water level, possibly in sulphide form.  To the second question he thought the answer was yes in the sweet bye and bye.  In the time of mining operations copper to the value of almost £5 million was taken and the ore assayed at an average of over 22%.

[Note.  Treloar’s statement about the sale of the mine property is at best misleading.  In 1901 an Adelaide based syndicate floated the Burra Burra Copper Co. and this bought the mine from the South Australian Mining Association.  The company was under capitalised and managed to do relatively little of either mining or exploration of the resource and after several abortive attempts to find a buyer the Burra Burra Copper Co. (in liquidation) sold its properties in 1916.  There were various buyers, but after the auction the mine block itself of 262 acres was sold to A.J. Mc Bride for £3,000.  See XV, 486, 2 Oct. 1901, page 2, XV, 495, 25 Dec. 1901, page 2 and XXXIII, 1984, 2 Feb. 1916, page 3.]
