Record Merino Price

A new SA record price of $261 per head for commercial Merino Ewes was achieved last Friday at Snowtown when Richard and Barbara Turner of ‘Rayville’ dispersed their Leahcim bloodline at their clearing sale.  This shattered the previous record of $180 by a staggering $81.  The price was paid by Mark Kerin of Yoeval NSW for 130 of the Turners’ 2008 drop ewes that were pregnancy tested in lamb.  [Considerably further detail is given of this sale.]
