‘Veritas’ writes to the editor from Kooringa 18 January re Kooringa Post Office in response to two letter on the same subject appearing in the paper of the previous Wednesday:

The telegraph office is not central; rather the reverse, being on the outskirts of the township.  It is the last house at the end of town opposite from where the mail cart enters.  It is also perched on a hill so high and inaccessible as to prevent the near approach of the mail cart.

On the other hand the proposed so-called ‘hole-in-the-wall’ location in Commercial Street is central and accessible to both miners and tradesmen, of whom the latter group receive fifty times the mail of the former.  It is also near the site of the old post office, whose site provoked no adverse comment.

The argument that the new site is more central for Redruth is negated by the fact that Redruth has its own post office.  I have been informed by a tradesman that our postmaster has already concluded a contract for enlarging and fitting up the new office in every way worthy of the central position it is to occupy in our principal business street.

‘Uninterested’ also writes to the editor on the same topic.  He makes five points in response to the previously published correspondence.

The post office at present is far from central.
