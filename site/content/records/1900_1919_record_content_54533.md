Burra Cheer-up Soc.

On Monday 11 March there was a welcome social for Tpr H. Bowman and Pte W.A. Pohlner.  Welcomed also were returned soldiers who have taken up land at Springbank: Messrs Clark, Ninnis, Roberts & Kelleough.

The Society has purchased a horse for a returned man, Mr Robertson, who badly needed one to continue his journey out east.

A photo of the late Pte Leighton has been received.
