Burra Arts & Crafts Exhibition was held last weekend and saw exhibits at the Town Hall, the Civic Centre and the former Smelters’ Home Hotel.  Coaches arrived from Broken Hill, Adelaide, Pt Pirie and Pt Augusta and other visitors came from across the state.  Local support was also good and the music of ‘Tamarisque’ on Sunday was a feature.
