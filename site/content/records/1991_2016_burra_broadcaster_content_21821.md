Burra Pony Club celebrated its 25 anniversary with a dinner and gymkhana in the beer garden of the Royal exchange Hotel on 11 March when over 70 old and new members attended.

Youngsters danced and played games and older members pored over albums of past events.  Ray Wardle, first President of the club, attended with his wife Ro, but there was an apology from another of the founders, John Newton of the Mounted Police.  Over 40 horses and ponies attended the gymkhana the next day.  [Results of events and extended details of the celebrations are printed.]
