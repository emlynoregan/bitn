Burra Burra DC convened a Fire Meeting 21 December 1950.

The Chairman, Cr E.L. McWaters, welcomed those present.  The meeting was to increase the understanding of the voluntary fire fighting organisation.  Fire fighting is largely the landowner’s responsibility.  Everyone in a fire situation should carry out the instructions of the Fire Control Officer.  There was no penalty for a volunteer who refused duty, but there was a penalty for obstructing the work of a Fire Control Officer.  The officer may, after consulting with the occupier, if present, enter lands or buildings and may cut fences etc. to make firebreaks, light fires, clear strips as firebreaks and take any water, other than domestic supplies, for fire fighting.

The Ladies’ Auxiliary of the EFS was formed by Miss MacMillan of the Police department and the Burra Section has been organised and functions effectively.

Various other aspects of the powers of individuals and the possibility of claims for compensation were clarified.
