Anzac Day was commemorated on Sunday 26 April and it is thought attendance exceeded any previous.  The weather was perfect.  RSL Secretary G.H. Dow organised the event.  The base of the monument was draped in the Union Jack and the Australian Flag and the town flag flew at half-mast.  The returned men assembled shortly before 3 p.m. under Major R.C. Sexton and marched from the club room.  Many were in uniform and most wore their medals.  The Light Horse under Lieut. M.T. Fuller drew up behind them, followed by the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster D.T. McBain.  The Burra Brass Band led the march up to the Hospital and down Commercial St again to the monument.  J.O. Earle was standard-bearer.  Rev. J.S.W. Coles took charge of the service.  Also present were Rev. H.S. Jarvis (Methodist) and Ensign Fielding of the Salvation Army, the Mayor and Councillors and returned nurse Mrs D. Keynes nee Sister E. Armstrong.  The band was led by J.H. Murison.  Ensign Fielding read the lesson.  Rev. Jarvis said the prayer of deliverance.  Rev. J.S.W. Coles gave the address.  About Â£12 was collected for the AIF Cemetery Fund.  H.J.B. Jennison played Last Post & Reveille.
