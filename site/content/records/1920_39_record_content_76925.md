Obituary.  Mrs S. Smelt who died on 30 October at Burra Hospital was a resident of Mt Bryan & Wynarka [Murray Mallee].  She was born at Echunga in 1858 and there later married Leonard Henry Smelt.  They later moved to Belalie North for many years and thence to Mt Bryan where they took up land.  The family were strong supporters of the Methodist Church there.  Mr Smelt died 20 years ago.  Five years ago Mrs Smelt went to live with her daughter Mrs Wardle at Wynarka.  She is survived by Mr Henry Smelt (Victoria), Mr John A. Smelt (Wynarka), Mrs Dorcas Wardle (Manoora) and Emily Mrs G.S. Nourse (Mt Bryan).  There are several grandchildren.

[Born Susan Hardeman or Hardiman from marriage but registration of birth not found.  The above information about who she lived with and where is contradictory.  Death registration gives her place of residence as Wynarka.]
