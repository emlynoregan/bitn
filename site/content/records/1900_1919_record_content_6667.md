A Motor Vehicle?  It was rumoured that a motorcar would arrive at the Burra Station on Friday night so a number of people went to see it.  One young couple talked so intently that they almost got to Copperhouse before turning back and a droverâ€™s turn-out passed them with a clatter of pots and pans dangling about.  They identified this as the motor, but their friends back in town had seen nothing.
