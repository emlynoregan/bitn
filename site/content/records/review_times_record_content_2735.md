Burra Branch of the National Trust had a bus tour of historic sites in Gladstone, Orroroo and Terowie.  Twenty-two members visited the Gladstone Gaol, a wattle and daub cottage at Orroroo and the Yesteryear Costume Gallery and finished with afternoon tea at Terowie where Mrs Marina Gray of Terowie’s Citizen’s Association introduced the group to the collection of historical buildings in the main street the association is restoring.  The branch raised $80 from the trip.
