Burra Primary School & Burra High School

The school libraries were opened by the Director of Education Mr E. Mander-Jones last Friday.  Among the official party were the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone; the Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr G.R. Finch and the District School Inspector Mr E. Gann.  [A complete list is printed.]

A summary of a speech by Mr Auhl is printed.

More extensively there is a report of the speech by Mr Darrell Field, Chairman of the Appeal Program, who outlined the appeal process.

Mr Mander-Jonesâ€™ speech appears to be printed in full.

Mrs Reg. Warnes then presented a photo of her grandfather Mr Cater, the first headmaster of the school in 1878.

After inspecting the Library and classrooms of both schools the Director was entertained at luncheon in the Commercial Hotel before going on to inspect the Farrell Flat School.
