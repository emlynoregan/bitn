Burra Hospital sent a deputation to Council to lay before them the need for raising funds for the rebuilding program.  Mr Thomson (Chairman of the Board) had raised with the Acting Premier, Mr R. Butler, the need for rebuilding and he had agreed, but the institution is a subsidised hospital, so funds will have to be raised which the Government will then subsidise.  The Board believed the task was outside their province and ought to be undertaken by the Council in whom the property was vested.  They suggested that they get plans from the Government and lay them before a public meeting at which representatives from adjacent District Councils would be present and a scheme for raising funds devised.  The Mayor promised support and was glad the Government had recognised the need for redevelopment.  The decision as to when a meeting be called was left to the Mayor.
