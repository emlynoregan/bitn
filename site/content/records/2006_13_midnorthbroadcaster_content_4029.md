Reminiscences of Peterborough sheep sales

Greg. Foster formerly of Elders at Peterborough recalls that the last sale, or very nearly the last sale could have been in September 1993 – it was certainly the last one for which the sheep arrived by rail – 15 vans or 1,500 sheep from Commonwealth Hill.  And they were accidentally carried on the Broken Hill and had to be sent back to Peterborough for the sale.  The steel yards and loading ramps have recently been sold by tender.
