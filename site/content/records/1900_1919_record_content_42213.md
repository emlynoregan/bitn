Soldiers’ Aid Society met at Jubilee Hall 17 June.  Several new members were enrolled to bring the total to close to 100.  Knitting and the preparation of old linen for hospital use continues and various money raising activities have begun: guessing the name of a doll for instance.  So far £20-11-0 has been raised.  A list of donated goods is, as usual, printed.
