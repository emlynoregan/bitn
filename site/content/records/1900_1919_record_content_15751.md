Accident.  Mr J. Edwards, son of Harry Edwards of Spring Bank, was coming into Burra with a load of hay and had just crossed the railway line with his team of five horses when a culvert gave way and the front wheel on one side descended to the bottom of the culvert.  The hay fell off and with it a younger brother who was lucky not to be hurt.  Mr Edwards doesnâ€™t recall how he escaped from the bottom of the hole, but others believe he must have climbed over the shafts to get free from the opposite side.  He slightly injured a leg and needed some stitches in a hand.
