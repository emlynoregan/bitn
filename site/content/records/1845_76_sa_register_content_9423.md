Election Notice

A numerously attended meeting of Mr Mildred’s supporters held at the Miner’s Arms on 2 October resolved:

‘That this meeting having read Mr Kingston’s address to the Electors of the Burra, receive it with that utter contempt it so RICHLY deserves.’

‘That Mr Mildred’s reply be considered a full; fair, just, and true repudiation to the MEAN and UNMANLY address which Mr Kingston, in his gentlemanlike way thought proper to offer.’
