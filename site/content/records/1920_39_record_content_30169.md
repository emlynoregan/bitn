Burra Local Court, 26 March

Arthur H. Harrison [Harold Arthur Harrison, known as ‘Mick’] was charged with stealing two bags of chaff from Sara & Co. on 18 March.  He pleaded not guilty and defended himself.

Sgt McDonald and PC Geoffrey Webster found a full bag and two half bags of chaff at the defendant’s on 18 March.  The defendant claimed to know nothing of them.  There was a quantity of chaff on the floor of a Ford car in the yard.  Harrison Sen. also claimed no knowledge of the chaff, but later admitted he knew it was there.

Laurie Johnson said that Harrison Sen. had said that Mick (the defendant) had got two bags of chaff from McKenzie’s.  The sergeant then showed he had discovered footprints at the rear of Sara’s shop that matched those of the defendant.  The samples of chaff at Sara’s and the defendant’s were alike in cut, grain and colour.

John Harrison, labourer of Redruth and father of the defendant, gave evidence of not knowing for certain where the chaff came from, but having assumed Mick had bought it from McKenzie’s, with a suggestion it might have been planted to get Mick into trouble.

E.J. McKenzie swore he had not sold the chaff and J.B. Crawford chaff merchant of Riverton could swear the bags were from his business.
