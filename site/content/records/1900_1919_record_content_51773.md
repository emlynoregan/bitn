On 27 September the Ladies’ Band went to Petersburg to assist in Red Triangle Day there.  They were pressed to perform at Terowie and produced a rousing march on the platform.  At 3 p.m. they assembled at the Town Hall and after two selections were rushed to the sale yards to gather money during a 15-minute session there.  Then there was afternoon tea at the Town Hall before further selections outside.  Time did not permit a parade.  At the evening entertainment they contributed four selections.

On the following Saturday they were at the Market Square Rotunda to welcome Major Lance Lewis home and in the afternoon went to Farrell’s Flat for Australia Day there.   Mr I.J. Warnes has allowed two more cornets to be got for the band by donating the extra £20 needed.  Last week we reported he gave a drum valued at £12.  There has been a farewell social for Pte P. Byles and a parcel was sent to Pte Williams.
