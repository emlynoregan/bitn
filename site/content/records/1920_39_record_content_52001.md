CWA held its AGM 20 July with President Mrs I.J. Warnes in the chair.

The deaths of two prominent members during the year in Mrs C.D. Wilkinson & Mrs F.R. Wigley were acknowledged.

The annual report revealed an active year.  Of special note was the 23 August meeting when the International Officer for Australia, Mrs Fairfax, addressed a gathering at the Institute, accompanied by State Officers.  A Continental on 31 January at ‘Wahroonga’ was also very successful.   The branch remained financially sound.  Elections returned Mrs I.J. Warnes as President again, Mrs Robinson remained Treasure and Miss Minnie Rogers was re-elected as Secretary.
