Football Semi-Final

Burra	3.1	4.2	7.4	10.4

Hallett	3.7	4.10	4.11	6.12

The weather was atrocious and many players were forced off the field by severe cramps brought on by the cold.  Neither team finished with 18 players.  Burra lost James (injured early in the first quarter) late in the third quarter and within minutes Baulderstone left with cramp.  At about the same time Hallett lost Warrior with severe cold shivers and in the third quarter they lost Furst with concussion, L. Sullivan, F. Brooks and R. Scott with cramp, N. Prior with concussion and Wanganeen with shivers.  Burra were also weakened with Allen receiving a severe knock to the leg.
