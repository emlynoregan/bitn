Burra’s Sewage Ponds have been leaking into groundwater and until repairs are effected contractors disposing of liquid waste cannot use them.  The solution being put to Council this week is for a PVC liner at a cost of $70,000 and a total cost of $113,000.

The Council is also considering what to do about leakages from the main pond in the centre of town. Compaction of the bed with clay is one option and the elimination of the pond is another.  Supplying the water is costing about $20,000 a year to run the electric pump.  Council Director of Operations, Peter Boaden, said there could be merit in using a solar powered pump to get water from the mine pool.
