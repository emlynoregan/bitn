‘Ajax’ writes concerning Council Assessment.  District Councils were created primarily to provide roads.  The District Councils Act of 1929 provides two bases for assessment: rental values or annual values, i.e. fee simple values.

[Surely this should read rather rental values, i.e. annual values or fee simple values?]

The fee simple value must be on actual value of land plus improvements and it is not intended that world production prices should be considered by the assessor.  Land under different ownership has different production values, but the same fee simple value.  The Burra DC (or any other DC) assessment never reached within 33% of actual values.  The move for lower assessments that were never too high is a mild form of panic.  The ratepayer can appeal against an assessment.  It is not for the Council to interfere in the assessment.
