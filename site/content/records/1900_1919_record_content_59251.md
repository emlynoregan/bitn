Messrs C. Bartholomaeus & G.E. Dane have forwarded their resignations to the Chief Secretary.  Mr Dane sent a copy of his reasons to the Board, which related to the decisions taken at the last meeting.

The Repatriation Department wrote that Sister J.S. Wood, late Matron of the Burra Hospital, had returned from active service and was enquiring if she could be reinstated.  The Chairman said that originally that had been the arrangement, but Sister Wood later wrote (in June 1916) that she was giving up nursing and so they had made the last appointment permanent, despite which Sister Mildred was willing to resign to allow Nurse Wood’s return.  The situation as above will be communicated to the Department.

Under the circumstances of the hospital the secretary of the Australian Trained Nurses Assoc. (ANTA) thought that if a letter of explanation were sent the hospital might be reinstated for a time, but now a letter has been received from ANTA refusing such a concession while bed usage was so low.  Because they had engaged nurses who would not now fulfil their requirements to get their certificates the Hospital Board felt there had been a breach of faith as ANTA had undertaken to allow the situation to go on till the end of the war.  Another letter will be sent to ANTA.

Mr Warnes thought the agreement with the Local Board of Health to treat infectious patients for 30/- a week should be done away with.  Each case cost the hospital £4-£5 a week and only 30/- could be claimed from the Board of Health.  The debate then moved from the principle to the individual cases of the Thamms and Mr Crewes.  Legal opinion from an Adelaide solicitor will be sought.
