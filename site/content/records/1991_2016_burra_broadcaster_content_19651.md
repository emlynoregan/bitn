This article outlined the opportunities presented by entering into this new method of local management for schools, children’s services and TAFE Institutions.  It outlined objections to the model voiced by the Australian Education Union.  Their legal advice was that it was a risky thing to sign up to because, although it was legally binding, it was unspecific and did not meet the obligations of due diligence.  Funding over the three years of the service agreement was uncertain and didn’t take into account that all schools were struggling with their budgets due to reductions in funding since 1993.
