Burra Brass Band held its AGM 14 January in the Band Room.  The band’s patron Mr James Thomas died during the year.  Collections brought in less this year than in the previous year.  In 1934 11 open air concerts had yielded £24-12-7, but in 1935 the same number produced only £15-7-2.  Collections from individual concerts ranged from 15/- to £2-0-6. Instruments were purchased during the year for a cost of c. £37. A collecting drive by members raised about £27 towards that expense.  Shortage of funds prevents the holding of our little social evening this year.  This year we will fight to have a band contest in Burra.  Thanks go to P.W. Clark for the use of his room for practice and for the use of his private room for committee meetings.  Elected were: Patron, L.W. Gebhardt, President, E.F. Marston; Bandmaster, J.H. Murison; Deputy Bandmasters, G. Terry and A.W. Andrews; Secretary, J.T. Pascoe and Treasurer, J. Allen.
