Obituary.  Mrs Jim Lomman was buried at Booborowie on Saturday.  She was living at Balaklava, but was formerly of Booborowie.  [Ethel Cecilia Elizabeth Lomman died 22 August 1969 Balaklava aged 74.  On death registration said to be widow of Francis James Lomman, but no marriage on SA CD.  The only woman with these given names seems to have been born Ethel Cecelia [sic] Elizabeth Slee 12 June 1895 Melrose, making her the right age, but she married Edward William John Summers in 1917.  He died in 1949, so Jim Lomman could be a second marriage.  The husband is equally elusive.  Births suggest a Francis Joseph or a Frederick James.  The latter was of Booborowie 1892-1962, but any marriage is after available CD dates.]
