Burra High School.  17 December saw the end of year for the school and the prize giving.  Rev. A.G. King distributed the prizes.  The severe financial stresses of the times saw a smaller number of students this year and Mrs McLagan has been absent due to continuing bad health.  The loss of Mrs Winnall’s services [Formerly Miss Sprod] was also a severe blow after six years.  For family reasons early in the year the school moved from Bleak House to premises opposite the park which the Council has in part allowed to be used as a playground.

Ivy May Topperwein’s unbroken attendance record in the 3rd class is splendid.

Annie Goldsworthy gets the special prize for music from Mrs Winnall.

Mrs Needham’s prize for callisthenics goes to her daughter.

Mrs Robinson’s special prize for French and music goes to May Topperwein.

Miss Millar's mapping prize was awarded by Mr Winnall to Vera Wilkinson.

[Though not so named the dux of the school would seem to have been May Sangster with 1st in scripture, reading, English, and music and 2nd in French and getting the school vote for Class VI.]

In Class V Ida Brummitt topped the exams and Vera Wilkinson was first in class marks.
