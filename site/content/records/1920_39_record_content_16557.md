Obituary.  Joseph Parker, youngest son of Mr & Mrs George Parker of Leighton, died at Burra Hospital on 4 August soon after admission following an accident at home.

He was putting an unbroken horse into a team when it reared and bounded out.  The flying hook caught in his groin inflicting fearful injury.  His brother hung onto the reins and managed to stop the horse after about 300 yards.  The young man remained conscious, but the main artery to the heart was severed and he died soon after reaching the hospital.  His brother Cecil was slightly injured and severely shocked.  He was aged 21.  There are also four sisters: Mrs J. Pens (Bendigo Station), Mrs J.O. Earle (Leighton), Mrs Collins (Leighton) & Mrs H. Cornelius (Loch Winnoch Station).

[Joseph James Parker born 4 June 1904 at Copperhouse.]
