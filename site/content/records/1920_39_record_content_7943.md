Burra Town Council, 8 June

The Automobile Assoc. asked that entrances to the town be marked to assist travellers.  Granted.

SA War Trophy Committee advised that another field gun had been allocated and will be forwarded when Council advised its acceptance.

Adelaide electric Supply Co. advised they were unlikely to extend power to Burra in less than 7-10 years and that the proposed scheme seemed quite acceptable, but probably at a cost nearer to £12,000 than the £8,000 cited.

Cr Kellaway was appointed to represent the Council on the Burra Hospital Board.

Council decided to form a committee to welcome boy immigrants and town minister are invited to assist.

Cr Collins complained that the George St crossing (the ‘Pig & Whistle’) had been estimated at £100 and had cost £190.

Cr Kellaway said there had been no estimate, but West Ward had promised £50 understanding that to be one third of the likely cost.

Cr Collins insisted an estimate of £100 had been stated and he was not complaining of the quality, but of the error in estimate.

Cr Ewins could recall no estimate and Cr Harris thought £125 or £130 had been mentioned.
