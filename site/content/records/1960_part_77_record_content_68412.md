Burra Show

Miss Show Girl:

Senior	Jenny Lawrie

Junior	Annette Nankivell

Sub-Junior	Theresa Schwier

Industrial stands were well represented, but less machinery was on display due to the improved rural economy, resulting in less being available.

Budgerigars were good this year, despite being in poor feather due to recent heat.

Bantams were good and there were two very good Muscovy Ducks and a good Rouen Ducks.

Large fowls were down both in numbers and quality.

Pigeons were varied in quality.

Horses in action produced keen competition and the standard was good in hunter events and in hack events.

There was a good show of cut flowers.

Grain entries were disappointing â€“ two main competitors dropped out after 25 years of showing.

Cookery was a credit to the society and entrants.

The dog show was successful.

The best of the goats were quite good, but the class tailed off considerably.

Needlework entries were down, but of good quality.

Pigs were of good quality, but with disappointingly few local entries.

Strong wool entires were few in number, but of good quality.

In sheep Polls and Merinos were few in number, but good and the under 1,000 class was quite well represented.

Fleece exhibits were very good and the wool display overall was the second largest on record.
