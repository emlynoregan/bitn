Freemasonry began in Burra soon after the discovery of copper.  Power to hold a Lodge in Burra was granted under the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of England, with the Lodge to be known as the Mildred Lodge No. 585.   [The first regular meeting was held on 16 February 1850.]  The name was changed to Kooringa Lodge in 1854.  For many years the meetings were held in the Assembly Room of the Burra Hotel [i.e. the hotel on the site of the Burra Hospital] with meetings timed to be held immediately before full moon to facilitate the safe journey of members afterwards.  After the mine closed in 1877 many families left and [in December 1888] the Charter was surrendered. A new Charter was granted under the name of Kooringa Lodge No. 6 [in August 1899].  The Lodge purchased the [former Primitive Methodist Church] for Â£350 [in 1901] and the refurbished building was dedicated on 18 June 1901.  The Lodge celebrated its centenary in 1950.  There have been 407 members since 1850.
