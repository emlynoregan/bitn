Frederick Gebhardt was charged on the information of his wife with leaving her without adequate means of support.  He pleaded not guilty.

Mrs Gebhardt said he had not given her any food for a fortnight and she had been dependent on neighbours.  There were five children (two from his first wife) aged 10, 8, 5, 2 and 8 months.  On 11 October after the summons was sent the defendant came and smashed crockery and her sister’s box and took away all the bedding.  She had to take the children with her to Mrs Moore’s.

Ellen Moore, wife of Ezra Anthony Moore gave evidence of Mrs Gebhardt’s coming to her faint from want of food.  She had fed her and the children too.  She was a witness to the husband’s actions on 11 October.  The bench finally ordered Gebhardt to pay his wife £1 a week if she remained away and if she returned, as she agreed to do if protected, ordered him to keep the peace for six months on a bond of £50 with two sureties of £25 each.  Gebhardt had a heated exchange with the bench during this, which very nearly had Mr Ridgway imposing a gaol sentence of 14 days for contempt of court.  Charles Woodruff and John Parker entered into the necessary bonds.
