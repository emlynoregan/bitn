Cr Dane had seen a diagram for 400 names at £60-£80.

The Mayor counselled delay at this time.

Cr Harris feared the records of some men might be lost.

The location suggested was the Hall or the Public Reading Room.

The proprietor of the Record offered to publish all names available with a view to obtaining others not on the list.
