Burra Town Council, 15 March

The Overseer complained he had caught a number of dogs, held them three days and then destroyed them. At 6d a day keep he suffered a loss.  Cr Dow moved he be reimbursed.  Carried.

He urged strict enforcement of the Dog Act.

Cr Worth volunteered to go through the Dog Act and find out what powers the Council had.

The Town Clerk will get advice on this from the Municipal Assoc.

No tenders were received for the construction of the swimming pool.

The Clerk said there was £403 in hand.

[The Mayor and Cr Jennison had a further pointless altercation over blames for this unproductive situation.]

Cr Dow said the pool was going to cost £800, they had £403 and he was not in favour of starting till they had the money in hand.

The Mayor said there were promises of 128 bags of cement as good as cash.

Cr Jennison asked the Mayor for a special meeting in committee to discuss the matter and for the Mayor at such a meeting ‘to define . . . what idea you have in mind regarding the swimming pool’.

The Mayor said he had provided £20 worth of plans and specifications free.  What more could he do? He couldn’t run away from his own work to build a swimming pool.

Cr Jennison: ‘All we ask you is to tell us what scheme you have in the back of your mind to build this pool.’

The Mayor: ‘What scheme.’

Cr Jennison moved for a special meeting and Cr Jeffery seconded.

The Mayor said that only for the referendum the Council would have had the money to build the pool.

Motion carried.

Burra Rifle Club.  16th stage of the Pine Valley Trophy saw best scores from L.W. Mumme, N.J. Villis, C.D. Pexton, J.C. Murray & H.H. Byles.

[Each had scored the limit of 105 with handicap and in such cases the order was decided by the person using the lowest percentage of his handicap to reach that limit. That resulted in the order as above.]

Military Camp.  Last year the annual military camp was held at Clare.  Cr Jennison reckoned it brought about £1,500 into that town.  Some 600-700 troopers were involved.  He wanted the Sports Syndicate to permit the use of the racecourse and for Council then to extend the invitation.  Council endorsed the concept.
