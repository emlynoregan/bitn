Tennis, 17 February

‘A’ Grade	Aberdeen 9-66 defeated Spalding 8-71

Willalo 14-103 defeated Kooringa 6-84

Leighton 10-102 defeated Hallett 10-91

‘B’ Grade	Aberdeen II 12-92 defeated Ironmine I 8-56

Booborowie drew with Mt Bryan

Booborowie 14-95 defeated Mt Bryan 3-53

[The last two results don’t make sense and presumably one set of results is either from a different date or from ‘A’ grade.]
