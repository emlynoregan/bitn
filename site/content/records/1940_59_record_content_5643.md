Obituary.  Mrs Luke Day died on Sunday 13 April.  She was born at Angaston in 1876, the second daughter of Mr & Mrs John McLeod.  She later lived with her grandparents Mr & Mrs George Benn.  Her marriage to Mr Luke Day took place in 1895 when she came to Burra to reside.  Before being overtaken by ill health Mrs Day, who was of a most kindly disposition, was a friend to many old folk and a sympathetic neighbour.  In the time of the Great War she was a foremost knitter, and taught many of the girls to knit socks at afternoon and evening classes at her home.  She gave most of her time to patriotic work apart from assisting to make comforts for soldiers.  Her health had been failing for some months.  [Born Esther Miriam McLeod 2 February 1875 Angaston, married as Hester Miriam MacLeod: died Hester Amelia Day 13 April 1941 Burra.]
