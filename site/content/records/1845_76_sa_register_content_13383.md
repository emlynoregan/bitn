Kooringa Local Court, Monday

On Saturday a pair of inebriated Aborigines went to Mr Custerphon’s house near Kooringa and demanded money, drink and ‘tuck-out’.  Mrs Custerphon was alone at the time and refused to comply.  The Aborigines than tried to force the door and broke a window, as the same time uttering threats.  Mrs Custerphon escaped through a back door to her husband who was working in an outbuilding some distance away.  As she fled one threw a spear at her, but missed. Mr Custerphon ordered them off, but they refused to leave, so he got out a gun and fired into the ground near them.  They still stood their ground so he wounded on in the posterior with a slight charge of shot.  The police then arrived and took them into custody.  The police are endeavouring to find where the offenders obtained the means of intoxication.  The trial has been adjourned to Saturday to allow the attendance of the wounded native.
