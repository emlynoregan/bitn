Sir J.C. Bray: ‘known to care very little for the welfare of the many so long as he can further the interests of the few’. 

W.B. Rounsevell: ‘on account of his inconsistency and total disregard for political honesty . . .he can change front on any subject at five minute’s notice’. 

Mr Copley: was elected as a people’s representative, but has become one of the greatest Conservatives.
