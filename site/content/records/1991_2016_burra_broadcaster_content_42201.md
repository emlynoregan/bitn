• The paper began on 30 June 1876 as The Northern Mail [The premises was on part allotment 72 Commercial Street, in 2017 this is the property opposite the roadhouse]

• Six months later it changed its name to The Burra News and Northern Mail.

• In July 1878 its new editor. Frederick William Holder announced its new title would be The Record.

• On 4 October 1878 the name changed again to The Burra Record.

• It had taken a long time for Burra to get a local paper. Compare its starting date with The Kapunda Herald (1864). The Kadina & Wallaroo Times (1865) and The Northern Argus (Clare. 1869).

• Burra had to make do with printed handbills for advertising and a town crier.

• The cost originally of 3d made it too expensive for many and kept its circulation low; 600 by the end of 1876.

• In October 1878 Holder became the sole proprietor.

• Under Holder the paper flourished. He became Mayor of Burra in 1886 and again in 1888, having been elected to Parliament in 1887. He was later Premier of SA on two occasions.

• In September 1880 Holder announced they would move next door because the original office (in Commercial Street) was about to be demolished to make room for two new shops to be built for Messrs Drew & Co.

• Three years later on 6 January 1883 four shops on Market Square were destroyed by fire: Lane's Saddlery, Geake's store, Packard's Solicitor's Office. Doe's Hairdressing Salon and the Burra Record Office.

• Despite the complete destruction The Burra Record appeared later that week, having been printed in Adelaide.

The shops were rapidly rebuilt.

• Late in 1883 the paper was issued twice a week and the price fell to 2d.

• In 1890 Holder sold the paper to Mr P. Murrie Jnr.

• In January 1891 the paper reverted to being a weekly.

• In September 1891 W.J. Davey took over as editor. [And later became the proprietor.]

• Davey reduced the size of the paper and in 1904 increased the pages to 8.

• Davey sold out to Ernest Frederick Marston in March 1913.

• In 1945 E.F. Marston sold the paper to his son Frank Teare Marston.

• In 1942 the paper was reduced to four pages, but increased again to 8 from 1945.

• E.L. & R.F. Angel acquired the paper in June 1954.  The Marstons had printed the paper for 41 years.

• Eric Angel must be the person with the longest association with the paper. He came to Burra from Eudunda in 1929 and was employed by Mr Marston Sen., and then by his son before taking it over in 1954 with his son, Bob until 1977.

[• The Burra Record ceased publication on 8 March 1977 as an independent entity.  From that date Burra news has appeared in The Northern Argus and in a series of other publications as listed below.]

• 1977 - 1987 Burra news appeared in the The Review Times Record.

• 1978 - 1993 Burra Community School and Community News.

• 1991   2006 Terry Wilson editor and proprietor of the Burra Broadcaster.

• 2006 The Taylor Group of Newspapers purchased the Burra Broadcaster and incorporated The Eudunda Observer

and The Peterborough Times into The Mid North Broadcaster.

• June 2013 the Mid North Broadcaster ceased operation.

• July August 2013 former Mid North Broadcaster journalist Michelle Osborn established an online Burra Broadcaster news service.

[• Michelle Osborn’s incarnation of the Burra Broadcaster first appeared in a hard copy format with the December issue 2013 (unnumbered) and ended with Issue 66.]

[Note.  Ian Auhl did the research for the history of The Burra Record.  Subsequent to that the information comes from The Burra History Group.

The sites occupied by the Burra Record and its predecessors are very difficult, if not impossible to pin down.  The business appears to have begun on allotment 72 in 1876.  (In 2017 this was opposite the Mobil Roadhouse).  In 1878 there was a move to the site adjacent to the Visitor Information Centre of 2017 on part allotment 79 – where the chemist shop was located in 2017.  Its next move is hard to fathom.  In 1880 it was said to move next door in June and in September into one of the new shops built immediately north.  A fire destroyed this group of four shops in 1883, but they were quickly rebuilt and the paper seems to have moved back into its site.  In 1897 the premises of the paper were bought by Walkers, who incorporated it into their large shop and the paper moved two doors north.  We have not precisely dated the next and final move, which saw the paper occupy the two shops immediately east of Pascoe’s (the two storey building on Commercial Street), but Council assessment records place E.F. Marston on part allotment 70 in 1922.]
