A Bolt. On Saturday as Dr Sangster was driving through Aberdeen his horse was frightened by the steam engine at Sara & Dunstan's and it bolted for home, passing through Aberdeen and Kooringa to his residence where the trap was overturned and the doctor and his groom thrown out. The doctor escaped with a shaking, but the groom, James Wooton, broke his leg. The horse then started off again and frightened a passing team, which also bolted briefly. Presently the horse was restrained and returned, but the buggy was greatly damaged.
