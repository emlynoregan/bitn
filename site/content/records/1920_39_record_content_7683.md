Burra Town Council, Monday

Military authorities have asked the council to look after military graves once the War Graves Commission has erected headstones etc.  The curator said there were three such graves in Burra cemetery: those of Messrs Winders, Collins and Jones.  [A.T. Winders, W.F. Jones & B.E. Collins.]

Winders’ and Collins’ graves had headstones and authorities were going to put one on Mr Jones’.

Council agreed to maintain the graves.

Council agreed to charge the Kooringa Football Club £2-2-0 for the season.

Council will hold a special meeting concerning the electric lighting scheme on 20 May.

Cr Kellaway moved that the bridge near Wicklein’s [in Queen St] be repaired.  [Outcome not stated.]

It was resolved that the gun in Market Square be so placed to prevent traffic between it and the monument.

Cr Collins asked whether the George St crossing had cost £191, which he thought abnormal.

The Town Clerk will respond next meeting.

It was resolved that the mason work only on the Fire Station be done by day labour.  Tenders will be called for the carpentry only.

There were complaints that streetlamps had not properly been attended to.

Mt Bryan District land prices are undergoing a boom, but it is not increasing the population: rather land is going back into larger holdings.
