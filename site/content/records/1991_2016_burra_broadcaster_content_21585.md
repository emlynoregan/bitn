Mt Bryan Primary School.  A meeting was held recently to consider the future for the school.  The preferred option was for the school to remain open as a sub-school of the Burra Community School, offering the years from reception to 5.  Year 6 & 7 students to be given the option of Mt Bryan or Burra.  A steering committee has been formed and Principal Angela Arbon said they would work closely with Burra Community School to reach a positive outcome.
