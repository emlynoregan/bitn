The Mount Barker Courier has an article saying that its Chairman of Directors Mr Frank Marston published his first newspaper fifty years ago on 12 August 1925 when with one employee, Mr Eric Angel, now of the Burra Record, he published the Eudunda Courier & Murray Flats Advertiser.  Later he came to Burra and in 1952 went to Mt Barker, where he still takes an active interest in the business.
