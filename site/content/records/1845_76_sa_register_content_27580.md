The SA Mining Association.  Burra Mine

The 31st Annual Report has been submitted to shareholders.  During the six months to 31 March the ore production reached 950 tons of 27% copper.  This excellent result is due to the improvements in ore dressing.  This is now so efficient that poor orey stuff can be properly treated and brought up to a high standard.  It will be reassuring that the works for proving the mine at depth are now nearly half completed.  They afford most promising expectations.  While they have cost upwards of £7,000, the estimated cost has not been exceeded, and the funds available for their completion are adequate.  The works have already led to valuable discoveries.  The balance sheet for the half-year to 30 September 1975 shows that income nearly matched expenditure.  There is a balance of unappropriated profit of £12,823.  In the last six months there has been haulage of 43,200 tons and 35,520 tons of ore have passed through the machinery.  Captain Sanders reports that the prospects of the deep workings exceed his expectations.  Settlement is rapidly extending in the area around the mines and many additions and improvements have been made to buildings in the townships of Kooringa and Graham and many transactions in the leasing and selling of land therein have been entered into in the last half-year.
