Weather.  Dust Storm.  On Friday one of the worst dust storms ever seen covered the Eastern Country when a howling gale raised thick dust.  The conditions extended to Broken Hill and beyond.  In that district buildings lost roofs.  A cool change brought relief in the evening.

On Sunday night rain fell and the pastoral country recorded 20-45 points.  Burra registered 27 points.
