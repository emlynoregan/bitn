Football.  W.T. Truscott, Chairman of the Burra Football Assoc. writes to thank the Record for its fair reporting of the current dispute and says the only solution is for the Aberdeen Club to ask the Kooringa Club to withdraw the players in contention as delegates to the Association can only act in accordance with their clubâ€™s instructions.
