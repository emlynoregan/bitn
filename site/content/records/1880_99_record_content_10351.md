Editorial on Water Supply for Burra.

This has long been talked of.   In some parts of town wells are close to nearly all the backyards and in the square as ample supply is provided for the labour of pumping from a shallow depth, but in the commercial part of town and on the hillsides where the newer houses are, water is not so readily available.  Even in the square the supply does not answer the needs of fire fighting, as we saw in the calamity of the first week of 1883.  Even where wells abound on the flat so do cesspits.  We have always opposed a scheme that would impose a general rate.  Now there is a letter from the Hydraulic Engineer to Council suggesting a scheme for which the annual cost would be £400.  In order to make this sum the Council would have to sell 2,000 gallons a day for 6 months and 6,000 gallons a day for the other six at 6/- per 1,000 gallons.  After that every gallon sold is profit.  That such a small amount could be sold seems certain.  The present works in Aberdeen yielded last year £75-8-0.  Taking into account extensions already made and the further ones to Opie’s Hotel to the south and to Bartholomæus’ store to the east, the north would yield £150 per annum.  Surely a main in Kooringa from St Mary’s to Jeffrey Pearse’s corner, running through the chief business centre would yield £150 p.a.  This must secure the Council against loss at the outset.  We have not taken into account any possible sales to the railways or to the contemplated public baths.
