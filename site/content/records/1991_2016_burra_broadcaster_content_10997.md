Burra Community Pool

The Council has budgeted for a projected loss for 1996-97 of $39,000.

This is made up of Loan repayment (principal)	20,500

Purchase of pool shades	3,000

Operating deficit	15,500

The operating committee will be expected to reduce the operating deficit either by reducing costs or increasing income or both.

The committee is desperate for community support, both in operating the pool and in fundraising.
