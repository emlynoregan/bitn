Burra Burra Races

Stewards: Messrs George Bevan, Joseph Genders and Edgar Chapman.  Judge: Dr T.H. Mayne.  Starter: Mark Watts.  The races were held on 31 December 1857 and 1 & 2 January 1858.  The weather was rather too hot to be agreeable.  The dust added to the inconvenience and with the heat was responsible for a rather low attendance.

The results of the races are printed.  There were three races each day plus a hurry-scurry to finish with.
