Phoenix Copper Exploration is causing some unease with their proposed exploration within the Burra Mine Reserve.  The proposed exploration will include the Burra Mines Historic site and the Burra Smelter site1, which are the centre of the township.  Concerns are centred around the removal or lifting of the Heritage status2, which was put in place to protect the site from mining.  Another concern, which has been highlighted by local stakeholders is the hydrology of the region, with fears that the pit of the Monster Mine would be de-watered.3  Last week the managing director of Phoenix Copper, Paul Dowd, met with representative of various committees in Burra, including the Regional Council of Goyder, National Trust and heritage Advisor Douglas Alexander, in a discussion of the proposed exploration and the company’s aspirations.  News of the exploration has been slowly trickling through to the community, with many residents unsure of exactly what is proposed.  National Trust representative Paul Marsson circulated an open letter last week outlining concerns with the proposal, which echo the concerns of many Burra residents.  Specifically the concerns are that the exploration is proposed for the Mine Reserve, which holds Heritage status and which lies in the centre of the town.  Mr Dowd has responded to the open letter to the Mid North Broadcaster (see page 2) stating the company’s intentions and refuting Mr Marsson’s assertions.  He says the company intends to work closely with stakeholders and leave little or no footprint.  He believes the prospect of mining would enhance Burra’s tourism with the modern offering comparison with the untouched heritage mining sites adjacent.  The Regional Council of Goyder has requested an open forum to be attended by Mr Dowd and the interested public and a meeting has been arranged in the Burra Town Hall 5 July at 7.30 p.m.
