North Ward main works were:

Aberdeen reserve has been fenced

Various areas of kerbing and watertabling

Roads formed near the Courthouse and in Hampton

Some trees planted

Middle Ward main works:

Paxton Tce and road to Recreation Ground were formed and metalled and with the road through the Smelting Works this makes a good road to Redruth.

Many trees planted

South Ward main works:

East St was made

George St was made passable

Bridge Tce was remade, but not metalled

Open drain in Chapel St covered in

Upper Thames St kerbed on one side, road remade and metalled, footway made and gravelled

Ayers St considerable work done including the bridge opposite the cemetery gate

Chapel St re-metalled

Trees planted

New ward boundaries were proclaimed in the start of October.  Middle Ward had an excess of income and South Ward an excess of roads and creek crossings.  The new East and West Wards are near enough equal in income and have about equal road lengths.

The main extraordinary work has been the erection of the Waterworks.

Tree planting has been undertaken with public donations.  It began with tree planting in open places in Welsh Place and Paradise and then went on to street plantings.  £217 has been expended.  Hundreds of trees have been planted.

Middle Ward rates paid for the avenue from Kooringa Hotel to the Recreation Ground.

The Conservator of Forests has planted the Railway Reserve.
