He also reported that the Porter’s room had been gutted by fire.  The investigation of the cause revealed the only likely thing was the explosion of an incubator lamp.  The machine had been working for 10 days and was all right when inspected at 6.45 p.m.  The building was insured for £200 and the contents for £70.  Damage had been assessed by the Insurance Society’s inspector at £110 for the building and £65-8-0 for contents.

Income from patients’ fees was well up and the Board was c. £600 better off than at the start of the year.
