The argument advanced was that without the bonds the rates would be absorbed by the debt and the Council would lose £950 of Government subsidy.  Mr Bartholomæus reckoned the loss to the town in interest etc. on this loan would be £3,000 and so he opposed it.  Well we got the bonds/debt and the Recreation Ground.
