Aberdeen Mill.  Last Monday an old boiler at Butterworth’s Mill exploded.  It was bought some years ago, second-hand, along with the 16 h.p. beam engine, from the Echunga Mine.  The boiler was 22’ long and 5’ in diameter.  At about noon on Monday it blew up: the tube of the boiler having collapsed from end to end.  The fireman and a lady who lives nearby narrowly escaped the explosion, having been right at the point of it seconds before.  This is the busy season and suspension of work while a new boiler is fitted will necessitate a big loss to the firm.
