The Rural Youth Rally at Burra for 1963 opened with a Friday night Ball and there were competitive events on Saturday.  On Saturday night the finals for the Upper North Zone in Public speaking and Debating were staged as well as a Mannequin Parade.  The Hawker Shield for the club with highest overall points went to Burra.  At the Ball Miss Rosemary Blight of Clare was judged Miss Upper North by Miss Glenys O’Brien of Channel 9 and Mr & Mrs L.P. Bence of Burra.  Door takings were £176-6-0.  [Competition results are on page 7.]

On Sunday there was a combined Church service conducted by Rev. Jenner at the gorge, followed by a barbecue, but the novelty sports had to be cancelled due to rain.
