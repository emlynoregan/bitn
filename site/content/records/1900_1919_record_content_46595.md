W.B. Page was farewelled in the Council Chamber on Monday last week.  The Mayor presided.  He had been very active in public affairs for many years.

Now he was moving on to become General Secretary of the Liberal Union in Adelaide.  He was presented with an inscribed watch and his wife with a very pretty clock.
