Burra Hospital’s Ladies’ Auxiliary has voted at its AGM on 7 May to change its name to the Burra Hospital Auxiliary and to broaden its base.  This follows the example of the corresponding Clare organisation, which some time ago became The Friends of Clare Hospital.  The Burra Hospital House Committee has decided to merge with the Burra Hospital Auxiliary and the first AGM of the new body will be on 31 May.  In the meantime Hazel Newcombe is the pro-tem President and Helen Stockman the pro-tem Secretary.
