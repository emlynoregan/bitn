Burra Show.  Burra Show was held in perfect weather on Saturday.  The shearing competition and improved pavilion exhibits made it the best show for some time.  It was opened by the Minister of Agriculture Mr C.R. Story.  There were nearly 500 hoses-in-action entries.  President Mr Rex Stockman introduced Mr Story.

The industrial sites provided a varied display of vehicles, household appliances and rural equipment.

Exhibits in the two pavilions were exceptional this year.  The Art Section was up by 70, Photography by 36, Cookery by 140, Flowers 85, Floral Art 62, Needlework 119 and Produce by 90.

The School Display was commendable.  The Rural Youth display was of the Wool Industry.

Entries were a record 2,986, beating the 1967 total of 2,778.

In the shearing contest winners were:

Novice: Tim Kakoschke

Open & Mid North Championship: J. Hutchins (Currently Australian Champion).

Sideshows were disappointing both in number and variety.
