Burra Show Society.

The Sports Syndicate has offered a 21-year lease for £3-3-0 per annum.  Mr Winnall thought they should have it on easier terms considering the amount of money they had spent on the luncheon booth.  The President also thought it high as they had spent £250 in the last two years and £200 before that.  The President suggested asking for a reduction to £1-1-0.  Mr Winnall thought it didn’t really matter much as the Syndicate spent the money on improvements.  The lease was accepted.

The President of the Burra Poultry & Kennel Club waited on them with requests about the prize list for the Burra Show.

The President said poultry was already well treated with about £23 in prizes and anyway it was too late to make alterations for this year.

Mr Winnall said the aim was to encourage the breeding of use rather than fancy breeds.  No action.

The Ring Committee recommended striking out section fours, ladies section fours and military horse.
