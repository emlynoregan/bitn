Editorial on the Government response to the request for aid for the Burra Mine.

The Government also believes the mine is worth developing.  The deputation was well received and it remains now to see if the directors will do their part.  They are bound to spend a certain sum of money.  The first thing they will do is to unwater the mine and inspect the whole property.  We believe large bodies of ore will be exposed, sufficient to encourage the directors to go on in earnest.  The restarting of the mine will be the townâ€™s salvation.  It is pitiful to see the number of houses, once spick and span, now going to ruin.  It is to be hoped that no time will be lost in erecting the pumping plant.  The concentrating plant will, we understand, not be started till the mine is unwatered.
