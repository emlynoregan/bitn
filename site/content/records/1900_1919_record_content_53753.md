Seaside Trip 1918.

Mr Hiscock [sic: Hitchcox], the new headmaster of the public school in place of Mr Mundy, was welcomed at the meeting.  The committee had a balance of 11/3.  It was resolved to go to Semaphore if possible and failing that to Henley Beach on Saturday 23 February.  The train will be asked to pick up at Hanson and Farrell’s Flat.  The train will depart Burra at 5 a.m. and Semaphore at 8 p.m.

The Ladies’ band will be invited to attend.

Mr Lawn hoped for better arrangements at the platform in the morning.
