Burra Show Society attempted to have an annual meeting on Monday, but only 12 or so members turned up and the Chairman, A.B. Riggs ruled the meeting out of order for failing to form a quorum, which would consist of 15 financial members.  Those who did attend seemed keen to hold a show in 1945 and it is hoped to hold a special general meeting later, when a quorum will be present.

Obituary.  Mr S.C. Genders of the National Bank in Burra, has been advised that his son, Pilot Officer David E. Genders, has been posted as missing, probably killed while air operations over enemy territory.  It is believed that his aircraft failed to come out of a bombing run and crashed into a tree.  Other planes flew low over the wreckage and failed to see any sign of life.  Pilot Officer Genders was aged 19 and was the eldest son of Mr & the late Mrs Genders and after a splendid scholastic career, had intended to become a Chartered Accountant.
