Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held before Dr Mayne at the Burra Burra Hotel on 10 September on the body of John Gilles Robinson, found dead on the sofa of a public house kept by Mr Henry Nankervis near Kooringa [i.e. the Crossroads Inn].

The jury went to see the body, which presented a most frightful spectacle.

Henry Nankervis said he knew the deceased. Last saw him alive on Saturday at about 12.30.  He appeared well, but complained of a fall he had had from a horse last Thursday.  About 1.15 I went into his room and found him dead.  He had complained for a day or two previously.  When I saw him as 12 .15 he appeared frightened and said: ‘Nankervis, I am dying.’  He did not seem to be in a fit.  His face was a little bruised on the right side from the fall.  He was sober when I left him.  He came to the house on Thursday and never left his room again.  I did not have a doctor as he did not seem sufficiently ill.  I did not send for a doctor when he said he was dying, as I have seen him many times worse than he was then.  He did not ask for a doctor and did not say how he was thrown.  He had three meals in mu house and appeared very hearty.  I heard him complain of being ill about a month ago.

James George Guthrie gave evidence of seeing deceased at the hotel and talking to him.  He had been with deceased when he suffered the fall from the horse.  It was Guthrie’s mare and she had reared, and the deceased pulled her over on him.  The mare seemed to fall on his chest, but he made no complaint when he got up.  He seemed the same as usual when we arrived at Nankervis’s house.  He was sober when I last saw him.  He had been drinking at the Burra for the last week.  [He describes their drinking habits.]

W.R, Carmichael, medical practitioner said he believed the deceased died of apoplexy.  Being predisposed to apoplexy, the fall hastened his death.  Apoplexy can be brought on by excessive drinking.

Constable William O’Shaughnessy gave evidence of being called to Nankervis’s to see the body.  The face appeared to be downwards, and when the body was turned over, the nose was flattened, and the cheeks were swollen and purple on both sides.

The verdict was death from apoplexy, the fall from the horse combined with the effects of intemperance, being the immediate cause.

[SA Deaths CD records this death as John Gillies Robertson bide 8 September 1855, age not registered.]
