The Mawson Iron Project & Razorback Magnetite Deposit northeast of Burra is attracting overseas interest.  If financial backing could be obtained, production could follow in four to five years.  Magnetite Mines General Manager, Dr Gavin England says they are trying to interest Chinese investors.  The mine would be located east of Peterborough and southeast of Yunta, with the ore transported to a floating port at Wallaroo, via a pipeline carrying it as slurry.  Mawson Iron Province is considered to be the largest undeveloped magnetite province in the world.  [Map]  Once developed the deposit would have a life of 20 to 25 years, producing at first 25 million tonnes p.a. and rising to 100 million tonnes p.a.  The concept plan envisages an administrative centre at Burra, probably with workers flying in and out daily by helicopter from Burra, rather than a conventional fly-in fly-out scheme.  The pipeline would pass just south of Burra and the state government would be asked to assist with infrastructure in Burra in terms of adequate power, roads, sewerage and water.  450 people would be required for the first stage.
