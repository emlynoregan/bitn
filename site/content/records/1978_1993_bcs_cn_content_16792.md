1st Burra Scout Troup has currently a crisis in that it has no Scout Leader.  At the parent meeting on Friday 3 June it was recommended to parents of scouts that they enrol the boys in Lone Scouts, which will enable them to proceed through scouting towards the Venturer Unit.  Shaun Dollman who has been assisting the scouts for the past few weeks has agreed to meet with the Lone Scouts on the last Friday of every month.
