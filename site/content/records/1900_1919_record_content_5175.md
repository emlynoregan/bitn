Telephone Service.  A party assembled at Drew & Crewes on Monday afternoon to witness the opening of the newly erected telephone service from their shop in Kooringa to the bulk store in Aberdeen and to take the opportunity to wish success to the firm of Drew & Crewes.  Refreshments were served.  The line will save much time and wear and tear on horses and traps.  Within 15 minutes of opening the service its use was demonstrated when an order to send chaff by the goods train was received.  It could never have been delivered in time, but for the telephone service, as the train was almost ready to depart.
