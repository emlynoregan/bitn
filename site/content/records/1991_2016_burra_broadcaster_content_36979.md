Vandalism & Anti-Social Behaviour Meeting

A public meeting was held to consider a response to the many complaints from people at the Burra Caravan Park about noise and harassment at night.  About 45 people attended.  The toilets in Pickett Reserve are a frequent target for vandalism.  Council Chairman, Laurie Sullivan said Council was considering a dry zone along the creek, though this could make it awkward for everyone else.  One of the problems the police face was that people were prepared to complain, but not to make a statement and stand up in court.  Providing somewhere else to go at night would be a more positive response.  It was also asked what state people were in when they left the hotels.  It was suggested that a shift was needed in community attitudes to alcohol and binge drinking, which was in epidemic proportions.  The presence of kids as young as 12 or 13 at the creek late at night brought up the question of parental responsibility and supervision.  It was finally resolved that the Council would co-ordinate a group with representatives from the YAC, the school, parents, police and tourism to work on immediate and longer term solutions.
