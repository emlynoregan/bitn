Burra Town Council

Cr Pearce hoped the paper would correct an error in the report of the last meeting.  It was Cr Woollacott and not he who wished ‘The Guns’ to be an election issue.

MPs advise that the Government cannot grant a loan until certain matters are finalised.

F.H. Reed was allowed to rent an unused road adjacent to his property for 5/- a year.

J. Turner offered to buy several pieces of unused road at Hampton, being parts of Victoria Road, East St and Quarry St.  This was approved.

It was decided to have a photo of the whole Council taken.
