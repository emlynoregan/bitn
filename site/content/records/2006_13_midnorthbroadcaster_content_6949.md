Attorney General Michael Atkinson is to seek harsher penalties for arsonists and vandals.  The present penalty system is a complex one based on cost of damage and does not allow the courts to consider other costs.  (For example damage to machinery may cost a firm in production, but this cannot be taken into account.)  Locally properties that are all too commonly targets for damage include the Burra Community School and Paxton Square.
