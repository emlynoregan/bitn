Burra High School.  49th Headmaster’s Report

[Three photos are printed of Staff, Prefects and House Leaders and Magazine Editors.]

Mr Mueller reported an enrolment of 125 (75 boys and 55 girls, a few more than in 1960.  This number is unlikely to grow in the future with now 72 in Grade VI and 76 in Grade V, but 64 in Grade IV and 62 in Grade II.

In 1961 there was a big turnover in staff with 9 changes, including part-time staff:

New were: Miss N. Lawes (S.M.), Mr R. Hillman, Mr B. McElroy, Mrs J. Bogisch (0.6), Miss E. McCabe (0.2), Mr K. Horsnell & Mr R.V. Mueller.  Mr J. Sladden & Mr K. Hicks were the only staff to carry on from 1960.

Religious Instruction has functioned smoothly throughout the year.

About 70 people attended the prefects’ induction in March.

The most urgent need for the school is improved playing grounds and the High School Council has been most supportive in plans to implement this.

The Department has offered £10 annually towards the use of the Town Oval.  In the year two fresh water tanks were installed and a new clothesline was erected.  154 steel chairs were obtained for the assembly hall.  A new Banda duplicating machine has been procured and linoleum was laid in the Needlework Room.  Anew lathe was obtained for the Woodwork Centre.  Most desks have been planed and varnished (and various other minor matters attended to.)

Six students gained Leaving Certificates and Trenna Eberhard & Merle Wickes won Commonwealth Scholarships.

11 students gained Intermediate Certificates.
