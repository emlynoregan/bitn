Archer Exploration Ltd reports excellent recoveries of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper and zinc at Ketchowla.  It also reports peak assays of 0.47% and 0.36% rare earth elements from rock chip and drill cuttings.   This indicated significant results for yttrium, neodymium, cerium, strontium and lithium.  Work is planned for 2011 to better define the extent of the manganese deposit and to define rare earth clay horizons.  The economic significance of the rare earth values detected is not yet known.
