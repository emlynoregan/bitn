Football.  The Burra Football Assoc. AGM.  Only the representatives from the Kooringa Club attended.  The Assoc. is in credit £19-15-4.  Elections: Secretary, J. Allen; Patron, E.W. Crewes; President, L.W. Gebhardt; Treasurer, A.D. McLaren.  [The Treasurer was corrected in the next issue to J. McLaren.]

Mr Truscott said the Kooringa and Light Horse teams should be combined and then with Aberdeen, Hallett, Farrell’s Flat and Terowie there would be a good association.  The Corporation charged ⅓ of the gate, but the Aberdeen oval cost £2-2-0 for the season, so all matches would be played there which was unfair.  Council will be asked for a season price.  Last year Victoria Park had cost them £14-18-2.  Mr Crewes promised to do what he could in Council to foster cheap clean healthy sport.
