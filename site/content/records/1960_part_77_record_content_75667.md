Two members died during the year: Lance Phillips and Hedley Pearce.  Financially the year was a success, due in considerable measure to the bar manager Neil Hurst.  The new watering system is now working well after a few initial hitches.  Membership numbers leave a little to be desired.  Facilities are being constantly improved.  Keith Phillips was the Club Champion and also won the Mid North Champion of Champions at Auburn.  The open tournaments in January and at Easter were a great success despite mediocre weather.
