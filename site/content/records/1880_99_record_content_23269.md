Football.  (by ‘Quiz’)  Last Saturday the match between two selected teams was very good.

The No. 2 team (Lott’s) 5.15 defeated the No.1 Team (Fitzgerald’s) 2.5

The Burra v. Clare match was played at Clare on 1 September on a very poor ground with the left wing a mud hole and with piles of dirt in the centre.  Play was fast and rough and ended in a draw.  Burra 0.9 and Clare 0.5
