Porter’s Lagoon

It has long been a resort for individuals and over the years a number of people have kept boats there, but only 18 months ago Harold Atkins decided to purchase a boat for himself and family.  Mr L.H. Piggott wished to go in with him, which set him thinking the place the place could be developed as a pleasure resort and a committee of seven gentlemen was formed.  Twelve months ago the first boat The Swan was launched by Mrs Atkins and sports were held.  From then on the Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club has been progressing.  Last Saturday the second aquatic sports meeting was a wonderful success.  Almost 300 cars were parked just back from the beach and scores more were left along the fences.  The crowd was estimated at between 1,000 and 2,000.  The Mid-North Brass Band (Saddleworth) attended.  All along the beach on fine seaweed were picnic parties.  A steady stream of young folk emerged from the bathing houses.  The area owned by the club has been fenced.  There was a cool drink stall, refreshment booth and ice cream stand.  Gate takings were £74-5-3.

A number of shore events were run from 10.30 and Mrs W.G. Hawkes launched the second boat, The Gull – sprinkling it with Eau de Cologne.  The club intends to plant trees and erect shelter sheds.  Aquatic events followed with swimming, rowing and diving contests.  With a clear moonlight night the beach was well patronised till about 9 p.m.  Gross taking were about £175.
