Burra Town Council, 7 April

Lewis & Medlow reply that it will be hard to sell a high-priced horse.

Permission was granted for the building of a bakehouse for W.M. Heath in Thames St.

‘The Gun’ in need of repair is to be attended to and both are to be painted.

The light near Jubilee Hall is to be moved to a position opposite Radford’s & Opperman’s in Penclacoyle St [sic: for Penglawdd St].
