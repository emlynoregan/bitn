Legislation for Railway Extension (Editorial)

Parliament has been prorogued and seems to have no great desire to reconvene.

The railway extension question was treated last session as a matter of urgency.  The select committee’s report was read, but no further action was taken.

The whole matter was dealt with in the report and all settlers are asking for is the implementation of its recommendations.  Politicians might be concerned about the costs of railway north of Pt Augusta, but the settlers want ordinary means of communication in the old established districts.  Railways should connect our main agricultural and mining districts with the metropolis and shipping ports of the colony.  Wherever the nature of the country permits the means of communication should be railways, as they are more economical than macadamised roads.  The lines recommended include:

Forresters to Saddleworth to Burra

Adelaide to Glenelg

And surveys for Clare District to Kadina

All the settlers want in this matter is the extension of roads – iron rails being used instead of broken stone.

As for a line beyond Pt Augusta – instead of borrowing heavily, it could be financed by land sales along the route, with some other encouragement from the Government.
