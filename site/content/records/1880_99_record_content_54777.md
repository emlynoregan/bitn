Burra Show 1894.

The last show held by the Burra & North-Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural & Pastoral Society was in 1885.  This year the society was resuscitated and a great deal of work went into restarting the society and holding a show.  J. McLaren was appointed Secretary and proved invaluable.  The weather was excellent and about 2,300 visited the show.  Gate takings were £70.  Excursion fares were available from north and south and attracted distinguished visitors.  The mayor, Mr P.L. Killicoat and Messrs T. Sandland and J. Lewis met Hons. F.W. Holder MP, G.H. Lake MO, W. Haslam MLC & W. Russell MLC, who were driven to the showground and entertained at lunch.  The school was closed all day and the shops from noon.  Sideshows were in evidence, but Cheap Jack was conspicuously absent.  A lady boxer was there who gave exhibitions of boxing.

Surprisingly agricultural produce was poorly represented.

(T. Bailey 1st, T. Fairchild 2nd in chaff & T. Bailey 1st with 4 bushels of wheat.)

10 entries in dairy produce – in butter Miss Turner 1st & Mr T. McWaters a close 2nd.

Poultry was well represented with 80 quality entries.  S. Dennison of Auburn did best with fowls.

Pigeons were well represented.

Horses were divided into draught, blood and roadster stock.

Cattle were a bit disappointing in quality.

Dogs.  Best sheep dog was H. Rabbich’s.  ‘Bob the Railway Dog’ was the greatest attraction.  [‘Bob’ travelled many thousands of miles on locomotives in SA and was widely known to travellers in the colony.]

Sheep attracted about 40 entries.  Mr G.A. Gebhardt had the champion Merino ewe and Blight Bros. of Hallett the champion ram.

There were few pigs entered.

Mr C.F. Newman nearly scooped the pool for vegetables and but for Ah Ching would have done so.

[Ah Ching is probably a.k.a. Ah Chin a.k.a. Chin Young.]

It was not a good time for flowers.

[Personal interest:

Only four results for flowers are printed and no Fuss features in them.

Ah Ching got prizes for 3 cabbages, 6 red beet, not less than 6 varieties of vegetable and not less than five varieties of salad vegetables.]

A full prize list is printed.

The evening entertainment was very successful, with standing room only. Program:

The Lost Chord	Miss A. Pearce

Ask Me Again & I Will Not Say No	Miss Fuller
