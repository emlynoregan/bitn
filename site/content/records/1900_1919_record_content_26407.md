Burra Town Council, Monday

The business was almost entirely routine in nature but:

‘Cr Hardy informed the Council that at its last meeting he made a statement which he afterwards found was not correct, and he asked the Mayor to convey his regret to the dayman, and at the same time ask the dayman to withdraw an offensive expression that he had used towards him.  The dayman withdrew the expression.’

[The previous Council report in the paper does not reveal what this refers to.]
