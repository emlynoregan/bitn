AGL Energy Ltd has announced that it is looking to develop a new proposal for a 33 turbine wind farm near Hallett that will include more economic wind turbine technology.  AGL earlier made a commercial decision not to proceed with the development previous approved in mid 2009.  There is currently an appeal before the ERD Court.  The ERD upheld the planning consent in November 2010.  AGL is seeking to cease legal proceedings and to develop a new proposal that would incorporate large and more efficient turbines.  The Hallett community remains an important region for AGL and since 2006 their community fund has injected $242,000 into local projects.  The company currently has five wind farms operating in SA with others under development.
