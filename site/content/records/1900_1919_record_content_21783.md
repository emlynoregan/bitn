Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The 13th half-yearly report reveals nothing striking.  The wages paid for the half-year were £34-17-8.  The directors’ fees are £3-17-8 less.  While no ore has been sold, the income from royalties, house rents, grazing and interest has been £93-17-3.  The directors report the Kooringa Syndicate, which had started boring and prospecting at the site in May 1907, ceased to do so early in 1908 and abandoned their option.  Litigation is pending to enforce the company’s rights under the agreement.
