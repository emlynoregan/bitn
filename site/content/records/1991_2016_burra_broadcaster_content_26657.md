Susan Parker [of Burra National Trust] writes to correct the impression in the Broadcaster of 21 November that the Burra Branch of the National Trust is seeking financial assistance to cover its losses.  The Branch is seeking a realistic contribution from Council towards the cost it incurs in conducting non-Branch related activities on behalf of Council and the wider business community.  This includes maintenance of several Council owned sites.  The current lease, which expires in 2002, requires the Branch to fully staff and operate the BVC for seven days a week and to maintain Council owned sites to agreed standards.  The Councilâ€™s current contribution to these activities is about $20,000.  If Council should not see its way clear to an increase in its contribution the Branch would have no alternative but to allow responsibility for those activities to revert to Council and to expend its own funds on its own sites and priorities.  Council would then discover the actual cost of conducting the said activities.
