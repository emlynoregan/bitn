East Burra Mine, some 15 miles from Burra, was visited on 27 June by Professor Sir Edgeworth David, Professor W. Howchin and H.K. Ward, Government Geologist.  The limestone belt from Burra to the mine was of considerable interest.  Towards the mine it has been infiltrated by silica in the form of black flint and white quartz.  Flint appears both in thin layers ad as nodules.  At Diprose’s Creek there is an interesting rock laid down under the action of ice at a very ancient period.  Some of the included erratics still show scratches from when under the ice sheet.
