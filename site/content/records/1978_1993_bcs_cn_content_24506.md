23 September 1992

Burra’s 115th Show on 10 October 1992.  [Actually, due to years when the show was not held since the inaugural one, the 1992 show was the 100th.]

Burra Hospital Quiz Night at Booborowie Hall recently raised $500.

The Last Passenger Train to Burra.  Steamranger’s steam locomotive ‘The Duke of Edinburgh’ drew 12 carriages to Burra last Saturday.

Burra Anglican Parishioners and visitors from Maitland Parish joined in a Blessing of the Fleece Service at East Bungaree on Sunday.  John Fahey of Hallett demonstrated blade shearing.

The Catholic Women’s League Street Stall last Friday raised more than $800.

The Lions Club Beerfest on Friday was poorly attended – disappointingly for those who did so much work in preparation.

Bob Heath will be installed as Worshipful Master of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge on 2 October and a Masonic Ball will follow.

Accident.  A vehicle rolled over near the front of the Burra Hospital early on Saturday morning.  Two vehicles were involved and both were seriously damaged.  One driver received chest and head injuries.

Squash.  Richard Holbrook’s squash team won the final.
