Proposed Copper Smelting Company (From the South Australian 28 July)

A meeting was held on Saturday at the Auction Mart Hotel.  About twelve gentlemen attended with Captain Bagot MLC in the chair.

Dr Davy laid on the table calculations as to the cost of establishing a works on sufficient scale to give the operation a fair trial and also an estimate of the cost of charcoal and coal and the quantities needed for a ton of ore to be smelted.  These were partly based on small scale experiments and partly on the experience of other smelting operations.  He was sure they were accurate enough to justify the establishment of a works on a large scale.  [These calculations are printed.]

Those most acquainted with the mines concluded that if the calculations were borne out by the results, the value of the mining property would be enhanced by at least 50%.  Dr Davy proposed the works be established at Port Adelaide, it being the most convenient place for the reception of ores and the fuel required.  An unlimited quantity of charcoal could be got from Kangaroo Island and York’s [sic] Peninsula.  After discussion there was general support for Dr Davy’s plan and agreement that the establishment of a smelter was highly desirable.  A committee was formed of Captain Bagot, J. Baker, John Hart, M. Smith, Henry Collier, John Ellis, James Bunce, Charles Beck and Dr Davy and they are requested to make arrangements for a trial of the proposal.  A subscription list was instituted.

[The Editor expressed the view that the prospects of success were even more favourable that the Doctor and his associates had ventured to suggest.]
