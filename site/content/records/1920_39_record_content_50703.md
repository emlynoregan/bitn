Mr [Henry] Shipway of Kooringa aged 94 is recovering after a stay in hospital.  He is very mentally bright despite his age.

Bert Broad, employed by K.B. Watts butcher of Aberdeen, had a number of stitches in a nasty gash in his right leg when a knife slipped while he was cutting down a carcase on Thursday afternoon.
