Burra Bowling Club held its AGM on 15 July in most inclement weather. The President Mr Dudley Jacka took the chair.  Members stood as a mark of respect for the late A.L. Kellock who died 2 July 1964.  Elected were: President, Jack Topsfield; Vice-Presidents, Les Phillips and Murray Stockman; Secretary, D. Field; Assistant Secretary, B. Riggs and Patron, G. Dollman.

President’s Report

The past year has been most active and successful.

Membership is c. 61 full members, as it has been for the past three years.

During the year we farewelled Peter Pritchard and Keith Horsnell and two night members in Errol Hood and Ron McCann.  The club was shaken by the sudden death of George Terry, an excellent bowler, coach and greens manager.  He would have been made the 1st Life Member at the next general meeting of the club.  The club team won the Premiership in the North Eastern Association and players in the Mid North Association also did well.  This year the club room has been painted and had new lining and a new glass front.  Thanks go to Stan

Woollacott and Bert Wardle for making this possible.  The telephone has also been installed.  The support of the Associates has continued to be a great help.  Alan Benger’s work as gardener has been much appreciated.
