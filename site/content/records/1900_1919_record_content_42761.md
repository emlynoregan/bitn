Recruiting.  A meeting was held on Monday evening to form a recruiting committee for Burra.  Dr Steele thought it should be pushed vigorously.  He was trying to go himself and on two or three occasions had almost lined up a locum and only on Saturday had a letter from one who had now decided to go himself.  The mayor mentioned a strapping young fellow, out of work, whose parents would not let him go.  A demonstration has been arranged for the 1st anniversary of the war on 4 August.
