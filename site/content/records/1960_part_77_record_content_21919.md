Daisy Kennedy and Mr A.L. Kennedy

This brother and sister returned to Burra for a visit, having left the town in 1895.  Daisy was born at the Commercial Hotel in 1893.

‘She was to become the world’s greatest violinist of her day.’

She went abroad for her training and stayed overseas, although she made a number of triumphant tours of Australia after 1914.  The family lived in a house in Kangaroo Street (now occupied by Mr & Mrs M.W. Eberhard and family).  She also had a look at the school where her father was headmaster from 1892 to 1895.  Her brother Mr A.L. Kennedy, who accompanied her, was one of Mawson’s companions on his Antarctic journeys.  Later he surveyed the vast area of the Kimberley in WA and became one of Australia’s leading geologists and mineralogists.  The pair spent an hour visiting their old home in Kangaroo Street, where they met Mrs Eberhard’s mother, Mrs Quinn, who had been at school with A.L. Kennedy.  Daisy Kennedy was first married to the great pianist Benna Mosceiwitsh and then to John Drinkwater, the English poet, writer and playwright.  She now lives in London and her brother in WA.

[Of the six Kennedy children, only Daisy Fowler Kennedy was born in Burra (Kooringa) 16 January 1893.  Alexander Lorimer Kennedy had been born 23 April 1889 at Woodside.]
