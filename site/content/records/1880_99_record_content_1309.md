Larrikinism.  A letter complains of larrikinism in Kooringa.  The writer blames music, the skittle-alley and billiard tables run by publicans, which are all ‘traps for the unwary’.  Parents should be keeping the young folk at home with a good book.  The editor agrees - if not entirely with the good books, at least with the idea of good home amusements.
