BBN Netball Club has conferred Life Membership on Sharyn Roberts.  Her involvement with the club and the Burra Club prior to that goes back at least to 1980.  In that time she has been a coach and umpire for many years and served on the committee, holding many executive positions throughout that period.  [A detailed history is printed.]

[Other life members are pictured with her: Hazel Stockman, Jenny (nee Hirschausen), Di Day, Mich. Phin and Robyn Baker.]
