Kooringa News, 1 May

Special services were held last Sunday for the Sunday school of the United Presbyterian Church.  Rev. W. Davidson preached and 40 students were examined.  Rev. T. Lloyd conducted the evening service.  Tea and public meetings were conducted the following day.

The election is creating considerable interest and there have been public meetings, together with electioneering placards, canvassing and other manoeuvrings.  At an open air meeting on Saturday afternoon Mr Dale was the principal speaker and on Monday evening there was a meeting of Mr Kingstonâ€™s supporters, composed chiefly of Germans.
