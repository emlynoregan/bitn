The Burra Mine.  The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association has just been laid before shareholders.  The accounts are as usual made up only to 31 March.  There was an apparent slight loss on the year up to that date.  Outgoings of £13,922-14-8 were placed against income of £13,570-18-4.  These costs include those of experimenting with the new machinery and of erecting it.  Doubtless due to the new processes and the price of copper the Directors were able recently to declare a dividend.  The report is judiciously silent on future returns.  As operations clear away surface debris it may be expected that more lucrative stuff will be reached.  In the year to 31 March 1,058 tons of ore was raised and in the six months to 30 September 1,269 tons was raised.  This averaged 17½% copper.  In a few days it is expected water will be forked to the 50 fathom level and this will enable several pitches in Peacock’s at the 40 fathom to be let.  A new 15 head set of stamps is expected to assist greatly.  A dressing machine of SA construction has been praised, while one sent from England has not performed well.  The new local machine follows the pattern of Captain Hancock’s dressing machine at Moonta.  The creek sand had proved difficult to treat, but these difficulties had now been overcome.
