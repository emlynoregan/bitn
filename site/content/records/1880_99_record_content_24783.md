‘Loafer’ writes in reply to ‘Lynx’. 

‘We the hardy sons of toil (ahem!!) are not going to be put down by ‘Lynx’ or any of your furious snobocracy, for that he is a ‘snobocrat’ who can doubt?  Look at the style of writing and quoting Latin too and Italian; what do we want with Latin? Good plain English (if I could only write it) is quite good enough for me.’

‘was it my fault that Ulooloo was a failure?  Why, we had to work (!!!) where we were told, when I could have spotted dozens of more likely places . . .’

[This has all the signs of being W.H. Hardy.]
