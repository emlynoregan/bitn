Editorial on the phoenix-like return of the Burra Record after the fire, which destroyed it recently.  Thanks are extended to all those who helped in containing the fire and especially to the men and women who ‘manned’ the pump in the middle of the night.  [Unfortunately which night is not stated. 8 April MS]  [The description of the effort suggests that women pumped water to fill tubs and then men carried buckets to the fire, where a chain of eight got the water up to the top of the wall to pour it onto the fire.]  Water from tanks behind the building was also used.  The front room was saved, but the machinery suffered through the heat and all the stationery was destroyed by smoke and the front windows were smashed.  The wall the men had stood on was so weakened that it had to be rebuilt and it was very lucky that it survived to support the men without collapsing into the flames with them.  The Record suffered heavy losses, but has risen now with the finest plant of any provincial paper in SA.  At the moment we cannot yet work in our new and commodious offices.  We start again today with an increase in circulation, which is already the largest of any provincial press in SA.  The Record circulates in the mid-north, north and northeast of SA and across the border into Queensland.  The fire destroyed all the back premises and with it all the type and the photographic studio.  This is now being rebuilt two storeys high* to become one of the largest and best lit studios anywhere.  The neighbouring shop of S.M. Lane also suffered.  Thanks are also extended to the providers of tea, coffee and eatables during the firefighting effort.
