‘Steel Beak’ writes regarding the guns.  He recalls 16 strong young men he was working with out east when war broke out.  Of them 3 enlisted at Peterborough, 3 at Willaston, 8 at Burra and 2 at Booborowie.  5 did not return, 3 he has not seen since, 2 returned in a sad state.  8 of these lads’ names appear on the monument and the writer knew more than half of those whose names are there.  For these reasons he respects it very much, though he does not need to go and look at the names nor at the guns either to remind himself of them.
