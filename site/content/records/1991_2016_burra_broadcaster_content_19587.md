The South Australian Underwater Training School has been granted access to the Burra Mine Pool as a fresh water training facility for scuba divers.  Martin Phillips from the school described the Mine Pool as offering the perfect venue.  The school is required to give students a wide range of diving conditions and needs a safe 30 m-plus fresh water diving location.  They have been searching for one for some time.  A sink hole in the South East has been used, but authorities have deemed it too small.  The courses run for about eight days four times a year.  This is a very passive use for the pool that fits well within heritage guidelines.  This is the only commercial underwater training school operating in SA and one of only six in Australia.
