Birth.  To Claire & Paolo Vitozzi at Mater Hospital in Brisbane, 14 February, twin sons, Giovanni (Gio) & Leandro (Leo).  Claire was visiting the hospital for some treatment when the twins were unexpectedly born prematurely, weighing less than 1 kg.  They spent three months in hospital in Brisbane and a further two months in Flinders Medical Centre before coming home to join their father Paolo and sister Alma (2).
