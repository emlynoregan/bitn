Kooringa Methodist Church Japanese Fair on 7 August was a great success.  Lady Holder opened the fair at 11 a.m. but gave her speech at 3 p.m. when the attendance was larger.  She had just returned home from a trip to America.  She had come to Burra with her parents when nine months old and people lived in huts along the creek.  She remembered the opening of the Methodist Church and became a school teacher at 13 with a class of 60.  At 16 she was converted in the vestry at the back of the old church.  She remembered a very large bazaar held in Rev. Lloyd’s time.  She met her husband when she was 20.  She hoped the war would be brief with few lives sacrificed.

The takings were £167-0-11.
