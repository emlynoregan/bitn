The Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline will be duplicated, with work starting this year.  The proposals for the year ending 31 December are for new pumps for numbers 1, 2, 3 & 4 pumping stations between Morgan and Robertstown and for booster stations at Spalding, Georgetown, Baroota and Lincoln Gap.  The 1961 works include a major pumping station and a 33-inch concrete-lined steel main to Bald Hill, two miles northwest of Burra and a summit storage of 2 million gallons.  The pumping station at Hanson is planned to lift 12,000 gallons per minute to the Burra tanks and three of a probable four pumping units are listed for early installation.

The Burra to Jamestown section will start in 1962 and will continue through 1963.  Jamestown to Wirrabara commences in 1964 and Wirrabara to Baroota in 1965.  Later the rising main from Morgan to Hanson will be duplicated as will also the main from Baroota to Whyalla.  The total cost will be Â£12,237,000 and the work will not be completed till 1985.

The Bald Hill storage tanks will be located where the Hundreds of Ayers, Hanson and Kooringa join west of Burra.  From the Burra Tanks the main will pass through the Hundred of Ayers to Booborowie, passing just north of the town and assuring it of reticulated water.  It will then trend northwest through Ayers and almost due north through the Hundred of Reynolds, then northwest to appoint almost due south of Jamestown, where ultimately there will be four 2 million gallon tanks.  Then it will go northwest in an almost direct line to Caltowie and on to Wirrabara, through Germein Gorge to meet the existing main.  Burra should receive Murray water in 1962.

These details from P.H. Quirke MP.
