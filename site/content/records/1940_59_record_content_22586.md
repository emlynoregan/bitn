Obituary.  William Frederick Gebhardt (‘Casey’) died at Burra Hospital on 25 July.  He was born in Burra 11 August 1863 and remained in this town all his life.  He was educated at Burra Primary School and on leaving there, he learnt the bakery business under his father, the late Mr F. Gebhardt, one of the town’s old pioneers.  Later he was in partnership with his father and on the latter’s death, carried on for some years alone, before handing the business over to two of his brothers, Messrs Alf and William Gebhardt.  Altogether this business was carried on by the Gebhardt family for 65 years.

In his younger days he was a keen sportsman with respect to hunting and coursing.  Some 25 years ago the small daughter of the late Mr D. Pizzo fell down a well where Mr Alf Gebhardt now resides.  A rescue party was organised and the late Mr Gebhardt volunteered to be lowered down by means of a clothes line.  He remained below while the girl was hauled up and was then recovered with some difficulty.  For this feat he was later presented with a sovereign case, filled with sovereigns at a ceremony at the Burra Institute.  He was twice married.  He first married a daughter of the Late Mr George Jordan of Saddleworth and they had two children: Mr Fred Gebhardt of Adelaide and Evelyn, Mrs Pudney of Adelaide.  Later he married the daughter of the late James Wilton of Adelaide and there were seven children from that marriage: Myrtle, Mrs Timms of Adelaide; Tilly, Mrs Taymidices of Sydney; Carrie, Mrs William Nankivell of Burra; Gladys, Mrs O. Pearce of Adelaide, Ivy, Mrs Tilbrook of Clare, and Allan and Ken Gebhardt of Burra.  There are seven grandchildren.  Two sons, Fred and Allan went to WWI and Ken has just returned from the present war.

[Despite above information the apparent relevant registered birth was for William Frederic Gebhardt 15 August 1864 at Kooringa.]
