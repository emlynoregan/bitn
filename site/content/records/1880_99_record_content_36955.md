On Things in General by Our Erratic Correspondent

[There is not much of significance here, but this seems to be the beginning of a series written by W.H. Hardy under this nom-de-plume.  The Round-About Notes by ‘Globe-Trotter’ also read like Hardy and perhaps the articles by ‘Ajax’ as well.  There is no doubt about Our Erratic Correspondent however.]

Burra Model Parliament.  At a meeting last Monday at the Institute only a dozen braved the wet to discuss the matter.  P. Murrie was voted into the chair with W.H. Linkson as secretary pro tem, with the whole to form a committee to carry out the idea.  The next meeting is scheduled for 17 June.

Burra Creek is presently flowing strongly.

Larrikinism is a problem in the town.

Football.  Another scratch match was held on Wednesday.

Shooting has been good of late with one hare brought in over 3’ long.

Sports from out-of-town covered in reports were racing, hunting, sculling and cricket.
