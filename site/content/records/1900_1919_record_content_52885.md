Ratepayers’ Annual Meeting, Monday.

Only about 25 persons attended.  Rev. A.J. Finch took the chair.

Cr Harris said a fair amount of kerbing had been done in East Ward and a garden established at the Black Bridge.

Cr Dane reported on a series of relatively minor or mundane achievements for West Ward.

Cr Radford did the same for North Ward, though he did report the installation of private letterboxes (finally) at the Aberdeen Post Office.  They were trying to get a pillar or two for Aberdeen, as people were charged extra for mailing letters at the station.

There was concern at the lower rate income in North Ward with its large number of roads to service.  Lighting was a major problem.  It was impossible to carry on with the present rate and yet not justifiable to increase it.  More trees were required.  Gums were dying and the pines had not been very successful.

Mr Greenwood had little to say in support of his candidacy for East Ward.

The mayor thanked all for his re-election unopposed.  He believed that but for the war they would have had a worthy lighting scheme by now.

E.J. Harris had little to add.

Mr Kellaway questioned the paying of the curator 8 weeks full time while he was sick in May 1916, but Mr Crewes and other Councillors backed the proceeding, which they said had not been concealed, but overlooked.  All Councillors were in favour of a bridge at the Pig & Whistle when possible.
