H. Morgan writes citing the same quotation from the Mayor.  This not only treats the writer with contempt, but the paper as a whole.  The rubbish in question was not just ash, but general household rubbish.  It is quite unfit to be placed near homes.  Would such be tipped near the home of a Councillor or the Mayor?  ‘To do such a thing would be to ‘lower the dignity’ of the municipal heads and the offender would be severely censured.
