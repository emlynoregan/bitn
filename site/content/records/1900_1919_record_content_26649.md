The Federal Election

Labour will have a substantial majority in both Houses of Parliament.  Of the 18 vacancies in the Senate, Labor won them all.  Although returns are not finalised, it seems that Mr Andrew Fisher will lead 42 members in the House of Representatives.  The turn-out in SA was a record – though figures cannot be finalised because the Northern Territory does not vote until tomorrow.

Mr Horne will lose his £25 deposit, having failed to score 20% of the number of votes of the winning candidate.
