Break-in.  There was an attempted break-in at Boulger’s Supermarket on Friday 16 May.  And last Thursday thieves broke through the front shop door window and stole $500 worth of cigarettes.

Thieves also broke into Burra Cold Stores and stole a quantity of flavoured milk and ice creams.  A side door was also damaged at the Burra Golf Club.
