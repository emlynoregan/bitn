A very successful tea meeting was held on the Monday at which Rev. C. Colwell read the financial report showing a debt on the whole property (church, school and manse) of £1,225.  The nett returns from the bazaar had been £325 and the anniversary services had raised £100, making up the noble sum of £523 [sic!].  This reduced the debt to £700.
