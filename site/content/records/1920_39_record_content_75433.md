Council Finances

At the start of the financial year 1938-39 the debit was so high a special rate had to be struck.  The clerk has announced an improvement in finances by £430 and the Council will end the year in debt by only £109 despite this year buying a motor lorry for £380, giving the Institute £60, paying £100 for the silent cop and rockery in Market Square, paying off the swimming pool loan of £90 and increased wages of £90.
