Notice.  A full page notice carrying the logo of the Regional Council of Goyder and carrying the Council’s name boldly across the bottom lists the seven proposed resolutions from the Ratepayers Action Group for the forthcoming ‘Meeting of Electors’

Issue 1 related to rates.  It was concerned about the high level of rates generally and the disparity across the different towns, and called for a general review of rates, especially for Hallett in the light of the wind farm development.  Generally wanted more transparency and objected to the proposal to seek heavier fines for late payment of rates.

Issue 2 related to Paxton Square and contained a complex list of clauses aimed generally at keeping the cottages in public ownership, securing their preservation and development as a community asset in the tourist industry.

Issue 3 concerned Burra Caravan Park.  The general desire here was to preserve and maintain the existing park with its ideal location and that any proposal to develop another park should be in addition.  Overflow could be accommodated at the Burra Showgrounds.   It also lists desirable upgrading at the caravan site.

Issue 4 was the Burra Swimming Pool.  The resolution asks that Council acknowledge it is a valuable community asset that must be maintained and improved.

Issue 5 related to Council transparency and accountability.  This sought to see the Mayor and Deputy Mayor abandon this title on the grounds that it incorrectly implies that the office is elected by ratepayers generally.  There is a general call for better communication, more active engagement with ratepayers, better and more timely availability of papers, minutes etc.  The call in general applies as much to Council staff as to Councillors.  [Much more detail of course in the lengthy motion.]

Issue 6 about Goyder Sports & Community Centre.  The general thrust was against this going ahead, but if it were to proceed then only after very clear and valid approval from Eudunda Ward ratepayers and with careful provisos to ensure that any subsequent liabilities fall on the Eudunda Ward – even if subsequently ward structures aru changed or abolished.

Issue 7 concerned Representation Review.  The request here was that the 2005 Representation Review and background documents be made publicly available and the SA Electoral Commission audit the Council Roll to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.

[The resolutions are very detailed and take up most of the page in fine print.]

[The apparent attribution of this notice to the Regional Council of Goyder was a gross error on the part of the paper.  They attempted to undo the damage by a letter drop to homes almost immediately and, of course, by an apology in the next issue.  The responsibility for the notice should have been attributed to the Regional Council of Goyder Ratepayers Action Group.]
