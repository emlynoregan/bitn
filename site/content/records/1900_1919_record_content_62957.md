Annual Meeting of Ratepayers (Continued)

Medical Officer’s Report

The Corporation is to be congratulated with passing through a year characterised by a severe influenza epidemic with such a low mortality.  It was most severe in May when a number of cases of pneumonic type were reported.  Many towns were finding isolation hospitals required and it looked like Burra would need one.  The Scout Hall was converted for use.  Luckily the increase in cases did not occur and the epidemic abated.  The hospital was closed after a fortnight had elapsed since the last case was discharged.  Later the epidemic returned, but this time, although almost every household was affected the form was milder and there were few pneumonic cases.  The Burra Hospital was adequate by using the private wards and one general ward as the influenza hospital and the spread to general wards was controlled with great care.  There have been a few cases of diphtheria and measles, but not in epidemic form.
