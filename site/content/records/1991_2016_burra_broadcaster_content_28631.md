Doug Wiltshire writes quite a long letter to draw attention to the habit of Goyder Council of undertaking private contracts â€“ citing earthworks for the Bower Piggery as an example.  He points out that this practice is contrary to the Trades Practices Act Section 4G, dealing with the Lessening of Competition or preventing or hindering competition.  There is a similar problem with Section 45, which prohibits the Council from making contracts that would substantially lessen competition and similar restrictions are imposed unde sections 46 & 47.
