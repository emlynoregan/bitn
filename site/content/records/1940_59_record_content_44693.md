The Mayor made the presentation of a traymobile with a coffee set.  Mr Woollacott responded.  He said Burra was the third oldest corporation in the state.  [Check this: it seems unlikely!]

He was honoured to have served as a member for 22 years and as Mayor for 14.  He thanked all who had contributed and his wife for her support.
