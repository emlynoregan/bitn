Kooringa Court, 3 August.

Thomas Rosewall was fined 10/- for being drunk, 20/- for indecent language, and 40/- for assaulting M-C Queale, plus costs of 45/- and a medical fee of 15/-.

It was two years since his last charge and he couldn’t remember any of the incidents.  He pleaded guilty and promised if he was given the chance he would not drink again.  M-C Queale said the defendant had been drunk for a week and had 14 previous convictions. [All for alcohol related offences similar to the above.]  The total payable was £6-10-0 or two months jail.  The fines were paid.
