Letter from W.H. Hardy querying the need for a larger pump at the Waterworks.  If the pump ordered can lift 2,700 gallons per hour and the same engine with a second pump can lift 5,000 gallons per hour, then the engine with the extra pump can lift 120,000 gallons if worked 3 days a week for 8 hours or 6 days a week for 4 hours.  Thus even if consumption is doubled to 100,000 gallons per week compared with last yearâ€™s consumption, it will be adequate.
