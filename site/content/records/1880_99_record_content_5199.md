Redruth Court.

In the course of a ‘drunk in public place’ case Dr Sangster complained of convalescent patients from the hospital going down to hotels and then returning to disturb other patients - this even happened on Sundays when the hotels were supposed to be closed.

Thomas Richards and W.L.H. Bruse were each fined 5/- for stray cattle.

Garrett Barrow was fined 5/- for riding on a footpath.
