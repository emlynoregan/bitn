Vice Regal Visit to Burra

[This is reported in detail in about 11 columns.]

The day was wintry, with showers throughout the morning.  The Governor’s car arrived at the Institute at 10.30 a.m. and was met by a Guard of Honour comprising many men of the first AIF and soldiers on leave from the second AIF as well as members of the Home Guard under M.T. Fuller.  Members of the local VSD and Transport Service lined the steps under Commandant Mrs A. Tennant.  In the foyer there was a squad of Girl Guides with District Commandant Mrs R.C. Lott.  The Vice-Regal party was met by The Town Clerk and the Mayor and Mayoress.  In the Council Chamber the Governor was introduced to Town Councillors, the DC Chairman Mr I.J. Warnes and District Councillors.  A Civic Reception was then held in the main hall, where the Address of Welcome was read by the Town Clerk and endorsed in a speech from the Mayor.

[These and the Governors reply are printed.]

The visitors then went to inspect the Burra Primary and High Schools.  There the pupils from St Joseph’s, Copperhouse, Leighton, Gum Creek and Hanson Schools also attended.  An extensive outdoor program by students had to be curtailed on account of the wet and cold conditions.  The visitors were welcomed by Mr H.J. B. Jennison as Chairman of the School Committee and Dr Steele as Chairman of the High School Council.  [Their speeches are printed, along with the Governor’s response.]  The Governor granted the schools a full day holiday on 10 October.

Their Excellencies were shown over the Primary School by Mr Jennison and Headmaster Mr Davies and then the High School by Dr Steele and the headmaster Mr Draysey.  The Governor met the staff of both schools and the members of the High School Council.

The Governor planted a tree near the tennis courts before going on to visit the Burra Hospital.  Here Sir Malcolm and Lady Muriel were met by Matron Robinson and introduced to the staff.  The visit was less formal here and they were shown over the building by Dr Steele and Mr I.J. Warnes.

After that the visitors were driven to Princess Royal Station where they were entertained at luncheon by Mrs John Tennant.  This was followed by a visit to the shearing shed, where the shearing plant was in full operation and the visitors, who had not previously witnessed such a sight, were intrigued to follow the process through to the classing and baling of the wool.

In the afternoon the Governor was taken to visit the miner’s dugouts, Mr R.D. Pascoe’s collection of sheep photographs, Mr Dick Pascoe’s collection of ore specimens, the old mine site and the smelts chimney.

At 8.15 p.m. His Excellency was welcomed in the Council Chamber by the Burra branch of the RSL.

His Excellency also attended the Kooringa Masonic Lodge as Grand Master of the Freemasons Lodge of South Australia – the first time the Kooringa Lodge has been visited by a Grand Master.

In the afternoon Lady Muriel met members of the Red Cross and Fighting Forces Comfort Fund groups in the Burra Institute, along with members of the VSD and Transport Members.  The hall was decorated with an exquisite floral display and displays of the various groups’ work were inspected by Lady Muriel.  [Details of this are printed.]

The Mayor entertained the Governor and Lady Muriel at dinner at the Burra Hotel at 6.45 p.m.

[The toasts are printed.]

The Civic Ball in aid of Red Cross funds was a great success.  The Vice-Regal party arrived at 8.30 and went to the dais, after which the National Anthem was sung and then patrons filed past their Excellencies and shook hands.  After a brief period of chatting the Vice-Regal party then departed and dancing proceeded. [The dresses of those attending are then described.]

A buffet supper was provided and the proceeds of the evening exceeded £30.
