Margaret Doecke of Eudunda writes expressing her fears concerning the implications of the business plan for the Goyder Sports and Community Centre.  She draws attention to the amendment of the motion by which the Council granted permission for the project to continue.  This amendment stipulated that the majority of Eudunda Ward electors at a council constituted public meeting had to approve, that there be Council approval of a loan or loans of up to $2,500,000 and that there be a reimbursement to council by way of a levy on the future Eudunda Ward rates of any financial shortfall in the construction and operation of the proposed centre.
