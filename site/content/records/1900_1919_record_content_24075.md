A Bolt.  One afternoon last week Miss J. Fairchild was driving a buggy from the railway station when the horse bolted near Fuss Bros. And the buggy ran into the kerbing at Sara’s Store.  Miss Fairchild was deposited under the verandah and Mrs R. Fairchild was thrown from the trap.  The escape of both ladies from serious harm is almost miraculous.  The trap was smashed, the harness partly broken and the horse scratched.
