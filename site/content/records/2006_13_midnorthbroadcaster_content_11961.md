Goyder Council is facing a $10 million repair bill following the storms of December and February.  This is beyond the resources of Council and formal application has been made for State Government assistance.  The floods removed the surface from a huge network of roads and damaged many drainage structures including floodways, pipes, culverts and headwalls in roads.  Council employees have been able to make frequently used road passable for now, but with winter rains further work will be needed to keep them open.
