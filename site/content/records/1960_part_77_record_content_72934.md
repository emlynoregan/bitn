Miss Gertrude Williams will be 90 on 30 September.  She was born in Burra, the second daughter of Mr & Mrs C.C. Williams.  Her mother, then Miss Watson, came to SA in 1876, employed on the voyage as a nurse.  Thirteen babies were born en route.  She became the Matron of the Burra Hospital during an epidemic of typhoid fever, which saw many patients there in very primitive conditions.  Some patients were accommodated in the old bar of the Burra Hotel and others on the floor.  Nurse Watson was dismayed to find many patients using tin pannikins to drink from and with her first pay bought them china cups.
