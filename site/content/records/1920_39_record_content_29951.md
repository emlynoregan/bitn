Railway Accident.  On Tuesday afternoon W. Wise fireman on a water train jumped off to try to halt a horse which had bolted while shunting at the Burra station.  He seems to have got tangled in the chains and was drawn under the trucks.  One leg was almost severed and the other was pulped.  He was taken to the Burra hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

[There appears to be no follow-up on this story and I can find no record of a W. Wise dying in 1929 either.]
