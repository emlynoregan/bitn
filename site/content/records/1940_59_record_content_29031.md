Obituary.  Mr Fred Turner Pascoe died recently at Burra Hospital after a long illness.  He was born at Yongala on 20 October 1881 and spent his first thirty-two years in that area.  He then moved to Farrell Flat and from there to Burra, where he was employed for 28 years by Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd.  In his lifetime he took a keen interest in football and basketball.  He is survived by a widow and two married daughters; Mrs Stan Truscott and Mrs C. Barratt, both of Waikerie.  [Frederick Turner Pascoe died 16 September 1946 at Burra.  The birth appears on the SA Births CD as Fred Fenner Pascoe 20 October 1881 at Yongala, with his mother as Mary Jane Fenner.  It seems likely that transcriptions from hand written documents have caused his motherâ€™s surname to appear in the CD variously as Turner, Furner, Farmer and Fenner.]
