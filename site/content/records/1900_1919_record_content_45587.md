Redruth Court.

T.P. Halls jnr was charged by his wife, Jessie Margaret Halls, with cruelty and wilful neglect to provide maintenance.  She applied for custody of the four children and reasonable separate maintenance.  Mr Bright appeared for the plaintiff and sought to add cruelty in August, September, October and November 1916 [sic] [presumably 1915].  This was disallowed.

Jessie M. Halls:

Married 8 February 1908 and had five children, four of whom are living.  The eldest is 7 and the youngest 19 months.  Lived unhappily with defendant till his admission to hospital 13 December 1915.  Married at 16, when he was 22.  The unhappiness was the result of his bad temper and drinking.  He was in hospital 7 weeks with enteric fever and I visited daily till meningitis broke out and I was quarantined.  He has been a cab proprietor for 12 months and had two cabs and four horses with receipts of £8-£11 a week.  While he was in hospital T. Halls Senior drove the cabs and kept the fares.  Hilton Grow drove the small cab and paid me £24, which he said he had received in fares.  When I showed the defendant the memorandum of receipts he threw it down and demanded the money and then beat me and told me to pack up and get out.

[Details are then given of the disagreement with Grow that had already been before the court and of financial matters.  Much more detail is given of the alleged impropriety with Hilton Grow, aged 17.]

The defendant admitted swearing false oaths in charging his wife and Grow with embezzlement and the SM said that tainted any evidence of his that was uncorroborated.

T.P. Halls Senior:

Swore to seeing his daughter-in-law commit acts of gross impropriety with Grow and of seeing them in the same room three or four times.  [He also said he still owned the cabs etc.]

The SM concluded that much of the defendant’s jealousy and bad behaviour resulted from his recent illness and neurasthenia.  The bench believed he had assaulted his wife as described and then had her locked up on a false charge.  Cruelty and failure to provide maintenance was proved.  A separation should be granted and custody of the children, also defendant to pay 30/- a week to the State Children’s Council in Adelaide.  Professional costs of £4-4-0 were awarded against the defendant.
