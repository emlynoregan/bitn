Burra Tourist Promotion Committee had a successful meeting on Thursday and decided to conduct another Copper Festival in conjunction with the Burra Show in October.  Elected: Ray Jennison, chairman and Wally Scott, retiring Chairman, is now Secretary.  Although the Show catalogues have for years suggested the first show was held in 1874, Ian Auhl has now presented research to show the Society was not formed until June 21 1877.
