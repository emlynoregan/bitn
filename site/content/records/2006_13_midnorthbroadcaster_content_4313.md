Letter.  Paul Wilson comments on the recent Paxton Square meeting:

He had the impression that Council had made a decision and did not put forward some realistic options.

A true assessment of the potential of business cannot be made on the figures supplied by Council.

Maswood Pty Ltd are the only people who would know the true operation of the cottages at this time.

Several ideas have since come forward:

Include the caravan park book [sic: for booking office?] in the centre.

Move the Tourist Information Centre to the building.

Lease out the area in blocks.

Baker [sic: presumably for Barker] Homes might take over a row.
