Obituary.  George Freeman, a former Burra resident, died at Ballarat recently.  The gentleman was born at Burra in 1858, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs George Freeman.  He was educated in Burra and we understand his father drove the mail between Burra and Kapunda before the railway reached Burra.  Two brothers, W.B. & W.S. Freeman survive.  [This George Freeman is not readily traced in SA Births, Deaths and Marriages.  The brother, W.S. Freeman appears to have been Walter Stanley, born 28 August 1873 at Redruth.  W.B. is also untraceable.]
