Burra Mine

With copper at £195 a ton, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr O’Halloran, is calling for the Government to thoroughly investigate all copper deposits in SA and the possibility of building smelters using Leigh Creek coal at Copley.  History showed copper deposits along a north-south corridor of 700 miles.  Mr McAlees (ALP) supported Mr O’Halloran and said as much copper was in the ground as had been taken out at Kadina and the prive should inspire resumption of mining at Wallaroo, Moonta and Burra.  Mr R.C. Lott writes to the Record saying it is time for locals to make strong representations to Government for the thorough prospecting of copper lodes at Burra.  Never before have prices been so favourable.  Now is the time for the Town Council to act.
