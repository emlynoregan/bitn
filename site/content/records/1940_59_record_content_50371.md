Burra Burra DC, 7 May

The E & WS Department writes to allow five unmetered hydrants to remain with the Council, but to be used only for fire fighting.

Work on the main road 46 has been completed, but it is not yet open for traffic.

‘Slow Down’ notices have been erected at either end of Hanson, but those for Farrell Flat have not yet arrived.
