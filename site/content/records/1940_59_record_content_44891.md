Burra Show Report for 1949

The show on the 2nd Saturday in October was very satisfactory.  The grounds were in fair order, though horehound and wild onion have infested the area.  Entries were well above standard, especially in flowers, bowls and bouquets.  Pigeon entries were well up.  Support from schools was good and industrial exhibits were far above average.  Show day was overcast, but all exhibits were judged and prospects looked good when the deluge began.  Horse in action continued, but the public were confined to their cars and pavilions.  Most sideshows did not even open.  Gate takings were down, but the ball was popular.  The show was opened by Mr McEwin, the Chief Secretary.

Report by Glen M. Finch, President.
