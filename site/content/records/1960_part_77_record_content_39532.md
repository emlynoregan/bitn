Common Effluent drain for Burra

The Department of Public Health is drawing up final plans for Burraâ€™s effluent drainage.  It will include Commercial Street, Market Square, Hill Street, Ware Street, Kangaroo Street, Queen Street, Chapel Street, Lloyd Street and Thames Street.  The proposed site for the biological filter is in Thames Street on land adjoining the Council Pound.  Because of the terrain in some streets only those on the high side will be connected.  Houses on the low side will have backyards to sink soakage wells, whereas many on the high side have no land on which to drain septic tank overflow.  The Corporation has requested the Department to install the drain in the water table rather than in the footpath, but that will be up to the Department.
