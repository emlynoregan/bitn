Letter from the Burra Burra Mines, 11 November

Today had been appointed the General Survey Day, for the purpose of setting various tut-work bargains and tribute pitches.  Against the smith’s shop door were several notice papers.  They announced 7 tut-work bargains and 21 tribute pitches.  It has been the custom to offer70 to 80 of these places and by this reduction fully 300 men are thrown out of employment in the underground department.  With very few exceptions all the miners then gathered on the side of the hill and in perfect composure and quietness entered into a discussion.  This resulted in a resolution for a deputation of the miners to wait upon the visiting Directors to obtain from them the information (as the notice had said nothing about the rate of wages).  The reply was: ‘If the men have a mind to work, they must work for 30s a week.’

The men said that at that rate it was not possible for the men to maintain their families in honesty and uprightness.  The Directors said they would give no more and the deputation returned with this news to the men.  The 400 assembled said with one voice, ‘We cannot, and therefore we will not work for that rate of wages.’

They then went home and no survey was held.

It would be a great pity if newcomers were inveigled by the company into accepting work here.

How can the men maintain their families at the offered rate of 30/- per week, when the old hands themselves, after a lengthy struggle have not been able to manage it?  30/- at Burra is barely equal to 20/- in Adelaide.

They must be madmen that can expect or try to exact it.

A notice was then posted:

‘Notice is hereby given, that all those who are not in the employ of the Association, are required to give up possession of the cottages!’

‘Can they imagine for a moment, that after depriving us of the possible power to feed our hungry families, we shall quietly submit also to be kicked out of doors?’

‘This is indeed the apex of arbitrary oppression – the ne plus ultra of despairing, malicious folly.’

Who can read this without regretting the absence of a spirit of conciliation, which is the essence of Christianity and has hitherto distinguished every man deserving the name of a freeborn Englishman?
