Burra Town Council, 2 February.

The Mayor and Cr Ridgway reported on their visit to Adelaide and were hopeful of getting the £150 for the road.

It was decided to write to the Central Fire Board re the operation of the Fire Brigade Act.

C. Jobson, the Waterworks Engineer, sent a list of materials he suggested the Council keep in stock in connection with the Waterworks.  This was referred to the Waterworks Committee.  Cr Sampson protested about Waterworks business being mixed with ordinary business.  Things were so mixed he got confused.  The Mayor thought everybody else understood it.

Cr West suggested that when reels were got the trees should be watered from them rather than from a cart.

Cr Symons said many trees were dying.

Cr Ridgway thought it was time meters were read.  Carried.

The stationman ‘Herchousen’ [sic: - probably Hirschausen] had injured himself working for the Council.  Cr Tiver moved that he be paid for the eight days he was ill, less the amount due to him from the Lodge.  Cr Ridgway 2nd.

Cr Sampson asked whether this was not getting money under false pretences.  He protested.

Cr Ridgway said if the injury was received not due to carelessness employers were liable under the Employers’ Liability Act and the principle was just and equitable.  He was astonished at Cr Sampson.
