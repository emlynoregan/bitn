Burra Town Council, 9 January

A.L. Clode’s tender for the ceiling of the Town Hall stage was accepted.

The quote from Matthew’s Emporium of £178-16-2 was accepted for the supply and fitting of the Town Hall stage curtains.

The Finance Committee recommended the Council ascertain whether the District Council has vacated their old depot and if so that the Town Council offer their own depot to the Burra Bowling Club for £100 and transfer costs, when the sale of the District Council depot has been completed.
