Burra High School visited Adelaide on Monday.  The party comprised 64 students and teachers.  The boys left the train at Dry Creek, where a bus took them to the Metropolitan Abattoirs to inspect the processes involved in preparing animals and meats for export.  Most of the boys showed a keen interest, especially in the slaughtering and freezing departments.  Some, however, were a little shaky.

The girls went on to Adelaide and visited the GPO where they inspected the telegram and telegraph department and then the mail sorting section.  The two parties met again at West Beach Airport where ANA officials were most co-operative.  The air hostess showed the girls over a DC4 that was ready for take-off.  The boys were shown over by one of the officers.  Lunch was then taken at Glenelg before a drive through the hills to Mt Bold via Clarendon.  On the way back a stop was made at Windy Point for a view over the city.  The trip home saw the cafeteria car in great demand.
