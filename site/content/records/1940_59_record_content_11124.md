‘Common Sense’ responds to Arthur Coverdale.

The original letter was far from an inside job.  The writer does not live in Burra and knows few who do, except for those with whom he/she does his/her shopping.  The writer’s name was supplied to the Record and if Mr Coverdale cares to donate half a guinea to the Burra Red Cross the Record may reveal it to him.
