The Redruth and Kooringa Combined Methodist Sunday Schools Picnic was held at Red Banks on 26 April in perfect holiday weather.  In the morning hot saveloys and rolls followed by cakes were popular.  There was a brief Anzac Observance and Misses Joan Fairchild and Joy Pettet and helpers convened a brief sports session for the kindergarten scholars.  R.M. Reed and S. Pearce organised sports for the older scholars.  [A list of prize winners is printed.]
