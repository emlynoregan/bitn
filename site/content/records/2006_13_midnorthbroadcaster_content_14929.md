The Hornsdale Wind Farm has won SA Government support with owners Investec Bank Australia given final planning consent for the $900 million project.  It will be 16 km north of Jamestown and will generate enough energy to power 180,000 homes.  Northern Areas Council Chairman Ben Browne says it will be an enormous economic boost to the region and the benefits could be felt as far away as Burra, Clare, Peterborough and Crystal Brook.
