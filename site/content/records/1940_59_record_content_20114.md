Letter.  R.J. Fairchild writes to assure M.A. Radford that damming the creek to make a pool would not raise the threat of flooding to housing because, he says: ‘it is, I believe, a fact that in deep slowly flowing water that portion of water nearest the surface, only is in motion.  So that assuming flood danger to be ,say, 10 to 12 ft, a weir six or eight feet in height would not increase danger at flood times.’
