Weather.  The district has been going through a severe dry spell with no rain for 46 days and just 5 points in 71 days.  There has been no significant rain since 15 points on 18 November.  The driest spell for November to January was in 1905-06.  Many people are now carting water for drinking and dams and creeks are very low.  Gordon’s Lagoon east of Burra has been wet for the past two years, but is expected to be dry this week.

Adelaide Wool Sales.  At the 6th series, 22-24 January, prices were up and the best in this district was 106d for Koo-Owie Proprietors.  [Other local district prices are printed.]

Fire.  A fire in a paddock of Mr L. Batersby [sic] near Canowie Belt c. 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday 22 January destroyed a truck, 40 bags of wheat and 3 acres of stubble.  It is thought the truck’s backfiring started the fire.  [Presumably Battersby.]

River Murray Flood Levels continue to fall.  At Renmark the fall was 2 ft 2 inches for the week.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 12th stage of the Darton Cottage Trophy over 200 and 300 yards.  Best were W. Watts, R. Francis & W. Hempel.  Bill Watts scored the only possible over 200 yards.  In the marksman’s contest Bill Watts led Jim Brown and Jim Schwier.

Whyte Yarcowie relieving stationmaster Duncan Cameron has been replaced after six weeks by relieving stationmaster Des. Laredo.  A permanent replacement is expected in about three weeks.

House Sale.  Two adjoining houses in Chapel Street on the account of the assigned estate of W. Carpenter were sold on Friday.  They were passed in at £600, but sold later to Mr V.J. Dower.

[They were in Thames St when advertised for sale.]
