BCS School Council held its AGM on Monday night.

Chairman Chris Reed outlined developments in the Agricultural Program.

Students have the opportunity to begin the program in Year 7 with a basic Science-Agricultural view of plants and animals.  Years 8-10 cover agricultural enterprises and domains.  Years 11 & 12 present a more intensive approach.  Year 12 in 1994 for example will include genetics and animal breeding, crop husbandry and technology and a new unit on aquaculture.  The school has leased the ‘Kookaburra’ property from Dick Cleland, enabling students to be involved with agriculture on a broader scale.  80 acres have been sown; 48 in Janz wheat and 32 in lupins.  Barley will be introduced next year into the rotation for use in supplementary feeding of steers in future years.  Some of the area that is unsuitable for grazing will see a tree planting program of 500 trees.  A grant is being sought to establish a yabby-marron farm.

The school canteen made a strong profit.

The Board of Management is offering an award of up to $1,000 for the Burra Burra J150 Research Award to foster research into the history of Burra and District.

The School Community News Committee reported that the last issue would be that of 22 December 1993, ending sixteen years of service reporting life and events in Burra.  It filled an important role when the Burra Record ceased publication.

The Community Swimming Pool is progressing on schedule.  Concreting of the pool itself should be completed this week.  So far $60,000 of the $380,000 has been spent.  It is hoped the pool will be completed in late January or early February.  The pool will not be available for swimming classes this season.
