Burra Show Society.  The Sheep Dog Trials at the Showgrounds in Aberdeen, 18-20 September were a great success.  Winners:

The Novice was won by Mr Thomas Eustice’s Pat.

The Puppy Stakes went to Mt Thomas White’s Wampey.

Open Class was won by Lt K.L. Duffield’s Bantry Jack.

[In the report the owner is said to be R. Laidlaw, but in the summary to be Lt K.L. Duffield.  It seems that Mr Laidlaw was working all of Lt Duffield’s dogs.]

The SA Champion was won by Mr Collins’s Frisk, worked by Mr White.
