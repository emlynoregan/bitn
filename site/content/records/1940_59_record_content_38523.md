Kooringa Tennis Club held its second AGM 24 August.  Despite the club’s youth and inexperience the A team managed to get through to the finals.  Unfortunately the day set for the finals was wet and they had to be played off after working hours during the week.  The Aberdeen team won by a good margin.

Attempts to get a club house erected stalled after the estimate of about £20 proved wide of the mark.  Work was stopped after £30 had been spent and the shed is presently in a very crude state.

Elected: Patron, Mr J. Kellock; President, Rev. S. Dorman; Secretary & Treasurer, Miss A. Bruce; Captain, C. Morrison and Vice-Captain, K. Bruce.
