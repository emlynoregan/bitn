Social Club.  Frederick Richmond writes re the club which meets at Mrs Roe’s School on Thursday evenings.  [This appears to have been associated with the General Temperance Society.]  It encourages singing and hobbies like butterfly collecting, stamp collecting, woodcarving, emu egg carving, cards, dominoes, draughts, and perhaps one day a billiard table.  The president is Dr Sangster.
