Burra STEDS Update.  The Burra STEDS scheme was constructed in 1977 and a new evaporation lagoon system was installed in 2003.  Council has now agreed to call tenders to investigate and make recommendations on the extension of the scheme.  The estimated $40,000 cost of the study will be allocated from Burra STEDS reserve funds.
