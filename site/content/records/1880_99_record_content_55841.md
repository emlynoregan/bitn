Burra District Council, 12 January.

Mr Nevin’s application for gravel at Copperhouse Schoolyard was granted.

The old brand of diamond 01 has been allotted to Copperhouse Pound.

‘Spectator’ writes that the Burra Sports were rather monotonous, with long waits between events.  A much greater variety of entertainment should be possible, rather than just races.  Perhaps tug-of-war, high jump, long jump, pole-jumping, putting the weight, or even a greasy pole.  He also wonders whether large prizes that bring in outside competitors are really worthwhile.
