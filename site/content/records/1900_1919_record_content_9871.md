Redruth Reformatory.

Two girls escaped from the reformatory about ten days ago and were returned on Saturday evening by M-C Phelan.  They spent the first night eastward and then started for Thistlebeds and then on to Robertstown with a lift from an Assyrian.  They went across country to Tothill’s Creek and then southwards with M-C Phelan in pursuit.  They were away longer than any other escapees from the reformatory.  They were Agnes Dyke and Martha Learmouth.  The constable covered about 250 miles in his pursuit.
