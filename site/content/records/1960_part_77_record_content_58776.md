Burra & Tourism

Mr J. O’Sullivan of Australia National Travel Association inspected tourist attractions and Samin Ltd operations at Burra last week.  He met Council representatives and various groups forming the Burra & District Tourist Promotion Committee.  He said Burra was ideally situated to exploit its great historical heritage and well situated on a sealed route to Broken Hill and the Flinders Ranges.  It would greatly benefit from the sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road and the Burra-Spalding Road to form the east-west link across the country.  The potential for tourist development was virtually untouched.
