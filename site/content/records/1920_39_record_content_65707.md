J.H. Murison (Jock) is leaving Burra this week for Waikerie where he has obtained a position.  He will be greatly missed in musical circles.  He has long been a member of the Institute Orchestral Class and Conductor and Organiser of the Burra District Band.  Owing to many removals the latter has gone into recess.  Mrs Murison and the family will follow in a few weeks.
