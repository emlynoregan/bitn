Burra Cemetery.  On 16 July the main gates to the walled section of the cemetery were rehung.  The gates date back to 1854, when the cemetery was walled to keep out foraging stock and stray animals.  At some unknown time the gates went missing and one was found in 1993 at the Bon Accord Museum.  Skillshare at Clare was contacted and a matching gate was made.  Since a conservation study of the cemetery was carried out in 1992 much restoration work has been done.  Most of the remaining headstones from the cleared area, which were leaning against the western wall, have now been re-sited to the cleared area and many broken or damaged headstones have been repaired.  Chairman of the Cemetery Committee is Kevin Wallis of Mongolata Gold.
