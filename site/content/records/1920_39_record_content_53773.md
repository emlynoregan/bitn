Burra Town Council

No nominations had been received for the extraordinary vacancy in North Ward.  There was a great deal of discussion about what was then legally possible and whether an extension of time for nominations was allowed etc.  There was reluctance to draft in someone against their wishes with the possible cost of a fine if they refused to serve.  It was finally decided that discussion with H.J.B. Jennison had revealed he was not unwilling and finally he was declared the new Councillor for North Ward.

Sgt Kain of Redruth advised that the Government had approved additional food rations for Christmas and an extra cash grant of 10/- for a man and 10/- for his wife and 2/6 a child to a maximum of 22/6 for a family for those on rations.  This amount had to be worked for.  Among the names Sgt Kain submitted for Burra were about 20 from Mongolata which Council considered were outside its district.  The total granted for Burra was about £30.  It was resolved to place the list of unemployed with the Overseer and for Ward Councillors to find the work to be done.

The Mayoral allowance was fixed at £12 for 7 months to carry the Mayor on till when the new date for elections will come into force.
