Burra Rifle Club held its AGM at the residence of Mr Darrell Field last Saturday evening.  Captain E.C. Collins read his annual report â€“ the 36th for the club.  Attendances had been excellent for the year, though most riflemen had not yet got back to their pre-war standard of accuracy.  The two visits of the Metropolitan Club were highlights of the year.  Clare also visited and the triangular match on 8 Hours Day between Burra, Pt Pirie and Peterborough was another enjoyable outing, as was an informal visit to Riverton.  Next year the club will lose some good members because a new club is starting at Hallett.  The captain thanked all the committee members who had given him such good support.

Elected: Captain, D. Field; Vice-Captain, J.H. Schwier; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt; Treasurer, P.W. Hogan; Armourer, J.E. Harris and Handicapper, F.T. Marston.
