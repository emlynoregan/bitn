Rabbits.  Rabbiting is popular at present and it is providing lucrative employment.  In several places to the east there are little canvas towns.  Rabbits are being dug out by day and trapped at night.  One party combining the two methods got 396 in 24 hours.  A wagon-load of 1,000 rabbits was sent to Pt Adelaide from the Burra station at the end of last week and another left on Monday.
