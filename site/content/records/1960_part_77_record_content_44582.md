1968 was a busy year.  Several sporting fixtures were held.  In Term 1 the swimming carnival was held on 23 February when Hampton House won.  The School Sports Day was held on a 19 April which was variously dusty, wet, and windy.  Aberdeen won the Gebhardt Cup.  On 22 March we entered two teams in the State Schools Swimming Championship in Adelaide.  On 3 May we fielded two tennis teams in the District Sports Day at Hallett.  The Purple Team returned with the Open Aggregate Shield and the Green Team was runner-up in the Team Games.  Interschool basketball and football games were held in Term 2.
