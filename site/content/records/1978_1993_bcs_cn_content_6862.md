4 November 1982

Burra Community Sports Club Inc.

The Sports Complex at the Burra Oval was officially opened on Sunday 31 October by the Minister for Recreation and Sport, the Hon. Michael Wilson.  Many past Burra people returned.  [Photo of the Minister with Graham Kellock at the unveiling of a plaque.]

The gala day was a combined effort of the Football Club, the Youth Group, the Cricket Club, Apex and Lions.  Gross takings of $2,482 should result in a pleasing profit.  After the opening a football match between Burra and ‘Has Beens’ was played.

The building cost $162,000 and initial payments were met by a $40,000 Government grant, $25,000 from the Football Club and a Savings Bank of SA loan of $95,000.
