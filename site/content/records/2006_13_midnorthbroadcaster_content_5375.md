Bill Grainger, internationally renowned chef, stopped briefly in Burra en route to Sturtvale to shoot scenes for his cooking series on the Lifestyle Channel.  Bill’s six part series ‘Bill’s Food’ was launched in 2004 and it has screened on BBC2 and in 22 other countries.  On Friday he passed through in a flurry with barely time to taste Stammy Overell’s Lamb Shank Ragout, but the crew & Bill got back on Saturday night and this time managed a two course dinner, of which the main course was Moroccan Saltbush Lamb, much to the delight of Stammy.
