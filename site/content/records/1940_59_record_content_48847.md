The School Bus.  Some students do very well despite long bus journeys, as seen from the Willalo-Burra bus route, which began in 1946.

Rex Anderson travelled three miles to the bus and then 30 miles each way, daily, only getting board in Burra for the last two terms of his Intermediate Year.  In that year he was Dux of school and afterwards went to Roseworthy College.

Brian Brooks did the same sort of trip until the middle of term 1 in his Intermediate Year, when he got board at Hallett and then only travelled 20 miles each way, daily.  He too was Dux of the School in his Leaving Year.
