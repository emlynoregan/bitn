Federal Election in the Seat of Grey

Figures on Wednesday:

J.P. Henderson 	NCP	[None printed]

R.H. Moulds	AD	3,897

J.W.G. Oswald	Lib	25,621

L.H. Wallis	ALP	30,637

Informal		1,995

Total counted		67,328

After the distribution of preferences Mr Oswald was in the lead.

[The figures above suggest the J.P. Henderson would have 5,178 votes.]

[Typically the paper did not follow up this story in the next issue, but in the Flinders News Vol. 52, 4, 20 December 1977, which seems to have been enclosed with the Review Times Record, it is revealed that the election had a sensational finish:

After the final distribution of preferences L.G. Wallis of Pt Augusta (ALP) was re-elected.

Wallis	ALP	33,408

Oswald	Lib	33,383

Mr Oswald called for a recount.  Since there are later references in 1978 to Mr Wallis as the Member for Grey, this recount failed to change the result.]
