Obituary.  John Hall died in Adelaide 17 August.  He was well known in Burra and district.  He was born at Mt Gambier in 1857, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs James Hall pioneers of Mongolata.  In his youth he assisted his father in carting ore for the Burra Mine.  In the 1870s his father took land at Mongolata where the family resided for many years.  John Hall carted goods to the Barrier as a sideline until the railway went through.  He retired to Silverton and in 1937 came to Burra to live with his nephew J.H. Schwier until a few months ago.  His son was killed in the Great War and his only daughter is Mrs Blore of Coally Station NSW.  He was buried at Kooringa.  [The birth does not seem to be registered in SA.]
