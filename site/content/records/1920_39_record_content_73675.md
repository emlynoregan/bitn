Weather.  The Heatwave

Burra recorded 15 consecutive centuries last Saturday.  100°F was generally reached about 8.30 a.m. and the temperature stayed above 100° till about 10 p.m.  The maximum reached in Burra was 112°F, but it is reported that 122°F was reached at Mongolata and 118°F at Ketchowla.

Birds and wildlife suffered greatly.  Many birds were reported not flying away if approached, especially if water was offered.  A West Coast settler reported coming back to his hut to find it full of birds of all sorts, seeking shelter from the heat and even hawks roosting with their usual prey.
