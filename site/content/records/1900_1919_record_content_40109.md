Local Board of Health

J.E.H. Winnall wrote concerning the depositing of rubbish on the approach to the depot in Bewley’s property.

Cr McBride said Mr Bewley had given permission for manure only to be put down, but tins had been thrown out too.

Cr McBride thought Council should get a lease of the road and then they would know their position.

The inspector is to inspect the railway quarry [ballast quarry] privies: said to be in a poor state.

There have been complaints about the behaviour of men working on the [railway] line at the navvy’s camp where there were no latrines.  Railway department will be written to about this.

Cr McBride complained about the depositing of rubbish in the creek in Chapel St.
