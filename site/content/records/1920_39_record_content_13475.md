Birthday.  Mrs James Taylor of Paxton Tce celebrated her 92nd birthday yesterday and is fit and well.  Born in Glasgow, Scotland 10 June 1832, married 1855 and came to Australia in 1865 in ‘The Naval Reserve’.  They settled in Queensland where Mr Taylor was in charge of the navvies on the Ipswich railway line.  After a three year contract there they came to Pt Adelaide by boats and thence to Burra by bullock wagon, arriving just after the mine closed.  [Presumably the 1869 closure to prepare for open-cut mining.] She described the town then as ‘just awful’.  Many houses had lost windows and doors, sent to Moonta for use there.  Her husband has been dead many years.  She lives in her own house which is attached to a daughter’s house.  Of five children two survive.

Her eldest daughter died in England.  Mr James Taylor and Mrs H. (Nellie) Riggs died some years ago.  Mrs John Rosewall of Kooringa and Mr William Taylor of Wooltana Station survive as do 7 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
