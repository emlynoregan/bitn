Kooringa News, 14 July

Accident.  A man named Pascoe apparently fell off the wagon while driving one of the Copper Company’s teams.  The load passed over him from the knee upwards, crushing him so severely that he is not expected to live.  [No corresponding death appears in SA Deaths Registrations.]

Nothing has yet been done to repair the Redruth Bridge; though it was stated the repairs were let without being put up for tender in the usual way.

The ford is in the same state although the money for it was voted some time ago.

A new discovery of ore has been made on the property of a man named Hare near the Mule Camp.  Mr Hare has let it to the Copper Co. for 12 months at £1 per ton.
