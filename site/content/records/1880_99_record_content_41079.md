W.H. Hardy writes expressing his outrage at the undemocratic nature of the qualifications for a vote in the Legislative Council elections: residence in a house of clear £25 annual rental value.  No matter ‘how intelligent, honest, respected or capable he may be, unless he is, as it were, the master of the “almighty dollar”, he must be silent as to governing of the land in which he lives’.  Reform is often spoken of at elections, but once in office nothing is done.  The work of the lower house is all too often frustrated ‘by the fossils who are sent to the Legislative Council for that purpose by the capitalists’.  As a NSW paper recently put it: ‘Hitherto for a fine all-round collection of useless kronks there is no need to go beyond the Legislative Council of South Australia’. 

[This and much more along this line, calling for reform ‘in the direction of liberty and freedom’.]
