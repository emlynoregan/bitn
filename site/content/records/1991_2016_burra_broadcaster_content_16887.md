Joan de Metris was farewelled at an afternoon tea at the old Courthouse last Thursday, prior to her departure soon to live in the UK.  While here she has been very active in the National Trust.  For a number of years she managed the Bon Accord Cottage B & B and then became the Treasurer, taking an active role in computerising the finances of the branch.  [Photo.]
