The shops were well stocked and busy and bright with extra lamps, candles and Chinese lanterns.  Christmas tunes could be heard from Mr Wheatley’s able musicians and the can-can ‘Fire Away’ of the Salvation Army grated in the ears of all visitors to Market Square.  Crowds began to disperse about 10 p.m.
