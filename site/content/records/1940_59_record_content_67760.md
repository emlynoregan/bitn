Mt Bryan CWA held a Pioneer Day on 19 April when papers from old pioneers were read.  One paper came from Mr G.W. Williams of Ascot Park, whose mother Mrs J. Trelease, lived at Burra and Mt Bryan 92 years ago.  Another was written by the late John Honan over 20 years ago, about life at Mt Bryan when he was a boy of 12.  Unanswered questions of the afternoon were:

What came out of the two shafts at the back of Cartapo?

Where was the gold mine one mile north-east of the railway station?
