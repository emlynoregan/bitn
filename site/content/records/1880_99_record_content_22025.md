Offence.  The Redruth Magistrate’s Court heard the case of the Police v. Midwinter.  Midwinter, the licensee of the Baldina Hotel, was charged with supplying liquor to a drunken man, one Jacob Jansen, who subsequently died as a result of a road accident.  The case was dismissed for want of sufficient evidence.
