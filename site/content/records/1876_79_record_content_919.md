Burra Burra Mine

Captain Sanders’ Report 5 August

Morphett’s Engine Shaft has been sunk a further 8 ft 9 inches in the last month and a further 7 ft will bring us to 85 fathoms.  By the end of September we hope to see the shaft divided and secured so as to haul with whim engine from that level.  The inflow of water into crosscut at the 70 is causing problems.  The 70 driving north on lode is bursting with water, but contains rich stores of grey ore.  This level is far from ventilation and so we will start on Monday to sink a winze from the 60.  When holed we will be able to run Waterhouse’s Shaft to the 70 and prove the ground for a considerable distance north.  Peacock’s Air Shaft is holed to the 50 and we will sink to the 60 and also drive north.  Ayer’s old shaft has been cleared through from the 50 to the surface and a whim is being erected and when the shaft is secure we will let tribute pitches.  Roach’s Shaft is secured from the 50 to the 55.  We will divert a stream of water from Roach’s Shaft by clearing a level towards a winze to the 60, which will ventilate the 60 to that point.

[There is further detail of clearing out old workings to allow access and ventilation for the purpose of proving new ground or letting tribute pitches.]  Surface work is being pushed on with dispatch.
