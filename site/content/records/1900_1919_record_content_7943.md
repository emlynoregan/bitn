Paul Neydock will not be prosecuted after all.  The Crown decided not to proceed with the case and medical experts have decided that although he is ‘a bit queer’ he was ‘not a fit subject for the lunatic asylum’.  Arrangements are being made by the Salvation Army to send him to Broken Hill and his family.
