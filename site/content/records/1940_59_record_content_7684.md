A Social for Four Soldiers was held at the Burra Institute last Friday evening.  They were Ptes Archie Kellock, Bert Davey, Elliott Kellock and George Gallagher Jnr.

The Mayor introduced the boys and welcomed the wives of soldiers who had enlisted in the city and who had now come to live in Burra to make room for munition workers in the metropolis.  He also congratulated Rev. Neil Usher for joining up with the YMCA and announced he would shortly be going to Woodside.  The boys were presented with wrist watches.
