Rescue Equipment was demonstrated to a large group of locals on Saturday 19 January representing the Burra Ambulance, Police, Hospital Staff, Burra Burra DC, Apex and Lions Clubs.

They were impressed by equipment designed to rescue accident victims from vehicles quickly and safely.  It is hoped the equipment will be acquired soon for our district ambulance.
