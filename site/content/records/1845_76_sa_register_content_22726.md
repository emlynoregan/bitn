27 April 1869, page

Dr Berncastle has been in Kooringa and his visit created much excitement.  At Least Â£100 was paid by those seeking his particular expertise.  So far only one of his patients seems to have benefited from his skills.

[The rest of the article makes reference to has activities elsewhere and it seems he was probably a charlatan.  The descriptions do no indicate exactly what he did or claimed to do, but it seems to have been some sort of eye surgery or treatment.]
