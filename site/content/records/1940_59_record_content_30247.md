Obituary.  Mr David Dearlove died at Terowie Hospital on 5 February, aged 72.  He was the second son of the late William Dearlove of Ketchowla Station.  As a young man, he was a keen cyclist and interested in various sports.  He was an active cricketer for the Ketchowla Cricket Club.  For more than 40 years he carted wool from Ketchowla, first to Burra and later to Terowie.  He was a great lover of horses and was very proud of his team.  He was one of the first in the district to ride a motorcycle and to drive a car and took part in the early Burra-Morgan runs.  He was a bachelor and had never visited Adelaide.
