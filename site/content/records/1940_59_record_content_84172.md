Christmas Eve 1958 saw a large crowd of shoppers in Burra, but nothing had been arranged for them during the tea break from 5.30 to 7.00 p.m. or after closing time at 9 p.m.  â€“ apart from  the distribution by Burra Food Traders of several hundred ice creams vis Father Christmas, to the children and some music courtesy of Burra Radio and Electrical Services.  A large crowd attended the dance organised by the Burra Rural Youth at the Showgrounds.

The Mayor wants something to be organised for 1959 and so has called for a meeting of Burra Traders to discuss the matter.
