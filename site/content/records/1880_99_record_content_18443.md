Rev. Howitt’s Farewell.  A public tea was held at the Institute last Wednesday to bid farewell to Rev. Howitt who is going to Semaphore.  Over 300 attended from country districts and from various denominations.  The ladies of the congregation of St Mary’s were kept busy for about two hours waiting on the tea tables.

Mr Edwards, the Senior Warden, then took the chair.

Rev. G.E. Rowe (Wesleyan) was the only minister present, but there were apologies from Revs J. Salmon (Primitive Methodist) and W. O’Dowling (Roman Catholic)

Mr W.H. Rosman spoke of Rev. Howitt’s service over the last 11 years, mentioning his work on the Hospital Board and the Institute Committee as well as his spiritual duties.  He handed over a purse of sovereigns.

Rev. G.E. Rowe also spoke in support and on behalf of members of his church.

Mr W.F. Coglin JP came forward and spoke in appreciation on behalf of the Catholics of Burra.

Rev. Howitt replied - he begged pardon for sometimes perhaps speaking his mind and saying sharper things than perhaps he ought to have.  He regretted has frequent illnesses and unfortunate accidents that had interrupted his work at times.  The parting after so long was painful.
