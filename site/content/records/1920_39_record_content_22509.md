The Government administration of the Soldier Settlement Act was severely criticised for the application of liens on crops.  The Government took all and the storekeepers etc. who gave credit got nothing.  They passed a motion asking for the Act to be changed to give soldiers title after six years instead of the stipulated 10 and for this to be retrospective.  Candidates for election to Parliament are to be asked to state their position on opening up new land as there are over 1,000 men still waiting.
