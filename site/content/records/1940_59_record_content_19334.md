Obituary.  Mr A.J. Rasmus died at Farrell Flat recently aged 73.  He was the second son of the late John Rasmus of Ucolta.  In 1895 he married Fanny Mann of Whyte Yarcowie and for many years was a farmer at Ulooloo, but later took up land at Porter’s Lagoon where he resided till about three years ago when health reasons forced him to retire to Farrell Flat and leave the farming to his son.  He has suffered poor health for the last 25 years.  As a young man he was a keen high jumper and Sheffield runner and an enthusiastic cricketer and tennis player.  He leaves a widow, two sons, three daughters and eleven grandchildren.  [Born Adolph Rasmus 21 February 1871 Greenock: died 21 September 1944 Farrell Flat.]
