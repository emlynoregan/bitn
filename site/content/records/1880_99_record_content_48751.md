Cr Parks, as Chairman of the Waterworks Committee, moved that Cr Kitchen be asked to produce substantial evidence in the charge against the engineer.  Cr Walsh 2nd.

Cr Kitchen said he would do so if the party who told him was willing for his name to be divulged, otherwise they would have to accept the engineer’s denial.

Cr Linkson said that several complaints had been made to him, but he said nothing, as the parties concerned were not prepared to have their names mentioned.

The Mayor considered the charge so serious that if proved the engineer would be severely reprimanded, if not discharged.  He hoped the engineer would substantiate his own remarks.

The motion was carried.
