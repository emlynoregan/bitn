Accident.  Last Wednesday night a two ton lorry loaded with 100 cases of oranges from Berri was negotiating the western bank of the Pig & Whistle crossing when the engine failed and it ran quickly backwards.  It toppled off the north side of the ford and dropped seven feet, landing upside-down.  The driver Roy Heard of Berri and a companion escaped unhurt except for a scratched hand.  Mr Baulderstone rescued the major part of the load.  T.H. Woollacott & Sons with the aid of others restored the lorry to its wheels on the road the next morning and it was amazingly little damaged â€“ even the windscreen survived.  The total loss was about 20 cases of oranges.
