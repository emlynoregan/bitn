Burra Waterworks.

Mr Sedgman has presented a report that shows that many of the complaints made by Council were valid, though many were not.  Had they been in possession of the facts they would have known how deplorable the condition of the machinery was and would have had less trouble in finding out about the supposed leakages.  It is impossible for the engineer to have been pumping anything like the quantity he claimed.  When he said he pumped thousands of gallons, he hardly pumped as many hundreds.  Three pumps out of six were not working.  Five out of six were without springs and yet it had been reported that all were working smoothly.  This shows the importance of appointing a competent man.  Not only has the new engineer reported the problems, but has demonstrated them before the Councillors.  The great cry was that the reservoir was emptied night after night: in fact the water never went into it.  No wonder the engineer had to work night and day.  With only two pumps working and steam at high pressure and leaking away through loose joints etc.  The repairs will see enormous savings in wood and pumping times can be halved.  The engineer will have time to see to the flushing of the mains and other neglected aspects.
