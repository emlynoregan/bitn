Liberal Party Dinner.  Dean Brown, Shadow Minister for Health was the guest speaker.  He said that as a result of the Governmentâ€™s Generational Health Review, local hospital boards could go and their powers be transferred to regional boards, which would be non-representative.  The Mayors of Goyder Council and Clare & Gilbert Valley Council voiced their concern at this possibility.  Mr Brown said country people were losing out under the Rann Government through cuts to services and insufficient funding and the closure of some obstetric services.
