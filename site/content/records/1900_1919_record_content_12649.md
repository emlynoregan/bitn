Johannes Gottfried Mann was charged with failure to kill rabbits on his land at Baldina.  He gave evidence that he had killed 8,000 and had begun killing prior to receiving a notice to do so, had employed as many as four men and had sent away 451lb of rabbit skins.  His son, T.A. Mann, also gave evidence and another son, L. Mann, said he had been working on the land all the time except for five days of illness and had killed 8,871 rabbits.  The SM dismissed the case.
