Belgian Relief Fund

The committee discussed going on beyond the £1,000 target and it was decided to do so even if some subscribers and collectors pulled out.

The Commercial Travellers’ Concert for 9 July is confirmed.

The Rifle Club has special matches set for 28 June.

Mr Hann has presented an original cartoon for sale.

Farmers are asked to donate 1 acre of crop to the fund.

Mr Walker suggested asking graziers for a bale of wool.

Drew & Crewes are displaying a mysterious clock.  There is a 3’ diameter dial transfer on the window.  In the centre is a suction cup with a small pin on which there are two aluminium hands.  The question is, ‘What makes it go?’  £5-5-0 is offered for the right scientific answer.
