Mostyn Burton (RAN) was given a farewell social on Wednesday evening.  The usual speeches were made and Mrs Stolte presented a parcel from the Cupboard Fund and Mr C. Collins made a presentation on behalf of the district.  The hall was then cleared for dancing.

[No statement of where this occurred, but was presumably at Mt Bryan Hall.  Mostyn had previously been riding his bike to BHS for three years, where he had been a commendable scholar.]
