Burra Railway

A train driver called the ‘Broadcaster’ office a few weeks ago while waiting to truck out a long load of grain.  He said the track was in good condition and in fact was better than most country lines.  ‘I don’t know why all the restrictions are on it.’  There would seem to be no good reason why special passenger trains can’t visit Burra.
