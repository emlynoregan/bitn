Mr Harold Atkins of Farrell’s Flat wants a motor boat on Porter’s Lagoon.  A committee has been formed and a boat is on the way.  Something that will do about 60 knots per hour!  Of late the Lagoon has been crowded with people ‘Surfing, boating, and enjoying the cool sea breeze effect and all that’.
