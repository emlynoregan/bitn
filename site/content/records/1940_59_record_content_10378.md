Obituary.  Mrs G.A. Heinrich died on 22 May.  She was born Bertha Christiana Meyer, fourth daughter of the late Mr & Mrs F. Meyer of Bright.  She spent her youth with her parents until she married Mr Gustav A, Heinrich of Bright.  Their first home was about four miles north of Robertstown and in November 1918 they moved to South Booborowie homestead where Mr Heinrich was overseer for the late Mr R.M. Hawker until 1927.  They then moved to their present residence ‘Flagstaff View’, a holding they acquired from the Government.  Mrs Heinrich was a quiet woman who won the esteem of all she came into contact with.  She was the mother of twelve surviving children.  She was a supporter of the Soldiers’ Wives Unit and a practical Red Cross worker.  About eleven years ago she had a severe illness from which she never fully recovered.  There are seven sons and five daughters:
