Midland Road Board visit to Burra

Main concern was the Bon Accord Bridge request.  Great traffic uses the road here due to Silverton and the wool cartage from the N-E Plains, but the extension of the railway to Silverton will change this and so for now an upgrading of the ford is decided on, with the bridge to be reconsidered later.
