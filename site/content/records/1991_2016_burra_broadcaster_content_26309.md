Council has decided to establish a regional Heritage Fund to assist owners of listed properties in the Goyder Council area.  This follows the success of the Burra State Heritage Area Heritage Fund.  In the previous round the $10,000 fund assisted twelve individual small projects totalling $25,000.  To be eligible you have to be the owner of a State heritage listed property within and contributing to the State Heritage Area.  Community Groups and churches as well as individuals may apply.
