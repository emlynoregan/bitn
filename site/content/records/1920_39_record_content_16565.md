Burra High School was inspected by W.J. Adey, the Superintendent of Secondary Education, on 29 July.  He was very satisfied, but agreed the school needs urgent upgrading of its accommodation.  This year the science room will be remodelled to teach Physics and Chemistry and the large classroom will be divided into two with modern lighting and the Domestic Arts room will soon also be remodelled.
