Burra Show Society, meeting of 23 February

It was resolved that the Dog Trials be on 27 & 28 April.

Mr I.J. Warnes said that due to the pressure of work associated with the Stockownersâ€™ Assoc. of SA, of which he was President, he wished to stand down from the presidency of the Show Society for 1923.  There was considerable discussion during which Mr Radford made it clear he could not accept the position and Mr Bartholomaeus said he would need to think it over.  [Both these gentlemen were Vice-Presidents.]
