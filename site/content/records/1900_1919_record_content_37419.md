Seaside Excursion last Wednesday.

Some were up by 2 a.m. to get ready.  Public Bells rang at 2.30.  Most people walked to the station in the keen morning air.  The double-headed train comprised 10 carriages of six compartments and departed at 5 a.m.  The first stop was at Manoora for water.  There was a stop at Riverton for breakfast.  The third stop for the Burra train was at Gawler, again for refreshments.  After Dry Creek one engine was discarded, but the remaining engine had trouble in St Vincent St.  The two trains carried just on 1,300 people.  At Semaphore the crowd dispersed.  Many took the local train to Adelaide where the Art Gallery, Museum, Botanic Gardens and particularly the picture shows were attractions.  The return train left at 7 p.m. and most were asleep by Riverton.  Burra was reached at 11.20 p.m.  The Burra Coronation Band livened the dayâ€™s proceedings and in all it was a great success.
