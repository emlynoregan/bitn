Fire.  The fire at Koomooloo on 31 December is reported.  The grass was 2’ high in places and the fire travelled six miles from NW to SE and burned from midday to 1 a.m. the following day.  In places it was 3 miles wide and consumed 4,000 to 5,000 acres.  Luck saved Mr Warnes’s stud rams which had only just been moved from the paddock.  A wind change saved the properties of Messrs McWaters and Sandland.  Wax vestas dropped by rabbiters are suspected of causing the fire.
