Burra RSL is facing a membership crisis.  It will have to close by next March if more members are not found.  Next week’s Anzac service could be Burra’s last.  Without more members the local branch will be unable to fill the quorum for official meetings.  At the AGM there were just five present from the board of eight.  Sub-Branch President John Trigg said they are fearful of closing because it could spell the end of traditional ceremonies in the town.  Places lice Booleroo Centre, Melrose, Jamestown and Orroroo no longer have RSLs so they have to travel to other towns to attend Anzac and Remembrance Day services.  Secretary Mike Thomas said that because Burra did not have service organisations like Rotary, Lions or Apex to take over the running of official RSL activities, we are looking to have to close for good.  Members call on returned soldiers, Vietnam vets, of National Service members to join the sub-branch to keep the organisation from closing.  The Anzac Day service for 2011 will take place at the War Memorial in Market Square at 6.30 a.m. on Monday 25 April.  Burra Indoor Bowling Ladies will provide tea, coffee and biscuits afterwards in the Council chamber or a tot of rum donated by the Burra Hotel.
