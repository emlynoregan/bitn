The newly opened sealed road has seen motorists travelling faster, but there is a need to be aware of emus and kangaroos.  The road was opened by local MP Ian Venning this week, after the completion of the $19.6 million upgrade.  It had been closed since January to allow the 15 km section through the Burra Hills to be reconstructed and sealed.  It is still under construction with 30 km yet to do between the Robertstown turn-off and ‘The Gums’ and that will be completed before the end of 1998.  It will provide another quick and efficient route for freight between east and west as well as better access for tourists to the Burra creek Gorge.  The section from Burra to Robertstown turn-off was closed because the terrain meant a bypass was not possible.
