He then got a rebate, but even after that it cost £277.

If he had continued by road he could easily save £150.

[The £127 cost to Mt Mary included petrol, oil, wages and food.]

W. Kakoschke, carrier of Aberdeen, said all his carrying was outback.  He did not know of any wool going past Burra to Adelaide by road, but it was possible for pastoralists to cart their own wool.  A lot was carted to Burra railway station.

Other drivers present were S.R. King, H.O. James, J.G. Carpenter & W. Montgomery.

Some raised the question of back-loading charges.

W. Kakoschke said he carried back-loading free; it saved the lorries and if the drivers had trouble the sheep farmers never made a charge for their keep in the meantime.  He would rather take a cwt free and save his lorries.

Mr Warnes said if back-loading were to be charged for they would be seeking a reduction in forward loading charges.  All back-loading in the last 30 years had been done free.

Mr Hill said years ago it [back-loading] was 1/3 a ton and now it is 6d.

R.A. Bevan, passenger carrier between Aberdeen and Kooringa supported the previous statements about excessive parcel freight charges.  He did not believe lowering the charges would affect the amount of freight carried on goods trains, but the Chairman thought passenger trains would be overcrowded with parcels.

Mr Warnes said the present charges were simply driving the parcels to road transport.
