E.T. Prior of Copperhouse writes that he was struck by a car being driven into Jennison’s Garage.  It grazed his leg and he was lucky not to be a step further on.  He could not see it coming as one eye was bandaged.  The driver claimed he did not see the pedestrian due to his side-curtains.  This is careless driving.
