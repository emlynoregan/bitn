Burra Town Council.

Cr Hardy drew the attention of the Mayor to a paragraph in the Record concerning the allotting of certain tenders to certain ratepayers.  He asked who gave the information to the press and by whose authority.

Cr Watt explained that the Public Works Committee had been given permission to allot 70 yards of metal contracts.

When Cr Hardy sought to query his action Cr Watt said that four of the five members of the committee were present when the committee decided the matter.

Cr Hardy asked if the Town Clerk had sent out notices of the meeting – No.

Cr Rabbich queried the legality of the meeting. – he having had no notice of the meeting.

Cr Watt said the date was fixed at the last meeting.

Cr Hardy queried the minutes of the Public Works Committee and he challenged the decision not to accept the lowest tender.

Cr Watt pointed out there had been many occasions when he [Hardy] and Cr Rabbich had dealt with tenders in the absence of others and he never complained then.

Cr Rabbich: ‘That’s different altogether.’

Cr Hardy then reverted to the question of the lowest tender.

Cr Watt accused him of not listening – having told him 20 minutes earlier that there was a tender for 2/-, ‘but it was not good enough to wait till Christmas before the contract [Voumard’s] was completed, when there were tenders in from men who would carry out the contract at once.

Cr Watt moved the minutes be received.  Cr Parks 2nd.

After some further bickering the motion was carried.

Other minor matters were dealt with and then Cr Linkson had a disagreement with the overseer about whether Richard Thomas had been working for the North Ward or on the Main Road account.

Cr Hardy then moved:

‘That this Council disapproves of the action of the Chairman in taking upon himself the transaction of public business with a total disregard of the standing orders of this Council, and that the business in question to wit the illegal acceptance of tenders for road metal from Messrs C. Herberle & J. Williams be not entertained by the Council and that the tenders received be referred back to the Public Works Committee.

‘I have been chiacked a lot about this affair.’

Cr Rabbich then took up the argument again claiming not to have known of the meeting and insisting that the lowest tender had to be accepted and several other quibbles.

Cr Parks said most of this was unnecessary.  The advertisement clearly said ‘neither the lowest nor any tender necessarily accepted’.

Cr Rabbich certainly knew the meeting was to be held on Saturday, if not the exact time.

Cr Watt observed that it was interesting that the principal person [Cr Hardy] in working up the furore was not a member of the Public Works Committee.  The debate then turned to some confusion over what was meant by ‘supplying’ and how that differed from ‘raising’ metal.

The motion was lost.

Cr Rabbich moved Rawlin’s tender at 2/3 a yard be accepted.  Carried.

[How this last fits in with the rest of the debate is unclear.]
