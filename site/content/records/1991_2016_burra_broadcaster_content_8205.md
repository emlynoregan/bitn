Creek Day

The festivities by the Burra Creek on Saturday were very successful.  A large crowd spread along the park from 10 a.m. and the official launch was made by Barry Wakelin MP â€“ the local federal member.  There were plenty of arts and crafts stalls, food stalls and music.  There was a fairground organ, Jeanette Wormald with her SA country music, the Celtic Broadsword Team and the Royal Caledonian Society Pipers.  Dick Frankel and the Jazz Disciples and The Wild Matildas were also there, as were the folk combo, Brigalow and the Morrismen.  Matt Reilly refereed the ice cream eating competition.
