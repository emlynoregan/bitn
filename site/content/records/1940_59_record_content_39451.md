Rectors of St Mary’s, Burra by Miss Lucy Webb of Victor Harbor.

Rev. John Charles Bagshawe MA migrated on the Northumberland in 1847 as Chaplain to the Copper Co.  He arrived earlier than Bishop Short, by whom he was engaged in England.  Jack Gleeson of Inchiquin, Clare rode over every week to be tutored by Mr Bagshawe, which led to Bagshawe being offered the living of Penwortham & Clare.  Bagshawe was the architect for both the Clare and Penwortham Churches and of the Penwortham parsonage (now in ruins).  He caused its date of 1850 to be inscribed over the front door. Mr Bagshawe married Miss Amelia Woodruffe, the Gleeson’s governess.  Mr Pollitt rode over from Burra to perform the ceremony.  Mr Bagshawe later moved to St John’s in Halifax Street in Adelaide and died as Principal of Invercargill College, New Zealand.  [Incumbent 1847-1850.]

James Pollitt was the second incumbent and second chaplain for the Copper Co.  He came to Adelaide in 1846, having been a CMS Missionary in the West Indies.  He came with Rev. W.J., later Archdeacon Woodcock.  There were then five Anglican clergy in the diocese of Adelaide, awaiting the arrival of their first Bishop.  Mr Pollitt was first stationed at Blakiston.  In 1850 Rev. E.K. Miller visited in 1850 and said Burra was then a very busy and dusty place with a deep creek running through the town and many people were living in caves they had dug in the creek bank, cutting apertures to the surface for chimneys, which were protected at the top by a beer cask or a few pieces of wood driven into the ground, sometimes by nothing at all, so that unwary travellers were liable to make a sudden descent into someone’s fireplace or frying pan.  Rev. James Pollitt and his wife are buried in the family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery in Adelaide.  In 1855 Rev. Pollitt transferred to St Luke’s, Whitmore Square in Adelaide, where he remained for 26 years.  He died in 1881. His son, Henry Martyn Pollitt was named after a famous missionary to India.  He became Honorary Cannon of St Peter’s Cathedral and Rector of All Saints, Hindmarsh.  He and his wife Caroline are also buried in the family vault.  Caroline Carleton Pollitt was a daughter of the authoress of ‘The Son of Australia’.  [Incumbent 1850-1855.]

Rev. D.T. Ibbetson [sic] was the son of the Commissariat General Ibbetson, who was on the island of St Helena at the time of Napoleon’s captivity there and who made well-known water-colour sketches of Napoleon after his death.  Rev. Ibbetson left Burra for St John’s, Halifax Street, Adelaide, where he remained until his death.  His eldest son rose to eminence in the Indian Civil Service, was knighted and died in 1908.  [Incumbent 1855-1861]  [Note.  He was actually Denzil John Holt Ibbetson and started working life as an engineer.  He was made a deacon in 1854 in London and was not ordained a priest until 29 June 1855, so for his first six months in Burra his ministry was limited by his not being a priest.]

Rev. John Fulford came to SA as a layman on the Derwent, with Bishop Short in 1847.  In 1848 he was ordained deacon in the first ordination held in the diocese at Trinity Church.  As a priest his first parish was at St Mary’s (South Road) and then moved around quite a lot, with stays at Strathalbyn, Port Elliot and Goolwa, among others.  In 1858, when incumbent at Blakiston, he returned to England.  [Incumbent 1861-63]  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says that in 1859-60 he returned to England.  He was appointed to Kooringa-Redruth in 1861, but the district then included ‘Booborowie, Canowie, Mann Narrie, Pekina, Black Rock, Pasnaroo, Parndapee, Cachowla, Carooma and Mt Bryan’.  He was therefore away from Burra for extended periods.  He left the parish in 1962.]

Rev. Lionel Stanton was strikingly handsome, with aquiline features and piercing black eyes.   One son was Lionel I.S.O., Inspector of Schools and the others were Clement and Gypsian.  The daughters were called Esther Holmes, Phoebe Pittar, Annie and Kathleen Pittar.  Later Mrs Stanton and the two eldest girls set up a school at Glenelg and many Burra girls went there as boarders.  Rev. Stanton died in England.  [Incumbent 1864-1874.]

Rev. Henry Howitt belonged to a well-known family at Magill.  His parents are buried in St George’s churchyard.  He was delicate as a youth, but lived to be 86.  He married a sister of the Rev. J.W. Gower of Blakiston.  He died as Rector Emeritus of Mill Valley, California.  [Incumbent 1874-1885.]

Rev. J. Stuart Mayland [sic] incumbent 1885-1891. [Note: actually Rev. John Stuart Wayland.]

Rev. A.G. King incumbent 1892-1899. [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says he died on Christmas Day 1941 in England.  He was Arthur George King.]

Rev. W.G.M. Murphy incumbent 1899-1904.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Wilfred Murphy.]

Rev. R.H.T. Nightwick.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Rev. Humphry Wightwick.  Incumbent 1904-1906.]

Rev. H.L. Ebbs.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Rev. Harvey Ebbs.  Incumbent 1906-1910.  In the latter part of Rev. Ebbs time Rev. William Terry came to the parish as Assistant Curate.  He too left in 1910.]

Rev. S.J. Bloyd.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Rev. Sydney Bloyd.  Incumbent 1910-1918.  In 1914 Rev. Francis Durnford came as Assistant Curate, but although officially appointed there till 1919, he volunteered for service in WWI, was awarded the Military Cross and was effectively only in Burra for the first year of his appointment.]

Rev. H. H. Hopton.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Rev. Henry Hopton.  Incumbent 1918-1921.]

Rev. F.B. Hewitson.  [St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years says Rev. Frank Hewitson.  Incumbent 1921-1927.]
