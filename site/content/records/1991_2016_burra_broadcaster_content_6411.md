Kangaroo Blindness Epidemic

A widespread epidemic of blindness affecting kangaroos has been reported across the Riverland and Flinders Ranges districts and it has now appeared to the east of Burra.  The cause is presently unknown, though a virus is suspected.  There is no treatment.  It has been seen most in western grey kangaroos, but more recently has appeared in red kangaroos.  Police and Wild Life Officers ask for any sightings to be reported with details if possible of the breed, sex, size and location.  The disease was first noticed in SA near Renmark some weeks ago.
