Burra Community School

Mr Christopher J. McCabe has been appointed Principal of Burra Community School.  He was previously Deputy Principal of Penola High School.  He is the first principal of a Country Community School in SA.  The comprehensive rebuilding of the existing Primary and Secondary Schools provided an integrated educational facility.  The original building, which is of historic interest, and has a National Trust classification, has been preserved.  Mr McCabe will be responsible for the successful introduction of the concept of community education in Burra.  In 1973 Mr McCabe took up a Rotary Foundation award to the USA and studied for his MA at Ball State University, Indiana.  A significant part of his study was community education.  He has taught at Findon and Port Pirie and Mt Gambier High Schools and was appointed Deputy Principal at Penola High School in January 1975.  In the rebuilding process the shell of the original building will be retained, while the interior is converted into modern open space learning areas for the Primary School students.
