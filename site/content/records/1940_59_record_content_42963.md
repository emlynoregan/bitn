Mr J.G. Oates will be 90 on 8 October.  Mr & Mrs Oates had lived in Burra North for about 30 years until moving to Adelaide last year due to failing health.  With the help there available their health improved.  In 1896 Mr Oates acquired the farm now owned by Roy Lloyd.  In 1919 he lost practically everything except the homestead in the great fire that came through from Booborowie.  12 months before that he had settled his two sons on ‘Poonunda’ at Mongolata.  They worked as partners for five years when O.J. Oates acquired land of his own and sold out to his brother.  Mr Oates Sen. still takes a keen interest in the activities of both places.  He now lives at 13 Second Ave St Peters.
