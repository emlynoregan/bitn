Redruth Reformatory

On 30 December Rev. E.M. Ingamells wrote to the President of the State Children’s Council requesting that the Council publicly clear the Matron of the Reformatory from the serious reflections cast upon her which were supported by statements from a former inmate, which she subsequently admitted were lies.  Failing this a good many of the leading men in Burra will take the matter up, which may reflect seriously on the State Children’s Council.  The State Children’s Council forwarded an apology to the Minister.  On 17 January a letter was sent to the Chief Secretary asking that the apology be published.  The Council seemed to be trying to shift all responsibility to the Minister.  The matter was still being pursued when the revolution of 4 February took place.  A serious aspect seems to be that some months ago the staff at the Reformatory wrote a letter to the President and requested it be forwarded to the Premier.  It seems the Council decided to keep it from the Premier.
