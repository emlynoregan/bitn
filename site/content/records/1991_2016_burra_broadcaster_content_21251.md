A letter to Transport SA will seek to have Route 64, the Morgan-Spalding road, named the Goyder Highway.  And the Burra-Robertstown Road named the World’s End Road.  And the Eudunda-Robertstown Road named Point Pass Road.

A letter of appreciation will be sent to John Oates for his long and dedicated service to the Redbanks Reserve Committee.
