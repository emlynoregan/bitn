George Parker farmer of Leighton was savagely attacked by a poley young bull at his farm on Wednesday.  He was hampered by the loss of an arm in a chaff-cutter a few years ago.  He was eventually rescued by his wife with a dog, but sustained broken ribs, an injured wrist and was covered with contusions and terrible bruises.  The bull has been shot.
