The hospital financial year should be brought into line with the grant year running from 1 July to 30 June and it would be more even.  This will be done.

Patient contributions varied greatly from year to year.  There was a low of £242 in 1910 and a high of £726 in 1914 for instance.  The secretary thought that outstanding accounts should be placed in the hands of a solicitor.

Outstanding accounts totalled about £300.
