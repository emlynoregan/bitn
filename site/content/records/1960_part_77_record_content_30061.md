Messrs H.L. Cullen & Son will complete 17 years on the Eastern Mail Run when the contract with the PMG expires at the end of the month.  They have covered nearly 350,000 miles on the 376 mile trip each week.  Added to that is the general carrying of many more thousands of miles.  In the earlier days the route was a mere track and occasionally the truck was bogged down to its tray.  Despite this there has been only one occasion when the run was not completed in the three day schedule of Friday to Sunday.  On that occasion they were not back until the following Thursday.  On the 376 mile trip there are only five ramps, but over 100 gates to open and close.  Mr Cullen will continue his general carrying business, but from Friday the mail run will be operated by Mr I.T. Allen.
