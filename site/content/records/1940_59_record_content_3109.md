Obituary.  Samuel Jeffrey died at his home at Clarence Park on 8 August.  He was the 5th son of the late Mr & Mrs William Barrett Jeffery of Porter’s Lagoon.  He was born at Anlaby Station on 29 June 1874.  In 1896 he married Rachel, 3rd daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Flower of Stony Gap, who died 8 years ago.  After his marriage he lived at Copperhouse and worked at the Burra Quarry, which was then working three shifts a day.  In 1898 he took up land consisting of 8 acres at Booborowie, where he lived for nearly 30 years, gradually adding to his holding and acquiring part of North Booborowie Estate.  He sold out during the land boom and purchased the property known as ‘Wildotta’, part of ‘Coralinga’ Station.  At one time he represented Anne Ward in the Booborowie DC.  Ill health forced him to retire to Burra for 5½ years before moving to Clarence Park.  As a young man he was a shearer of no mean ability and a lover of all sport.  He also loved thoroughbreds, both in the show ring and on the racecourse.  He was widely known for his abilities at foot-running, football, boxing and horsemanship.  He is survived by: Roy Jeffery (Burra), Amy Mrs W.N. Young (Orroroo) and Emily Jeffery (Clarence Park).  There is one grandchild.
