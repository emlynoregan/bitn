Koonoona Field Day was held last Wednesday and saw a WA buyer, Mr Clem J. Manuel, pay 1,500 guineas for a ram.  About 400 people attended.  Mr Roy Butcher from Mt Kokeby paid 1,000 guineas for a ram and Mr Hayfield of Yacka paid a similar amount.  Three went to New Zealand for 500 guineas each.  Other sales were also very good.
