Burra Town Hall Pictures

Attendances have dropped rather drastically in the last six months.

This represents a fall in attendance of 26% in the last half of the year.  Over the last six months the venture has been operating at a small loss.  This cannot continue.  Attendances were bad in 1966, improved in the first half of 1967 and then fell again.  Some special bigger films have been booked and will carry slightly greater admission charges.  Letâ€™s hope attendances will improve.  For the first night of 1968 it was 126.
