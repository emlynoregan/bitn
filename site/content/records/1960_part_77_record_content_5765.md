Burra Open Swimming Carnival was not as successful as hoped because the Peterborough competitors did not arrive and this prevented the night program as planned.  The rest of the events went of satisfactorily.  The weather was a little cool.  Peterborough had over 40 entries from 20 competitors, but could not arrange transport.  Overall the club showed a small profit on the day.
