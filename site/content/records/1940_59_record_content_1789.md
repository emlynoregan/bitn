Obituary.  Raymond Burke, a well-known figure in the town in the last 12 months or so, died at the Burra Hospital last Sunday, 19 May.  He was born in Antigua, West Indies, in 1876 and came to Australia in 1896 on the Jane Spratt, arriving at Pt Melbourne as part of the Georgia Minstrel & Cakewalk Co.  He later left the stage for the boxing ring and obtained fame as a lightweight boxer.  He once fought for the Australian Championship and fought a draw with the holder.  After getting too old and heavy for boxing he bought a dry cleaning plant and resided for some years at Horsham in Victoria.  Later he came to Burra and did odd dry-cleaning jobs till recently when his health failed.  He was admitted to the Burra Hospital in the middle of April.

[Age on death registration is 66.]
