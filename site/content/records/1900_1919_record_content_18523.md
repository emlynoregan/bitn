W. Kellaway writes concerning the report of a loss of £893-19-2 for the Burra Mine recently.  He says the company had no need to look for milling ore.  They just needed two or three jigs to treat the hundreds of thousands of tons that have been staring them in the face for years.  Pump the water out and spend the money searching virgin ground.  The mine ought to be employing a thousand men, but there seems to be no go in either the directors or the management.
