Goyder YAC received funding through Country Arts SA for an aerosol art project utilising the skills of Jimmy C who came to co-ordinate it.  On Monday 9 July some young Burra locals produced some aerosol art, which will hopefully be displayed around the school.  With the commitment of local youth to see a skate park established these skills could be implemented in the skate park design process.  The project covered an understanding and the responsibility of using spray cans, safety concerns and the difference between legal and d responsible aerosol art and irresponsible graffiti art, with a focus on developing artistic skills.
