[Lapford* Articles.  On 27 February a series of articles had begun which purported to come from the town of Lapford, supposedly from the solitary inhabitant of a poorly constructed tin hut on the edge of the creek.  They were cast in the form of humorous accounts based on local incidents, but strayed rather easily into the tall story category and there are doubtless references that meant much more and were more readily identifiable to people of the day.  The humour is rather laboured, the length somewhat excessive, even for 1885, and the writer interlards his work with scraps of poetry and quotations in Latin and other languages.  In the paper for 18 August he takes issue with another contributor of humour who wrote an occasional column called ‘Echoes from the Bush’ under the pen name ‘By Jingo’.  His efforts are said to be flat, stale and unoriginal with their inspiration coming from cheap American origins, though oddly enough he is accused of getting his American terms from English penny-dreadfuls.  ‘Jingo’ naturally responded in a like vein and the writer of ‘Life at the World’s End’, as the Lapford articles had come to be headed, responded in turn with the announcement of a satirical look at Burra life which began in the paper of 28 August under the title of ‘The City of Big-Big’.  This took the form of letters descriptive of the place previously known as Kooringa, written in the years 1910-12.  From the style it is not unlikely that both players in the altercation were the one person.]
