Kooringa Football Club AGM was held at J. Allen’s rooms last Wednesday.  The decision was made to carry on 1n 1922 and to join the Burra Association.  Elected were Patron, S.M. Lane; President, W.R. Chambers; Hon. Sec. J. Allen pro tem till the next meeting.  The Chairman, W. Moyses said he felt the proposed Gymnasium Club would make the other two town teams very weak.  Mr Norman said that if Kooringa joined the Association the Gymnasium team would not: the proposal had only been made in the first place to keep the sport going [in the event that Kooringa decided not to continue.]  Victoria Park will be the home ground.
