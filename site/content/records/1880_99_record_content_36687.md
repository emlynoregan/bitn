Obituary.  Mr Misner, who was said to have been turned out of the Jamestown Hospital the same day he was brought to the Burra Hospital, died suddenly yesterday.  Unless there is a satisfactory reply from Jamestown authorities we can expect an inquest here.  [Registered as William Mysner, died 19 May 1890 aged 39.]
