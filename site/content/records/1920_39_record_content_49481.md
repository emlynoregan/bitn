Burra Town Council, 5 February

Municipal assoc. advises the Council cannot forbid pedestrians from walking on the roads, but can pass a by-law that they must keep to the footpaths where available.  Council will move to have the issue discussed at a Municipal Assoc. meeting.

The Mayor reported on the Youths Occupational Committee meeting.

The Town Clerk reported the assessment was £14,488 last year and £14,416 this year, a reduction of £72.  On a 2/3 rate last year’s revenue was £1,629 and this year a 2/3 rate would produce £1,621.  The report was adopted.

The Court of Appeal will meet 26 February and the rate will be 2/3.  The road from the National Bank to SAFU corner will be tar-dressed.
