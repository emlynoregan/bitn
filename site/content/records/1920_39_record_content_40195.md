Mongolata Goldfield

Flaherty, Bevan & Morgan have again reported good results from a crushing with 3oz 9dwt 5gr per ton plus tailings 3oz 14dwt for a total of 7oz 3dwt 5gr.  A company is soon to be formed to work this claim: the Mongolata FBM Gold Mining Co. Ltd.

The Mongolata Gold Prospectors’ Assoc. met on 3 December and sent a complaint to the Minister of Mines about the water supply.  They request a supply of rain water from Redruth Girls’ Reformatory.  Water from the Burra town supply deteriorates rapidly in the heat.

The Government-supplied First Aid Equipment comprises two bandages and ¼lb of boracic acid and a tourniquet for a total value of 3/-.  The Association conveys its disgust via local MPs.

The Government has not implemented recommendations for a larger ration.  Nor as yet has it supplied a battery.  There is a feeling that city dwellers come first and country dwellers last.

Chess at the Redruth Memorial Hall 7 December saw Burra 16 games defeat Clare 11 games.

The Mayoress’s Christmas Appeal donations are acknowledged.

[Personal interest: they include 3/- from R. Fuss.]
