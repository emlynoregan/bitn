‘Squibs & Crackers’ writes urging that the beacon on Mount Lofty for the Royal Visit should include some very large Bengal lights.

Composition: saltpetre 1 lb, sulphur ½ lb and black antimony ¼ lb.

Powder them all until they cease to feel gritty and cram into pots or tins.

When lit they would be visible for a great distance.  The cost could be reduced by using 2 oz antimony with 2 oz charcoal.  [Bengal lights were a form of firework producing a steady vivid blue light.]
