East Ward Candidates’ Meeting

R.A. Bevan & R.C. Lott addressed voters at the Council Chamber last night as candidates for the Town Council.

Mr Bevan would not make any promises as he might not be able to deliver, being only one voice in seven.  He was a supporter of sports and eager to raise funds for the Town Hall.  Liquidating the debt on the Town Hall could be a Memorial Scheme.

Mr Lott saw a lot of work that needed to be done around the town.  Certain industries needed to be pushed.  The ballast quarry should be re-opened and a cement works opened.

Hanson Agricultural Bureau AGM will be held on 7 July.
