Burra High School Prize Day was held on Tuesday on the tennis courts.  Prize-giving and reports were interspersed with items.

The Headmasterâ€™s Report by H.O. Pederick

It had been a successful year with a slightly smaller enrolment, but a better retention rate throughout the year, so that the average attendance had not been much changed.  It is hoped that a bus service for Booborowie & Booborowie North will help numbers in 1950.  This year the services of Miss Burge (Needlework) were lost.  Two new classrooms were opened about a month ago by the Inspector of Technical Schools.  New wash troughs and laundry facilities and a new stove have been installed in the Domestic Arts Centre and a new typewriter has been acquired.  A Junior Red Cross Circle was established under Miss Blesing.  There were two excursions: one to Port Adelaide to visit factories, wool stores and steamers and one to Clare to hear the SA State Orchestra.  The Director of Education visited early in the year.
