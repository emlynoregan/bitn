Burra Quilting Group last week sewed 60 shoulder bags for the drain bags used by patients following surgery for breast cancer.  They will be donated to Flinders Medical Centre.  At present members are working on Friendship Quilts, where a member chooses a pattern, some fabric and a colour scheme, and others make a block for assembly into a quilt.  Many will be on show at their annual exhibition in May 2013.
