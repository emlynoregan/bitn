Gala Day at Burra North

On Saturday 30 November a Children’s Fancy Dress Frolic was held at the Memorial Hall Burra North.

[Results are printed.]

At 6 p.m. a delicious tea was served and in the evening a concert was presented by the Burra & District Choral Society with Mrs Evehback & Mrs Tucker from Blackwood.  The Choral society was led by Mr R. Mueller with Mrs J. Oates as pianist.  There was a clear £87 profit, which will aid the Freedom From Hunger Campaign.
