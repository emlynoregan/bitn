Burra Hospital.  Chairman R.K. Pearse’s Report 1967-68.  The 91st Annual Report

Capital assets increased by $78, 921 due to the extensive building program.  Liquid assets stand at $21,890; down $8, 215.  The general account overdraft is $1,649 compared with $4,342 last year.  The overall credit balance is $17,548.  The Government subsidy increased by #3,090 and patients’ fees rose $4,765.  At present there is no need to increase patients’ fees, which were last raised in November 1965.

The average number of in-patients rose by 2.5 to 18.5 – an all-time high.

The average cost of out-patients fell by 50c to $2.30.

Births at the hospital rose to 50.

The year saw the completion of the ‘Alice Collins’ Theatre and Casualty Wing and the domestic quarters.  These additions plus equipment will cost approximately $100,000, not all of which is subsidised.  Since the building program was commenced we have expended $160,000 on capital improvements and $40,000 on maintenance.  The new wing was opened on 2 August by the Chief Secretary Hon. R.C. De Garis.  There are now plans to modernise the Maternity Wing and the kitchen.  The equipment for the Intensive Care Ward has to be purchased and the Board hopes to standardise on St Andrew’s type beds throughout the hospital.  The cropping program is receiving little support unfortunately and this year wheat sales produced only $229.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary continues its good work in sewing and stocking jams and preserves and now operates in adequate facilities.  The Fund Raising Committee contributed $840 towards equipment purchases.

The Matron and nursing staff have given excellent service as have the domestic staff and handy man.  The appeal for building funds produced a generous $13,302 despite the dry season, and this was greatly appreciated.

The death of respected Board Member Mr Keith Gare was deeply regretted.  We thank Mrs A.D. Radford for her services and we lose her this year and welcome Mrs H. Treweeke and Mr W.A. Field to the Board.
