The Record office was deluged as was Bowey’s while smoke and water were also giving Sara’s a bad time.

The Record office has four rooms.  In the front room the glass windows were soon smashed with heat and water and the façade and verandah [partly] burnt.  The fire from Wohling’s spread into the roof and ceilings of the first three of the rooms, each of which is fitted with large skylights.  When these broke they admitted much air to the fire, but also much water.  Pascoe’s balcony caught fire, but was extinguished and the flooding of the Record office roof area saved Pascoe’s from the fire.

In the Record composing room over 100 cases of type were filled with water and all newspaper copy on the files ready for Monday was destroyed.  The stapling machines, cutter and fixings in the second room were much damaged.  The books etc. from the front office were saved although the place was flooded and the floor covered with charred wood from the ceiling and roof.  The fourth room was built strongly of stone in recent years and had an iron ceiling.  When the door connecting it to the front rooms was opened it was found to be in perfect order without even smoke damage.  A little water had run down one wall.  The printing press was safe and the £2,000 worth of equipment in the room was undamaged.

While working at the back of the shops Mr P.J. Byrne (fireman) & Mr Ron Burt both received severe electrical shocks.  Mr Burt was knocked backwards onto a lean-to roof of Bowey & Montgomery’s and Mr Byrne received a greater shock because of his wet boots and was thrown heavily.  The rear room at Bowey & Montgomery’s was saved, but the long room adjacent to Wohling’s was destroyed and with it all the stock.  Nothing in Wohling’s was saved, as it was fully ablaze before the alarm was raised.

Behind Wohling’s is a thick-walled storeroom with cement floor, used as a storeroom by the Record and this was saved with only minor losses of stock due to water and smoke.

We believe the stock of Bowey & Montgomery, who have occupied the premises for only a few weeks, was not insured.

At Sara’s the main damage was due to smoke – even a pound of butter left on the counter on Friday night was quite firm and butter and other goods in the cellar were in perfect condition.  The ceiling is black and damaged where the fire got under the roof.  Four extra hands have been engaged to clean up and prepare for a big sale [advertised for Thursday].

Insurance covers everything except Bowey & Montgomery’s stock.

In Mr Pascoe’s house there was also smoke and water damage.  Water from the efforts to save the Record office poured down the wall of the sitting room, damaging wall-paper and linoleum in this downstairs room which is on a level with the Record’s composing room.  Smoke also penetrated and blackened the ceiling.  Water from here ran into the adjoining shade house and thence to the cellar.

We have been told Mr Wandke employed by Mr Charles Parks baker of Kooringa, passed down the lane on his way to work at 2 a.m. and heard a crackling noise and thinking it came from Drew & Crewes shone his torch on the property, but saw nothing amiss. Unfortunately he did not look in the other direction.
