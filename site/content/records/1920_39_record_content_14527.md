Show Society.  The committee met on Friday to consider a complaint from Mr I’Anson of Farrell’s Flat that his spring dray horse had not been judged at the show.  He was demanding at least half the prize money.  The stewards reported that having waited a full quarter of an hour after calling the event the judge had been dismissed and so when the dray had arrived it was too late.  The committee decided to uphold the Ring Committee report and not to comply with Mr I’Anson’s request.
