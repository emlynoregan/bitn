Midland Road Board.

Mr Killicoat brought the Boardâ€™s attention to breaches of the Width of Tires Act.  The almost daily habit of despatching overweight wagons from Burra to Silverton was destroying the roads.  Some weighed from 10-12 tons and left indentations in macadamised roads.  The surveyor was instructed to see that the stationmen put a stop to the practice.
