‘Returned Soldier’ writes expressing shock at moves to shift the Market Square guns.  He is amazed at the Mayor’s dismissal of the guns as looking like a scrap heap and also at Ct Harris who was such a patriot in the war years.  Mr Crewes would not have entertained such a move for a moment and it would be a breach of faith with the Defence Department.
