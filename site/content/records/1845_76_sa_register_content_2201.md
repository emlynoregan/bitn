Princess Royal Mine

The third half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held at their office in Rundle Street on 12 April.  John Grainger was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Mr Shepherd.

The original capital of the company was £14,800.  The proceeds and bills drawn against 397 tons of ore sold, shipped, or in course of shipment £3,857-7-0.  Fees, £43-10-0 and sundry creditors £183-16-3.  For a total of £18,881-13-3.  This is accounted for by £13,443-15-2 for land and preliminary expenses; cash etc in hand £534-17-3, working and establishment expenses, and materials £4,903-0-10.  Total £18,881-13-3.

The available assets include the balance as above of £534-17-3 and proceeds of intended drafts against shipments or returns expected £1,880.  Total £2,414-17-3.  The liabilities are only £510-13-6 and a clear balance of £1,904-3-9 may therefore by calculated on for the prosecution of the works, which had been satisfactorily reported of by Captain Bath. , subsequent to Captain Richard’s report dated 18 March 1847.

The directors have met with no satisfactory inducement to lease for pasturage the unoccupied portions of their 10,000 acres, but a proposal to rent a few acres for a market garden had been agreed to.  It was intimated that a similar proposal would be favourably entertained.

From Captain Richard’s report it appeared that two pitches upon tribute at Baxter’s Lode had averaged about 12 tons per month for the preceding 6 months at a tribute varying from £3 to £4 per ton.  In the same period about 16 tons had been raised from varying parts of the surface at a tribute of £4 per ton.  Many Captain would not pay such rates on tribute, but we regard it as proof of captain Richard’s discernment that he has held out to the working miner this inducement to become instrumental in the more extensive discoveries which undoubtedly must, sooner or later, reward the spirited proprietors of this fine property, and enable the Princess Royal Mine to rival its twin-sister the Burra Burra.
