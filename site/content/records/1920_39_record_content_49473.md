Burra District Band visited Waikerie on 27 January and on that evening played with the Waikerie Dance Orchestra at a dance.  On Sunday morning there was a joint practice with Waikerie Band and at 2.50 the two bands marched through the town and gave concerts on the bank of the river from 3-5 and from 5-8 p.m.  On Monday they visited the RSA Club, the Institute, the pumping station, distilleries, fruit-packing sheds, railway station, other sporting places and Mr Ekins’ drying sheds.  They then had lunch at Mr S. Rainey’s home.  Members were billeted by Waikerie bandsmen during their visit.  Waikerie Band is better equipped with a fine set of almost new silver instruments.  The band returned to Burra on Monday afternoon.
