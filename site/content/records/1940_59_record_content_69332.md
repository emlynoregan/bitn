Basketball

Burra Rovers v. Booborowie match was cancelled.

Terowie forfeited to Burra Comrades

Leighton drew with Spalding 4 each.

Leighton Hall is to get a new lighting plant.  In the last two years the interior of the main hall and the supper room have been replastered and painted and new guttering erected.  Exterior walls have been repaired and windows painted.  All this cost over £300.  Much had been raised by public subscription and the efforts of the Leighton Ladies’ Guild.  This left the hall with only a small overdraft.  Elected were: President, M. Carmody; Vice-President, C.A. McDonald and Secretary, T.B. Lynch.  Because of insufficient use the existing lighting plant, which used batteries, did not work satisfactorily and the batteries soon deteriorated.  It was decided to install a direct lighting plant that would not require batteries.
