A New Iron Ore Mine

It is quite likely that Royal Resources will develop a new iron ore mine situated some 80 km northeast of Peterborough and 40 km south of Yunta.  Investigations by the SA Government in the 1960s revealed the deposit, which was purchased by Royal Resources in 2009.  The prospect is for an open cut mine to win 500 million tons already defined, (with perhaps as much again to come) and a 30 year lifespan.  It is estimated that there would be 1,000 jobs in the construction phase and 400 in the operational phase.  It is not expected to be a fly-in fly-out mine and Peterborough is well placed to benefit from the development.  A Memorial of Understanding has been signed with key rail operators and Flinders Ports and a Native Title agreement signed with the traditional owners â€“ the Ngadjuri.  The decision to mine and initial construction is expected to be undertaken in the period 2013-15.
