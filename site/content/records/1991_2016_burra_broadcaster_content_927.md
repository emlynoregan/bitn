George Woods writes in response to the previous letters opposing the ‘Naked Revue’.  He thinks they were ‘over the top’.  He seeks to draw a distinction between pornography and erotic entertainment.

‘I personally have attended such shows where the audience was 400 male construction workers drinking alcohol and not misbehaving once.  To have uttered obscenities met instant retribution by other audience members & to have physically touched on of the “working girls” would have given you a one way ticket to outpatients.  One only generally heard comments relating to the performers skill, beauty, or athletic ability.’
