Burra Hospital Board, 9 November

A decision to make hospitals with fewer than 20 occupied beds only part-time training hospitals will be appealed with a request the limit be changed to allow hospitals with 15-20 beds to train over 5 years.  (Before the war 20-bed hospitals trained over 4 years.)

The Chief Secretary advises he sees no reason to allow an alteration to Rule 8 (Which provided for only one medical officer at the hospital.)

In the meantime both Dr Ashton & Dr Steele have taken up duties as medical officers from 1 November.  The chairman said he supposed one of them would have to take charge.  The decision was deferred in the hope that by then some modus vivendi would be arrived at.
