The editor draws attention to a Council decision last year to double the public liability insurance cover needed by local clubs and organisations undertaking activities requiring Council consent from 10 to 20 million dollars.  This will raise premiums by 50 to 80% and he questions the need for this ‘excessive knee-jerk reaction’.
