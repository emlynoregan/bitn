Obituary.  Mr W.F. Brown died on Monday morning leaving a young widow and six little children.  For years Mr Brown had been in bad health due to war disabilities, but so far the family has been unable to receive assistance from AIF Headquarters.  The local Sub-Branch of the RSL has established a Brown Relief Fund and calls for donations to be handed to Mr Ken Drew.  They will be acknowledged in these columns.

[The total to date was Â£13-17-6.]

[A notice on page 3 adds that he died at Burra Hospital aged 48.]

[William Francis Brown born 11 February 1888 Leasingham: died 8 November 1936 Burra.]
