An Ultralight Aircraft crashed at Burra Golf Club last Tuesday morning.  The pilot was a 54-year-old man from Gympie and formerly of Burra.  He badly injured some of his fingers, but luckily escaped other damage.  His wife was first on the scene and with Gold Club member David Robinson, helped him out of the harness and waited for the ambulance.  The couple were on the first leg of a trip around Australia and were in Burra to visit a brother and brother-in-law, Tony Gisi and family.  [2 photos.]
