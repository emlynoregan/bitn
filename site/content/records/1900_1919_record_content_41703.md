Loyal Aberdeen Lodge MUIOOF gave a social in honour of Ptes Hilary Fuss, Frank Tiver & Jack Ridgway, who have enlisted for the front.  Unfortunately only Pte Fuss was able to attend.  Bro. C. Fuss took the chair.  There was a large attendance with the Mayor, (Mr Crewes), Cr Radford, Cr McBride, Rev. J.C. Jennison, and Rev. J.H. Nield present.  The evening comprised songs, recitations, speeches and toasts.  There was a presentation of a handsome shaving outfit.  Details extend 1Â½ columns.
