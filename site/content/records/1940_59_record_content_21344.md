Anzac Day

On Wednesday last Burra citizens paid tribute to the men of Anzac.  Mr ‘Doxo’ Barratt of the Royal Exchange Hotel is one of very few left who were at the original landing.  He was the only original artillery observer left at the end and so could not be relieved until the evacuation.

Thirty years ago this story about him appeared in The Advertiser.

Pte B.A. Clarke of the 3rd Artillery Brigade writes from Gallipoli dated 3 August that he has just had a visit from ‘Doxo’, a well-known South Australian artillery lad, who has been stationed at ‘Lonesome Pine’ with a periscope, searching for targets and finding them too.  I’ll guarantee he can find more pet names for the Turks in one minute than any other man in the line could in a week.  His usefulness during a bomb attack is proverbial.  I’ve lit matches off his hair and the infantry are now in on the joke and lighting fuses of their bombs.  ‘Doxo’ accepted my invitation to stay to dinner and the topic of conversation turned to flies.  The persistence of the Turkish fly is remarkable.  You may think spreading a piece of bread and jam simple, but here it is a different matter.  First cut your bread and lay it on your knee.  Now get your tin in the left hand and a knife in your right.  By now the bread will look interesting, with flies six or eight deep around the crust.  Telling them to quit is a waste of time and pushing them off is a long job.  Take your bread and turn it over and over quickly until the pests are wondering which is the top, then out with your jam.  Once you have managed to spread it, get on the move and you’ll find walking up and down a great aid to digestion and between waving and walking you’ll get quite a lot of exercise.

After lunch I wandered into ‘Doxo’s’ digs: ‘through tunnels as dark as the inside of your pocket in a coal cellar.  That little trip out was fine; Turkish 75’s were scattering things a foot above your head, and an occasional bomb was thrown in to create a diversion, but in spite of these little kindly attentions I managed to get a good view of the decorations lining the walls of this funny old thoroughfare.  Ducking to avoid a ‘big one’ overhead I ran my head into a projection in the wall in the shape of a pair of boots with feet (or bones in them, and was informed that the owner, who still wore them, was a Turkish chap who had lost all interest in the Dardanelles question…All the way out the spectacle of arms, feet, &c., showing through the walls proved that quite a host had lost all interest in the proceedings.  This [joint of] ‘Doxo’s’ was by no means a drawing room and the air wasn’t exactly sweet…The next turn in the track brought me to the observation station.  I was quickly in possession of a periscope and dodging the dead hand which stuck out stiffly near my right ear I settled down to investigate.  The trenches here are only six or eight yards distant…It’s over four weeks ago since our lads took this position and on that occasion there was a good deal of damage on both sides.  There they are, still out there, just about sin-dried, a sprinkling of khaki mixed with the blue, shot-torn and riddled. Form after form shows up plainly in the mirror, pile after pile, mostly blue clad.  To bury them is an impossibility.  And in the heat of all the days – well - flies.’

[The article goes on the compare conditions on the western front, where troops can be withdrawn for rest and recreation, with the conditions at Gallipoli where for almost five months the Australians had held on under constant fire, without relief and catching snatches of sleep in spite of thundering artillery and bombardment.  It continues with reminiscences of home and an appeal for men at home to ‘Come out and help to see the game through and in after years call yourself a man and meet those questioning eyes without dread or fear.’]

[The article was published in The Advertiser of 18 October 1915, page 11.]
