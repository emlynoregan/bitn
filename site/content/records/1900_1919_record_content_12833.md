Accident.  A swagman, John Newton (35), injured his spine on Monday night when he jumped 16 or 17 feet from the Black Bridge.  He had intended to sleep under the bridge and thought the drop was only a few feet.  He was lucky to have missed the stones.  He is likely to be in hospital for a considerable time.
