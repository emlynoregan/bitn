Accidents on 18 Sept.

E.F. Opie was thrown from his horse and sprained a wrist.

J. Opie with the Waukaringa Mail lost a swingletree near the National Bank causing the leading horse to bolt. The coach ran into J.W. White's residence smashing the pole. There were no injuries.

Mr Rains galloped into a spring cart just north of White's residence and suffered bruising and a fractured leg. The horse was probably ruined and the cart damaged.

Mr J.F. Duff was driving a pair of horses when they bolted up Commercial St and were stopped eventually some way along the Sod Hut Road. He turned them, but they bolted again at the bridge in Commercial St and negotiated Market Square at a great rate before again being stopped without damage. The horse of F. Bromley, butcher, became unmanageable near the Aberdeen Hotel and ran into W.H. Martin's buggy, breaking the points off both shafts and slightly hurting his horse.
