Accident.  A car driven by Mr Walters, a Grand Lodge Officer and carrying his wife and Mr Ide, another Grand Lodge Officer, and his wife, overturned twice about five miles south of Burra en route to the town for the Masonic installation.  All were shaked and bruised and sustained some lacerations, but injuries were not very serious, although they required treatment at the Burra Hospital.  Mr Ide sustained a nasty cut to his head, but afterwards managed to attend the lodge meeting and assist in the Installation Ceremony.
