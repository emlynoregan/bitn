BCS.  Staff Profile: Mark Deamar

Born near London, but came to Australia with my family when 18 months old.  Attended Brighton H.S. and matriculated in 1979.  Went for a working holiday in England and got a job with a Building Society.  After a year returned to Australia to complete a B.A. at Adelaide University in French and German, and a Dip. Ed. at Adelaide College of Advanced Education.  Went to UK and taught French part-time at a small private school and took holiday work in an English language school for foreign students.  In 1985-86 worked as an English assistant teacher in West Germany.  Am teaching French at BCS and hope in the future to go to France as an assistant teacher.
