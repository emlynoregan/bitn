Darrell Kakoschke (2nd son of Beryl Kakoschke) was recently awarded a 40-year service award with Telstra.  He began in January 1961 as a telegram delivery boy at Burra P.O. â€“ working alternate nights on the manual switchboard in the telephone exchange.  In 1965 he began a 12-month Line Maintenance Training Course at Rostrevor, graduating in 1966 and then worked in the Mid North, the North and Northeast of the state.  In 1979 he was promoted to Line Supervisor at Kadina Regional Office and in 1982 joined Field Engineering Northern as Line Officer involved in planning an external plant in SA which covered all the state north of Adelaide.  He later saw optical cables laid, doing much of the planning for that.  The longest route he was involved on was Marla to Ayers Rock of 400 km.  Currently he is in charge of planning for all country SA from his office in Kadina.  Not many people these days can say they have worked for the same company for 40 years.
