Kingston St Bridge.  On Friday 6 August the beans were lifted into place to strengthen the bridge.  The contractors will now install bearings and pack and shim the existing beams over the next two weeks.  Once work is completed there will be a settling period for 30 days with a speed limit of 25 km/hr, after which the bridge will re-open with a 50 km/hr speed limit.
