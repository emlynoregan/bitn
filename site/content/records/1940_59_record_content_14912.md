Messrs W.A. Murray & James Craig became the first Councillors for Anne Ward on 24 March 1888.  The Council Chambers were not centrally located and in 1888 it was decided to build new ones north of the Booborowie Eating House.  Tenders were called and Sara & Dunstan’s tender was accepted on 4 August 1888 for £131-4-0.
