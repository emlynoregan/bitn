Jo Van Gasteren writes as Secretary of the Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club.

The club was the object of thieves over the weekend, losing over $3,000 worth of equipment including a ride-on mower and a new whipper-snipper.  The building was also subject to a graffiti attack.  This is a cretinous attack on a hard working group who have been ticking along now for nearly 19 years.  The club will regroup and struggle on.  The stuff taken will mean a few dollars to someone, but ‘a lot more to us as it was earned honestly through sheer bloody hard work and personal sacrifice.’  The club was not insured for theft.  We cannot manage the $2,000 a year that insurance would cost.  If you see one of our members clutching a book of raffle tickets in the near future please consider buying some to help the club get back on its feet, if you are able to.
