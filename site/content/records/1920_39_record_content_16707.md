Hanson Floral Fair on Saturday 29 August was held to raise funds towards the building of a Methodist Sunday school.  Mrs I.J. Warnes opened the fair.  Rev. Alvey said the proposed building was expected to cost £700 not including stone and sand which was being carted free of cost by members of the congregation.  Their own people had promised £200 and the object of this day was £100.  Late in the evening the amount to hand was £172 and a call to get it to £200 that night immediately brought in £20 and £3-3-0 came in later with supper takings to be added.

[A brief note on page 2 says that the nett result was eventually £245, including £25 from Mrs Thomas Rogers.]
