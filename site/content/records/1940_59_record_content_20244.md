LAC C.  (Charlie) Kellaway was given a farewell on 22 January.  The Mayor said he had hoped there would be no more farewells for servicemen, but they continued.  Speakers were Mayor T.H. Woollacott, M.T. Fuller (President of Burra RSL Branch), W. Carpenter, Mr Riggs (Secretary of the Welfare Committee) and Miss Sellars.

The Hallett Institute held its AGM on 20 January.  Great difficulty was experienced in getting a quorum for the meeting.  The overdraft stood at £600, which considering wartime conditions was deemed satisfactory – annual fetes etc. not being held to leave the field clear for patriotic bodies.

Burra Town Council, 21 January

The St Just Street ford is to be repaired.

Straying stock within the town was a nuisance.  Sheep, lambs and a donkey were causing problems.

It was decided to send a deputation to the Premier or Minister of Education urging the construction of a house for the headmaster of the High School.  The Department had owned a block of land in the town for some time, but no house had ever been erected.  It was also resolved at the same time to ask that accommodation be erected for railway employees at Burra North, some of whom were forced to live in Burra, due to the lack of accommodation nearer the railway station.

Local Board of Health

The Central Board of Health wrote asking what action had been taken to obviate the offensive odour from the Burra Bacon Factory refuse pit.  The Health Officer had reported on the matter and ordered improvements, failing which the factory and its pit should be closed.  The Mayor said the problem was difficult, as the factory was an asset to the town.  Cr Bevan and Cr Lee had inspected the soakage pit on the banks of the creek and a pool of black slime was being formed where water was soaking through the bank.  Cr Bevan agreed the factory premises were good, but that was no reason to allow water therefrom to run into the creek.

The present state of the drainage and septic system at the hospital was also quite unsatisfactory.

A special meeting with the Burra Bacon Factory proprietor and the Chairman of the Hospital Board has been arranged for 30 January.

Mrs E.R. Davey, sister of R.D. Pascoe of Burra, was 80 on 17 November and has resided in Broken Hill for many years.  She was born in Burra and married a Burra bootmaker, Mr Davey and left the town for Broken Hill 54 years ago.  Mr Davey died 45 years ago.  During the war she has knitted 123 pairs of socks for soldiers and is an active member of the Red Cross and the FFCF.

[Further details of her life are printed.]
