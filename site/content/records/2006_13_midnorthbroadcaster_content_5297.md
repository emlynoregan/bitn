Obituary.  Jessie May Rooke 30 September 1906 to 8 April 2008

‘Jessie May Rooke was born on September 30, 1906 to Elizabeth and Samuel Finch of World's End.  She grew up on the land and attended World's End School and Methodist Church.  She left school finishing her Primary education and gaining her QC at 14.  She worked on her parents' property and her life on the land was Jessie's greatest love, riding her horse (often bareback) over the hills mustering sheep, fencing etc.  As long as Jessie was outdoors she was happy.  She played tennis, joined the district's social activities; there were many social gatherings at the Burra Creek.  Jessie also loved dancing and would ride her horse to a friend's place, get in the dray and go to dances in the district.  On her return she would mount her horse and head for home.  In November of 1932 Jessie married Edmund Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church, Burra and honeymooned at Broken Hill.  On their return they settled on a property at Baldina east of Burra.  There she worked with her husband milking cows, farming and sheep work.  Ted died in 1962 and Jessie continued to live and work on her property with help when she needed it.  She was a very hard working determined woman, who would not let anything or anyone beat her.  Jessie's parents, Sam and Liz Finch returned to Burra.  With failing health, Jessie brought her parents to her home and cared for them.  Liz died in June 1961 aged 82.  With the help of friends, she cared for her father until he was hospitalised.  He died in 1963 aged 90.  With help Jessie continued working hard, loading bales of hay on her ute, feeding her sheep, checking her dams, windmills and fences almost daily.  Driving her ute around her paddocks was her great love.  Jessie would skin and cut up kangaroos to feed her dogs and cats, make a dog cake every week and feed her cats bread and milk.  She was always there to help out her neighbours.  The kettle was always on the boil and a meal on the table for all who called.  Jessie Rooke was a true, hard-working, honest and trusting woman of the land she loved so passionately.’
