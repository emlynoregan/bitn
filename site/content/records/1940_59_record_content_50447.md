Accident.  E.J. Lehmann’s passenger bus and a car collided opposite the Fire Station on Thursday night.  The bus was entering the Main Road from Mt Pleasant and was halfway across when struck by the car travelling north from Commercial Street.  The bus veered into the light pole at the Fire Station.  The car was driven by Norman Kakoschke of Burra North who sustained lacerations, as did a passenger Miss Fay Kakoschke.  Damage to the bus is estimated at £100 and to the 1939 Ford V-8 car at about £200.
