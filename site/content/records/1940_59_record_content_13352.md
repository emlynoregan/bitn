Cr Lee moved that the plaque be forwarded.

A public meeting about the plaque will now be called.

The Mayor indicated his willingness to stand again if it was the wish of ratepayers.

The other retiring Councillors are also willing to stand again.

Stan Kellaway Jnr was the only applicant for the Rangerâ€™s position and was subsequently appointed.

Willow trees will be planted along the Burra Creek towards Burra North and suitably protected.
