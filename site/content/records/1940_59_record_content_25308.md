Mr Con Samuel enlisted in the RAAF in 1942 and received his discharge last week.  Before the war he was the proprietor of one of Burraâ€™s betting shops and he has now obtained signatures on a petition to the Government to enable him to resume the provision of betting facilities in Burra.  The Betting Control Board will visit Burra and an inquiry will be held at a public meeting.  The final decision will lie with the Board.  Mr Samuel points out that all he is asking for is for his old business back again.
