S. Pearce moved the second motion ‘That this meeting protests most emphatically against the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands being held be a member of the Legislative Council.’  Seconded W.H. Hardy.

[There is no indication here of the motion’s fate, but the editorial tells us it was ‘carried amidst loud applause’.]
