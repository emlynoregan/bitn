Weather.  Christmas Day was mild, but in the late afternoon a huge rainstorm delivered up to 150 points in half an hour.  The run-off from Brewery Hill was particularly dramatic and washed rocks and considerable mud onto roads.  The area around the dugouts was flooded, including some houses.  Kerrigan’s received some damage.  Eudunda fared far worse with some people reporting falls of 5 to 6 inches.  Burra for all of 1999 recorded exactly 400 mm.  Since then summer has really arrived with the predicted maximum for today being 40°C.

Much flood damage occurred in the area around the dugouts.
