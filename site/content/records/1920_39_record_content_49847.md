The Youth Occupational Committee decided on 6 March that if sufficient youths were registered they would find instructors for vocational training classes.

Arrangements are in hand for the formation of classes in:

Carpentry 	Motor Mechanics	Book-keeping

Shorthand	The Merino Sheep	Farming

Wireless	First Aid

Attendance is free of charge to unemployed youths.  So far 15 boys have shown interest and it is hoped later to enrol unemployed girls and a meeting of ladies to consider the schemeâ€™s application to girls is called for 15 March.
