Don Lloyd and Claire Tiver write expressing their concern that the removal of large pepper trees (Schinus molle) across the district is ‘tearing a page from a history book’.  The pepper trees are believed to have grown from seeds introduced by Chilean muleteers carting copper to Port Wakefield in the mid 1850s.
