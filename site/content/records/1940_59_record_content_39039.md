Trunk Calls.  Burra has only two telephone booths; one at the Burra Post Office and the other at Burra North.  Neither can handle trunk calls without operator assistance.  The Town Council has asked for an automatic trunk call machine to be installed near the central position of the Burra District Council Chambers.  A similar booth would likely then be installed at Burra North.
