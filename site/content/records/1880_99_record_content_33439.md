Editorial on Assisted Immigration and Female Domestic Servants.  Also on the problems with female domestics due principally to:

‘mothers . . . seem quite unable to teach their girls household duties’

‘Parents do not teach their children domestic duties as formerly’

‘so many mistresses are entrusted with servants, who are utterly unfitted and incompetent to manage them.’
