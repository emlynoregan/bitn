Goyder Council’s public meetings on changes to their Development Plan in Hallett, Farrell Flat and Booborowie heard that locals want services maintained and growth to be encouraged.  Hallett might fare better as a ‘settlement zone’ rather than as a township.  Farrell Flat is growing and a separate Planning Amendment Report might be needed to acknowledge this change – it is presently classified as a ‘settlement’, but may in future need to be considered as a ‘town’.  Booborowie residents wanted the ability to attract industry and for rural subdivision rules to allow hobby farm type enterprises.  The Terowie meeting failed to attract anyone.
