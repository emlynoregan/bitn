Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute on Wednesday 20 December with Dr Brummitt in the chair.  It was a rather noisy meeting.

Mr Holder and W.R. Ridgway took seats as candidates for Mayor.

The Waterworks question was addressed first.

F.W. Holder:

He said as a result of a previous meeting a deputation they had waited on the Commissioner and had got the impression that some considerable concessions were possible.  Mr Holder had subsequent conversation with Mr Catt and at last the matter had gone to Cabinet.  Cabinet simply reasserted the old terms and there can be no appeal until Parliament reassembles in June next year.  The issue is what to do in the meantime.  He was much disappointed, especially with respect to the cost of the old works, which were not even in existence now.  Holder did not think accepting them now would prejudice any appeal, but he also did not have great hopes about the appeal, though he and Mr Rounsevell would work hard.

The Chairman thought if they took over they would have to pay the Government 5%, but if they did not the ratepayers would have to pay more than that to the Government.

P. Lane wanted to leave the matter to the Council, which would be better informed.

Cr Rabbich believed the cost of running the Waterworks would be c. £670 and the Government assessment [for water rates] was £1,000.  It would therefore save the town £300 or so a year by taking over.

W. Anderson 2nd Mr Lane’s proposal.

Cr Sampson expressed concern about the possible reopening of the mine and urged a deferral of any decision.

W. Geake moved an amendment to set up a committee including ratepayers and Councillors.  2nd by Mr Rayner.

The Chairman felt the Council should have a chance before such a committee or it would look like a want of confidence in them.

Mr Lane’s motion was carried.

The meeting then turned to consider the Mayoralty.

Holder said he had no ambitions of being Mayor and had signed a requisition calling on W.R. Ridgway to stand.  When he was approached to stand he had understood that Mr Ridgway was not coming out and so agreed to stand in the absence of any experienced candidate.  When he heard that Mr Ridgway was coming out he asked his proposers to allow him to withdraw, but they declined.  The one thing that had persuaded him to remain in the running was the extraordinary proceedings with the assessment appeals.

He felt that ‘it was not expedient at this crisis that one who had been associated in the matter should be placed at the head of municipal affairs, and that Mr Ridgway had thus forfeited his claim.’  (Cheers)

Cr Ridgway said that he was there as the result of a requisition signed by 81 ratepayers.  ‘He had seen many hanky-panky tricks, but this was the first time he had been opposed by a man who had signed his requisition. (Uproar)  It was quite unique’

Had Holder agreed to stand before Monday last he (Ridgway) would not be on the platform.  But he wanted now conciliation and construction ‘If elected he would get the business of the town done instead of indulging in outside twaddle.’

With respect to the assessments: ‘nothing could have been fairer. (Hisses and uproar)’.   The council had plenty of time to defend themselves and it was wise for them to have done as they did.  (Cries of no and uproar)

Mr Lane asked if Mr Ridgway were aware the assessment was illegal before he appealed to the Local Court.

He said he was not.  He thought a reduction was necessary all round.  Mr Holder did not think so, but only that some alteration should be made.

Ridgway said he had never made any threat with reference to the assessment.

‘Mr Lane proposed that Mr Holder was a fit and proper person to be Mayor of the town.  He had served the town well, he had never been a party to any clique, nor had he ever entered into any round robbinism or put the town to any expense . . . he remembered a time when a few ratepayers had joined together and put the town to a lot of expense through the same thing, he would ask any commonsense ratepayer was it fair.  He held that no other man had attempted to put the town to such expense as the man aspiring at present to the position of Mayor.’

Ridgway objected to Mr Lane going on in such a way.
