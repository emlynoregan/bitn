Bench of Magistrates, 30 April.

John Prosser appealed against the decision made in which he had been found in breach of a contract made with G.S. Walters, acting as manager and agent for the Patent Copper Co.

[The case is reported at length and depended on the validity or otherwise of two contracts; one made in England and one made on arrival in the colony.  The original decision had been that the contract made on arrival in SA was binding and the Bench upheld that decision.]

The Bench ruled that the contract made in the colony was valid and affirmed the conviction with costs.
