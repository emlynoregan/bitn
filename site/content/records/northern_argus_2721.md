Burra Swimming Pool Board of Management AGM was held last Thursday night.  Chairman John Barton reported on the year.  The committee had operated with a set Council budget of $7,000.  The 1986-87 summer had been unusually cold and gate takings for 92 days had been $3,534.40, while operating costs had been $3,754.49, to give a deficit of $217.08.  [The figures cited give a deficit of $220.09.]

For the coming season the pool had been re-painted at a cost of $3,500, so this financial year is expected to end with a deficit of c. $1,500 over the Council’s budgeted deficit of $7,000.  This sum will be drawn from the Swimming Pool Committee’s fund raising account.  Elected: Chairman, John Barton; Secretary, Jan. Jacka and Treasurer, John Brak.
