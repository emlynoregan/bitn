Mr Wiltshire has referred over 30 issues to both the Ombudsman and the Minister of Local Government over a two month period, involving significant staff time on almost a daily basis.  Council recognises its duty to respond to reasonable requests for information and clarification of issues placed before Council.  However, the number of requests and responses required is becoming unmanageable and is in danger of infringing on the ability to provide those services to the community required by the Local Government Act.  Most issues raised are either within the discretion of Council or are matters the Council considers to be entirely without foundation and which will be defended in court by Council if necessary.  Anyone interested in changing the Councilâ€™s direction should consider discussing issues with current elected members.
