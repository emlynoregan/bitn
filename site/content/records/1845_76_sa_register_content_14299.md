Kooringa News, 10 April

The forthcoming election promises to arouse more interest than the last one.  One of the candidates was rejected last year and the whole thing is a more local affair.

On Sunday last Mr Fulford began his ministry at St Mary’s Church.  There was a very full attendance in the morning and a more moderate number in the evening.

This week I was shown some very promising specimens of copper from the Coroona Mine, about 25 miles north of here.  I understand a prospectus is being published for the purposes of forming a larger company by the issue of shares on very liberal terms.
