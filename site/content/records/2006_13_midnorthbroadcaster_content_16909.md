Phoenix Copper has secured $1 million in additional funding to drill existing targets at the Burra project, seeking high-grade copper sulphides.  It will also aid the companyâ€™s Black Hill gold prospects in SA.

Drilling at the Eagle tenement of Burra North intercepted significant copper sulphide mineralisation in May 2012, including 26.3 m at 2.86% copper from 50.7 m, including 15.7 m at 4.65% copper.
