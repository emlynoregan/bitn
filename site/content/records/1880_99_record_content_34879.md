Literary Work in the 1889 paper.

Throughout the year the paper ran a serialised novel each week.

In X, 815, 4 January 1889 it was Pauline, beginning at Chapter XXVII

Pauline concluded in X, 824, 5 February 1889.

In X, 824, 5 February 1889 Mine is Thine began and it was still in progress at chapter LV in XI, 917, 31 Dec. 1889.

The characteristics of the 1889 paper are essentially unchanged from the previous year.  Though not of course acknowledged, it is clear that the leader writer was W.H. Hardy.  He has a rambling style, which often takes a long time to get to the point and he is politically and socially left wing in content matter.  His moral stand is interesting in that despite his political views he is often espousing quite conservative Christian stances on moral issues and yet he was a little later in his career accused of being an atheist: a charge which he did not deny.  He appears to consider Christâ€™s moral teachings to be the essential foundation of civilised life, even if he might not have accepted his divinity.  He was to become a frequent contributor to the Southern Cross, whose birth is noted in this year.

The paper was issued twice a week: on Tuesdays and Fridays.
