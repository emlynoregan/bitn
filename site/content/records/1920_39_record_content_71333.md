Obituary.  Major Lance Lewis died at midnight on 13 June at his residence ‘Benacre’ at Glen Osmond.  He was the youngest son of the late Hon. John Lewis & Mrs Lewis and was born at Kooringa in September 1885.  He attended Burra Public School before finishing at St Peter’s College Adelaide.  He was a superb horseman and when 12 or 13 rode to Victoria on his pony and brought back stock for his father.  At 16 he took a mob of sheep to Queensland.  He was intrepid without arrogance.  As a young man he was in the firm’s office in Burra where he was extremely popular.  He was a great sportsman and played for Kooringa Football Club and later for Norwood, returning on occasion to his old club.  He also excelled at polo.  As a member of the Light Horse he was among the first to enlist when the Great War broke out in 1914 and served with the 3rd Light Horse.  He landed at Gallipoli 17 days after Gaba Tepe was stormed.  Later he fought in Palestine and was severely wounded near Rafa when a bullet entered his right cheek and came out in his neck near the spine.  He recovered after a long convalescence.  His business ability was widely recognised in SA and he held many prominent positions including President of the Stockowners’ Association of SA, Chairman of the Sailors & Soldiers’ Distress Fund, and Manager & Director of Messrs Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd.  On Wednesday the cortege comprised over 136 cars and over 1,000 people attended the West terrace Crematorium.  On Thursday his ashes were placed in the family burial ground at Kooringa, where a large body of returned soldiers preceded mourners.  Over 400 floral tributes arrived by the midday train, notable among them one from the 3rd Light Horse Regiment.  Relatives present included the widow, her elder son and young daughter also brothers Dr Brook Lewis who flew in from WA and Mr Essington Lewis, Mrs A.J. Melrose (a sister) and other relatives.

[Lancelot Ashley Lewis born 25 September 1885 Kooringa: died 13 June 1938 Glen Osmond.]
