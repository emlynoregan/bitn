Burra Races were held on 1 & 2 January.  Since the Burra Mining Co. has fenced in a large paddock on the Copperhouse flat, it was necessary to move the racecourse a little distance to the southward to ground not so flat or as large as previously used.  The numbers attending were fewer than previous years.  This I attribute mainly to the loss of population since the last meeting.  [The races are then reported.]

With the exception of one or two bacchanalian brawls tolerably good order prevailed through both daysâ€™ proceedings.  No accident or misadventure marred the races.
