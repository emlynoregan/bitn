Mt Bryan Methodist Church.  About 12 months ago Mt Bryan people thought the Methodist Church was too far out of town – about two miles, so under Rev. F.W. Brasher a trust was formed to erect a church in the town.  Three months ago the tender of F. Pearce of Burra was accepted to erect an iron building lined with fibro-cement.  This was opened on Sunday 20 July when Rev. T.M. Flood preached two sermons.  On Wednesday 23 July a monster dinner was held in the District Hall with seats for 70.  Both events raised just over £19.  Dinner was followed by a public meeting and then supper.
