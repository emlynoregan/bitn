Burra Regional Art Gallery held its AGM recently at which Peter Harvey reported a successful year.

The gallery has mounted three special exhibitions during the year: the Art of the Flower, All that Jazz and the Archaeological Exhibition in conjunction with the Burra National Trust and the Flinders University.  There have also been exhibitions of works by Dennis Dale, Leonard Bence and Ruth Norris as well as by the Burra Quilters.  In attempting to show a wide representation of artists of the region we have displayed the works of 53 artists from the Adelaide Hills to the Flinders.  In 1999-2000 there were 6,217 visitors to the gallery plus 455 children.  The S.T. Gill interpretive project has begun with the help of former Burra Librarian/Historian Colin Fidock.  Four major exhibitions are scheduled for 2001: Flight, to complement the opening of the Sir Hubert Wilkins Museum; The Centenary of Federation Road-show; the S.T. Gill display and our annual Art of the Flower.  There will also be a full scale Burra Quilters Show and works of Gerry Wedd, photographs by Meredith Mayr and exhibitions by regional artists.  [Thanks to the hanging teams and officers of the gallery followed.]  Elected were: Chairman, Russell Skinner; Secretary, Helen Stockman; Treasurer, Bryan Dunnow and Assistant Secretary/Curator, Wendy Douglas.
