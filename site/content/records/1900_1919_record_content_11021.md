Obituary.  Charles Williams died on Monday morning aged 39.  He was the third son of the late Thomas Williams of Baldina and later of Broken Hill.  Death followed many months of problems from an internal complaint and was not unexpected.  [Charles Hammett Williams born 13 July 1865: died 16 August 1904.]
