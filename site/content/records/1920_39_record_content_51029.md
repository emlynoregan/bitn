Burra Town Council, 21 May

Advice was received that there would be no special grant for work on the Railway Station-Morgan District road.

The Town Clerk advised that the Unemployment Relief Council would permit the unexpended balance of their funds to be spent on this road if the Council matched it £ for £.

A refund cheque for £19-9-4 was received from the Fire Brigade Board.

The Central Board of Health advised that the Local Board already had a regulation that no meat could be sold in the Burra Corporation unless slaughtered in a slaughterhouse approved and licensed by the Local Board of Health.  This had been gazetted 15 years ago.

The Inspector said that unless action was soon taken the north wall of Victoria Park would come down.  An inspection would be made.

Football.  Booborowie 10.8 defeated Spalding 8.9.

Mayor T. Woollacott writes complaining of a lack of interest shown by parents and friends in the Empire Day gathering at the Primary and High Schools.
