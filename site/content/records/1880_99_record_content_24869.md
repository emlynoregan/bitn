Mr Jonathon Hosking has left Burra to establish a branch of his business at Broken Hill.  He will be missed as a tireless worker of the Wesleyan Church and Sunday School and other community activities.  Church members presented him with a three volume Life of Gladstone.  He was a supporter of the Institute and for two years the secretary and this year was President.  He was also secretary of the British & Foreign Bible Society.
