Township of Redruth

In consequence of the enormous prices to which the allotments were run up by the Burra Company in August, the sale of the town had not been completed.  It was again put up for auction on Wednesday last.  The Deputy Surveyor assisted by the Postmaster commenced the sale.  Because there had been little publicity, scarcely anyone attended and the bidding was low.  At noon the Postmaster had to attend the Magistrate’s Court and the auction was adjourned for an hour.  When it resumed the prices bore no comparison to those in August.  The highest price was £8.  The total amount was £377.  The total amount was £377, while at the first sale the total exceeded £5,000.  William Paxton was the greatest purchaser and in fact the only speculator who attended the sale.

[Note that this report is inconsistent with the report in the paper of 1 September 1849.  There it is stated that the SA Mining Association secured 77 and Mr Solomon got 15.  This left only 21.  If all 21 were offered at the second sale they could not have realised £377 if the top price was £8.  One, at least, of these reports is therefore unreliable.]
