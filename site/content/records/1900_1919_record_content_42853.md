Letter from ‘Loyalty’ who takes exception to remarks of two of the speakers farewelling volunteers on 24 July, one of whom said

‘There ought not to be one able-bodied man in the hall who had not volunteered.’

And another said ‘all those physically fit who do not go are called the cold foot brigade’.

But some must stay behind as indicated in a cutting from the Register of 22 July.

The point made there was that the biggest harvest yet in Australia is on the way and men are needed to gather it in and farmer numbers are so depleted.  Harvesting food for the nation is serving the country as faithfully as he who goes to the front.
