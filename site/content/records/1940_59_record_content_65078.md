Accident/Obituary.  Lawrence William Partridge of Burra aged 47 was killed in a fall from a horse at Canopus Station on 14 September.  Mr Partridge, who was employed as a station hand, went out on Tuesday afternoon to get in two horses, but failed to return.  The proprietor Mr Colin McClure and his wife were in Adelaide at the time and the only people at the homestead were Mr ‘Butch’ Batty (60) and Mrs J. Rowe Sen. (76).  Mr Batty began a search when night fell, but finding no trace had to give up for the night.  Next morning he found the horse in the horse paddock and the body within a quarter mile of the homestead and 150 yards from the staff quarters.  The deceased is believed to have died instantly.  As neither person at the homestead could operate the radio, Mr Batty rode 22 miles to Morgan Vale to send a message to Renmark Police.  Mr & Mrs Ross Mullins returned to Canopus from Morgan Vale.  Constables R. Maple and L. McEvoy from Renmark, with coroner Mr F.S.W. Trigg, visited the scene.  Death was due to a broken neck and an inquest was deemed unnecessary.  Burra RSL formed a guard of honour at the funeral on Friday afternoon.  The deceased leaves a widow and eight children: Keith, John, Barry, Raymond, Patricia, Roy, Vonnie and Dawn.

[Born 3 May 1908 Quorn: died 14 September 1954 Canopus Station, residence Burra.]
