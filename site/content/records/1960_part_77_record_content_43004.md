Burra Mine.

[E.C. Allen writes seeking to clarify the implications of the possible re-opening of the Burra Mine.]

Too many assumptions have been made by people not in possession of the facts.  On 10 January 1966 the then Minister of Mines Hon. S.C. Bevan MLC advised Mines Exploration Ltd of his acceptance of their proposal to explore the area.  Both the present and the previous Government have placed much emphasis on mineral exploration in SA to directly help state income.  Indicated reserves at Burra are 3.3 million tons of possible ore at an average 1.6% copper.  The problem of how much of this can be extracted is being investigated.  Consequently it is not yet possible to say how much the mine would be worth – a figure also affected by changing copper prices.  A rough estimate, however, suggests that 3.3 million tons yielding 1% copper at the present price of $1,000 per ton would realise $33 million.  Some 60-70 men would be directly employed with a payroll of about $5,000 per week or $260,000 per year.  As many local men as were available would be employed and housing would be built as needed – men would not live in caravans or units.  No homes would be affected by the possible open pits, the largest of which would finally be 1,100 feet x 750 ft and the smaller 800 ft x 300 ft, separated by some 300 ft and the deepest would be some 300 ft in depth.  Experience suggests the water table would not be affected except in the immediate mine area.  Ore would be treated to the concentration stage at Burra, as otherwise transportation cost would be prohibitive.  I asked a question in the House on 28 November to see if provision could be made when laying the natural gas pipeline through Gum Creek and Leighton areas, for a later connection to Burra.  Arrangements were completed some time ago with the Corporation to realign the fence in the Graves’ Shaft area to allow access to the shaft (the cost to be borne by Mines Exploration Ltd.) and this has been attended to.  It is expected the life of operations would be 10-15 years.  I have no doubt that both mining activities and tourist activities could work together.  The Department of Mines Exploration have expressed a keen desire to do everything possible to preserve the early relics of mining in this area and I have been given to understand they would be prepared to remove and re-erect any of the buildings considered to be of value.  I have supplied a map showing the extent of the proposed operations.

[Editor: the map will be displayed in the Record Office window.]
