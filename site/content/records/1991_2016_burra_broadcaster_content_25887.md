Hallett Power Station

AGL Group Manager Michael Fraser expects to have 90 megawatts of power available by December and a further 90 megawatts available for the start of February 2002.  It is intended to extend capacity to 250 megawatts in the future.  Over the next four weeks AGL will take delivery of 12 gas turbines, four transformers and other related equipment.  The turbines have been sourced from Chile, Spain, Italy and Finland and the transformers from Queensland.
