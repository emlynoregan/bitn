Cricket.  The club has found the cost of a new asphalt pitch will be £10 and will ask the Council to bear half the cost.  The club will accept the challenge from Clare for a game on 11 November.  It was resolved to co-operate with the Rifle Club to arrange a picnic and sports day to raise money for both clubs.  It was decided to hold last year’s trophies over for this year provided the donors are willing.
