Burra Hospital.  Specifications for the additions are on hand.  Some minor changes, sought by the Board, are to be discussed with the architect Mr Dean Berry and then tenders will be called.  The estimated cost is £25,000.  The Board has in hand £9,292 from donations and about £5,000 from the Gebhardt Bequest.  The Government has placed £10,000 on the estimates for the purpose.  The Board feels the most modern building possible is needed and this will increase costs considerably.
