Burra Town Council, 12 January

Council agreed to a request to burn off grass on the block next to the hospital – the Hospital being prepared to do up the tennis courts.

Mr Makin, Minister for Munitions, advises he is too busy to receive a deputation from Burra re a munitions factory in the town, but will note the offer.

An appeal for aluminium for the war effort will be made in the Record.

There was a complaint that stray sheep were damaging the Hospital Garden.  Owners to be advised; with a warning of possible impounding of the stock.

A.A. Davey, Burra Institute Librarian writes:

Despite considerable discussion concerning the takeover of the Institute by the Town Council, after a year’s talking we as just where we were twelve months ago.  Evidently the best solution is, as happened two years ago, when the Council declared a special 1d rate for the Institute.  This would enable the Institute to carry on until after the war.  Delving further into the matter while the war demands all our attention seems inappropriate.  For the past twelve months essential business has been transacted by the four remaining Trustees and myself.

[Mr Davey then goes on at some length about the problem of memberships in arrears and the costs of maintaining the reading room.]

I hope and trust that a management committee will be formed for 1942.
