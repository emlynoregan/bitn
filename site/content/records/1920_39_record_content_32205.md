Burra Benevolent Society has a shortage of funds needed for the unemployed here and elsewhere and for the approaching Christmas season.  It has been decided to ask hotel keepers to place boxes on their bars and on the counters of some of the leading businesses.  There will also be a Mayorâ€™s Fund appeal closer to Christmas.
