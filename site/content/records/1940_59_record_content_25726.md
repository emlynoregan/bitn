Mrs Max (Nell) Pearce is leaving Burra to live in Adelaide.  She was given a farewell at Pearce’s Building on Wednesday when the Mayor presided.  The Mayor said the Town Hall would have been more appropriate to farewell the town’s Queen of Song, who had always given of her best for church and patriotic concerts.

Mr George E. Dane spoke of the musical life of Burra and referred to Mrs Pearce’s role within that.  She had been Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance and had taken the lead in productions of Elijah and Messiah when she had an orchestra accompaniment of 42 instrumentalists.

Mr T. Fuller spoke for the RSL and hoped to see her back pretty often.
