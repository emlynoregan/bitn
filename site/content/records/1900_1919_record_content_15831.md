Numbering of issues in 1905

Volume XV which started 7 December 1892 finally ended with issue number 683 of 5 July 1905.

The year began with Volume XV Number 658 on 4 January 1905

And continued to

Volume XV 683 on 5 July 1905.  Within this series number 668 was used twice.

Then

Volume VX began with Number 684 on 12 July 1905

And continued to Volume VX Number 707 on 20 December 1905

The type for 706 is jumbled so that it appears as 6 __ 70.

VX is of course not a proper Roman numeral and was presumably simply a mistake in setting XV.

The error was perpetuated till the end of 1910 when the paper reverted to Volume XV.
