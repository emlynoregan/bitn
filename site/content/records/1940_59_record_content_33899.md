Girl Guides

In 1937 twenty-three Girl Guides were enrolled in the 1st Burra Girl Guides.  Brownies came next and the local association formed a committee headed by Mrs John Barker.  The movement went well until lack of leaders forced a closure in 1943.  In the war years a Thrift Campaign was run by Mrs Barker and her band of workers.  The Guides can be re-formed again in Burra if mothers and daughters give support.  Mrs Lott is willing to act as Captain.  The Mayoress Mrs Jennison has called a meeting for 12 November at 3 p.m. in the RSL Hall.  Divisional Commissioner Miss Wien-Smith & Clare District Captain Miss Roberts will attend.
