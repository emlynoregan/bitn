I.J. Warnes welcomed the Minister.  He said he was most interested in Byles' Mine, being a director.  Last year they had spent about £4,000 and the mine had between 7,000 & 8,000ft of drives and a shaft over 200ft and had taken over 1,000oz of gold.  The mine had so far paid its way and they currently had c. £2,500 in the bank, 100oz at the battery and 100oz in the bank.  Assistance now to the men would help SA along.
