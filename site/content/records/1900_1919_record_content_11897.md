Haymaking.  Some very fair crops are being cut to the west of Burra, but to the east hardly six tons will be cut â€“ growth is so short and thin.

Things are better towards Robertstown and Eudunda, but are still on average poor.

Red rust has rendered many hundreds of acres in the district useless even for hay.

Conditions around Mt Bryan and Hallett are better.
