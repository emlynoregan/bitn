Mock Air Raid on Burra.  The mock air raid went very smoothly last Saturday and about two minutes after the all clear was sounded casualties began streaming into the First Aid Posts and Clearing Stations.  The telephone lines ran hot with orders for the Fire brigade to extinguish a fire at Sara & Co. at Burra North and for the Water Supply Department to repair a burst main.  There was an excellent response to appeals for cars as transports for the exercise.  Each post was visited for assessment and feedback.  The whole exercise was completed in just over an hour.

[An extensive list of participants and their roles is printed.]
