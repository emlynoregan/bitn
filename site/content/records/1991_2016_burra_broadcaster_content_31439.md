Nigel Winzar retired from Adchem after 28 years of service.  Twenty-five employees of Adchem attended a dinner celebrating his retirement on 28 May.  Nigel started work with Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers at Pt Lincoln in 1974 as Works Chemist.  He later became Production Superintendent of Fertilizers at Pt Adelaide.  In November 1983 he was appointed Technical (later Project) Superintendent.  This role involved technical support for the Burra operation as well as evaluation of Leigh Creek and Mt Gunson mining leases.  He visited Burra weekly at that time.  He was involved in the commissioning of the Mt Gunson plant in 1987 and moved to Burra full-time in November that year.  He later became Quality Assurance Manager with a leading role in establishing ISO 9002 accreditation for copper oxide production.  He has overseen the operation of the plant to record production levels over the last two years and has a reputation as a dedicated and loyal employee over 28 years with Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers, Adelaide Chemical Company and Adchem.
