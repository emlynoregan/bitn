SA Mining Association Meeting

Last Wednesday at 11 o’clock the adjourned meeting resumed at the Auction Mart Tavern in Hindley Street to receive the report of the Directors and of the Committee appointed to examine the Deed of Settlement and then to settle the said Deed.  Charles Beck as Chairman of Directors presided.

He said in almost all cases the Directors had adopted amendments proposed by the Committee.  He proposed the secretary then read the deed and that every clause not objected to or which was not proposed to be altered by the Committee or the Directors would be considered passed.

Clauses 1-30 were passed with but minor alterations.  Then came the controversial Clause 31 – referred to as the Voting Clause.

The Directors were opposed to the scale of voting proposed by the Committee, especially they were opposed to giving the vote to single shareholders and suggested that no shares fewer than three should be entitled to a vote and then holders of a greater number be entitled according to the proposed scale.

Mr M. Smith said if they denied the vote to a single share, then the deed would never be signed.

Mr Peacock said the single scrip holder was much over-rated.  He believed they only amounted to ten and their interests could not be considered to the detriment of larger holders.  There were many companies where voting was not given to a single share.

Dr Addison said the Sa Mining Assoc. was differently constituted compared with other companies and the increased value of the shares was an additional reason for not denying voting in respect of a single share – even worse if the shares rose, as they might, to £400 or £500.

G.M .Waterhouse supported a vote for the single shareholder.

Mr Stocks was inclined to support the Directors, but as the holder of several proxies that their scale would rule out, he had to vote against their position.

John Brown proposed a compromise, that the Directors’ scale be adopted, but that existing single shareholders retain the right to one vote.  This was eventually agreed to.

The scale adopted was:

3-5 inclusive	1 vote

6-10	2

11-15	3

16-20	4

21-25	5

26-30	6

31-35	7

36-40	8

41-45	9

46-50	10

51-60	11

61-70	12

71-80	13

81-90	14

91-100	15

Then 1 vote for every 25 shares beyond 100.

Present holders of 1 & 2 shares will have 1 vote.
