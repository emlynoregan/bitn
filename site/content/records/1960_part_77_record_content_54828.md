Football.  The Mid North Football League, after an association with the SA National Football Umpires Association for 22 out of 23 years of the associationâ€™s existence, will now affiliate with the SANFL and ask them to supply umpires.  This follows a special meeting at Saddleworth on 9 February.  [Circumstances have led to the SANFUA going into recess.]
