Letter.  Paul Wilson writes re the recent Goyder Council Rates Review Committee public meeting.  He says the meeting was well run, but he left feeling it was only a formality and that all the decisions had already been made.  He also felt that some Councillors had a very narrow view â€“ being only concerned with the betterment of their own area, without taking a whole region view.
