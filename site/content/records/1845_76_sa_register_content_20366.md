Kooringa News, 10 April

Flood.  On the night of the 5 & 6 April one of the largest floods know affected Aberdeen and Redruth.  It began raining at 11 p.m. Friday and continued for several hours.  The creek peaked at 6 a.m. with 15 inches of water in the White Hart Hotel and 2 feet in the Aberdeen Hotel.  In Richard Davey’s house it reached the window sills and was halfway up the windows in Fogg’s house.  Several other homes were flooded.  In the White Hart the walls of three rooms have collapsed and the cellar has fallen in, destroying a set of photographic instruments.  The household furniture is much damaged.  At the Aberdeen Hotel the cellar is much damaged and one of the side walls on the lower floor is badly damaged, as is the household furniture.  Mr West’s cellar in Redruth has fallen in and the foundations of the back kitchen sank.  The water rose higher than in previous floods because the natural watercourse has been filled in with sand from the Mine.  Those affected are talking of suing the Mining Company.  The water covered the new road opposite the hospital [i.e. Bleak House] as well as that leading to the new ford, the piles of which were entirely covered.

Many people have passed through en route to the Barrier Ranges.  All are well equipped with drays, provisions and tools.

The tributers at the mine are washing their ore and preparations are being made for an almost complete stoppage at the end of the month.  Wages have been reduced for the few remaining.
