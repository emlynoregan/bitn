The Burra History Group has recreated the Burra Cheer-Up Hall from WWI in the Mary Warnes Room at the Burra Town Hall.  The Burra branch of the Cheer-Up Society was the first country branch formed in May 1915.  Its main object was to see that no local volunteer left without a farewell social and a small gift.  Later they tried to ensure that none returned without a welcome at the station and a social in the Cheer-Up Hall.  Members also made socks, handkerchiefs, etc. for the front line and despatched special gifts for Christmas.  The group also supported the town’s other patriotic efforts.  Most of the 300 members were women, but there was also a small group of male members.  When the local brass band failed, due to enlistment in the war effort, the branch formed the Burra Cheer-Up Ladies’ Band.  This became famous throughout SA and visited a number of Country towns and Adelaide.  It was dissolved on the men’s return.  The Cheer-Up Society presented returned personnel with a medal at the Burra Institute on 29 October 1919.  [3 photos.]
