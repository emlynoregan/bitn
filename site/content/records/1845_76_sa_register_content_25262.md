Obituary and Inquest.

An inquest was held at the residence of Mr F. Wark of Apoinga on Thursday  evening 3 July to inquire into the death of James Stevens who was killed the previous day when a  field roller passed over him.

Francis Wark said:

Yesterday morning I told deceased to roll with three horses and sent Andrew Croker to see him properly started.  I went myself afterwards and accompanied him for a short time, leaving about 9 a.m.  Saw deceased walking behind the roller at 11.30 a.m.  Went into the house with Mr Earle and at about noon Andrew Croker came in and said Jim is killed.  Deceased was alive, but he died about 10 minutes later after I had sent for the doctor.  Believe the centre of the roller passed over him.  It would weigh quite a ton.  The reins were under the roller and under the deceasedâ€™s back.  The horses were perfectly quiet and I believe the deceased was competent to drive them.

Andrew Croker gave evidence of finding the deceased.  Agreed that the deceased was competent to drive the horses.  Added nothing of substance to the above.

A.W. Walls, a doctor, testified that death was caused by a fractured skull and confirmed that the marks on the body were consistent with a roller passing over him.

J.M. Lillecrap said deceased had been living with him for almost three years.  Thought he had a step-father somewhere and a brother and sister.  Said he was over eight years old when he came to live with me.  Latterly has been working with Mr Wark.    He was usually employed looking after cattle and driving horses.  Considered him quite capable of managing horses.  He had been driving horses for two years in the spring and at harvest.

The verdict was death by a roller accidentally passing over him and they considered him quite competent to drive the horses in the roller.

[There are a number of problems with tracing this death.  James Stephen is registered as dying aged 11 at Apoinga on 18 July 1873, and despite the date this seems likely to be the right person.  If so he may have been the son of a Prudence Budge and to have been born 20 July 1861 at Kooringa as James Peter Stevens; father William Peter Richards.  Prudence Budge had ten registered children in the Burra district, variously to William Peter Richards, John Symons, John Stephens and Henry Thomas.  She married the last named at the Wesleyan Parsonage Kooringa 1 December 1865 when she was 33 and he was 45.  She was then calling herself Prudence Stephens.  There is no record in SA of any previous marriage for Prudence Budge.  Prudence Thomas died 1 September 1870 at Kooringa aged 39.  This fits in with the statement that he had a stepfather and siblings, but no mention of a mother.]
