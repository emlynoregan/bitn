H.C. Atkins writes denying that at the opening of the Hanson Memorial Institute he referred to the prevalence of drink at Farrell’s Flat socials etc.  His remarks were general and not directed specifically at any one place.

The editor reports that several people have supported Mr Atkins version of the speech and he admits that the reported may have drawn an unwarranted conclusion knowing that Mr Atkins came from Farrell’s Flat.
