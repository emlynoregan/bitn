Burra Show Society

President Ian Slade thanks all for their support for this year’s show.  Entries were up in many sections, especially in flowers, cooking and produce.  The biggest disappointment was in the lack of machinery and vehicle displays – which will be an area to receive attention for next year.  This year Burra is hosting the final of the Northern Agricultural Show Societies Miss show Girl and the presentation of aggregate trophies for the 1991 show season on Saturday 16 November at Burra Town Hall.  It would be good to see as many Burra people as possible along to support our entrant Miss Cheree Thamm.
