Burra Town Council, 20 April

Donation of £1-1-0 to the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.

Donation of £5-5-0 to the Soldiers & Sailors’ Distress Fund.

Council discussed, on Cr Dow’s request, the circumstances of Licensed Victuallers who lost money when the Tramways Tourist Club visited on 27 March.  Allegedly the organisers had been told that Burra could not cater for 20 let alone 200 and so had told the picnickers to bring hampers.  The Mayor explained he had been informed 140-200 people would be visiting on 27 March.  He made arrangements for each hotel to cater for 30 people.  When arrangements had not been confirmed by Thursday morning he rang the office where a girl had told him 240 rather than 200 would be coming and he had done his best to distribute the surplus among hotels.  Nevertheless the visitors arrived with hampers.  He asked them to use the hampers for tea knowing what losses the hotels would incur.  They said arrangements had been made for tea at Clare – where apparently they were then unable to procure tea!

Cr Dow said it was all very unfortunate and though no blame attached to Burra the hotel-keepers suffered a loss and Burra got the name of being unable to provide for visitors.  A letter fully explaining the situation will be sent to the licensed victuallers.

A committee was formed to go over the tenders received to provide the Council with a truck.

A light is to be installed on the bridge opposite Mr Oates’s in Thames St.
