In these depressed times a number of men have been putting in a lot of time prospecting in likely spots.  One such was Mr George Morgan’s property and we understand that those prospecting these have at least struck a promising reef.  It was discovered in a broken ref of ironstone and quartz and the specimens shown in Burra on Monday showed unmistakable signs of good coarse gold.  The specks of gold were in many instances the size of a pin head, with some larger.  On Monday morning Messrs Byles Senior & Junior took a half kerosene tin of specimens to the city for assay.  We did not get to inspect them, but we understand it was a real ‘find’.  We are informed the prospect was found on a hill, most of which appears to be the same sort of formation.  There are two parties, both of whom have struck gold on adjacent claims.  Let us hope for the sake of the town and district that the find is a really big one.  One or two other claims have already been pegged out.
