Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward

[When Ian Auhl published Burra-Burra Reminiscences of the Burra Mine and Its Townships he said that despite widespread enquiry he had been unable to identify Elizabeth Ward.  An Elizabeth Ann Ward died 5 June 1952 aged 92.  She would thus have been born about 1860.  There is no certainty of her birth, but an Elizabeth Ann Ward was born 10 October 1861 at Clare to Richard and Elizabeth nee White and an R. Ward was living in Burra in 1876.  The evidence in the articles she wrote places her in school in Burra 1870-1874.  It seems likely that this is the person writing in 1936.]
