Mr Winnall said it was quite unreasonable to suggest a man possessing any grain of sense or self respect would carry on as the girl wished the court to believe.  He suggested there was some animosity between the parties and this was how the plaintiff aimed to get even with the defendant.  For this to happen in broad daylight among houses inhabited by people was beyond all probability.  The evidence was conflicting and unreliable.

Fred. Neydock was called and said he was not guilty.  He said he was outside looking for Bill Highet because they always went for a walk on Sundays.  He said his brother Paul was only about half a yard away and his sister Mary was also nearby.  As he was going inside he had heard Bevan call out, but had not seen him.

Paul Neydock confirmed this and said Fred didn’t do bad things.

Mrs Mary Mann, sister of the defendant gave similar evidence.

Mr Winnall said it was a case of trumpery altogether.

The court decided the evidence warranted conviction and though the highest penalty was £10, they would fine the defendant £1 + £1 court fees or in default 14 days.  The fine was paid.
