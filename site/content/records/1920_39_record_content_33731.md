J.H. Hogan raised the question of ‘The Guns’ now moved to either side of Lewis’s Bridge in the Council Gardens.  When they arrived he didn’t like them, but considering the fuss made to get them and with the passage of time he now felt their removal was symptomatic of how some folks treat the digger – pushed to one side.  He moved that the Council be asked to return them.  When they were moved it was done hurriedly and apparently on advice from the RSL, but actually only on the private views of a few members.

Mr Spencer mentioned the mortar first sent and how Mr Hughes had been prevailed upon to send the pair of larger guns.  Their subsequent treatment was a disgrace.

Mr Jennison moved an amendment that they be placed on either side of the entrance to the Institute where they would be enclosed.  The amendment was lost and the motion carried unanimously.
