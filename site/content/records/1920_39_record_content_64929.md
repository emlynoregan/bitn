Redruth Methodist Guild Strawberry Fete was held last Saturday at the Memorial Sunday School Hall.  Mrs J.G. Sara [1864-1959] opened the event.  She took the opportunity to reminisce about the history of the church as she could remember it:

My earliest memory was of a service held in a little building near Mr Herbert Cox’s, which seemed to be walled off with part of the wall built of burnt slag.  We entered from the east between this wall and the church and the door opened from the south.  The ceiling was papered in blue with stars.  Next, when nearly eight years old there was an Anniversary service in the Court House.  Mr A.H. Forder had trained the singers.  Mt next recollection is of the present church being built with the Sunday school on the end.  Mr John Roach was the Superintendent and John Dunstan the Secretary.  Mrs Chant is the only teacher I remember because she progressed with the students to the next class.  Later the wall between the Church and the Sunday school was removed and we had the church as it is now.

The first magic lantern that I ever saw was held over in the building now occupied by Mr Cecil Thamm, we had boards put along for seats and many had to stand.  It was arranged by Mr Fisher and others, in aid, I believe, of church funds.

After the wall between the Sunday school and the church was taken down the Sunday school was held in the German Church near the Court House and the adult classes came over to the church for lessons.  On the tea meeting days we had sports on the flat.  The older girls enjoyed archery with a big target and a bow and arrows.  The young men were always gallant and brought the arrows back to us.

[Some names of families of the time are listed.]

After the Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist and Bible Christian Churches joined together the Primitive Methodist Church was used as the Sunday school.  Later the Kindergarten and Primary Schools were started.  Miss Bentley had the Kindergarten in the old building recently demolished and Miss Hazel Bartholomaeus had the Primary, which was held in the front of the building that had been Mr A. Bartholomaeus’ store.  Mr M. Morton was Superintendent and Mr F.T. Sara was Secretary.

Mr James Reed, who had always been a worker for the young people had a vision and with the co-operation

Of others had the present beautiful Sunday school built.

In the evening a concert was held and was well attended.
