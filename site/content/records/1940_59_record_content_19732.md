The Pie Cart.  Red Cross Headquarters in Adelaide have asked to buy the pie cart and as its use there would be much greater the Burra RSL Wives, Red Cross, FFCF & Burra North Red Cross have agreed to sell.  It is expected the Burra North FFCF will also consent.  Consequently the familiar sight will vanish from the saleyards.  The ladies thank all their supporting customers, those who donated sheep and Mr Arnold Heinrich who conveyed the cart to and fro each month.
