The Mail.  At present mail from the north is carried past Burra and then returned four or five hours later by the morning train from Adelaide.  The mail should be sorted between Petersburg and Burra, which would give business time to respond to correspondence by the Broken Hill Express that night.  We hope for a change soon.
