‘Economist’ writes saying that at a certain Redruth church service recently he heard, in the shape of a religious announcement, that the Burra Literary Society would give a concert in the German Chapel on Wednesday evening next, 15 April and he thought what a wonderful thing it would be if the Dramatic Co. used this example to get publicity from the church and chapel and saved on advertising.

[The tone of this is a little uncertain, but I am sure the editor did not fail to note that the letter itself, which comes with much detail of both organisations’ events, is also 11 column-centimetres of free advertising, which may have led him and the reader to doubt the genuineness of the complaint being expressed.]
