Kooringa News, 29 January

An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms before Mr Marshall MacDermott SM on the fire at W.H. Stanbury’s store on 26 January with J. Winnall as foreman of the jury.

Charles Drew, storekeeper.  Was returning from Black Springs at c. 3.45 a.m. Tuesday morning in the company of Mr Drake and Howard.  We passed up the hill between the Bank and Mr Chappell’s.  Did not see the fire until we reached the gate into our yard.  As Mr Drake opened the gate I observed fire issue from Stanbury’s skylight and went to raise the alarm at Stanbury’s house. Mr Stanbury came out as I arrived.  I flung a bucket or two of water on the roof next to Stanbury’s house and then noticed the varnish and paint oozing out of the Bank’s windows.  In a moment or two they were ablaze.  Went round to the Bank and entered by the back door and was going upstairs when I met Mr Wilkinson.  Got a bucket of water and threw it on one of the windows.  The powder exploded while I was throwing water on the roof – not much of it judging from the explosion.

Henry Drake.  Saw the flames coming out of the building in one sheet.  Gave the alarm and ran to the Bank.  I also called Mr Chappell, Mr Dyer and the policeman.  Then went up the street giving the alarm as far as Mr Robert’s.  On returning I went up the hill by which time the roof was a mass of flames.  Went to the Bank and helped carry water upstairs.  Saw no sign of the fire until I was getting out of the cart about 100 yards away.  About 20 persons were present on my return.  The wind was blowing towards the creek and Dr Maurau’s.  The flame was six feet above the skylight.  The powder exploded while I was coming back – perhaps six minutes after I saw the fire.

Charles Bock.  At3.30 was in my yard and on going back to my house saw the glare of fire.  Crossed the road and ran up the hill.  Went to see where the fire was and discovered it was at Mr Stanbury’s store.  Went up the street rousing people and then returned and went up by the Bank.  Saw no one there and so returned and gave the alarm down the street.  In front of Mr Chappell’s I met Mr McKeevor the policeman.  I stayed till the fire was put out.  There was a crowd there when it was got under using the water from Mr Stanbury’s tank.  I was at work behind the store.  The first water cart came before daylight. I was not at the Bank, but saw water used from the Bank and also the little force pump at Mr Stanbury’s store.  The fire smouldered till 7 p.m.  When I left the roofs had fallen in.

John Peters.  Am a miner and was returning from the Mine soon after 3 a.m.  Passed in front of the store and saw no indication of fire or any smell of it.  There was a stiff breeze from the southwest.  Went home to my house near the new bridge.  After half an hour I heard a crash and in ten t fifteen minutes more my wife said she heard cries of murder and there were sounds of talking and running.  Went and saw Mr Stanbury’s store on fire.  Stayed till evening.  There were about 20 there when I arrived and the roof had fallen in.  When I got to the fire the surgery was just catching fire.  No one came with me [on my way home from the Mine], my mates went over the hill.

Francis Cook.  Live at Mr G. Bennet’s and was awakened between 3 and 4 by Miss Cox who called ‘Fire’.  Got dressed and went to the Bank and also went to the Police Station and gave the alarm.  Woke Mr Cowper, called Mrs Bennet.  It was then 3.45 a.m.  Called out the Champion, who was crossing the creek, to fetch the pump.  Before I got to the store there was an explosion and the shutters were blown out and the roof fell in.  Set the pump to work and used water from Stanbury’s tank.  Directed the water onto the wash house.  Mr Jones was pumping.  I helped them at the windows of the bank and afterwards at Dr Maurau’s.  At times there was plenty of water from the water cart.  The Burra fire engine [from the Mine] did not arrive until about 9 a.m.

Dr Maurau.  I reside at Kooringa on the north side of Mr Stanbury’s store.  On Tuesday morning the household was awakened between 3 and 4 by a loud noise.  I ran out the back and saw a large column of flame coming from one of Mr Stanbury’s roofs.  It was about six feet wide and 30 feet high and was roaring.  I ran through to the front and noticed the crates were not on fire.  I was at once satisfied that nothing could save Stanbury’s store.  I began clearing the surgery with a view to cutting it down.  I lost 15 minutes saving my books etc. from my house.  The surgery had ignited before I could cut it down – I believe from the crates in front.  I had extreme difficulty in preventing the roof of the dwelling house from catching fire.  I kept throwing water on it from my tank, which got the water back from my guttering.  It was just daylight when the danger to my roof passed.  Not more than twenty or thirty minutes had passed from first seeing the fire till then.  There is only a party wall between the surgery and the store and so the surgery might have caught fire from the store.  There were scores of men in front, but not one of them attempted to roll the crates away.  Always thought the premises to be dangerous.  The walls were of stone, but very rotten.  The shop and storehouse communicated by a door through the stone wall and also a door led to the dwelling house.  The roofs were of paling and the shop was ceiled in zinc.  The storeroom was not ceiled.

W.H. Stanbury.  Went to bed at 11 p.m.  I and a little girl were the last in the store.  We had a candle on the counter and I took it upstairs.  I did not remain in the store after closing, only to get the books and the candle.  Kerosene and oil were in the storehouse not in the store.  There were not more than three kegs of oil and two cases of kerosene – about 16 gallons.  There was less than 12 lb of powder.  There were no loose matches around and I am sure no sparks fell from the sperm candle.  I always take the books to the house at night.  The stock in the shop was c. £4,000 and in the storeroom about £2,000.  Am insured for £4,000.

John Kelly.  Am shopman for Mr Stanbury.  Left the store at 7.15.  There was then a candle on the counter.  All matches were in boxes and the goods were put away.  The fire was nearly out when I got there.  The stock at the time was the best we have had for a long time.

Margaret O’Brien.  Servant to Mr Stanbury.  The door of my bedroom goes into the store [room].  There is no other door into it.  I was not in the store that night.  It was either Mr or Mrs Stanbury that awakened me.  There was no light to be seen till I got out of the room to the kitchen.

The verdict was of accidental fire with no evidence as to its origin.  Besides the insurance on the stock, the buildings were insured in the South Australian for £550, but £100 of that was for the dwelling house so the loss to the office will be £450.
