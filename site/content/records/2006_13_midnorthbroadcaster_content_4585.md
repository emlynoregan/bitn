BCS students have organised a petition to the Goyder Council to open the Burra Pool in the holidays regardless of the weather.  Michael Fretwell of the Goyder Council admits the arrangements can be a bit confusing.  The pool is open in the day when the forecast temperature for Clare is 28°C or more and at night when the figure is 32°C or more.  The boys concerned think it is always hotter in Burra than in Clare.  The Council in December decided to be guided by the Burra Swimming Pool Management Committee, which so far has not met on the matter.  The pool costs $40 to $40 an hour to run, so getting people through the gate is necessary.

(Petition organised by Ricky McCreight, Zachery O’Brien, Codie Camac and Josh Angrave.)
