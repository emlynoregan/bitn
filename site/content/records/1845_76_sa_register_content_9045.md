Kooringa News

The town clock has been completed and does credit to Mr Johnston.  It is about 18 inches in diameter and at night is brilliantly illuminated.  It far exceeds the expectations of the most sanguine.

Yesterday Kooringa was graced with the appearance of Rounseville’s [sic: for Rounsevell’s] splendid turn-out of four greys in a handsome carriage.  In the carriage were seated Edward Stephens Esq., John Brown Esq. and some ladies, driven by Mr Rounseville.  People rushed to their doors to get a look at this gay equipage.

The reports of gold around about are numerous, but nothing has yet been confirmed that would induce a rush and the inhabitants are not disposed to believe all they hear.
