Ratepayers’ Action Group has called a public meeting in the Burra Town Hall at 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday 27 February to discuss rates and representation.  State MP for Stuart Dan van Holst Pellekaan has been invited to host the meeting.  Community representatives who were members of the Council’s Rate Review Committee were invited to attend and Councillors, but the latter have so far declined to do so.  One of the issues is the parity of rating for Burra and Eudunda ratepayers.  This has been mentioned in modelling a number of times, but there is no mention of it in the Rating Review Report.  The Council is going through the minimum public consultation required under the Local Government Act 1999.  RAG urges ratepayers to attend and also to write submissions on issues to Council by 3 p.m. 1 March.
