Booborowie DC.  A deputation of ratepayers on 16 February sought a solution to the problem of paying rates and suggested that by 1 March 25% or 50% be paid â€“ extremists wanted the Council to go into recess for 12 months.  The Council eventually decided to accept 50% payment by 1 March and the balance by 20 June.
