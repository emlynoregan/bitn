The serialised novel: Two Men & A Woman, came to a conclusion.

Ada Delroy’s Company drew a larger audience than any other travelling company has for a considerable time at the Institute on Monday evening and the crowd was kept in almost convulsive laughter from start to finish.  The show ran almost to 11 p.m.
