Burra Town Council, 2 May

The Road board agrees to lengthen the culvert in Morehead St, nearest the railway gate, by 15’, but it will not allow the culvert in Commercial St unless the street leading to it is paved.  [I thought they had asked for a culvert across Market St at the National Bank corner with Mt Pleasant Rd as the unpaved street in question, so is this reference to Commercial St an error, or is it a different request?  See IV, 144, 1 April 1881

Page 2, but see also Midland Road Board IV, 150, 13 May 1881 & Advt. IV, 151, 20 May 1881]

Dr Brummitt thought the alteration to his garden wall should only occur if the following conditions obtained:

If the footpath remained at its present level a step be allowed in the kerb.

The Council pay half the cost of rebuilding the wall on the new line - a foot lower and with iron palisading.

The work should include a verandah in front of the house.

Cr Lockyer said that point three at least was impossible.

Negotiations will resume when the path level is obtained.

Enoch Stephens wanted a small section of Fore St reopened, but the Mayor said it was useless for traffic and had been sold.

Cr Dunstan thought it should not have been closed as it could easily be made into the best access to the top of Redruth Hill.  Crs Dunstan and Rabbich will report on the possibility of repurchasing it.

Morehead St culvert will be extended another 9’ in addition to the length build by the Road Board.

Tenders are called for kerbing and pitch paving in Market Square opposite the Burra Hotel.

Plans will be presented next meeting for the footbridge in Chapel St.

W.F. Coglin led a deputation asking for the Council to approach SAMA for a piece of land to use as a recreation ground, near the Model School and not less than 300 yards by 350 yards.  The sporting clubs would fence it and plant it.  J. Roberts and J. Snell spoke in support of the petition.

Two letters complained of carelessness on the part of the sexton regarding a recent interment.

[Somewhat unclear references elsewhere suggest that the fault was probably in the width of the grave which created awkwardness at the funeral.]

[Here runs onto page 3]

Mr Pearse has completed the Market St road (constructed for £385), though not to the satisfaction of Council.  Traffic has caused some unevenness where there had been much filling.  Council required such places to be made good.  Mr Duffy, the Road Board Surveyor wanted it graded and then 6” of top metal added.  He regarded it as only having the bottom metal completed.  The contract was however, only for 4” of top metal and the Council would have to pay for the other 2”.  The Surveyor should not be too exacting as the Board was getting a road for nothing in place of a much neglected road.  Ordered that the contractor complete the road to Council’s satisfaction.

SAMA is to be approached re a recreation ground.
