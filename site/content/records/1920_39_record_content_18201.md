Annual Hospital Christmas Treat was organised for 23 December.  It began with a concert on the eastern side of the buildings to seek shelter from the cool conditions.  Supper followed and a cot presented by a number of visitors to ‘Back to Burra’ was handed over and presents distributed.  The Mayor said that the building of an isolation ward was in sight.  [A list of donors for the cot is printed.]  The evening was organised by Miss Sandland aided by Mrs M. Collins and Mrs W.J.C. Ewins.
