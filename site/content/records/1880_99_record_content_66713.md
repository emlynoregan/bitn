W.H. Hardy writes re the shows of copper east of Burra and immediately to the south and also of the gold to the north near Ulooloo.  He also writes of gold to the west around Watervale and Mintaro and of the Burra Slag Extraction Co.  It is to be hoped that all with money to invest will enable the mineral bearing country on all sides of Burra to be fairly tried.  Prospects are good and all that is needed ‘is pluck, enterprise, and a little capital’.
