Holder Memorial

Holder Garden in Chapel Street was the gathering place for about 40 guests for the official unveiling of interpretive panels outlining the significant achievements of the great nineteenth century Burra Resident, Sir Frederick Holder.  Arranged by The Burra History Group, the unveiling was officiated by Sir Frederickâ€™s great-grandson, Christopher Brooks.  He stressed the Burra connection, since his great-grandfather had married in Burra and had eight children born here.  The History Group President, Meredith Satchell was present and said Sir Frederick was a largely unsung hero of Burra.  He came to Burra in 1875 as the headmaster of the Kooringa Public School and in a few years was manager of a store, Burra Town Clerk, managing editor of The Burra Record, an active member of the Burra Parliamentary Club, member of the Burra Gun Club, Mayor of Burra, Captain of the SA Volunteer Force and a Councillor of the SA School of Mines and Industry.  He married a local girl, Julia Stephens and supported her in her temperance and anti-gambling campaigns.  The couple had eight children.  He was then elected to the SA Parliament as the local member, later becoming Treasurer and Premier, during which period he was a tireless proponent of Australian Federation.  He moved into Federal Parliament and became the first Speaker in the Commonwealth Parliament, a position he held until his death in 1909.
