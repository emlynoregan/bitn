Alf Bevan recently told a joke against himself.  He said that when aged about 16, he completed a lengthy working period at Netley Station some 70 miles out of Broken Hill.  He collected a substantial amount of pay and decided to make for Broken Hill.  It was suggested he take the stage coach, but fearful of bushrangers, he decided to walk, eventually arriving safely in Broken Hill with his money intact.  The stage coach also arrived without mishap.
