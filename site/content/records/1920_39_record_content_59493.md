Weather.  Between 4 and 11 January good rains fell to the east.  These rains were general and in some instances exceeded all records for January since 1890.  Their chief value was in being initially a heavy soaking fall, followed by continuous light rain, which soaked in to the ground.  This was followed by falls of a more tropical nature, much heavier in some places than in others.

On Wednesday for instance M.A. Radford at Canegrass received 200 points in 40 minutes.  At midday on Thursday World’s End received from 250 to 400 points and the biggest flood in memory.  N.H. Pearse of ‘The Gums’ was en route to Burra, but had to turn back.  Most wheat had been reaped, so little damage was done to crops, but gates and fences have been widely destroyed.

This week’s rainfall at World’s End amounted to 550 points.  Mr Len Gordon’s lagoon near S. Finch’s is a sheet of water extending to the main road to ‘The Gums.’  A ford at Klaebe’s corner about 13 miles from Burra, which was built by the late Tom McWaters and Richard Bruce, was thought to be impregnable, but was swept away.  At ‘The Gums’ Mr Pearse reports the 1890 record of 203 points for January has been replaced when he gauged 227 points up to 9 January.

The Burra Creek ran the biggest flood for years.  Two or three times last week Baldina, Deep and Pine creeks were in heavy flood and at one time Baldina Creek was flowing more than 4 ft deep over the ford.

On Friday morning a big flood came through Thistlebeds.  The flows down the creeks which empty out onto the Eastern Plains will be of great value to the various owners.  Collinsville watercourse, Ulooloo Creek and Newikie Creek all ran strongly and the mail has been unable to get through to Ketchowla.

Torrential rain has fallen at Mt Bryan East area, but with no mail getting through there are few figures to hand.  Some of the falls from 4-11 January: Sturt Vale 453, Oakbank 408, Canegrass 401, Quondong 250, Old Koomooloo 162, Balah 212, Braemar 223 and Ketchowla 220.

Burra has registered 207 for the week, but falls have been very localised.  While the post office recorded 75 F. Harris in Kooringa reported 51 and at Aberdeen J.G. Wardle recorded 161.

Hanson and Farrell Flat had heavy falls, but Gum Creek got nothing.

On Wednesday the Burra creek flowed strongly from local flooding, but it has received nothing from further north.
