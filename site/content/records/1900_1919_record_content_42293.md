Utica Copper Mine: inspected 19 May.  Six miles south east of Burra.

Recent work has been confined to the 100’ level of the underlie shaft.  31 feet in on the SW crosscut a winze in the lode has been sunk 17’, yielding about 4% copper.  The engine for pumping water out at this level makes it hot and unfit for men to work.  Nothing more will be done here till this improves.  A half mile east an underlie shaft is down 60’ in ore of 5% to 1% copper.  90’ east of this there is a shaft 65’ deep from former exploration some years ago and this will be further explored.
