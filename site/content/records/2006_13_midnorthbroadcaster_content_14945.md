St John’s Catholic Church at Terowie was damaged in a significant fire last week.  It is a privately owned building now.  The extent of damage is not known, but the fire burned through flooring in two places and came close to two LPG bottles, which could have exploded with disastrous consequences.  The structure was a Wesleyan Chapel for the 1870s and was rededicated as a Catholic Church in 1880.
