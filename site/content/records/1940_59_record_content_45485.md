Methodist Sunday School Picnic for the combined schools from Kooringa, Redruth, Hanson, Farrell Flat and Ironmine, was held at Gum Creek Station on Anzac Day.  It was the best picnic to date.  Apples were distributed on arrival.  Luncheon was given to the children on forms outside the shearersâ€™ quarters and adults had theirs inside, at tables.  Races and competitions occupied the afternoon.  [Results are printed.]  Ice cream was distributed and cool drinks were on sale.  Tea was served at 4.30 p.m. and a bag of sweets was given to each child for the homeward journey.
