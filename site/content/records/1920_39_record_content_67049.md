Mrs Isaac Warnes who was awarded an MBE in the Coronation Honours has been President of the CWA in SA since 1926.  Since then she estimates she has travelled 1-2,000 miles visiting CWA branches each year.  Shortly she intends to go to Central Australia and perhaps to Darwin.  The CWA now has 50 branches.  After her marriage she lived for 10 years on Old Koomooloo before moving to Leighton.  She was a delegate to the International Council of Women’s Conference in London in 1929 and to the first Conference of Rural Women of the World.  The news of the award lifted family spirits following the death of the fiancée of one of her sons who was to have married in June.
