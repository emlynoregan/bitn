Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward

The “Jiggers”

These were placed in the bed of the creek from the Mine Bridge to the Hotel on the side furthest from the road.  Water flowing from the upper part of the big creek and from the big wheel at the stamps was brought by channel and used for the washing of the ore.  These ‘Jiggers’ were constructed of two upright posts, about four feet high and four feet apart.  They were joined by another narrow plank.  At the batteries a cradle [which] was suspended by iron bands and fastened to a yoked handle was rocked or jigged by mine workers who stood on a plank just wide enough to hold both feet.  Grasping the big handle they jigged during the whole day.  Often have I watched them, and wondered why the men did not get giddy and slip off into space.  One little move to right or left would have upset the whole apple-cart.  It was a quaint sight to see them all at work.   When the ore had been sufficiently jigged it was emptied out of the cradles and placed for safety on the top of the bank until it could be taken away for further treatment.
