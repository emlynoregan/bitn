Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF

About two years ago Mr George Parks was elected secretary, treasurer and sick pay officer and all seems to have gone very well until just recently when a brother mentioned casually to a trustee that he had received his sick pay in cash, rather than as a cheque.  This led to an investigation and the trustees demanded to see the books and all documents.  This did not happen until compulsory measures were taken under the MUIOOF Act of 1874.  On examination it was found that the secretary had not banked or accounted for £22-11-0 taken at the last lodge meeting and a warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of embezzlement.  On Saturday he appeared before Mr P. Lane JP and was remanded to Tuesday on bail of two sureties of £150 and himself in £100.  On examining the office used for the lodge work between £20 and £30 was found and lodge cards were produced with the secretary’s signature, but without the amount received entered in the cashbook or ledger.  Mr W. Davey is doing an audit.

The accused is c. 33 and for a considerable time his father carried on the well-known business of Thomas Parks and several years ago it was transferred to his son George, who proved to be an industrious and energetic businessman.  In 1891 he was elected Councillor for East Ward, which position he has held ever since.  He was an active member of the Burra School Board of Advice and has been secretary to many sports clubs with his honesty never challenged.  In Lodge affairs he was trusted implicitly.  On Tuesday he was specifically charged with embezzling:

10/- received from H. Pinch

19/10 received from J. Snell on a/c Vouden

11/8 from L. Grow

11/8 from L. Grow on a/c C. Grow

The case was adjourned to 12 August.
