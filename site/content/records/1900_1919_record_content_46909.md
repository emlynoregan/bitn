Redruth Court, 7 June.

J. Duncan Kelly and Hector Bagg were each fined 5/- + 15/- costs for driving an unlit vehicle.

T.P. Halls Senior was charged by his wife Isabella Halls with acts of cruelty and improper relations with Mrs Evans, Dolly Churchman and other unknown women and with neglecting to provide maintenance from 9 April onwards.

Isabella Halls:

Before 9 April had been allowed £2 per week, but he then told me the two boys could keep me.  Have been married 32 years.  On 18 April said he would ‘make an Alf. Lyons [sic] job of the whole lot of you’.  [This is a reference to Alfred Lines, who in June 1885 shot his wife and her lover before shooting himself.]  Have seen him in the company of the women above and heard him with others unknown.  Am afraid he might shoot me.  About five weeks ago saw his bankbook – he had about £700 in the bank.  The house I live in is my own.  Would accept 30/- a week.  Four children from the marriage are still alive: the youngest is 19.  Defendant lives in another house, but comes to mine for dinner and tea.  He had been in mental hospital for six months.

S.L.G. Halls (Joe):

Joe gave evidence of his father’s behaviour with other women and of threatening him and his brother with a revolver.

T.P. Halls:

Said they had not lived happily for the last 16 years and had not got on well with the children since they grew up.  About 18 months ago my wife told me not to enter the house any more.  I have given Tom £200 and Joe £110 and handed over the cabs and business to them on condition they provide for their mother.  The houses belong to me and I am getting no rent.  Remember saying recently I paid Tom wages to drive the cab.  Never used the expression ‘Alf Lyons’ to my wife.  Had no improper relations with any of the women.  Brought home a water pistol: had no revolver.

The Bench decided that much of his behaviour was due to his being kicked by a horse about two years ago.  Cruelty was not proven, but the improper relations were circumstantially proved and sufficient to grant a separation.  Mrs Halls accepted an offer made by Halls as to assignment.

Bright & Bright sued T. Halls Senior for legal costs of £21-5-4, which arose out of a case that T. Halls Senior brought against T. Halls jnr for assault.  A dispute arose over which Mr Bright had been engaged – W.S. or T.R. – who had to come up from Adelaide.  Under all the circumstances the magistrate thought there should have been a written agreement and gave a verdict for £11-5-4 plus costs.
