During the last year the committee have established a juvenile library.  [Though actually they announced that at the previous AGM.]  They also conducted a class in conjunction with the St John’s Ambulance Assoc. that resulted in the awarding of 5 certificates.  They supported a Literary Association.  The attempted winter series of lectures failed with only one being delivered.  This was a very interesting talk by G.F. Dodwell on Astronomy.

The library now holds 3,816 volumes.  The committee intend issuing free scholarships for young people to use the library.

Subscribers at 31 December 1912:	25 double, 89 single for a total of 114, which is an increase of 19.

Daily reading room use averages 30.

During the year a new floor was put in the hall at a cost of £79-17-6.

An engine shed was erected to provide for moving pictures.  A ramp was constructed for the escape door.  Gas was extended to the side entrance and to the copper.

The Burra Literary Soc. Continued under Mr J. McLaren as President, but lack of attendance saw it close down.  [This coincided with the boom in skating.]

Mr Dane has started an orchestral class.

The committee lost one member of very long standing when Mr P. Lane died.

Elected were President, S.M. Lane; Vice-President, Mr [C.A.] Fuss; Treasurer, Mr Wilkinson; & Honorary Secretary, Mr Harcus.
