Burra Meals on Wheels began on 26 July with a meal of hot soup, rabbit pie with cabbage, carrot, potatoes and peas and a cold sweet.  Eleven people were served and in due course 13 will be.  Officers are: Chairman, Mrs L.M. Fyfe; Vice-Chairman, Mrs Ray Jennison; Secretary, Mr L. Packer & Treasurer, Mrs E. Clode.

Kapunda Musical Society’s production of The Mikado at the Burra Town Hall on Saturday is very enthusiastically reviewed, having ‘reached an enviable level of achievement’.  The Burra Swimming Pool Committee will benefit by c. $75.
