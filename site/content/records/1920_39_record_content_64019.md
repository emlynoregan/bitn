The Johnny Fortnights

These were small tradesmen who called at the houses regularly.  They carried tea, fancy and small mercery articles and visits were appreciated by the women, as it saved them the trouble of dressing up to go ‘up street’.  Among these were Messrs Harry Hicks, W. Dalston, I. Pressick, W. Betty and Jimmy.  Ah Jimmy was a merry soul; we always knew when he was about by the sounds of merriment going on, his broken English and funny remarks causing much laughter.  He often called at our shop for sugar to make ‘taffy’.  Yes he said ‘I always cally taffee when I go round with boxee.  Little children come to door I always give ’em taffy.  Mother say “Oh what a nice man.” Then they buy something Jimmy.’  He knew the tricks of the trade.

I once saw him in Lipsett’s shop trying on a variety of straw hats.  He was standing before a large looking glass and his ridiculous appearance as he stood surveying himself caused the attendants much laughter.  Little did Mister Lipsett’s customers guess those hats had been on Jimmy’s head.
