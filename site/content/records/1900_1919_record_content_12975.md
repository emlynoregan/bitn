Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  There is still no news about the sample sent to Wallaroo for treatment some time ago, but the directors are satisfied with the result and will shortly make more information available.  Mr Pryor says he knows nothing about his rumoured removal [as underground manager.]
