1929

E.A. Haese was Headmaster with Ruth Bachelor, Elizabeth Jones and Stella Parker.  The enrolment was 54.  The school was still being painted when the year began.  A professor deplored the waste of money in educating many in our schools and Dr Steele attacked him, saying that knowledge was power and while it might be dangerous to educate the masses, it was right to give the boys and girls every chance and this was a duty parents owed the child and the nation.
