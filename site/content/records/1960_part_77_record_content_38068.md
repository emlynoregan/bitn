Weather.  A severe thunderstorm with hail struck an area between Farrell Flat and Hanson at about 2 p.m. last Wednesday.  Hail as large as marbles fell and torrential rain for about 80 minutes with a total of about 320 points.  Homes were flooded at Farrell Flat.  The Burra Burra DC road gang was at work in the midst of it on the main road, which turned into a quagmire.  On the other side of Farrell Flat the road’s top metal was washed away, but six miles on, where a Clare Council gang was working only about 60 points fell.  The railway line was damaged and goods trains were delayed for some time.  Water ran into Porter’s Lagoon, which had been practically dry.  Water was a foot deep over the road at the Koonoona turn-off.  Fences were washed away in the vicinity.

At C.W. Neill’s property 150 points fell and on the section known as ‘Riggs’ half the area was too wet to inspect and the rest received almost nothing.  Piggott’s got an inch, but Ron Winders said he got nothing worth mentioning.  At Gum Creek Robert Neill was harrowing on Thursday morning with one section of paddock providing good working and the other two or three hundred yards away was too hard to work.  In all it did more harm than good except for the water catchment value.
