Burra Town Council, 22 May

The Swimming Pool Committee asks the Council to send two representatives to discuss plans and specifications now in hand.

The Mayor and Cr Robinson will try to see the Minister of Railways about the ballast quarry when they attend the opening of Parliament.

C.R. Bevan offers to repair the cemetery wall in payment of his rates.  Offer accepted.

Cr Lott felt the town had been stigmatised by not greeting the Waterworks Commission at the station and conveying them to the town.

The other Councillors seemed to consider this unnecessary.  The Mayor said they were paid for their work and Cr Terry said they might as well welcome the members of the Fire Brigade Board.

The Mayor reported the unanimous decision of the public meeting to change the names of the local post offices to Burra and North Burra.

Cr McWaters presented a petition of 130 signatures asking that Aberdeen Post Office be called North Burra.

Cr Robinson moved that steps be taken to so inform the Postmaster General.

Cr Lott wanted a poll of ratepayers on the issue on polling day, but found no seconder.

Cr Robinson’s motion was carried with only Cr Lott dissenting.

Council discussed and finally agreed to a request from the Institute Committee that part of the £60 granted by Council be used to remove the broken fence in front of the Institute and to plant more shrubs in the grounds and improve the front of the building.

Council discussed and decided to support the idea of state-wide legislation enforcing the closing of all SA shops on the same day under the Early Closing Act.

Thomas Henry Eustice of Hillmanville, Councillor for Waikerie DC was fined £20 plus £1-11-0 costs for failing to move stock the required distance of 5 miles per day on a TSR in the Hundred of King.  The Clerk of Waikerie DC had written saying the stock would be travelling from 23-30 January and Eustice was a genuine traveller.  On 1 March the Ranger interviewed Eustice just inside the Council boundary where he had been for about a week and he asked for an extension of time.  The Ranger said he had no power to grant extensions and he would have to do his distance.  He was later found at the same spot and again told to move on.  He said the stock were too weak to do the 5miles a day.  He stayed several more days.  He complained about the law and blamed the drought conditions around Morgan.  Mr Bednall for the Council said the defendant was doing just what he blamed others for: eating out the stock route to the disadvantage of local travellers.
