The German Chapel Fire.

The old German Chapel at the rear of the Court House Hotel was destroyed by fire last week.  The origin of the fire is a mystery.  No alarm was raised.  Mr C. Lowe was in the building the previous night cleaning the lamps and left c. 9 p.m.  At about 10 p.m. a light was seen in the building, but was assumed to be a meeting.  Even at 11 p.m. no one thought of a fire.  Later a resident found the fire and tried to extinguish it with buckets of water from the creek, giving up only after falling in.  Cpl Gibbons attended, but by then could only watch.  The greatest losers are the Oddfellows Lodge in Aberdeen, who held meetings there and who lost their regalia, records and dispensation boards etc.  The building was uninsured and no inquiry into the fire was held.  [See next issue for clarification of this last point.]  The Germans held monthly meetings in it, but another place will now have to be arranged.
