Accident.  On Friday, an accident at Deep Creek, five miles east of Burra, resulted in the death of 19 sheep, valued at Â£150.  Lance Cutten, driving The Eastern Mail Truck, did not see the sheep travelling through Deep Creek towards Burra, until it was too late to stop on the steep incline.  The sheep were the property of J.H. Fletcher of Pt Broughton and had been bought at Glenora Station.
