James Said writes a sarcastic letter praising Dr Cross and concluding –

‘As we wait for Dr Cross’ solutions to all the problems we suffer in this town we are all sure Dr Cross is a pro-active individual with a positive attitude, with a bright outlook for the town of Burra (which he seems to be concerned with) not just a disgruntled retiree.

Dr Cross mabe [sic] you could write positively for a change and surprize [sic] us all.’
