Seaside Trip.  The annual day at Semaphore on 25 February this year was in very good weather.  Some 500 joined the train at Burra where extra carriages were added.  When it left Manoora the total was about 740 plus infants.  The Mayor of Pt Adelaide W.G. Gibb greeted the train at Semaphore.  As usual at least half the travellers went into the city by the first train and after lunch many older folk went to the Botanic Gardens for the annual Burra reunion.  Others visited the races or went to Glenelg.  T.T. Shortridge (78) President of the Reunion greeted visitors at the gardens supported by Tom Nevin.  The Mayor attended.  About 100 people were disappointed at the station through not getting tickets in advance.
