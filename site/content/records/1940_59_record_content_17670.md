Local Board of Health

A recent meeting was concerned with bread deliveries and the dog nuisance.

The Mayor said other towns had deliveries and it did not seem right to see children carrying unwrapped bread home.  Others also thought it inflicted hardship on the elderly.  The bakers will be approached in the matter.

The dog nuisance was discussed and the Inspector said that all that could be done was to impound the dogs and if they were unclaimed they could be destroyed.  It was decided to give notice in the local press that the Dog Act would be enforced after 14 days.  [The notice appeared on 30 May.]
