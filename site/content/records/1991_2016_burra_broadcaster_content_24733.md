Burra Show Society had 19 at its AGM.  Attendance was slightly down at the 2000 show, but financially the society was sound. Elected were: President, Ron Shipard; Senior Vice-President, Teresa Earle; Junior Vice-President, Sharon O’Connor.  Ken Broad replaces Len Newcombe as Secretary.  Len has done a great job for three years, but he and his wife leave Burra soon for a home in Tasmania.
