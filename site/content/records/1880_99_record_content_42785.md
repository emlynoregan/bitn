Saltbush.  A scale insect is infesting the saltbush, so important in the eastern country for summer fodder.  Mr Johnson Carpenter has brought in a sample from Baldina.  The bug seems very like Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) which devastated the oranges in California till the ladybug (Vedalia cardinalis) was introduced.
