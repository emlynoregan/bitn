Signage Trouble.  A large sign more than three metres square was recently erected to encourage visitors to ‘Enjoy the Mining Heritage’ of Burra, featuring a large picture of Morphett’s Engine House.  It was erected on the roadside between Mt Bryan and Hallett, but unfortunately was located to attract the attention of north bound traffic.  It has since been correctly located.
