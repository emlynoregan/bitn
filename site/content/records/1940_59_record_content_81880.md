ETSA Takes Over Burra Electricity Supply

As from 1 July ETSA is supplying Burra’s electricity.  Trust workers have been erecting new lines and considerable rewiring and attention to meters is still required.  Rates are set out under Zone 5 of the Trust’s Tariff Schedules.  There will be a single meter domestic tariff.

The first 40 units per quarter at 12d per unit.

The next 90 units at 4.1d and then at 2.25d per unit.

Special night water heating rate is 1.16 d per unit.

[Commercial and Industrial rates are printed.]

After 34 years of operation the Burra Electric Supply Co. handed over to ETSA.  The local company was formed through the enterprise of several townsmen: Messrs E.W. Crewes, J. Reed, M. Collins, J. Gallagher, J.E.H. Winnall, W.H. Sandland and G.E. Dane.  Formation of the company was decided on at a meeting on 29 November 1922.  Directors were appointed at a meeting on 15 October 1923: Messrs J. Gallagher, E.W. Crewes, J. Reed, W.H. Sandland and M. Collins.  The company was then formed with an authorised capital of £12,000.  Power was switched on 27 March 1924.  The company maintained a service despite sometimes great difficulties and blackouts were rare.  Assets of approximately £25,000 were handed over today and the Burra Electric Supply Co. received only £10,000 for these assets. Power in Burra has not been cheap, but the shareholders did not greatly profit either.  Dividends were often omitted and never exceeded 5%.  Len Bourman joined the company as an engineer in 1925 and has since been responsible for keeping the wheels turning; being on call 24 hours a day as foreman.  The present Directors of the company are Messrs M.W. Bednall (Chairman), F.H. Reed, A. Dane and K.R. Crewes.
