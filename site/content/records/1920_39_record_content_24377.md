Mr Wilyliam Waymen Mosey [sic] aged 87 reminisces in about ¾ column.

[Mr William Wayman Mosey of Robertstown died 16 December 1927 aged 86.]

He was born in Scarborough UK and is still classing wool.  He came to SA aged 10 and started work at Tanunda as a shepherd for 2/6 a week with tucker.  (Seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year.)  Then he went minding cows at Pt Gawler for 7/- a week.  He later took the first draft of sheep to Koonoona – poor Merinos – today’s sheep are worth three times the small Merinos then, with their indifferent fleeces.  After three years there he took to bullock driving, carting wood for the Burra Mines and wool from the Burra District to Pt Wakefield.  He remembers in 1860 using a sickle and getting 4/- a day for scything 1 acre of hay.  He recalls when 12 or 14/- a week was good pay and shearers got 15/- to 20/- per 100 sheep and when best Merino wool got 6d a pound and wheat 1/6 a bushel.  Two years ago he got 32d a lb for wool, though that was inflated.
