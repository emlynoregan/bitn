Burra High School re-opened last week with an enrolment of 72, which is 7 fewer than for 1947.  The first year class however, is very large at 37.  The teaching staff is one less than last year.  Mr J. Deer BSc has replaced Mr Morely and Mr R. Walker has replaced Mr Thorne, but no Junior Teacher has been appointed.  Unfortunately there is no Leaving Class, since all successful Intermediate students have left to take up positions.
