Luck Dip Gift Shop & SA Lotteries Outlet will close on Saturday after more than 24 years.  Colleen Spackman and her sister Sandra Snook bought the shop in 1988.  Colleen has been the primary operator with Sandra having relocated to other places with family for work.  Sandra returned to the shop, when Colleen became ill, along with younger sister Keryl Maidment more recently.  Continuing health conditions have forced the sale.  Colleen says she is tired and needs a rest, after which she intends to travel.  She has plans to go to the Cowell Country Music Festival, to WA to visit another sister and to Darwin on The Ghan.  The SA Lotteries will continue to operate while the shop is refitted for the new Burra Chemmart.
