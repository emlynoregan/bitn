Frank Treloar: Looking Back, Continued.

Continuation of the story of the establishment of a sheep station in the far north of SA.

They eventually saw a tree some 500-600 yards away with some land around its base.  They went there, wading through water and mud up to 5ft deep with their belongings on their heads.  At the tree they could make a fire and have some tea.  At sundown it began to rain in torrents.  They retreated to a limb two feet above the ground and later had to go higher and eventually the water rose 4ft up the tree.  They were now reduced to 2lb flour and 4lb of sugar, 1lb tea and ½lb cheese, 2 tins of sardines, a tin of jam and 1lb of ships biscuit (wet).  The ration was set at 1 sardine and a tablespoon of ships biscuit three times a day.  On the evening of 17 January the water fell and in the morning some land appeared.  The horses were hobbled on a tableland surrounded by water.  There was a man with a horse nearby and for £5 he was induced to get their horses and force them to cross the creek where they were caught.  What could be recovered from the mud was recovered and a start was made for Dalhousie on 20 January.  At Sundown they reached Mr Cameron’s camp.  They had been flood-bound from 7 to 20 January 1876.

[Treloar then describes the setting up of the station and how Mr Deane returned south in 1878 leaving Arthur Treloar as manager and Walter Treloar, then 16, went up to join him.]

The seasons being good the first draft of cattle to be sent to market was despatched in 1881.  They walked to Farina, then by rail to Terowie and then walked to Adelaide.  They averaged £8-2-6 a head.  Seasons remained good till 1889, but prices of cattle fell and there was little profit.  Mr Treloar visited the station again in 1881. In 1886 Arthur married and took his wife north to the station.  After some two years they decided to move south.  Mrs Arthur and girlie were taken to Farina and Arthur returned to join Walter on the station, now in drought.

They searched for water to the west and southwest and eventually found some on Coongara Creek at Allemmba Waterhole.  On the way back Arthur fell very ill and only slowly recovered.

[The next section deals with moving the cattle to this water.]

The drought almost immediately broke.  Arthur wanted to move south, but the owners said if he did they wanted to sell out.  In the end Duncan & Treloar sold out to Arthur & Walter Treloar on terms favourable to each.  James Cowan bought Crown Point Station on the Finke River and was negotiating to buy Treloar’s Station when he was killed in a railway accident at Dry Creek.  They then sold to Melbourne people who made such a mess of it (or their manager did) that the Treloars had to resume the station because payments misfired.  Walter took over in a severe drought.  The cattle died and then the horses, and though the rains came the Treloar’s were ruined.  The Government gave no encouragement and they had to abandon the lease.  Two years later it was let, so Frank Treloar believes, for 42 years at 1/- per mile, though previously it had cost 2/6 a mile.
