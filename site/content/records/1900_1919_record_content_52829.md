E.J. Davey wrote concerning the Burra Hospital Meeting with the Premier.

He writes in response to Mr Winnall.

[Whose approach was quite legalistic and sounded like a defence presented in court.]

Mr Winnall said the public meeting decision was a result of misconception and lack of knowledge.  The Board at no time placed the facts before the public.  The public was fully convinced that the situation was intolerable.  The resolution passed almost unanimously and the petition received 400-500 signatures and as many more could have been easily obtained after that.  My letter was not a Foresters’ letter.  On 26 September a letter was sent to all Friendly Societies saying that on 25th a meeting of Court Unity discussed the hospital situation and the opinion of the Court was that something must be done to clear the atmosphere.  Enclosed are copies of the letters sent to Dr Ashton and received from him.  I ask that your Board of Management meet the Members of my Board in the Lodge Room at the Institute 2 October to discuss the matter with a view of laying something before a combined meeting of Lodges.

This conference was duly held with three delegates from each of the Friendly Societies and it was resolved to send a letter to the Chief Secretary pointing out the serious position in which the Lodges were placed by the disagreement between Dr Ashton and the Hospital Board.  The letter was written and signed by the Chairman & Secretary of each Lodge.

Mr Winnall is wrong in asserting it did not come from the whole of the Lodges.  ‘I grant Mr Winnall that he is a member of the Foresters’ Lodge and also a trustee, but I do not think he is as fully interested as he might be, otherwise we should see him at the meetings more often than once in six years.  When a full reply is received from the Chief Secretary a further combined meeting of all members concerned will be held.

Mr Winnall asserts the Hospital board is fully representative, but public opinion is otherwise.  If the Board would not accept the advice of the medical men, the Board are surely at fault.

The public feel that the only solution is for the Board to resign.  Having now had the facts placed before them from the inquiry of the 16th instant, I believe the public opinion is unchanged.

As for the letter drafted by Mr Hawkes: I believe he drafted it at the request of the Board, never having the intention of signing it himself and it expresses the views of the Board, not his own.  As for the appointment of Mr McBride: it was not Mr Hawkes who first objected.  The Record of 9 July 1916 shows it was Mr McLaren who suggested the Board respectfully protest the appointment and Mr Warnes 2nd.
