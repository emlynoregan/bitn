Burra Amateur Swimming Club

On Saturday there was a good turn out.  Though it was sunny it was cool, which kept all the females out of the water, but the male events in swimming and diving were well contested.  M.J. Tiddy gave diving exhibitions from the steep cliffs.  Much fun resulted from the duck hunt, the cork scramble and the balloon race.  Results are printed.
