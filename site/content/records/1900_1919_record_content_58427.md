Burra Institute AGM.

The balance sheet was signed by Mr Milner, but Mr McLaren, the second auditor, refused to do so because:

The librarian declined to give some information, specifically the names and addresses of G.E. Dane’s choral and orchestral classes and the number of books taken out by them.  Also the number of meetings and average attendance of the same and the names of those attending.

He was not satisfied that the method of paying in such members’ subscriptions and paying them out again to claim the Government subsidy would meet the Institute Association’s Commissioner of Audit.

When questioned, Mr McLaren said he had no other faults to find in the statement.

The President said Mr McLaren had exceeded his duty and should have signed and then asked for an explanation of these other matters.

Mr McLaren then signed with an endorsement protesting the procedures noted above.

[Apparently 98 subscriptions at 12/- were paid in and immediately the same amount was paid out to G.E. Dane.]

Mr Dane explained that he had run classes for many years, then the Government decided to subsidise classes run by Institutes, so his classes were brought under the Institute, then the Government decided not to subsidise classes and subsequently Mr Dane had suggested making members of classes members of the Institute.

Mr Winnall had acquiesced and the committee adopted the idea.

Mr Drew said that he and Mr McLaren (then President) and Mr Winnall had drawn up the scheme and he thought it ill-became anyone to challenge a scheme he had helped to set up.

[The discussion as reported then becomes too confusing for me to follow.]

Elected were	President	M. Pederson

Vice President	J. Drew

Treasurer	C.D. Wilkinson

Hon. Sec.	E.J. Harris
