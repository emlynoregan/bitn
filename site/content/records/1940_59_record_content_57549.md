Burra Primary School has an increased enrolment and an extra teacher, Miss Till, has been appointed.  The School Committee has been advised that nothing can be done to the classroom due for renovation until the 1953 estimates are out.  In the meantime the Committee is endeavouring to obtain the use of St Mary’s Parish Hall as a class-room.
