Burra Town Council, 3 September

A response was received about aeroplane landing requirements.  For lage planes a 660yard run in from all directions was needed.  For medium planes a 550 yard run in could be licensed and for light aircraft 440 yards would suffice.

The Town Clerk said the racecourse would not do for a big machine.

The Mayor said the ground could be used for other purposes also and he had an idea for a site.

The letter is to lie on the table for consideration.

Burra Football Assoc. advised that the account for water would be considered at the end of season meeting.

A Government communication said £300 was available for unemployment relief.  The whole had to be expended on labour with the Council to find materials and only men in receipt of Government relief were to be employed.  A special meeting of Council was called to consider this.

Unpaid rates stand at £61-7-9 and final notices have been sent.  It was resolved on the casting vote of the Mayor to send a further notice stating that if rates were not paid by the next Council meeting legal actions would be taken.

The Town Clerk reported that the Pt Pirie Relief Fund had reached over £32 plus clothing parcels.
