Steamtown Peterborough

The roundhouse at Peterborough suffered severe damage from a whirlwind on New Yearâ€™s Eve.  The wind blew the front off, so that the galvanised iron on the roof hinged back, flapping around and damaging the asbestos roofing over the back of the bays.  The stresses caused damaged other parts of the structure.  [Photograph and further details are printed.]
