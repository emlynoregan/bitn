Driver:

On 7 November was driving the ballast train from the station to the quarries and coming out of the station yard he saw two persons between the rails.  Tried to stop and blew the whistle, but did not get their attention.  Did not think they noticed the train till it was on the bridge.  He believed the vibration of the bridge attracted their attention, but it was too late.  A man called Gitsham was on the truck that struck Mrs Foy.
