Ally Fricker responds to Dudley Lehmann.  She points out that no one denied the benefits of electricity.  The question is how to generate it without destroying the planet and all methods have their impact.  Her view is that there is no way of doing this given our present way of using electricity and we need to turn to conserving energy and reducing demand.  Birds are killed by wind turbines, especially large birds of prey and not even the wind farm owners deny this.  At Woolnorth in Tasmania Roaring 40s employs a raptor expert to reduce eagle deaths, unfortunately without effect.  The blade tips can be moving at up to 320 km per hour.  The percussion effect caused by updraft and turbulence can crush internal organs of birds and bats.
