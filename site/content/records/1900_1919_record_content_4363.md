Burra Defence Rifle Club & Cricket Club’s combined picnic and sports began inauspiciously with drizzling rain till about 9 a.m. on Wednesday last, but then the sun came out and attendance was reasonable.  In the end a credit balance of £4 resulted.  The events were keenly contested.  The novelty bicycle race involved riding a lap, dismounting, running to the centre of the ring for an umbrella, then riding another ¼ mile, then a third lap pushing the bike backwards with both wheels on the ground and then a fourth lap ridden.  The Burra Band played during the day and cabs ran to and fro.  Results are printed.
