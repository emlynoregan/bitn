Hallett RSL.  On Friday 23 October the Governor, Sir Robert George, opened the new club rooms.  The building had been erected in 1879as the Hallett Institute and later (1928-52) was used as the Church of England.  In 1952 it was bought by the RSL for £1,250.  It has been converted into a very useful set of rooms, equipped with modern conveniences.  The main hall is spacious.  The work was done by voluntary effort.  The Governor and Lady George were the guests of Mr & Mrs Owen-Smyth of Ulooloo and were greeted by the Chairman of the District Council, Mr N.G. Tiver upon arrival at the rooms.  Mr J. Hooper, as President of Hallett RSL, outlined the history of the building and how it was transformed into RSL rooms.  [The report extends for c. 1¾ columns.]
