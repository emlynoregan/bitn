Mr J.P. Stow, our Stipendiary Magistrate, retires on 30 June 1904.  He presided at the Redruth Court for the last time on 20 June.  He arrived in SA in October 1837 and was educated by Mr David Wylie of Magill.  He became a farmer before going to the Victorian goldfields and returned to resume farming.  After about four years he became an auctioneer at Gawler and later at Adelaide.  About six years later he joined an expedition to the Northern Territory in the course of which, in the boat Forlorn Hope, he was with a party that followed the northern coast of WA for 2,000 to 3,000 miles.  In 1865 he joined the staff of the Advertiser and worked there for 20 years, the last five or six as editor.  In 1884 he was appointed as Stipendiary Magistrate of Naracoorte on the death of H.J. Smith SM.  When J.B. Scott SM at Mt Gambier died the two positions were merged and Mr Stow moved to Mt Gambier, but after some time he found the climate did not suit him and he applied for and was transferred to this district where he has served 14 years.  He is 74.  He has published a book: History of South Australia, its Productions and Natural Resources. [There is a copy of this in the Burra Community Library profusely illustrated with black and white etchings.]
