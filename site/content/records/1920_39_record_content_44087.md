Martin Pederson Sen. has news from his homeland, Denmark, that his brother Soren, who is a doctor of high repute, has been knighted by King Christian for distinguished service as a doctor and made a Knight of Dannebroge.  Mr Pederson recently spent a holiday with his brother in Denmark and is awaiting a letter from him.  His brother many years ago changed his name and is well known in Denmark as Dr Soren Krage, to distinguish himself from several other Dr Pedersons.
