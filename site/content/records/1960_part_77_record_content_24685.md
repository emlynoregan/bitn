Adelaide Wool Sales.  J.F. & D.H. Keane of Farrell Flat topped district prices at 70¾d.  Eastern Pastoral wool was fetching 64-66½d.  [Other local district prices are printed.]

St Mary’s.  At a Special Parish Eucharist on Sunday next the Lord Bishop’s Licence to act as a Lay-Reader will be given to:

Mr I.T. Allen of Burra

Mr D.R. Burge of Farrell Flat

Mr D.H. Campbell of Booborowie

Mr G.W. Dare of Mt Bryan.

Harold Raymond, the blind violinist, retired last year after years of raising funds through his Gloombusters Concerts.  A gigantic embezzlement of the institution’s funds, which led to the imprisonment of the offender, has caused him to come out of retirement and the Gloombusters will appear at Burra for 1965 on 3 June, at Spalding on 4 June and at Manoora on 5 June.
