Mr Charlesworth said that with the introduction of fees it had been feared that enrolments would fall, but 51 students had enrolled in February.  He stressed that no fees were charged for pupils under 14 years of age, not if parents could not afford to pay them and when they were charge it was according to the ability of parents to pay.  Despite removals and illness during the year the average attendance was c. 44.  There had been several staff changes.  In February Miss Parry took the place of Miss Coghlan and Miss Waterhouse had taken Miss Dunstan’s place in Domestic Arts.  In the May vacation Mr Haese had been transferred to Peterborough after being here since 1926.  Mr Charlesworth was his replacement.

This year two students sat for the Leaving and 5 for the Intermediate Exams, but of course the results are not yet known.  The Minister of Education Hon. S.W. Jefferies visited in July and he was pleased with what he saw.  An Old Scholars Assoc. was formed and a number of pleasant and profitable re-union functions had been held.  Electric light has recently been installed through the efforts of the High School Council.  Average attendances had been: 1931, 52.8; 1932, 46.3; 1933, 43.7 & 1934, 44.

Dr Steele said a few words as President of the High School Council urging people to keep their students at school and of the necessity of this if the school was to continue.  He favoured raising the school leaving age to 16.  The Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott was then called upon to make the presentations.
