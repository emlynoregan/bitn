Entertainments By the Celebrations Committee

On Tuesday afternoon a convoy of 39 vehicles took visitors on an inspection of the gardens in the Gardens Competition.

Mrs S. Sandland entertained some 300 visitors at a very dainty afternoon tea at ‘Heathmount’.

The convey then went to the opening of the Burra North Croquet Lawn, where the Mayoress declared the season open and Mrs J.G. Sara hit off the first ball.

On Friday morning about 30 of the visitors took the opportunity to inspect the Burra Hospital at the invitation of the Chairman of the Hospital Board, Mr E. Finch.

A move was then made to the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd, where Senior Director E.J. Pearce welcomed them.  Visitors then requested to visit some of the churches and groups then visited St Mary’s and the Burra and Burra North Methodist Churches.

Mr Jack Fisher then welcomed visitors to the Waterworks.

A visit to the residence of Mr W. Thomas followed, to see by what methods he has made so many cement garden ornaments to be sold for patriotic purposes during the war years.

Friday afternoon was set aside for Gossip Day and a Mock Court and many familiar faces were seen around the streets recalling old times.

The Committee wishes to thank all who made their vehicles available to transport visitors around on the occasions mentioned.
