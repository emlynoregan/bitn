Burra Town Council, 20 July

Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club was given permission to remove the shed only from the Kooringa Tennis Courts.

Burra Burra DC is to be advised of the Town Council’s intention to level a portion of the old cemetery and to be asked what assistance they would be prepared to give.

The men’s toilet block opposite the Town Hall is to be refaced with Besser Brick, new plastering where necessary and a new pan.
