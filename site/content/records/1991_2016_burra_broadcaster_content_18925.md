The Sporting Car Club of SA has organised a gathering of more than 50 Alvis cars in the Mid North next week.  They will range from four cylinder models of the 1920s to elegant post WWII models:

Monday 3 May		Mintaro & Martindale Hall

Tuesday 4 May		Bungaree Station & Geralka Rural Farm

Wednesday 5 May	Burra Highlights Tour

Thursday 6 May		A free day at Clare

Friday 7 May		Riverton and Auburn

Each morning will begin with an assembly of cars at Clare Oval.

The Alvis Company stopped making cars in the 1960s, but still produces vehicles for the British defence Forces.  It is estimated the tour will bring about 120 people to Burra.
