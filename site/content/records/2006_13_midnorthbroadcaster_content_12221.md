Tiny Hill (96) of Queen Street continues to be a keen bridge player.  She began playing Auction Bridge at evening at Burra School with her husband Johnny.  The group then progressed to Contract Bridge when Mrs Ashton went to Adelaide each week to learn and returned to teach them the art.  At the time there were three bridge tables regularly in use; now there is just one when friends gather on Monday afternoons.  Mrs Hill has been an inspiration to many new players over the years.
