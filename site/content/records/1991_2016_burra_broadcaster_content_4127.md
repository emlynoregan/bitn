Council Mergers

The report of the Structural Reform Task Force proposed last month that the number of Councils in SA be reduced from 118 to 74.  Local Government Association President Mr John Dyer said the Association welcomed the report cautiously.  Burra Council has made no decision concerning boundaries or amalgamations following the report.  District Clerk Steve Kerrigan said the Council wished to keep an open mind about future options.
