World’s End Methodist Church held its anniversary on 20 October.  Rev. W.G. Clarke officiated and there were large congregations.  The tea and public meeting were held on the following Wednesday and both were also crowded.  Proceeds will meet the £5-6-0 needed for building improvement and leave a surplus of £2-8-10.
