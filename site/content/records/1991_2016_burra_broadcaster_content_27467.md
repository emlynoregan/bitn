Fire.  A fire broke our in waste on the south side of Adchem’s property on Monday afternoon.  It raced past the town dump and burnt most of the way towards the ridge track through the mine site.  The wind direction increased the danger to the town centre, but with swift action it was extinguished before it reached the ridge top.
