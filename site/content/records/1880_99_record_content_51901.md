A voice: Who asked you? (Laughter)

He said he could tell some very funny incidents that occurred in Council in the last 12 months, but then decided not to and was then goaded into saying:

‘There were certain monies paid away that should never have been.  He would refer to one chief item which had been paid to the Record office (Laughter and dissent) – last year £42-11-9 went to the Record office. – He could make a saving of £100 at any rate – by amalgamation of offices.’

He said the price of water should be reduced or the scale re-arranged and some property values should be decreased – but not SAMA property.

Cr Harris is also to contest West Ward.

Cr Linkson will contest North Ward.

He thought the assessment was 30% too high.  He said Mr Davey received less than the Town Clerks elsewhere with less to do than him.  He would oppose any reduction in his salary.

Mr Cave would be a candidate again for auditor and with respect to W. Davey ‘Any proposal to reduce his salary could only come from an idiot and a man who knew nothing about business.  (Cheers)’
