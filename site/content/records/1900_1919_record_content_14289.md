Cemetery Flat.  There is a short article on old Cemetery Flat – in early days the home of many goats – today not one person in thirty has a goat – now the flat is fenced into paddocks – the portion of it on the right going to the cemetery is under crop to Mr George March.  The cemetery road has been put in repair and its course somewhat altered.
