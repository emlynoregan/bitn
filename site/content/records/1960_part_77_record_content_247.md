The Burra & District Swimming Pool will be officially opened on 30 January by Mr G. Stanley Hawker at 3 p.m.  Although the pool has been in use for twelve months the committee had many jobs to do to complete the surrounds and this has delayed the official opening.  A Grand Swimming Carnival will mark the event.
