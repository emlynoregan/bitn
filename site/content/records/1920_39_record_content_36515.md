Ayers School break-up was celebrated at Ironmine Memorial Hall on 18 December.  A fine gathering was held with Mr Roy Humphrys presiding.  Whooping cough has affected the schoolâ€™s performance this year, as it had others in the district.  There were 30 on the roll with an average attendance of 27.4.  Five children attended every day despite the whooping cough.  25 of 27 who sat for exams were promoted.  The students provided entertainment throughout the evening.  Jean Williams was Dux of the School.  Qualifying Certificates were awarded to Melva Callary, Freda Heinrich & Mervyn Humphrys.
