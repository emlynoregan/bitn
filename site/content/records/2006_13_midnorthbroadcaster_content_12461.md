Burra Hospital.  After a wait of more than 12 months, Country Health SA has granted Dr Lakman Fernando privileges to attend to accident and emergencies at Burra Hospital.  This applies to the end of June when CHSA will meet again to consider extending the term.  Dr Fernando says he has arranged for Dr Evinta Royce to come from overseas with full Australian certificates and once her working visa has been approved they will be able to provide 24-hour on call care.  This is expected to be in three to four weeks.  Dr Dharma Dissanayake is still awaiting CHSAâ€™s decision to reinstate her privileges at the hospital.
