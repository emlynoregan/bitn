Shoe Repairer needed in Burra.  Burra Traders feel it is necessary that an attempt be made to have a shoe repairer in Burra following the closure of the Shoe Repair Shop.  Mr P.J. Byrne of Byrneâ€™s Shoe Store has been approached to try to locate a suitable man and the RSL is also being contacted.  It is understood a rental house could be made available to a person prepared to act in this capacity.
