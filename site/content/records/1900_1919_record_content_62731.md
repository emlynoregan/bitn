Boy Scouts have continued to be active in patriotic work.  On 1 February the Boys’ Hall was opened by the Mayor and the Bazaar was opened by Mrs I.J. Warnes – proceeds were £46.

Navy Day was held for the third time in Burra on 5 November and about £350 was raised.

Burra Sporting & Athletic Club has continued to present a wallet with £5 to every local returned boy.

Burra Show on 22 October saw another record attendance and many felt it was the best ever.

Burra Cheer-up Society has been particularly active in welcoming returning soldiers both at the station and with socials and last month organised a banquet for them all at the Institute when a gold medal was presented to each as a small token for services rendered.

Last Monday it was decided to present £20 cash to each of 12 returned men who had lost a limb or been grievously wounded.

The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. has taken a very active part in all patriotic efforts and directs its attention especially to the needs of sick and wounded men.

Peace day on 19 July was celebrated in Burra with a grand procession and demonstration at Victoria Park where sports were held for the children and an appeal was made for funds for the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  The children filed past to make their donations and to receive a Peace Medal.  The total amount raised that day was c. £1,800.

A Peace Thanksgiving Service that was held on 6 July at the Institute was packed, many people standing.

The general account began the year in credit £17-17-7 and ends in debit £55-0-6.   Though some accounts are yet to be paid to affect the ward balances, all their accounts are in credit.
