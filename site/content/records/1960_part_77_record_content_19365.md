Burra War Memorial Oval Committee has sanctioned spending up to £250 for a bore to supply water to the oval.  The high cost of E & WS water has so far limited improvements to the oval.  The cost of reticulation etc. would be a later additional charge.  A.C. Thomas has offered either free boring for 25 ft of a rebate of £50 – the normal cost of drilling being £2 per foot, including casing.
