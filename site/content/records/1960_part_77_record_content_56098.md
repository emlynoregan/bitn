Anzac Day.  Burra’s Anzac March took place as scheduled on Sunday, but the weather was cold and windy and kept most people indoors.

Ashton’s Circus was prevented from erecting its big top for its show scheduled for last night and their vehicles had trouble negotiating the slippery surfaces of the old sale yards.  They had to resort to tractor assistance for some heavy vehicles.

The Burra Methodist Sunday School Picnic was cancelled due to the weather conditions.
