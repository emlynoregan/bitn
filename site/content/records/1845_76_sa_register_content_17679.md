Kooringa News, 21 July

Accident.  Samuel East who was driving a pair of whim horses yesterday at the Burra Mine found one of his trace-chains had got loose and caused one of the horses to fall.  As he stepped forward to unloose the other, the animal gave him a kick on the forehead, knocking him over and cutting the back of his head on stones lying about.  He was removed and attended to by the doctor.

Messrs Cressy & Ayers have been entertaining people here with their magnificent panorama.  The scenes shown so far have drawn full houses and loud praise.  A change of scene will take place for Friday and Saturday when startling events of the American [Civil] War will be placed before spectators.  The exhibition is well worth a visit and the distribution of free gifts amused the audience.

News suggest that mining prospects in the North do not look very promising and a great many bullocks are dying from pleuro-pneumonia, so that cartage is becoming difficult.
