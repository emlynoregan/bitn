State Election.

The remaining 300-400 postal and absentee votes cannot affect the outcome.

Mr A.D. McDonald (LCL)	1,965

Mr E.A. Bristow (ALP)	1,567

(In Burra itself Bristow won 319 to McDonald 260.)

In the Legislative Council the results so far:

McEwin (LCL)	931

Edmonds (LCL)	46

McQuoid (ALP)	121

Threadgold (ALP)	321

As it is expected that all McEwinâ€™s 2nd preferences will go to Mr Edmonds, it appears that the LCL will take both seats.
