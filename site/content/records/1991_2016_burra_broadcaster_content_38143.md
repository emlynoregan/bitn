The Burra Town Hall Committee & Burra History Group have organised a display of historic photographs in the Town Hall Supper Room this Saturday 10 December.  With mobile display boards as well as wall hangings there are over 90 photographs on show from private collections as well as the National Trust and the Community Library.  Nancy Pearce, whose family was among the townâ€™s pioneers, and who has loaned a number of the photographs, will open the event.  Copies of photographs will be available for sale.  The Town Hall Committee would like to have the Town Hall open daily for visitors and is calling for interested volunteers.
