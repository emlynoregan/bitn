New Road to Hanson.  Recently two surveyors visited the district and District Councillors hope this means an early start on the new road from Burra to Hanson.  The present road will be used as far as Mr Oscar Oatesâ€™ property and then land will be acquired to curve the road along the eastern side of the railway line and run it to Hanson. This will reduce the number of railway crossings and the also the distance between the two points.
