Mr Norman Ford has brought in another lot of rich specimens.  Previous samples had come from the south side of the creek and these come from the north side.  Pieces of gold as thick as a common pin were sticking out of the rock.  Unfortunately the seam is only about 2” wide.

Last Saturday the miners at Mongolata formed ‘The Mongolata Gold Prospectors’ Assoc.’.  A number of resolutions were passed to aid the cause and the Mayor will be asked to forward them to the local MPs.  J.E. Hogan was elected Chairman.  P. Borowski is Hon. Secretary and the committee comprises J. Kellaway, L. Kellaway, N. Ford & T. Brown.

A fine pocket of gold was taken from Byles’ Claim on Saturday with more on Monday & Tuesday.
