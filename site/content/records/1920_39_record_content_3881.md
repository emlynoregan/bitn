Lady & Miss Priscilla Weigall were indisposed and arranged to return to Adelaide on the afternoon train.  His Excellency and party however made a round of hurried visits to various institutions in the town.  First stop was the Girls’ Reformatory and then the State Primary and High Schools.  The Governor then visited the RSL sub-branch and was received by Dr Steele.  The Burra Hospital was next on the list and the party then proceeded to ‘Murlippa’ Koonoona before going on to Koonoona Head Station where they had lunch and were entertained by Mrs Hawkes.  His Excellency then returned to Burra in time for the afternoon train.  Unfortunately this change of plan meant abandoning the ride to Princess Royal and afternoon tea there by Mrs J. Tennant.  The Governor brought a cinema operator with him to record the event.
