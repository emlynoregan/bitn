Accident/Obituary.  A semi-trailer overturned five miles from Spalding on Thursday 21 March.  The deceased driver was Robert Albert Oakes (22), of Hutt Street, Adelaide.  He and his partner, Terrence David Ward (23) of the same address, had only acquired the semi-trailer the previous day and were taking a 10-ton load of groceries to Broken Hill.  Mr Ward received minor injuries, but Mr Oakes was thrown from the cabin and died from head injuries soon after the police arrived.
