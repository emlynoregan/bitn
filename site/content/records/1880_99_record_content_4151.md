Midland Road Board

The matter of the road past the Burra Institute was not gone into.

The Midland road Board has agreed to construct a culvert in Commercial St opposite Drew & Co.â€™s shops if the Town Council will keep the inlet free from silt.

[This appears to be the culvert under discussion in the last issue.  Apparently the Mt Pleasant water was to be taken under Commercial St to the creek behind the Commercial Hotel.  This decision of the Board would thus be a change to their original decision after further representation from the Council.]
