The SA Assoc. of Four Wheel Drive Clubs Inc. visited Burra at the weekend.  More than 50 vehicles and 120 members camped at the Burra Showgrounds.  This was part of an ‘all roads lead to Burra family fun weekend.’

Burra Cricket and Burra Golf Clubs catered for the visitors.  The club held its AGM on Saturday morning before a long lunch at the Burra creek reserve.  A quiz night aided the Royal Flying Doctor Service.  There was a tag-a-long tour through Caroona Creek and Mt Bryan East by the Range Rover Club.  The weekend was so successful the club has booked the showgrounds for next year.
