Goyder Council Elections

Voter packs will be posted between 20 and 24 October and voting papers must be returned by 5 p.m. Friday 7 November.

Burra Ward Candidates:

Adrian Gill (Gilly)

Aged 67 and have lived in Burra since 1977.  I run my own business as an electrical contractor and publican.  I have served as a Councillor for two years with the Burra Burra DC and then for 17 years with the Regional Council of Goyder.  I support progress and the establishment of businesses across the region.  Tourism in important, but industry is needed as well.

Jane Marie Kellock

I have been an active member of the Council of Goyder for the past four years and Deputy Mayor for the past three.  [Membership of committees is then listed.]  I am self-employed, owning a farm near Farrell Flat with husband Greg and we have four children.  Concerned to listen to the concerns of the community and to increase the services and efficiency of our region.

Helen Szuty

I believe Burra is a special place, not only for the people who live and work here, but for the many who visit.  I care about Burra, its people, community, environment and heritage and seek the opportunity to listen to you, represent you and advocate for you.  I have previous work experience in community service, advocacy, tourism and publishing.  I have been a spokesperson for the Group of Concerned Burra and District Residents and for the Ratepayersâ€™ Action Group and have been an Independent Member of the ACT Legislative Assembly.
