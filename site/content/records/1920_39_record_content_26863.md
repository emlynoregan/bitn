The cemetery bridge has been repaired.

Cr Pearce said the bridge near Mr Finchâ€™s past the cemetery was unsafe.

Cr Woollacott said in his opinion a single span concrete bridge would be the most effective and cheapest solution.  Measurements and estimates of cost will be obtained.

The Local Government Department will pay for one side if Council will pay for the other, of the cost of extending the tar on the sides of the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen.
