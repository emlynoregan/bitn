Burra Town Council, 2 February

Council will take no action on the Advertiser Swimming Campaign this season.  In previous years the swimming committee had done all it could to make the pool safe and to engage instructors, but the movement had finally languished for lack of funds.

The Relief Council has supplied the names of 30 men entitled to Christmas Relief.  Council was pleased the list was so much shorter than for 1934.  Moves will be made to get them working promptly.

No general work has yet been started on the enlargement of the town’s reservoir.  There were questions about the use of local labour, but in the absence of actual work there were no answers to the queries.

Kooringa Playground needed repairs.  There was a letter asking that the area be used instead for tennis courts.  There was a lengthy and at time heated debate on this and the Mayor and Cr Kellaway got quite agitated.

Cr Kellaway wanted the playground restored as part of the State Centenary beautification scheme.  Most of the other Councillors appear to have favoured the tennis court solution either in total or in part.  Cr Dow said that it ‘at present was only used as a lavatory’.

Cr Kellaway moved that £20 be spent to improve the playground.

Cr Jennison thought £20 was too much and if money were spent there ‘naturally the same would be expected for the Aberdeen ground’. 

[The report then appears to me to become confused because when the motion is put Cr Kellaway appears to be the only vote against.  I would have expected him to be the only one for!]

Cr Dow then initiated a discussion about people playing tennis on the Kooringa courts on Sunday and wondered why the Kooringa Club allowed this – those playing apparently not being members.

It was resolved to take steps to prevent Sunday play.

Mr H.W. Mumme asked Council to place a kerbing around the lawns he had established in front of the Burra Hotel.

While complimenting him of his good work, Council was not moved to comply.  The mayor feared the precedence it would set and there was also the fear that pedestrians might trip over the kerbing.

Eventually the matter lapsed.

There was also discussion about the care and maintenance of the Market Square garden.

E. Jettner writes a letter of some ¾ column on Foreign Traders.

‘A Tree Lover’ writes deploring the damage done to a lovely bushy mallee type tree near the Aberdeen swing bridge.  Apparently a hole was bored right through it to attach some sort of support for part of the bridge.
