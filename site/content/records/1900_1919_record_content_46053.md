The secretary asked for clarification of the closing statement, which referred to the consequences of this problem in Reice’s and similar cases.

An Acknowledgement has been received signed jointly by Drs Ashton & Williams:

‘Your notes of the 11th inst. have been received.’

The Board was indignant at what seems to have been a decision not to answer their request at all and were also annoyed and puzzled by Dr Williams’ signature, as the case referred to occurred before he was in town.
