Burra History Group meets monthly to research, record, promote and bring to prominence the history of the town and district.  Members share the results of their researches and there are occasional guest speakers intermixed with working bees on group projects.  The emphasis is on the collecting and collating of historical information and photographs for the period after the closure of the Mine in 1877, given that Ian Auhl focussed his extensive research on the mining period.  Resources are the materials in the History Room at the Burra Community Library, and original copies of the Burra Record held by the National Trust.  Eric Fuss is working on the huge task of summarising the 100 years of the Burra Record.  In five years he has summarised the paper from 1876 to 1943.  The period 1876 to 1910 has been typed up and is searchable on computer.  It runs to more than 2,000 A4 pages so far.  Meredith Satchell has been compiling a Burra Families Database for the last eight years.  This contains the birth, marriage and death information for more than 25,000 people with a Burra connection.  It is still very much a work in progress.  [Photo.]
