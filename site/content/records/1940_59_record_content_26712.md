Witness 7.  R. France

Was the officer in charge of the Burra North Police Station.

There were at least six bookmakers in Burra.

Most operated in hotels.

All but one hotel had a bookmaker attached to them.

It had proved impossible to detect them.

He thought a hotel would suffer in business without a bookmaker attached.

Illegal betting in the town was not noticeable except to punters.

Betting shops would not have much effect on hotels either way.

Betting shops would make it easier to control illegal betting since the legal bookmaker would be on the side of the police.
