BCS Principal Rob Night says the school should have about ten fewer students next year, but seems likely to maintain its funding in real terms.  It will also retain staffing and will add an extra $50,000 to enable the staffing of a sixth primary school class.  $50,000 will go towards information technology and $40,000 to site development. (Noise reduction and wall partitioning.)  $500,000 has been allocated by DECS for roof replacement, to be completed in two stages.  Air conditioning and heating will be improved.  $160,000 has been allocated to the redevelopment of the science labs, occupational health & safety etc. and c. $10,000 has been allocated for external painting.
