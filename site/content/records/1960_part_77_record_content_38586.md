The RSL held its AGM on Friday night.  Elected: President, Wilf Nankivell; Vice-Presidents, B.A. Riggs & T.R. Rogers; Treasurer, A. Wright; Secretary, Ben Kotz and Pension Officers H. Cornelius and B.A. Riggs.

The President reported on a successful year with better attendance.  The Anzac Day service was conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and was preceded by a march of ex-service personnel led by the Marananga Band.  Remembrance Day was also observed and badge days conducted for Legacy, Poppy Day and the Anzac Appeal.  With reduced income the Legacy Wards supported were reduced to one.  Four ex-servicemen of the club died during the year: S. Moore, Lindsay Hood, Horton Jennison and Roy Earle.  Three members left the district in Alick Ford, Jim Kelly & Vern Riggs.  A contingent from New Zealand was entertained at a Dinner Social in November when about 55 members attended.  The club rooms have been painted and a new iron façade placed on the verandah and a new fence erected.  The Pt Pirie Pipe Band will attend and lead the annual Anzac Parade this year.
