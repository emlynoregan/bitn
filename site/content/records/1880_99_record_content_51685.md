Rabbits & Lease Cancellations.

On 10 October a Government Circular threatened the cancellation of leases of landholders in the Hundreds of King, Rees and Tomkinson, who had not effectively eradicated rabbits.  A meeting was called at the Commercial Hotel in Kooringa last Friday, chaired by Mr T. Warnes.  Holders of 263,511 acres attended.

This was all very unfair and the bill before Parliament still had not got the erection of the Morgan to Winninnie [sic] [Presumably actually Winnininnie] vermin-proof fence included.  Landholders are to be responsible for vermin-proof fences around all permanent water supplies on their holdings, other than running streams, and such fences must be fitted with gates that are closed for seven months of the year.  W.P. Barker said the Government fence was essential: then effective control could be taken.

Mr Bald said the Government circular was an insult when Crown Lands were infested with millions of vermin.

The meeting called for the Government to take a fair share of the destruction of vermin on land adjoining those to whom notice had been given.
