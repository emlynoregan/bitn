Royal Adelaide Show Ram Sales

Fewer rams were sold this year and a number of vendors took more home than they had hoped.

Nevertheless prices were strong for the best lots.

Collinsville sold one ram for $68,000, another for $30,000 and a third for $20,000.

[Other prices are cited.]

Collinsvilleâ€™s on-property sale on Saturday drew a good crowd, but they proved very selective.
