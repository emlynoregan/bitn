Obituary.  Giles Miller of Hallett died on 17 February.  He was born in Hutt St Adelaide on 4 March 1842.  Shortly afterwards he came to Burra with his parents on a bullock dray.  When he was 7 his parents went to Mintaro and his father carted ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield, bringing flour back.  Later they moved to Blinman and Mr Miller carted ore from there to Pt Augusta.  At 24 he took land near Leighton and married Miss S.J. Place of Mintaro and they lived at Leighton some 36 years and raised a family there.  He also acquired land at Wonna.  He was a circuit steward and trustee for Leighton Methodist Church and a staunch supporter of Methodism.  For the last 29 years he has lived at Hallett in good health and mentally very sharp.  He leaves a family of three daughters and two sons: Mesdames G.E. McWaters (Guildford WA), J.H. McWaters (Wentworth NSW), D. Pryde (Spalding) and Messrs F.W. Miller (Hallett) & W.G. Miller (Hallett).  James Miller of Adelaide is a brother and Mesdames W. Rowe of South Broken Hill & Smelt of Mypolonga are sisters.  [Born 7 March 1842 Adelaide: died 17 February 1932 at Hallett.]
