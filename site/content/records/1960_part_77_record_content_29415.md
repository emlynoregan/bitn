Burra RSL was visited by State RSL President Mr Eastick on Friday night.  Mr Eastick came to answer questions and to see why the Burra Sub-Branch seemed to be in imminent danger of closing down.  After discussion a call was made for someone to nominate as President so a committee could be formed, but there was no response.  A second call for someone to come forward to try to form a committee also elicited no response.
