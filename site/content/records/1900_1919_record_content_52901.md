E.J. Harris had little to add.

Mr Kellaway questioned the paying of the curator 8 weeks full time while he was sick in May 1916, but Mr Crewes and other Councillors backed the proceeding, which they said had not been concealed, but overlooked.  All Councillors were in favour of a bridge at the Pig & Whistle when possible.
