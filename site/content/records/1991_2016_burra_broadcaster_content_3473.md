Supplement

Main Street Update

The object is to revitalise the town by providing what the community wants.  Initially funded by the State Government, it eventually becomes self-funding and has no ties to local government.  When community input and involvement comes together funding will be made available by the State Government and this must be used to employ a co-ordinator.  At the last public meeting thirty-seven people attended.  A motion was passed that each person would circulate ten questionnaires.  The response has so far been very positive. One question refers to the name ‘Main Street’ and asks what you would prefer to see it called.  Suggestions have been:

Burra Development Plan

Better Business Plan

Burra Alive

Burra Community Improvement Program

Make Burra Beautiful

If you would like to participate questionnaires are available from Stephen Angel (Décor Made Easy) and Richard Holbrook in the Antique Clock Work.
