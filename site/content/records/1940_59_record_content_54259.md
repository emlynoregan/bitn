Burra Town Council, 17 March

Council voted to support a deputation from the District Council to wait upon the Minister about the Adelaide Road.

The Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau advises that the conditions in his letter of 14 March 1951 concerning assistance for caravan parks still apply.

Transfer of Part allotment G from M.E. Watson to the Commonwealth is advised.  [Paxton Terrace.]

Lots 4 & 6 are transferred from SA Housing Trust to the Minister of Education.  [Presumably the new allotments in the Housing Trust development in Chapel St.  Lot 6 is on the corner of Stock and Chapel Streets and lot 4 is the next north but one.]

It was moved that consideration of an agreement with the Burra Electric Supply Co. be deferred pending a reply from G.S. Hawker MP, [concerning ETSAâ€™s position] but an amendment resulted in the Council seeking prices for street lighting if the agreement were to be extended.
