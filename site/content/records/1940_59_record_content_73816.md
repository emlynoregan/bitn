Phil Rule writes in response to a question of whether Hallett’s 12 goals in the first quarter against Booborowie is a record.  He says it is not: he recalls a match when South Booborowie kicked 13.6 to almost nothing by his old team of Aberdeen.  Much of the damage was done by Frank ‘Splinter’ Byles, who about that time won the Warracknabeal Gift and could make a swift dash from centre and nearly land the ball in the goal square, even if not scoring the goal himself.
