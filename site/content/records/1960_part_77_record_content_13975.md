Redruth Methodist Ladies Guild held its Annual Fete, this time in the theme of a ‘Fan’ Fair on 24 November in Redruth Memorial Hall.  It raised a nett £260. [Details in c. 1 column.]

The Governor’s Visit.  Photos are printed of Sir Edric Bastyan and Mr S. Woollacott and of Sir Edric Bastyan and a group at the Burra Mine.

Fuel Prices have fallen by ½d a gallon at Burra from 26 November.

At Burra Standard petrol is now 3/6 a gallon and premium is 3/10½ a gallon.

Burra High School.  Another £4,000 bus has come into use for the Hanson run.  Illness has prevented Mr L. Carthew, a former headmaster, from speaking on speech night on 29 November, but Dr Steele has consented to fill in.

Burra Pictures have been running at a loss of £4 to £5 a night on Wednesdays with patronage as low as 25-30 people.  If these figures do not improve with the warmer weather Wednesday screening will have to cease.
