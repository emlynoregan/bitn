A few smaller advertisements, sales and public notices, but not as many as in earlier years.  News begins early on the page, but is heavily mixed with news-like advertisements for things like toilet soap, or haemorrhoid cream.  A column by ‘Eyespy’ of passing events concentrated largely on events from beyond the local area.
