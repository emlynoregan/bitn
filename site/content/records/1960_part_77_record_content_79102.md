The main school building has been painted and so has the Home Economics room.

The Minister of Education, Dr Don Hopgood has announced that the building program will begin in July.

$20,000 contributed in two parts; $10,000 from the Burra Burra DC and $10,000 from the School Council will enable a full sized hall to be included in the program.  Plans for the building (as revised) are on display in the foyer of the school.

A Men’s Fitness Course will begin soon and the typing class begins on Thursday 3 June at 7.30 p.m.

Community Programs are being organised and input is requested so that they end up providing what is really wanted.  Two groups will receive suggestions and contribute to the organisation; The Community Advisory Agents and the Management Committee.  [Members are listed.]

The Burra Inter-Church Council has arranged a special Ecumenical Service for Friday night in St Mary’s to mark the Week of Christian Unity.  For the first time the Lutherans will be represented along with members of the Methodist, Anglican and catholic congregations.  The first meeting of the Inter-Church Council was at St Joseph’s Hall last Wednesday.  Elected: President, Roger Schwarz; Joint Secretaries, Rosemary Quinn & Jan Cockingham and Publicity Officer, Mary Woollacott.

The Council aims to promote shared worship, prayer, action and discussion among the churches and Christians of Burra.
