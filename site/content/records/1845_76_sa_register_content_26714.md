SA Mining Association.  Burra Mine.

The latest half-yearly report shows that in the six months to 30 September 922 tons of 24¾% copper ore have been raised.  The net profit has been £2,990-16-11.  The Directors state that after making provision for all outgoings, including the expenditure of upwards of £3,000 incurred during the last half-year in works connected with the future development of the mines in depth, there is a total profit remaining of £13,870-17-2.

Captain Sanders said he has introduced some improved dressing machinery, by means of which he has been able to dress ores to a much higher percentage than usual.  The machinery is reported in good order and the establishment is 274 men and boys.  Operations are proceeding to prove the mine at greater depth and the Directors are hopeful that this will lead to valuable discoveries of ore.
