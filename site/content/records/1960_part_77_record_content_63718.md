Burra is one place being considered as a possible headquarters for this move.  Unfortunately its geographical position counts against it.  As 150 persons would be employed, it would mean the influx of 400-500 people.  Mr R.T. Prior, an old Burra boy has been appointed to the position of Area Manager Telecommunications for the Mid North, Upper North, Far North and Eyre Peninsula of SA.  Mr Prior (Ray) called on the Chairman of the District Council, Mr R.J. Jeffery, and the District Clerk, Mr T.G. Perry, on 25 October to discuss the proposal as part of his familiarisation with the vast area concerned.
