St John’s Ambulance Service Burra

At a public meeting in Burra Council Chambers on 4 July the serious problems facing the service were discussed.  Currently there are 12 volunteers available.  This problem is not unique to Burra and similar difficulties are experienced from Yunta and Clare and many other country branches.  Anyone with free time would be welcome.  Contact Mrs Rosemary Opperman.
