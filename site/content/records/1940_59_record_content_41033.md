Mr L.L. Fiebig applied for permission to alter the western side of his premises for a motor showroom.

The Savings Bank of SA advises that under the Act the Council could only borrow £2,896 on the Town Hall account as it had recently borrowed £800.

The Town Clerk will interview the Council’s solicitor on the matter.

The platform at the Burra Railway Station will be repaired as SAR has agreed to supply all the materials.

Cr Baulderstone moved that a light be placed in McQuarie St. [sic].  Carried.  [Perhaps Quarry St?]
