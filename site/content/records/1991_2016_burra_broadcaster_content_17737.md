Two Major Entertainment Events have been announced for the district in 1999:

Jailhouse Rock Festival 26-28 February.

Twilight Jazz Affair at Petherton, 20 March.

Planning for the inaugural Jailhouse Rock Festival is well in hand and it will feature 50s and 60s rock ʼn’ roll, beginning with a nostalgic movie night.  (Cartoons, newsreel and American Graffiti.)

The main event will be in the Old Redruth Gaol at 7.30 p.m. to late – with Adelaide band Rockin the Jukebox.

Triomore will provide music for brunch by the creek to wind up the affair on Sunday.

The staging of the Twilight Jazz Affair follows the very successful event held in March 1998 at Petherton.

The 1999 version will be on 20 March at 5.30 p.m. in the Petherton Orchard, with proceeds to aid the Wilkins’ Cottage restoration.
