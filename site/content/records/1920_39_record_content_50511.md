H.P. Monaghan writes to contradict remarks made by H.C. Atkins at the opening of the Hanson Soldiers’ Hall.  Atkins contended that dances at Farrell’s Flat have been of a very low order and that drink had almost compelled the Institute committee there to abandon this class of entertainment.  Monaghan as caretaker and secretary of the hall says these statements are untrue and misleading.  No liquor enters the hall and if any assistance is needed there it is only a phone call away.
