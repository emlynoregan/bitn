Obituary.  Mr Alfred Hanley died in his sleep on 21 July in his residence in Paxton Square.  As a member of the Veterinary Corps he served in the Great War.  Later he was employed by Messrs Gallagher Bros at Quondong Station for many years.  He retired to Burra seven years ago.  He was accorded a military funeral attended by members of the local RSL.  In the absence of the Anglican minister the service was conducted by Mr Hilary Fuss, lay reader and also late of the 1st AIF.  The deceased was aged 76.  He left no next of kin and was in a sound financial position.  He was found dead by a neighbour who went to his cottage after not seeing him about.  After a medical examination the coroner Mr S. Kellaway deemed an inquest unnecessary.
