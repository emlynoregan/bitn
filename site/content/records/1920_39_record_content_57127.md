Obituary.  John Joseph Sullivan died after a short illness at his residence on 12 July aged 75.  He was a man of good nature, reserved, calm, gentle and unassuming. In his youth he was a keen sportsman and held the state 100 yard record for running.  He spent his early life in the Northern Districts and came to Willalo area in 1911.  Here he achieved the success that was a reward for hardships experienced at Eurelia and Carrieton.  He married Miss Hemingway of Carrieton who survives with three sons and four daughters.  The funeral cortege comprised over 60 cars.
