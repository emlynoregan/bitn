Obituary.  Norman Horton Ford, eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Francis H. Ford’s family of nine children, was born at Burra 19 October 1892.  The family moved to Diprose Creek near Burra, which was the family home for many years and the home of Mr Norman Ford and his family for thirty years.  Mr Ford enlisted for service in the Great War and served nearly three years overseas.  He died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital 6 June 1960.  He leaves a widow and seven children (one deceased) [sic] and five grandchildren.

[Actually born 1891.  There were eight children.  One daughter died in 1948.  The meaning of the last sentence therefore is unclear.]
