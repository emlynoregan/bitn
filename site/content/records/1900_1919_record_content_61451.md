Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.

The Peace Day Committee meeting revealed that the day had raised £1,690 with expenses of £112 for a nett balance of £1,577 towards the cost of the memorial in Market Square.

The mayor said several districts had decided to erect their own memorials and so could not, as districts, join in schemes for a central one, but now as the greater part of the sum had been raised Mr Crewes thought they should again be asked to join an executive to call for designs and prices.  It was everyone’s desire to include the name of every boy who had fallen and who had enlisted from Burra or the district.

A meeting of delegates from the various DCs will be called.  Burra Town will be represented by the Mayor and Mr Winnall, with Mr G.E. Dane as a non-voting delegate ex officio.  [Ex officio for what office is not stated, but he was the Hon. Sec. of the Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.]  In 1915 the Town Council formed itself into a Memorial Committee and collected c. £35.  The Council will be approached to merge the two committees.
