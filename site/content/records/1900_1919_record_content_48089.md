W. Howard Turner of Leighton, who is evidently the anonymous Leighton writer previously on the subject of the Black Springs Hall, writes on that topic.  He attempts to refute the points in the letter by the Honorary Secretary of the hall, item by item and at considerable length.  The letter extends for over 1-column.
