Kooringa News, 2 June

The heavy gale which affected the entire colony scattered flocks of sheep in this district.  They have been recovered, but with heavy loss of lambs.  Runs that usually have a 90% lambing rate will struggle this year to get to 30%.

Ashton’s Anglo-Saxon Circus has been in town for two nights and was fairly patronised.

The St Leon Troupe has also performed here.

Her Majesty’s birthday was celebrated with a holiday and a successful ball.

Mr Bocaut [sic: Boucaut] gave a lecture on Trial by Jury.  It was thinly attended.

Trade remains slack, though I hear a Melbourne Company has taken up a discovery of copper made near here sixteen years ago, on the Mt Bryan Run.

On Thursday evening a meeting was held at the Burra Hotel to present a testimonial to Mr Winnall for services as Superintendent of St Mary’s Sunday School for the past six or seven years and for his work in keeping the congregation together in the interregnum between ministers that preceded the arrival of the present incumbent.  He was presented with a silver salver suitable inscribed.  It was presented by Rev. Stanton in a speech of considerable length and feeling.
