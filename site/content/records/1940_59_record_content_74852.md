Conversion of the present building on the south side adjoining the Council Chamber, to an office for the Town Clerk, leaving the Council Chamber as a reception and meeting place.

Using the rest of the south side for the library, which the Library Committee intend to modernise a great deal.  The entrance to the Library will be on the left hand side – as at present used by the CWA.

On the north side the present Reading Room will become the CWA Room and the other library rooms will be turned into one big supper room with all facilities.

It is intended that this room will also be used as a meeting room for sporting and other bodies.

To effect these changes it will only be necessary to erect a kitchen on the northwest end of the present building, with an entrance on the right hand side of the Town Hall.

It is intended to move the film winding room to the dress circle next to the Bio Room.  This will take up a little room, but with the new seating to be installed it is thought that more patrons will actually be accommodated than at present.  Although this will be done at the same time, it will be financed from the picture fund.

The scheme was approved and will proceed immediately and a committee to implement it has been formed from the three bodies mentioned.  An appeal for funds will be launched.  The expected cost is about £1,500 of which about £1,000 will need to be raised.  If the stage is no longer used for supper room purposes the screen, which is delicate and expensive, will not have to be moved at all.
