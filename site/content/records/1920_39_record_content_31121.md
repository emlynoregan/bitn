Burra Town Council, 1 July

Mr M. Collins requested further information re the aerodrome paddock, as it was leased to his brother who would want all possible returns from grazing.  Captain Roberts will be asked for details.

M.W. Bednall acting in the estate of Mary Allen asked the Council to sell a small piece of land (a dead end) of St Dye St adjoining the deceased’s property.  Granted on the payment of £1.

A letter from the Burra Benevolent Society urged the erection of Johnny Green at some suitable place.

The Town Clerk knew where the effigy was, but it had lost an arm and a leg.

Cr Woollacott said the missing parts could be welded on.

Crs Harris, Allen & Pearce are to inspect ‘Johnny’ and report back.

Woollacott & Sons were given permission to build an office for Vacuum Oil Co.

Edgar Pearce was given permission to build a garage for Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Morgan on his recent loss.  [Death of his brother.]

The Town Clerk’s letter of Sympathy to Cr Allen was endorsed.  [Death of his mother.]

The Governor will be given a civic reception if it is convenient during his visit to the Coursing Carnival or the Burra Show.

Local Board of Health

Cr Woollacott was elected to represent the Council on the Hospital Board.

Hallett Golf Club was opened on 29 June by Sir John Melrose who presented the Patron E.C. Baker with a ball for the first drive.
