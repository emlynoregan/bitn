Don Lloyd writes to the editor:

It was a pleasure to hear Mr Hawker refer to the recently revealed turned wood frontage to the gallery at the Town Hall.  How fortunate that it was covered up and not removed.  In the same week the unique signpost in Market Square was removed.  Hoe many years had that been part of Burra?  Over the years much heritage has been removed.  In recent years the main school building and the Town Hall steps have been under threat and the maternity wing of the hospital has been demolished.  What will be threatened next?  Will the wall in front of Polly’s Tea Rooms be plastered or the wooden steps from the road destroyed.  The proposed Ludgvan Street deviation will see more destroyed and the railway overpass will probably be bulldozed so it can be enlarged.  The expensive mess that is now Market Square will not prevent accidents.  The signpost should be returned and restored to its original state with wooden posts and chains.
