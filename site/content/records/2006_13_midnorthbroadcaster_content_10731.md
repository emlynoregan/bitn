Grassy Woodlands need to be recognised for their importance as a home to a host of threatened species.  SA MDB NRM Board spokesperson Sarah Lance said their importance can often be overlooked as they blend in with surrounding pasture and crops.  They contain unusual plants and a wide range of wildlife reliant on these threatened ecosystems. She was speaking on National Threatened Species Day yesterday.  Two such threatened habitats are Iron-grass Temperate Grasslands and Peppermint Box Grassy Woodlands.   Many species are found only in grassy ecosystems.  Among endangered animal species are the pygmy blue-tongue lizard and the plains wanderer an endangered and elusive seed eating bird.  Most of the areas of these ecosystems occur on private land and the SA MDB NRM Board is running a new Environmental Stewardship project to fund private land managers to protect and improve these ecosystems.  People with these two ecosystems on their property are invited to participate in the project.
