Editorial on the Burra Show.

The editor predicts a great success given good weather and he stresses its importance in infusing energy into the various industries.  The prize list has been increased in value by £60 to £200.  A new shed has been erected for perishable goods.  A new gate allows for the entrance of cattle.  The society is in a sound financial position.
