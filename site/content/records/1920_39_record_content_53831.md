Burra Brass Band held its AGM 27 November

Mr Murison was welcomed back after his recent illness.  The secretary reported a year of considerable achievement.  The band had won the competition at Clare early in the year.   Illness had prevented their holding a series of dances this year and consequently the band’s finances were low.  They had just one dance this year for £7-4-9 compared with six in 1933 for £33-13-3.  But they had held 11 open-air concerts for £24-12-7 compared with 5 in 1933 for £8-8-9.  During the year they had visited Waikerie, which was very enjoyable and financially rewarding.  They had also received a visit from Waikerie Band with similarly pleasing results.  The committee is planning for a Band Competition in Burra as soon as possible with the hope of attracting seven or eight bands and upwards of 100 bandsmen.  P.W. Clark was particularly thanked for the use of his room.  Elected were Patron, Mr James Thomas; President, Mr E.F. Marston; Secretary, J.T. Pascoe; Treasurer, J. Allen; Bandmaster, J.H. Murison & Deputy Bandmasters George Terry & A.W. Andrews.
