Goyder Council has adopted a plan for some redevelopment of the creek area â€“ much of it based on a concept drawn up in 1994.  Plans are afoot to use water from the Mine Pool to maintain the creek flow, rather than bore water.  A solar pump is being investigated.  A walking trail on the west side of the creek, reaching north from the foot bridge could also be included.

The Effluent Ponds

At present the southern ponds are being made into one large pond, to be separated from the northern area, which will become four smaller ponds.  A liner will be laid in the larger pond, where the treatment cycle begins, before the effluent is pumped through the remaining four ponds.  Council is looking for a customer to use the end product.
