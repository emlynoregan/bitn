Editorial on Reform of the Legislative Council.

This was previously much debated, but the fire has now gone out without any change having occurred.

We favour five or six electorates instead of the present one, as it would make the representation more local and reduce the costs of any by-election.

The Intercolonial Conference continues, but nothing definite has yet been resolved.
