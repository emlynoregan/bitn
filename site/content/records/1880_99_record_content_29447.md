Letter from W.R. Ridgway re the Waterworks.  He recommends that the Council take over the works again, under certain conditions.  He makes the following points:

The Waterworks were intended to meet the wants of the south end of the town in particular.

It has collapsed because (a) a free well was supplied in Market Square; (b) the Government charged what it liked rather than the true cost of construction.

The works prospered for two years because they were economically managed and the interest rates were 3% and 4% and the charges for water were 6/- per 1,000 gallons when the Corporation was paying 3/- per 1,000 gallons.

The failure in the third year was due to bad management coupled with a reduction in charges for water, a higher interest rate, the expenses of the Avenue, and public consumption for which there was no revenue produced.

We can go on with the Government, or the Council can resume control.

The Council should take the Waterworks back as the Government has indicated it will cut the interest rate (and since they charged 25% more than cost they can certainly afford to).

The Council should do its duty.
