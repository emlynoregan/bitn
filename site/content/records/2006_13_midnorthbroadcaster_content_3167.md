Gaslight has new owners.  Bob Perry has moved back to Burra with his wife Jill to run Gaslight Old Books and Collectables.  Bob’s family was here in the 1950s when his father was District Clerk.  Bob moved to Adelaide 12 or 13 years later to finish school while his parents stayed till the 1970s.  Jill and Bob rediscovered Burra about eight years ago, looked around, and bought a cottage.  Using the cottage as a weekender, they have seen Gaslight evolve into the popular hive of ‘cuppa society’ it is today.  Jill worked for the Commonwealth Department for Employment and Workplace Relations and Bob in training and apprenticeships and was a partner in a printing business before semi-retiring.  Jill & Bob said they did not plan to make any major changes to the operation of the business.
