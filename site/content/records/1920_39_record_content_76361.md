Rev. C. Gray writes objecting to a statement of 22 August in the paper, that the Salvation Army did the work other denominations left undone: reportedly said by Mrs I.J. Warnes.  He then outlines the four Anglican homes for orphans, the Girls’ Hostel in Whitmore Square, The Girls’ Club, the GFS Lodge, the Hostel for Unemployed Men and Others in Wright St, the Missions to Seamen and the House of Mercy at Walkerville for fallen girls and other missions.  Perhaps, he says, the trouble is that they do not advertise enough.  Without belittling the work of the Army it is time to dispel the idea that it does all the social work of religion.
