Burr Town Council, 5 July

[Additional to matters noted on page 1.]

A letter from Mr E. Lehmann (Bus Proprietor) stated that Mr L. Fiebig (Taxi-Cab) Proprietor) was interfering with his business by running  passengers to and from the Burra Railway Station.

Cr Bevan said When Messrs Freer & Scott had applied to run a bus service in Burra, he had pointed out there was not enough business for two bus proprietors in Burra.  Council had not agreed with him.

The Town Clerk said that Mr L.L. Fiebig had agreed when starting his cab business in Burra, not to go in opposition to Mr E.J. Lehmann.  At present neither party had taken out fresh hire licences.

Cr Fisher said it would cause a monopoly is Council granted a hire licence to one and not the other.  He moved that Council take no action, as no licences had yet been granted for this year.  Cr Lee seconded and T.H. Woollacott amended that the matter lie on the table until next meeting.  Cr Bevan seconded.  Amendment carried.

After discussion [see page 1] it was resolved that the Town Clerk be asked to tender a price for making a Fresh Assessment of the Town Area.  Carried.
