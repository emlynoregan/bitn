The Town Clerk, Mr Fogg, was asked to resign after three months, in the face of repeated warnings. Immediate steps were taken to recover monies missing due to his neglect and all except £2 was recovered. His neglect caused a delay of 3 months in getting Govt. subsidy and a loss of £10 in interest and because work had been let in anticipation of income a£400 loan became necessary.
