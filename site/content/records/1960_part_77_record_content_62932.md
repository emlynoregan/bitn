Burra Hospital.  Cabinet has approved a $240,000 contract for improvements to the Burra Hospital.  It has gone to Kennett Bros Pty Ltd of Adelaide and involves changes to the Maternity Wing to provide increased accommodation, upgrading the kitchen and general replanning so the hospital operates on the one level instead of the present three levels.
