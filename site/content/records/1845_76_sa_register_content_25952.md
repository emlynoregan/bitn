The Mt Bryan Road.  2 October.  A Deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works, Hon. H.E. Bright MP.

Mr P. Waite stated that the Mt Bryan Road was in a very bad state and there were this year some 12,000 to 14,000 bales of wool to come down it.

Mr Killicoat reported driving down it with Mr Dawson a day or two ago and saw six bullocks drawing four bales of wool and six horses 9-13 bales.  Almost every half mile the teamsters had to unload and beside the bales of wool there were stacks of flour, bran and pollard and all manner of merchandise bound for Jamestown and other places.  ‘Their lives were in danger from the time they left the Burra until they arrived at Mt Bryan Station.  In one place the road was fenced off for two miles because of the state of the road, and the traffic had to turn to the right and the left, and it was scarcely possible to cross Holman’s Creek.  They managed to get back to the Burra with only one broken spring.  The road was the most dangerous and treacherous that he had ever seen in South Australia.’

He asked for a special grant.

Mr Dawson corroborated Mr Killicoat’s observations, but added that he had forgotten to mention the approach to the Burra Station.  ‘Within a quarter mile of the station there was a hole large enough to cover a spring-dray.  Five miles from the Burra the road was fenced off to save people’s lives and there were men there to forcibly prevent persons passing.’

‘When he was on the road the other day he saw 60 or 70 teams travelling six and seven together.’

Mr Drew said that about 300 teams were employed on the road.

Mr Hill said his firm had taken their teams off the road because they could not get along.  About 2,500 tons had been carted over the road in the last two months and about 1,000 tons were at the Burra Station waiting to go up.  Several teams had been eight days on the road from Mt Bryan to Burra, and the drivers refused to go back.

Mr S. Davenport travelled the road on Tuesday and confirmed the above.  For 12 miles travel was impossible except on horseback or with a well-horsed mail and it was only with great difficulty that the mail got through.  He thought some of the slag from the smelting works could be used to fill the holes.

Mr A.S. Clark said that at the present time £150,000 worth of wool was detained on the other side of the road and 1,000 tons of goods worth between £20,000 and £30,000 was waiting to be taken north to Jamestown etc.  Many of the teamsters were farmers who would soon leave to undertake their harvest, leaving the traffic stranded.  Ships were waiting at the port and graziers’ wool would miss the sales as a consequence.  Providence was promising a bumper harvest, which would contribute more traffic.  Thousands of tons of wheat would need to use the road.

Hon. J. Crozier supported immediate action.  They did not blame the present Government, but came to them as the only source of remedy.

Mr Acraman said he represented the interests of settlers in other colonies doing business through this one.  The owners of Mt Gipps Station in NSW had their traffic through SA and paid £1,800 a year to the Government and the teamsters, sending down all their clip and taking back stores.  He understood this section of road had taken more time than all the rest of the journey.  They were 90 miles from the Darling and very little might cause them to send their business via Echuca.

Mr Dawson said there was a quantity of mining equipment presently in Burra that ought to be moving over the road.

Mr Bright in reply said he had never before heard of a case of such magnitude as this.  He had been making inquiries before they arrived and had been informed of wool taken down and thrown into the mud on the side of the road because of the state of the road.  He was in a difficult position as it was a main road under the Central Board, over which he had no control, but he undertook to discuss the matter with the Chairman of that Board and to impress upon him the urgency of the case.  The Board had the money to act.  If the result of the discussion was unsatisfactory, he would take the matter up with his colleagues and was sure he would have the support of the

Attorney-General, who was one of the members for the district.
