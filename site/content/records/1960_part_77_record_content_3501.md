Ratepayers contributed on the following basis:

Burra Town Council	£410

Burra Burra District Council	£1,380

Hallett District Council	£340

Robertstown District Council	£190

Chairman A.D. Radford said the fall in patient numbers meant a fall in revenue of £2,250.  Salaries and wages account for more than 50% of expenses.  The scatter of hospital buildings means more domestic staff are required.  Fees were raised in March, which will benefit the coming year.  Fluorescent lighting was installed in the Men’s and Women’s Wards, which considerably brightened up the wards and recently the hospital and Sisters’ quarters were treated for termite extermination at a cost of £150.
