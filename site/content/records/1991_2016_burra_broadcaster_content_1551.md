The Department did not want to take on the area as a reserve as they have neither the money nor the rangers to staff it.

Bob Major of the Field Geology Club of SA described a report suggesting the western quarter should be a reserve to protect a couple of old gold mines, Aboriginal artefacts and the watercourse of the Baldina Creek.

Steve Pike, a previous squatter on the area, said a diprotodon had been taken from the area by the SA Museum and the area had definite archaeological significance.

Rob, a bike rider from Hackham asked why it couldnâ€™t be run as an off-road park like Port Gawler, but it seemed from bike riders present that their case was spoilt by a hooligan element.

On a vote ten persons favoured an option involving some in favour of off-road vehicle use.  Most favoured the whole area becoming a reserve under Council care with no off-road vehicles.

The option of grazing with no off-road vehicles and a reserve had no support.

The Council will give the matter further consideration.
