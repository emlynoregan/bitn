Burra High School – Bleak House: Report of the Principal, Annie B. Millar

Miss Bertha and I will return to re-open the school on 30 January.  The brightest experience this year was the successful result of Vera Wilkinson’s preliminary examination and the saddest was the passing of Miss Davidson.  Rev. Wilfred Murphy continues his excellent scripture lessons.  Vera Wilkinson is dux of the school with Zoe Sangster second.

The prize list and concert items are printed.
