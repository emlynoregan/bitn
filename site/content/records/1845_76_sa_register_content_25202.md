The Northern Railways.  A meeting was held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel, Kooringa on 17 June to consider improvements to the train timetables.  Captain Killicoat presided and considered the railways were conducted in an unsatisfactory manner.  13 towns would be represented at a meeting at Saddleworth soon and he expected a deputation would then wait on the Commissioner of Public Works.

Mr T. Moody saw no reason why Burra should not have two mails a day, as at Kapunda.

J.D. Cave could not see why third class carriages could not be attached to all trains.  Wheat storage needed to be improved so that it was not damaged while awaiting clearance from the station.

M.H. Furniss agreed with that and thought that wheat, copper, fuel, iron, building materials, manure etc. should all be carried at lower rates that articles of luxury.

J.R. Stephens complained that Clare did not have a connecting coach for the early morning train.  Overcharging for parcels from Gawler to Burra had come to his notice.  He wanted a morning and an afternoon train with second and third class accommodation.

O. Harvey moved to appoint representatives to attend the Saddleworth meeting.

P. Lane agreed and wanted better third class accommodation; at present third class passengers had to share their train with sheep and cattle and times of departure needed changing as well.

Mr E. Lipsett agreed with Mr Lane.

T. Warnes thought the charges to transport sheep and cattle were exorbitant.  The railways wanted £55 to get a flock to Adelaide.  He hired a drover and moved them for £9.

W.R. Ridgway though the charges for both goods and passengers were far too high.

J.D. Cave wanted excursion tickets for third class as well as second class.

Motions supporting all the above views were carried.
