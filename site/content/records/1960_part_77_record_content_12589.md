Burra Town Council, 6 August

A general rate of 46d in the pound and a special rate of 4d in the pound were adopted.

The Royal Agricultural & Horticultural Society of SA wrote to the Council.  It was resolved that a letter be sent to them saying Council had made arrangements for the removal of the jinker.

Mr R.M. Reed is to be informed that Anne Street has not been sold and Council can see no inconvenience caused by the fences mentioned in his letter and he will be asked to state any complaint he may have.

It was resolved to hold a Civic Ball on 9 November in honour of the Governor’s visit.

The SA Tourist Bureau is to be advised that Council is proceeding with the first section of its original plan for a Caravan Park at a cost of £1,500 and it will be asked what subsidy would be available on that amount in this financial year.

The Highways & Local Government Department is to be asked for a grant to complete the traffic islands in Market Square.

Tothill’s Creek residents plan a ‘Back to School’ celebration on either 27 October or 3 November.
