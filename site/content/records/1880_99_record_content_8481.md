The Board has visited and has ignored the difficulties.  They have not attempted to show how their surveyor is correct, but have decided to maintain the road as at present, i.e. in dispute.

Mr Kelly’s statement that no one has raised an objection is incorrect.

Mr Duffy’s statement that there exists the full width of 66’ except for a 6” encroachment is knowingly incorrect.

He further says the road has been thus for 25 years when in fact Ridgway’s fence where it encroaches most for its whole length beyond the house has been there for only about 3 years.

He also errs in asserting that the Council seeks to change the width of the road.  There is a chain road there, but it has been encroached upon.

After the Board meeting Mr Duffy came along and found that the measurements would not tally with his preconceived ideas.  He then shifted the road 16-20’ west which places the boundary line 16” inside the doorways of shops in a situation where owners hold title to land in front of their buildings.

Mr Duffy is not acting in the spirit of compromise which he said at the meeting was needed.  The best compromise we believe would be to place the centre line midway between the opposing boundaries and the narrowing of footways will then be shared by east and west sides, rather than be all on the east as Council proposed, or all on the west as Mr Duffy wants.

The encroachments can then be removed as alterations to the buildings are made later.
