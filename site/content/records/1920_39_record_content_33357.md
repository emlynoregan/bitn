Seaside Trip.  On 1 February about 1,000 people between Manoora and Hallett made the journey to Semaphore.  One train was sufficient this year, perhaps because the Exhibition opens in March.  One of the big engines drew the train to Dry Creek where a lighter one was substituted.  Trains ran to time.  Many of course went to the city for the ‘Talkies’ or to Victoria Park, but the majority enjoyed the beach and many old Burraites met friends at the seaside.  The secretary Mr Will. Lee did his part well.
