Burra Show Soc.

A general meeting was held on Friday in the Liberal Union Rooms.  The President said he had been approached after the last show about a separate sheep show, as the date of shows near the end of October was unsuitable for sheep breeders.

As President of the Pastoral Assoc. he could not ignore it, but as President of the Show Soc. he could not move against its interests.

Mr E.W. Van Senden spoke and felt that a show at Burra under the auspices of the Burra Show Soc. in August or September would not clash with the Adelaide Show.

H.H. Thomas supported a sheep show.

Mr Hawkes pointed out how sheep breeders had to fit in with other shows, and not only with those in SA.  For the Sydney show in August the sheep had to be shorn in July.  HE favoured a pastoral committee for the Burra Show Soc.

M.A. Radford also favoured a separate sheep show.  He thought a committee should be appointed at once to get things going.

Mr Winnall proposed that the society was prepared to hold a sheep show on a separate day from the general show.  Mr Hawkes 2nd.  Carried 17-4.  A committee of twelve was appointed.
