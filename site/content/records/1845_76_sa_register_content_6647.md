The NSW Gold Mania [Editorial]

The news from Sydney is calculated to inflame the minds of men and induce them to abandon the tangible advantages of their present situation and dash of in pursuit of a beckoning false light.  It is one thing to dash off if you are seeking work or have suffered disappointment; it is something else to throw up settled circumstances with the prospect of a independency which has rarely failed to attend labour when accompanied by discretion.

Immediate measures are needed to stop any further immigration ships.  So long as the mania persists we would merely be spending our land fund to benefit the labour market in NSW.

Fortunately SA can boast a race of men bound by no ordinary ties to her soil.  She will reap the reward of the system that has allowed the poor man to become a freeholder.  They will no lightly throw away the advantages they have reaped by the sweat of their brow.  On this security we rest.  There will remain enough sturdy arms and toil-hardened hands in SA among her freeholders to reap her harvests and shear her sheep, though hosts of the labouring population should, to their own bane, leave us.

The NSW Gold Diggings

[The reports from the Bathurst district confirm large auriferous deposits and there are statements that 400 men working around the Government Geologist were making 1 to 2 oz of gold a day.  The £1 gold licence is confirmed, as is the rising price of provisions, with flour reaching £30 per ton.

A letter to the Register removes any doubt of the fact that a vast quantity of gold is to be found between Summerhill in the south and Dubbo in the north, known generally as the Wellington District, 35 miles from Bathurst and 150 miles from Sydney.  Gold is selling at £3-3-0 to £3-5-0 per troy ounce.  Six men in a few days raised 17 ounces and another report said men were getting an ounce per day.

While men can easily make 15/- a day, the cost of provisions is very high and as a result many robberies are taking place.  Excitement is still rising and men are arriving in large numbers.  Other industrial pursuits in the colony are being neglected and as a result wages have suddenly risen almost 25%.  A complete madness has overtaken the colony.  [Details are given of law and order issues and the costs and means of getting from Sydney to the area, as well as reports on how other parts of the economy are being affected.]
