Middle Ward	£357-13-2

North Ward	£475-19-10

Recreation Ground	£638-3-2

Total	£2216-9-8

A £100 bond was also repaid and £372 is in hand for the town survey.

£150 is in hand for works not begun or in progress.

The only real disappointment has been the cost of the Recreation Ground.

With the survey money and the £150 in hand there will be over £500 to be expended next year over the usual income, which will allow the maximum claim for Government subsidy.

We anticipate North Ward will have 	£285

Middle Ward	£310

South Ward	£275

But as South Ward owes Middle Ward £100 and the General fund £111-13-6 effectively it will change to:

North Ward	£285

Middle Ward	£410

South Ward	£64

South Ward may elect not to pay all the debt off this year, for to do so would leave them with virtually nothing to spend.

One major question is the survey money.

It is too little for the job so:

Is more to be borrowed to get the job done?

Can the balance needed be taken from the rates?

Will ratepayers sanction its use for other purposes?

The need for a proper survey is apparent.  At present nothing can prevent encroachments for there is no proof of where boundaries are.
