John Oates, Secretary-Treasurer of the Burra Picnic Race Club, writes to express their disappointment at the number of people who brought their own alcohol and soft drinks to the races.  The Club is not out to rip people off and all the funds raised go to the RFDS and SES, who really deserve all the donations they can get.
