Mongolata Goldfield

Messrs Rampton & Son, who are among the oldest prospectors at Mongolata, have recently got onto some ‘good stuff’ with excellent battery returns.  They recently came on a very rich vein showing gold clearly.  Their claim is near Byles’ Mongolata.  Two years ago they were only seven feet away from the present find, but a flood washed down tons of earth and they abandoned the area.

Curlew Claim had had processed 26½ tons for 88 oz 4 dwt, or an excellent average of 3 oz 4 gr per ton.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate had 10 tons 4 cwt pass through the battery for 3 oz 8 dwt 17 gr plus 1 oz 7 dwt 5 gr by cyanide, for an average ½ oz per ton.
