The Minister of Railways replied to questions on notice from Mr McDonald:

Yes: he was aware of the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.

The quality of the ballast from there was not as good as that from Sleep’s Hill and the price was 1/- per ton more than from the latter.

Yes, ballast used north of Burra recently had come from the Sleep’s Hill Quarry and this was the most economical option for the railways, who owned the Sleep’s Hill Quarry.

Mr McDonald regarded the answers as unsatisfactory.
