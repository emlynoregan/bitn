Burra Show Society (Burra Agricultural Soc.)

AGM Friday last.  The President, I.J. Warnes said last yearâ€™s show had not been held on account of the war and the very bad season, though personally he had favoured holding it.  The secretary had still had quite a lot of work to do and had not been paid.  He hoped the meeting would attend to that, unlike the Racing Club.  The Hon. John Lewis was re-elected Patron and I.J. Warnes was re-elected President.

[The committee included C. Fuss, A. Forrest and Thomas McWaters]

It was resolved to have the sheep dog trials on 30 & 31 July.  Various details of the trials were then settled.  A decision on holding a show was deferred for five weeks.
