Editorial on S.A.'s prospects. Summary of agricultural prospects, production and exports for the year. Settlement of new lands was going on very fast. 1876 saw the alienation of 213,669 acres and 1877 saw 793,303 acres at a price of Â£398,432-12-0. (Most on credit or receipts would have been much larger.) Immigration continues to bring settlers to S.A.

Railway construction continues.

Burra Burra Mines. Rumours of a potential buyer continue.

Local industry. Michael Williams, formerly a foreman blacksmith at the Mines is making ornamental smith's work in Aberdeen.
