Cr Jennison was anxious to get started.

Cr Kellaway moved that arrangements be made to borrow the £400.

Cr Dow said the motion to borrow £500 was out of order as the previous one to borrow £400 had not been rescinded.

The Clerk confirmed that no notice had been published about the £500 loan.

The Mayor said he would like to see a full Council present before anything definite was decided.

Cr Dow agreed with Cr Jennison that they needed to act.  They had been talking for six months.

It was unanimously agreed to borrow £400 as originally intended and they would meet immediately to choose a site.

With respect to the Mine Bridge Inspector Davis had made a fresh survey and would send up the necessary specifications and tenders would be called.
