Middle Ward Election Meeting

Thursday evening.  Small attendance.

Mr Lockyer summarised the year’s works.  He hoped the next year would see a windmill and tanks in Market Square, the town surveyed and more trees planted now that it had been established that it was eligible for subsidy.  The Recreation Ground was a white elephant with a debt of over £150.  He would like to see all reserves planted and the completion of the footway to Aberdeen.  He was for more streetlights.  He was opposed to a tax on stock sales.

Cr Geake favoured a town survey and against the Corporation owning saleyards.  He would support public baths if it could be shown they were ‘reproductive’.  [Presumably he wanted them to make a profit.]  He would support a general water supply if the majority wanted it.  He believed the Recreation Ground would ultimately be of benefit.
