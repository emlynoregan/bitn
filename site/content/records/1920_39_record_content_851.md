Dr Steele, as President of the RSL, said the ‘boys’ wanted the figure to be in the attitude known as ‘parry’ – the attitude in which so many had died.  They did not want a stiff expressionless figure.

The Mayor thought they might save money by calling tenders and that their obligation to Mr Tillett extended only to £10-10-0.

(Tillett had at his own risk and cost brought along plans and specifications.)

Mr Hawkes wanted to lose the lions and save £250 and reduce the steps to three to save a further £75.

Dr Steele favoured a shorter column.

Mr Broderick thought all the designs should have been submitted to the General Committee.

Dr Steele felt that the memorial should not cost over £2,000 and that the next best design was from a returned soldier who had kept within the mark.

Mr Crewes said that the original Tillett design had been within the £2,000 limit and the Executive’s suggestions had pushed the cost up.

Finally Dr Steele moved the adoption of the design and Mr Broderick seconded.

Tillett said that if he did the work he would return the £10-10-0 prize.  He strongly favoured granite as more durable and it did not need cleaning.  He did not think the ‘parry’ position an improvement – his proposal was for a figure ‘at ease’.

Dr Steele said ‘the figure should show the striking characteristics of a digger . . . We do not want replicas of other statues’. 

Tillett said tenders might get the work done £250 cheaper by ‘rough work on the granite’ – he would not reduce his estimate, which was a firm offer – a supervising architect would add £100.  There would be no monument of the same class outside the city.

Dr Steele moved the figure be clean-shaven and an Australian infantryman dressed in fighting order.

It was resolved to lose the lions, reduce the steps to three and to make the column red granite on a grey base with the figure in bronze.  The plans to be submitted to an architect for an opinion and cost estimate.

A deputation is to wait on the Town Council to discuss the site.

There was some discussion about lawns and fencing around the memorial.

The Mayor favoured an open area and Mr Davey said the cost of garden preparation would be high.

Mr Broderick asked if the Defence Department had promised the flanking field pieces in black and white.

Mr Crewes said he had two letters practically promising them.

[The report wanders somewhat between Mr Tillitt and Mr Tillett.]
