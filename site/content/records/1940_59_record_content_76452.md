The Head Teacher was prepared to vacate the lunch room as soon as it was furnished, but even the respite of a week from teaching two [classes] in the same room is appreciated.  The hiring of an outside hall was considered, but that poses difficulties and inconveniences.  The Head Teacher appreciates the reasonableness and friendliness of the discussions with the Committee and the Welfare Club representatives.

Since then the Minister of Education has promised the Member for the District, Mr P.H .Quirke, the classroom will be finished by the end of April.

Some improvements were made in the vacation, with a new ablutions trough installed and lights put in four of the classrooms.

On Thursday the school was supplied with free milk from Golden North at Clare – it is railed to Burra Cold Stores.  There being no train Sundays, milk will not be available on Mondays.  260 one-third pint bottles are delivered daily.  We understand St Joseph’s has applied for the same service.

Hallett School enrolled 12 in Grade I and has a total of 59, but 5 are likely to transfer out in the near future.  Miss Margaret Lewis of Largs Bay has been appointed assistant.  Swimming lessons have re-commenced and Mr Dowling and Mr Schliebs appreciate the use of Mr John Murray’s pool.

Willalo School has no new enrolments this year and numbers have fallen from 14 last year to an initial 10 this year.  Head Teacher is Mr Brian brooks, previously at Wandearah North near Port Pirie.  Although a new portable building was to be ready for the opening, as yet no start has been made and the school continues as usual in the Hall.

St Joseph’s School has 39 on the roll, including 12 new enrolments [listed].  Sister (Superior) M. Maurice and Sister M. Joan have returned this year and secondary education and music are being taught.

Burra High School has an enrolment of 85 with 41 in First Year and 24 in Second Year, 17 in Intermediate and 31 in Leaving [sic: though total suggests 3].  The new staff is C. Morrison from Burra Primary, G. Ireland from Snowtown Higher Primary and T. Baudin from Riverton High.  Last year in Leaving five candidates gained four certificates and in Intermediate eight candidates gained six certificates.

Booborowie North School has 20 on the roll with five new enrolments.  The teacher is Mr A.A. Pye.  Numbers are down, as two families have left the district and other children have completed Primary Education.  Margaret Brooks and Ashley Sutton gained their Progress certificates and are now at Burra High and Ivon Garrard, who turned 14, has found employment.  Mr W.J.M. Roberts, Chairman of the School Committee, has sold his farm and left the area.  He was given a farewell at the school.  The Twigden family have also left for Mt Bryan and the school lost Daryl, John, Kaylene and Pamela as a result.  The Wilkes family have moved in, bringing Dorothy, Brian, Kae and Dean to the school.  Stuart Catt will soon be a new pupil.

Farrell Flat School has 9 new enrolments in their total of 45 students.  Head teacher is Mr C.R. Brereton, who has been at Farrell Flat for four years and Miss H.R. Battye has been appointed as assistant from Teachers’ College.  Mrs G.E. Brereton teaches sewing.
