Accidents

Three serious accidents occurred in the district in two weeks.

On 8 July a car and motorcycle collided at the intersection of the Barrier Highway and Copperhouse Road.  The motorcyclist (59) died shortly after arriving at Burra Hospital.

On the weekend a male from Adelaide luckily escaped injury when his car rolled over near Porter Lagoon.

A second accident saw a driver from Adelaide lose control near the S bends north of Mt Bryan, possibly during a medical incident.  The car rolled and the driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected, but luckily escaped serious injury.
