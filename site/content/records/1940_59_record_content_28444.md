Civic Welcome for the Prime Minister

Mayor H.J.B. Jennison welcomed Mr Chifley to Burra at a civic reception, which had to be moved to the Town Hall from the Council Chambers due to the numbers attending.

Mr Jennison outlined the history of the mine and town and said there were still some living who remembered the mine at work.  Mr Chifley visited Burra’s centenarian Mrs Klaffus while he was here.  Mr Jennison also referred to Burra’s position at the centre of wool production and its contribution to the war effort, both with service personnel and on the home front.  Cr Kellaway supported the Mayor, as did Cr Finch, Chairman of the Burra Burra DC.
