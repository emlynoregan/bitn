Weather.  Welcome rain has been falling.  Mr Hardy reports that to the east falls have been significant.  Quondong got 25 points and Old Koomooloo 19.  Most other places fell in between.  Redcliffe recorded 30 points.  [This would suggest that Hardy was still the telephonist for the Eastern Telephone Exchange.]
