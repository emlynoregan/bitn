RSL Dinner.  The 4th annual dinner was held at Pearce’s Building last Saturday.  Dr Steele as President presided.  Dinner was provided for the third time by the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. in the charge of Miss Bubb.  Floral decorations came from Hampton Court gardens.  S.M. Lane Vice-President said it was a shame that the branch was declining.  Mr Andrew Bartholomaeus also expressed disappointment that more had not attended.  Some 40-50 were present.  D. Van Senden proposed the toast for the Rejected Volunteers and the Fathers’ Assoc.  W.G. Hawkes proposed that for the War-working Societies, mentioning Red Cross, The Cheer-up Soc., The League of Loyal Women, The Burra Sporting and Athletic Club and The Cheer-up Ladies Band, which he believed had attended the station about 180 times, ‘and everywhere the girls were there was our worthy Mayor.’  Mr Crewes responded for the Red Cross and Cheer-up Soc.  He said that although the Cheer-up Society was not active it still existed and had £138 in the bank ready for any emergency if one of the boys struck trouble.  He said the band had actually visited the station 166 times.  Mr Foote responded for the Soldiers’ Aid Soc.  He recalled their war effort and said that since then they had principally aided the Royal Institution for the Blind and raised £200 for it.  As for the Sporting and Athletic Club – it no longer met, but any returned man who had not received his £5 had only to mention it and it would be attended to.  Dr Steele proposed the toast to the RSL.  Also present was Staff-Nurse Lang and Mrs C.F. Humphris (formerly Staff-Nurse McWaters).
