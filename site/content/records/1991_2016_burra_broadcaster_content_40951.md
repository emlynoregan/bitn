The Willalo Hall was constructed c. 1918* and served the local community for many decades, but as a result of lack of use and maintenance, it has fallen into disrepair.  A general meeting of the Willalo Hall Committee on 8 March 2000 resolved to ask Council to put the Hall up for tender for demolition and that the land be not sold, but be reserved for community use and a plaque and trees be placed on the site.  In January 2007 the former Secretary of Willalo Hall and Oval Committee advised of the winding up of the committee and requested Council maintain the Hall until it was demolished.  An inspection in 2015 determined it was a risk to public safety and should be demolished.  Renovations were not financially viable.

[*See the article Issue 37, 22 July 2015, page 6, which says it was built in 1912.  A Trove search shows it was actively being used through 1913.]
