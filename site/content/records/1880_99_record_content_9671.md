Editorial on the improvements to the town in the past six years.  Money was borrowed last year to have the town surveyed, but it was then found that a reliable survey would cost at least £1,000 and it then became a question what to do with the money.  It is to be hoped that the ratepayers will soon be asked this question.

Trees.  There are now a great many trees about the town, both in public and private places and in a year or two they will show above the houses to improve the appearance of the ‘hitherto naked town’.
