The Air Force Ball was held on 6 July in the Burra Town Hall.

Official guests included Mr Alec Coombs, President of the Clare branch of the Air Force Association, Mr Eckert, Secretary of the Clare Branch and Wing Commander Buckham (or Huckam in another paragraph) of Parafield.  They and friends of members attended a pre-ball cocktail party in the old Brewery Cellars on the property owned by Mr W. Young.  The ball was opened by the Mayor, Mr W. Carpenter.  Music was supplied by Bruce Gray’s ‘All Star Five’ Band.  Miss Thelma Seaford was declared Belle of the Ball with Mrs L.P. Bence as Matron of the Ball.  The Burra Hospital will benefit by £100 or more.
