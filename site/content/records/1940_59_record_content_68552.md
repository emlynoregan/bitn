The Council has to expend money on street lighting, the Hospital, fire station, maintenance, materials, wages etc.  Financially it was sound, due mainly to the Town Hall Pictures project.

A special grant was obtained for work on Kangaroo St and another of £500 enabled the resurfacing of the road from the Kooringa Hotel to the cemetery.  Most of the Main Road grant was expended on resurfacing part of Market Square, but poor weather has seen £375 carried over to next year (without affecting future grants).

Planting trees to celebrate the Queen’s visit was deferred due to the dry season last year, but they will be planted in the next two or three weeks.  The Ex-servicemen’s Avenue of Memory consists of some 250 trees and the Association is commended on their effort.  Large old street trees, particularly pines and cork elms with potential to damage property were being replaced with smaller trees and shrubs.

Though the Town Hall had maintenance work this year, the Mayor said it was his ambition to see it improved.

The Picture Committee now comprises five: The Town Clerk, Mr E.R. Davey and H.C. Davies, D.A. Halliday, J.A.S. Fisher and E.T. Baulderstone.  A six month trial of Wednesday screenings is being held to raise funds to refurnish the hall.  The overdraft on the Town Hall building has been reduced from £3,300 to £1,000, mainly through the Picture Project.

The Corporation undertook to carry out the clerical work connected with the Burra Hospital.

A superannuation scheme for Corporation employees comes into operation from 1 July.

The new Ferguson tractor and attachments should prove quite satisfactory.

A special rate of 4d over and above ordinary rates will not be required for this purchase.*

The overdraft of more than £2,000 of the previous year has been reduced to c. £500.

The swing bridge over the Burra Creek [opposite the Town Hall] has been closed, as it was unsafe and the opinion of the Highways Department was that repairs would cost £3,000 or more.

[The Mayor thanked the committee and all those who had helped raise funds for the Youth travel scheme.]

When questioned, the Mayor said that alterations to the Town Hall would not be financed from an increase in rates if finance was not available from the general public.

Mr A.B. Riggs asked about the bridge situation and the Mayor said it would have to be considered in the near future.

H. Jennison complained about stray stock in the town.

Mr Jennison moved the vote of thanks, which was carried by acclamation.

[* This sentence may have an unintended negative in it.  A special rate of 4d in the £ was passed at a meeting of Council on 4 July and announced in the Public Notices on page 2 of this issue.  Since the Mayor said ‘No reduction in rates could be assured, but ratepayers would pay no more than the previous year,’ perhaps the general rate fell by the amount of the special rate.]
