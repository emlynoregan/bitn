Robbery.  Thieves forced their way into A. & L. Pearce’s shop at Booborowie on the night of Sunday/Monday and got away with £250 in cash and £167 in cheques.  The thieves opened the safe with a duplicate key found on the premises.  They may have used a car stolen from Dr G. Mellor’s garage and later recovered from a disused quarry on the Burra side of Riverton.  Another car stolen from Saddleworth was recovered from Kangaroo St, Burra.  It is possible that this is the fourth in a series of robberies in the last few months: Burra Motor Co., Fiebig’s Service Station and the Burra Bakery have all been hit in recent times.
