Burra Town Council is contemplating planting many more street trees, but only where the residents are prepared to water them in their initial stages of growth.

Town Hall Finances.  When acquired, the Town Hall had a debt of £3,200.  The Council then thought it best to have an ordinary mortgage from the Council’s trading bank, as when there was a surplus in their account it would act as a lien against the overdraft and so reduce interest.  It does save some interest, but the principal does not reduce.  The Town Clerk has recommended reverting to the initial scheme which would call on the Council to reduce the principal each year.  Discussion will doubtless continue.

Burra Town Council has expressed its disgust at the elimination of all trains on Saturdays.  Clare got a train on Saturday night and Burra got two on Friday nights, but none on Saturday.  Councils north of Riverton are to be asked to co-operate.

Burra War Memorial.  £800 is now available to help in reconstructing the oval and beautifying Victoria Park.

Burra School Conveniences.  No tenders were received, so the Council will interview local contractors with a view to resolving the problem.

Johnny Green.  The adoption of Johnny Green as a symbol by Minespa drinks has revived interest in the character whose image stands on a pole at the corner of the paddock near the Mine Bridge.  The figure used to stand on the poppet head at the mine until the building etc. was burnt down as a result of boys trying to smoke pigeons from the shaft beneath.

[Actually the boys were trying to smoke out rabbits from under the floor of the adjacent engine house according to the courts case evidence that followed.  See XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3.]

The late Mr Fred Pascoe later found the image and handed it to the Council.  Johnny was repaired by the overseer Mr H. Wilson and another employee and bolted in the present position on the property now owned by T.H. Villis.  It has recently been discussed in Council that Johnny Green could be made to earn money in the way the ‘Dog on the Tucker-Box’ does at Gundagai.  Consequently at the last meeting of Council it was resolved to take him down and place him in a suitable place with a wishing well in front.
