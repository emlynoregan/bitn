The Mayor commented that he appreciated the difficulties that the Board faced.  In his opinion the evidence submitted was not a true reflection of public opinion either for or against and there should have been a poll of the people.  He also commented on the coincidence that the places where Betting shops are to be licensed – Port Pirie, Peterborough and Quorn – are all strong Labor centres.
