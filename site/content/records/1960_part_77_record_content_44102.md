The Department of Adult Education is arranging a weekend seminar on the Historic Copper Towns of SA for early in May.  Lectures will be given on Friday evening with visits to Kapunda and Burra on Sunday.  Lecturers would give a solid treatment of the history of copper mining in SA with particular reference to Moonta, Kadina, Wallaroo, Kapunda and Burra, with geological background and the technical aspects of copper mining.  Ian Auhl will visit Burra on Monday 10 March and talk about the seminar so that local people not attending the University on the Friday and Saturday will still be able to be in the picture.  If it generates sufficient local interest a weekend school in Burra may be arranged at a later date.
