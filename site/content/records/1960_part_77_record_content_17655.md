Burra Show

There were a record number of entries at 2,600 and the show was a great success despite the day starting out with light showers and a cold south-easterly wind.  Conditions improved later.  The gate takings were Â£190 and about 2,800 attended.  The Central Command Band attended and was much appreciated.  The British Trade Commissioner visited and was impressed by the standard generally and by that of the cooking in particular.

The Flower Section was outstanding this year.

Horses in Action were the centre of keen competition and of much interest; as usual.

Sideshows were better this year with several tents new to the area.  The small merry-go-round was popular with tiny tots and the bucking horses with the older ones.

Rural Youth Club had a very original collection of noxious weeds.

Industrial displays may have been down in numbers, but were comprehensive and up-to-date.

President Mr Rex Warnes welcomed visitors and the Band and called on Brigadier W.W. Wearne to open the show.

Results for Art & Photography, Birds, Cattle, Cookery & Dogs are printed, with the other sections to follow in the next issue.
