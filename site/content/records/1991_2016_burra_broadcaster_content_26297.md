Hallett Centenary of Federation Celebrations

On Saturday evening local and visiting people gathered to see the unveiling of a sculpture comprising two sheep, a dog and Statton Gates.  These were chosen as sheep and wool have always been Hallett’s main industry.  It is believed that the first consignment of wool from SA to be sold in England was from the sheep runs of John & Alfred Hallett.  The gates were famous for being made at Statton’s Blacksmith’s Shop in Hallett.  Ned Statton founded the business in 1892 and it was soon a flourishing business in Alfred Street.  Ned and his sons were innovative and as well as standard blacksmithing they patented several inventions of which the most widely used locally was the Statton gate.  Thousands were made and can still be seen on properties today.  After serving the district for 63 years the blacksmith’s business closed in 1957.  Marcus Possingham, the artist in residence in the Goyder Council area for these projects, helped design and create the project along with a local committee.  Three interpretive boards were also unveiled by Henry & Mary Krichauff.  [Photo.]
