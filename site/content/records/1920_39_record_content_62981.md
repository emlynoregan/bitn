The Floral Float left Burra on Monday morning and arrived safely in Adelaide at 1.30 p.m.  The float is the result of many weeks of labour by many ladies.  It was not quite complete when it left Burra and the finishing touches will be added in the city.  Miss Melva Bourman (19) will be Amphitre [sic: for Amphitrite], Poseidonâ€™s wife, driving the three sea horses ridden by Nereids or sea nymphs: Margaret Steele (11), Marcia Collins (9) and Maxine Whittney.  The float is now in Pirie Street and on the pageant day will assemble in East Terrace and then proceed via Pirie Street to its starting point at Victoria Drive opposite the Parade Ground.
