Sheep numbers were down somewhat, but of excellent quality.  Sir John Melrose had an interesting display of Wensleydale Sheep from New Zealand.  They are ideal for freezing for export.  Roy Humphrys of Leighton bought them with the intention we understand of starting a stud.  Champion Merino Ram went to H. Collins & Co.
