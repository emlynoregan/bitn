Burra Hospital.  A group of local residents met the Premier Mike Rann at White cedars Café in Burra before the opening of Hallett 2 Wind Farm.  They queried the implications of the recently announced Federal Government funding arrangements and whether they would mean that the abandoned Country health Plan would be returning.  They also wanted the reinstatement of an attending Burra doctor for the assessment and or treatment of emergency cases at the Burra Hospital.  They sought the Premier’s assistance in organising a public meeting at Burra Town Hall, Attended by the Health Minister, John Hill.  Helen Szuty said the group got a good hearing in a meeting of more than half an hour.  The Premier said the abandoned Country health Plan was definitely not back on the agenda.
