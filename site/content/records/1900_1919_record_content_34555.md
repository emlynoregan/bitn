St Mary’s.  Former rector Rev. H.L. Ebbs dedicated the new reredos on Friday 23 May.  It was a gift of Mrs W.P. Barker of Baldina.  There are five panels finely carved in walnut by the ladies of the Cathedral Guild in Adelaide.  The elaborate walnut framework reaches to the foot of the eastern window and flanking work extends across the eastern wall of the chancel.  The work was executed by Messrs Boettger & Delank of Adelaide from the design of Mr Guy Makin and was put in place by Mr Delank last week.
