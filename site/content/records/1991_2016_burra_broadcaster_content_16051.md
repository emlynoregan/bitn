The Auxiliary raises funds largely by catering.  It provides teas for Council meetings and conferences (like ICOMOS) and for clearing sales and of course, the Melbourne Cup Luncheon.  This latter moved from the Town Hall to the Sports Complex this year and raised c. $1,400.  Money spent on helping the Burra Hospital this year totalled $2,721.45.  Elected were: President, Hazel Newcombe; Secretary, Celine Stockman and Treasurer, Kaye Boulger.
