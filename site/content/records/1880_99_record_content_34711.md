Nelson Hills Dairy Farm.

Messrs Forder Bros have started a dairy to supply Broken Hill with milk, butter, eggs, poultry, bacon etc.  The first can of milk went up on 12 Jan. 1888 and their plan for cooling the produce proved eminently successful and it is now sold in Broken Hill as pure as it is taken from the cows.  Other firms have joined them: one from Jamestown.  The Forders are now remodelling along the lines of the model farm at Roseworthy.  Arrangements are being made to do 14-15 lb of scalded cream at one time from the steam engine boiler.  There is a 110’ deep well of pure water and nearby is a room in which a De Laval cream separator will soon be placed.  They have also negotiated for a Zero refrigerating machine, which will enable bacon to be made in hot weather and butter as hard as in winter, and this should arrive any day now.  They have over 250 tons of ensilage for the hot months stored 18’ deep.  Near the 6 h.p. Ransome and Son engine with tubular boiler is a stone built underground dairy and underground wooden coolroom insulated with sawdust to which the refrigeration unit will be attached.  There are also six acres of almond trees.
