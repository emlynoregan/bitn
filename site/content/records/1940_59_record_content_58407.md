Burra Progress Assoc. met on 25 March.  The report on a successful Christmas Pageant was received and action to buy an extra £11 worth of presents for children was endorsed.  It was agreed to hand the £65 raised to the Caravan Park Fund.  The Association will support the Coronation Celebration Committee in its parade, children’s sports and the Coronation Ball.  Any surplus funds will be divided between the War Memorial Oval Fund and the Hospital Building Fund.  Another approach to the Government will be made on the poor state of the Burra-Marrabel Road.  At present it is believed there is about £700 in trust for a swimming pool.  Plans and specifications were drawn up in 1934, but would need to be modernised and further discussions will be held.  A minute’s silence was held in respect of the death of the Queen Great-grandmother, Queen Mary.
