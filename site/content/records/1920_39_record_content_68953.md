R.A. Bevan as Hon. Secretary of Burra Cycling & Athletic Club writes endorsing Council’s decision to build a grandstand at Victoria Park.  Its lack has led to sports being conducted at Aberdeen, 1½ miles from Kooringa and ½ mile from Aberdeen.  Victoria Park is the home ground for the Burra Football Club and it is also the ground that fosters the coming generation through its use by the school.  The park has provision for a good cycle track and could be excellent for football.  He wished them success and offers any assistance.
