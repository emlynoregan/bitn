Mongolata Goldfield

Work has been suspended till New Year.

Takati (Pexton’s) has recently put through a parcel averaging 2oz 18dwt per ton with 19dwt from tailings.

Fred Lewis’s claim adjoining has encouraging results with a shaft dug from old diggings over 40ft with a 30ft cross-cut east opening a big lode.

J. Kellaway’s claim south of Lewis’s gave excellent results at last crushing and warrants development.

Another promising discovery has been made out east near Chalk Cliffs Station and the claim named Anderson’s Reward.  Gold was first found there 40 years ago and it will now be tested.
