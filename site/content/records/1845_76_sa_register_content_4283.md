Floods.  From our Kooringa correspondent:

‘The late heavy rains have caused an immense destruction of property among the huts excavated in the banks of the creek.  Some months ago the Patent Copper Company made a roadway across the creek for the use of the carts carrying the ores from the mine to the smelting works.  This roadway being raised several feet above the level of the creek formed a complete dam across the waterway, a very small channel being left for the water to flow through.  On Thursday morning the creek assumed a very alarming appearance, and the channel through the roadway soon became choked.  The water soon rose above the roofs of many of the huts, the inmates being glad to escape with their lives.  Upwards of eighty huts were utterly destroyed, the furniture floating about in all directions.  The water accumulated so quickly that in many instances large sums of money were forgotten to be removed.  In one instance a man dived after his money, said to be upwards of £100, and succeeded in recovering it.  It was a sad sight to see the women and children midst the heavy rain  endeavouring to save their furniture from the flood which had destroyed their dwellings, and having no place to go for shelter.  Many found shelter in the stables belonging to the “Smelters’ Home” public house, and in Messrs Thompson and Kekwick’s stores.  The officers of the South Australian Mining Association rendered assistance to the unfortunate sufferers by sending carts belonging to the mine to assist in conveying such furniture as could be saved from the flood to a place of shelter, and as many families were admitted into the storehouses now being erected as could find room.'
