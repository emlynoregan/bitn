The Burra Entertainment Group’s recent production of Agatha Christie’s Afternoon at the Seaside and Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury is reviewed.  The production was very favourably received.  The sets by Roger Boehm for the Agatha Christie play were particularly good and Olive Oates as pianist did a fine job.
