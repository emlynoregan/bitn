Kooringa News, 13 May

Accident/Obituary.  A young man named Woods was a bullock driver carting firewood from the Murray Scrub.  On Friday morning in the company of a lad named Williams he was riding in the scrub seeking their bullocks when Woods’ mare fell and brought down both horses.  Williams was soon up, but he found Woods had fractured the base of his skull.  Williams went for aid and soon found a man called Sampson.  They returned and found Woods still alive, but insensible.  After some delay they obtained a bullock cart and took the deceased to Mr Barker’s property of Baldino [sic: for Baldina].  They did not get there till nearly 9 p.m. and Woods had expired about an hour earlier.  It is unlikely that medical aid would in any case have been of any avail.

An inquest was held by Dr Mayne on Saturday, which returned a verdict of accidental death.  Woods was the support for his aged parents and sisters.

[Charles Wood died 8 May 1863 aged 18 at Baldino Hills [sic], residence Kooringa.]
