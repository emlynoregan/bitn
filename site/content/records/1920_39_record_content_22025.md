K.B. Watts the butcher has been having meat stolen from his slaughterhouse frequently over a period of nearly 12 months.  About every 8 weeks some 30-40lb, mostly beef, disappeared.  About a fortnight ago he had reason to suspect people living opposite him and as a result a police search of Mrs Stevens, a widow, and her brother named McGahan were charged with unlawful possession and she was fined £10, being given two months to pay – she being the tenant of the house.  The case against the man was dismissed.
