Note that for the first time news appears on page 1.  It is only ⅔ column in column 6 and was certainly not a move to put major news in an eye-catching position.  This week’s topic was a general article on forest conservation.  This did not immediately become usual and when news appeared on page 1 it was often a small and insignificant item, but sometimes a considerable amount appeared.
