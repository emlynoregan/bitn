Editorial on the Last Meeting of the old Council.

There was further unpleasantness in reference to a letter that W.H. Hardy had published castigating the Inspector J.R. Gray.  Cr Linkson sought redress in Council without much satisfaction.  He moved the Council censure Cr Hardy for going to the press before raising the issue in Council, but Cr Hardy moved it be deferred until Monday night and that was carried.

If the Inspector is guilty of the alleged offence he deserves to be asked to resign, but if Hardy is guilty of misrepresentation then he needs to be so dealt with as to induce him to keep strictly to the truth in the future.  The trouble is over the recent court case of Thomas Builder.  Cr Parks resented the Record describing the Town Clerk as the keystone of the Council.  No meeting was held on Monday night so the matter will lapse.
