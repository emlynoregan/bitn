Burra Town Council, 1 November

Cr Riggs was concerned at the motion passed at the last meeting in his absence empowering members for East and West Wards to oversee some works.  This seemed to reflect on him as Chairman of Public works.  He said the attack on him at the last meeting was cowardly and unjust.  He wanted to know what right the Council had to interfere with the duties of the Chairman of Public Works in his absence and without consultation.  He had taken action to return men from other wards to their work in Hardy St and noticed men cutting grass from footpaths when in a month’s time it could have been removed by burning using the Fire Brigade that had to be paid for anyway.  The truth was the rates were too high.  It was better to have a credit balance than to waste money kerbing market gardens and empty allotments as in East Ward when footpaths in front of new houses were not fixed.  Nearly £100 of North Ward money had been used in a contract and if that were deducted, it compared very favourably with other wards.  There was much left undone pro rata which had been ordered in North Ward as in other wards.

Mr Oborn of the State School wrote thanking Council for removing dangerous rocks from near the school.

There was further sniping between Cr Riggs and Crs Kellock & Kellaway.
