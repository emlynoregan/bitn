SA Election – Dinner of Mr Mildred’s Friends

A large gathering of Mr Mildred’s friends took place for a dinner at the Pig & Whistle last Tuesday evening.  Dr Carmichael took the chair supported by Mr Cox, Mr Corey and Mr Johnston as vice-chairman.

Toasts were proposed or responded to by: Mr Thomas, Mr Barker, Mr Gubbins, Mr C.J. Ware, Mr Chapman, Mr Langmead, Mr Barclay, Mr Coward, Mr Weir and the chairman ad supporters named above.

Mr Johnston commented on Mr Challoner’s remark at the dinner honouring Mr Kingston:

‘…that every penny of the wealth of the Burra had come up in the ‘kibble.’  If that gentleman had really said so, he would beg to remind him that it was not so; that the settlers, teamsters, shepherds, &c., had, more properly speaking, been the support of the trade and prosperity of the Burra, to say nothing of the produce of the gold-fields…He should recollect that all are mutually dependent on each other.’
