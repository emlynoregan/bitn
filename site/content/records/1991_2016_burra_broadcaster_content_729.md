Johnny Greenhorn writes to the editor in reply to R.J. Phillips’ letter of 2 September:

[Basically he says he is just glad to see someone doing something about planting trees and not just talking about it.  If concern about native species is so great then try doing something about it.  He does, however, fail to address the heritage points made by R.J. Phillips.]
