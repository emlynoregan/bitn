A.B. Riggs writes as Secretary to the Trustees re the Burra Institute:

The AGM of subscribers will be held on Friday 30 January, to receive the annual report and balance sheet and to elect officers and committeemen.

At the last meeting of the Trustees Mr A.B. Riggs as Secretary to the Trustees reported that upon application being made to the Institutes’ Association [for permission to sell the Institute to the Burra Corporation] a difference of opinion had arisen and he had refused to sign the two certificates sent for his signature.  His reasons being:

The two resolutions carried by subscribers were confirmed with certain conditions attached.  Without those conditions they were not confirmed.

There is no secretary to the Institute at present to sign the certificates and no other person can sign them.

It appears that the [Institutes] Act was drawn up having in mind that a committee of management exists in all Institutes and without it the Act cannot be enforced satisfactorily to both parties.

Mr Riggs’ report was adopted and he was requested to inform the Council that negotiations between the Trustees and the Corporation for the sale of the property had therefore fallen through.

This brings us back to where we were twelve months ago.  It is essential that there be a Committee of Management.  Despite the troubled times the Burra Institute Library remains second to none outside Adelaide.

I appeal to all subscribers to show up on the night and show that Burra is still on the map.
