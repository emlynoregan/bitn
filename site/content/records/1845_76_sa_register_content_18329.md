Anniversary of the Bible Christian Chapel

On Sunday 12 March three sermons were preached at the chapel.  Mr J. Trewin from Bowden preached in the morning and evening and the Primitive Methodist minister Mr J. Warner in the afternoon.  On Monday amidst wind and clouds of dust a goodly number of people assembled in the schoolroom for a tea meeting and the public meeting followed at 7 p.m. in the church.  There was a proposal to aim to pay off £1,000 of the debt on the chapel within two years.  This would leave only £200 owing.  Promises of nearly £400 were received and if a further £400 can be raised in the next two years the District Meeting has engaged to make up the £1,000 by giving £200 out of its funds.
