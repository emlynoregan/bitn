Editorial on the Baldina Water Scheme.  The report of J.W. Jones, the Conservator of Water is finally available.  The perennial supply at Baldina is too highly mineralised.  To store the floodwaters would cost £35,000, which is prohibitive.  Mr Jones is however, prepared to recommend a scheme costing £8,000 for a smaller reservoir with distribution pipes which would provide stock water.  At 5% this would represent £400 p.a.  If landowners in the area can raise this sum then Mr Jones would recommend the scheme to the Government.  It would impound 100,000,000 gallons and serve an area about 12 miles by 14 miles.  It would not employ many labourers however.  For this latter purpose he is going to fund a large new reservoir at Mongolata on the stock reserve.  This will take 40-50 men at 4/6 a day from next Tuesday and also 10-12 horses and carts.  All in all this is a prompt and useful reply to Burra’s appeal for help.
