Thefts.  On 11 June a window valued at $400 was smashed at Gaslight Collectables and this caused the business to remain closed for the long weekend, resulting in trading losses estimated at up to $3,000.

On 19 June the Miners’ Couch was broken into and a variety of items were stolen.  Damage to the premises was estimated at c. $1,000.
