Local Board of Health

The Director of Education has ordered that no school can be closed on account of an epidemic without the express sanction of the Minister.

The Ambulance committee recommends a charge of 5/- in town and 1/- a mile both ways for country service.  W.R. Lee is appointed ambulance driver.

Privy accommodation at the school is a disgrace and a letter is to be sent to the Director of Education.
