The Season.  To the east the situation is dire.  Hardly any vegetation is to be seen.  Many paddocks are as bare as the road.  Hundreds of sheep can be seen starving.

The Chinamen with their two windmills have enough to do to obtain the needed dampness for their gardens.  If the Floricultural Society decides to hold a show it will be a sorry affair.
