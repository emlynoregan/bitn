Ourselves

The Record was established in 1878 by whom we do not know, because the files from 1878 to 1883 are not obtainable.  In those days it was printed on a hand press and it took three employees an hour to print 250 copies of one side.  Today we can print up to 2,000 with one man on the machine, the whole plant costing around Â£3,000.  In 1883 it was taken over by the late Mr Frederick Holder (later Sir Frederick) and was conducted by him for a number of years.  It had various owners till the present proprietor took possession in 1912.  It then had a very small circulation, but that has gradually increased until now it goes into nearly every residence in the town and district with a circulation as large as any purely country paper in SA.  This issue of eight pages illustrated is the largest and most ambitious yet printed.
