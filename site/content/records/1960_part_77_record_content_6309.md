Anzac Memorial Service.  The Burra commemoration was marred by wet and wintry conditions.  About 250 attended, but owing to the rain at the commencement, the actual service was transferred to the RSL Hall in place of the Rotunda.  After the address by the Rev. T. Drought about 45 ex-servicemen led by the Pt Pirie Pipe Band marched to the Commercial St Bridge and returned to the Memorial where the formal laying of wreaths took place:

Mayor E.T. Baulderstone for the Burra Town Council and Citizens

A.D. Radford for the Burra Burra District Council

L. Fiebig for the Demobilised Soldiers Association

W. Carpenter for the Fathers’ Association

H.R. Cornelius for the Burra Sub-Branch of the RSL

T. Rogers for the Air Force Association.

After the service members of the band were entertained by the RSL members at afternoon tea.

Rev. Drought’s address is printed.
