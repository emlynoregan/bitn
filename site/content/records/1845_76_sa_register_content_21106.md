Cartapo Cobalt Mine

Results of samples of smelted allot from Cartapo ores average 26.29% cobalt and 69.72% copper.

The report of Mr Francis says the patent process used offers the mining world a means of smelting low grade copper ores and offers a better process than any wet or acid process.  The resulting alloy can be treated with suitable acids and reagents to separate the copper and cobalt metals or their oxides and salts.  The main use for cobalt at present is in smalts [i.e. glass] for giving the beautiful blue colour to glass, china and earthenware, but there are many other potential uses.  William Davey has been appointed Captain of the Mine.  He reports raising good ores from both the north and south levels.  They have also opened new workings.  There are about 19 bags of ore at the mine.  The Directors intend to continue raising ore, but before anymore smelting is done, they will await the results from ores shipped to England.  If the results warrant it they will erect smelting works on or near the mine to make the alloy and so reduce freight costs if the ore had to be sent.
