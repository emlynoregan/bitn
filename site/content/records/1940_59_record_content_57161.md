Burra’s First Christmas Pageant was held last Saturday evening.  It was organised by the Burra Progress Association and was a success beyond all expectations.  2,000 or more people lined the streets to see the procession, which left the Hospital at about 6 p.m. and travelled down Commercial Street.  [The series of floats is then described.]

After the pageant an open-air concert was staged on a specially built stage.  [This is also described in some detail.]

A dance was then held in the RSL Hall.  £26 was taken at the door and Mr W. Nankivell was MC.  Mr Young’s Orchestra supplied the music.  Much of the success is due to the work of R. Cummins, President of the Progress Assoc. and of J. Wohling, its Secretary.
