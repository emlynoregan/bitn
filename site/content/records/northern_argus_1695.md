Paxton Square

In the unrestored cottage (one of eleven) vandals had sat on the dirt floor and scrawled psychedelic-coloured words on the stone walls where whitewash peeled off in fragments.  They had sat around a burnt out shell of a fireplace and passed through the corrugated iron lean-to added in the 1930s, when poor families in the Great Depression had sheltered extra babies and boiled their clothes in coppers.

The three rows of eleven cottages each were built by the SA Mining Association in 1849.  Two thousand miners and their families had lived in dugouts in the creek banks, but floods had forced them out so Paxton Square was built.  There were a few changes over the years.  Verandahs were added in the 1930s and the rows of backyard toilets were later removed.  In 1913 John Lewis, a former Burra resident, bought the square and presented it to the Burra Corporation to be used by ‘the indigent and deserving people who did not get drunk’. 

[Actually the Corporation rejected the offer, fearing that the income generated would not cover maintenance and they would be left with a bill.  Eventually a Trust was established to manage the cottages.]

Paxton Square was gazetted a Historic Reserve in 1969.

Twenty-two of the thirty-three cottages have now been restored and adapted to low cost holiday accommodation.  They feature whitewashed walls, open fireplaces, Berber carpets, slate floors and pine furnishings.  The renovations were possible following a $150,000 J150 grant, money from a Federal Government job creation scheme and funds from the Lewis Board of Management.
