Cr Helen Stockman said the Council just wanted to show that the boiler house option was feasible, but had been blocked by the Heritage Conservation Branch.  Now it seemed the town would lose the project altogether without even being consulted.  The Council wanted a meeting between the executive committee of the Jubilee 150 Board and the working party of the Heritage Conservation Board.
