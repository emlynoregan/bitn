The mayor asked him not to reopen the fire and to put a dash of Christianity into it.

Cr Rabbich said he was asked for an explanation and had given it in as mild a language as possible, but no doubt the Council could not understand it, but they might have seen he meant no insult and would say the same again, he did not mean to express an insult, but the Council had been anything but respectable [sic] to him and he would have to consider.

Cr Sampson said if Cr Rabbich had made that apology at the start the matter would have been settled.

Cr O’Leary echoed Cr Sampson.

They went around in circles a while longer with Cr Sampson accepting the apology and Cr Rabbich denying it was one and eventually the motion was put and carried with Cr Rabbich refraining from voting.

The committee reported the bridge at the rear of Smith’s was unsafe and recommended a second rail.

J. Lewis representing Bagot, Shakes & Lewis waited on Council about the watercourse and said the question reminded him of ‘Much Ado About Nothing’.  He believed the present Council was ignorant of some of the facts.  Some 11 years ago his firm had purchased some blocks from the Mining Co. and had them fenced and had one watercourse filled in altogether.  The course in dispute was allowed to remain and an opening through the brewery wall, which adjoined, was large enough to carry all the water through, since then the Council had raised the ford at the southwest corner of the brewery about five or six feet and the result was the watercourse had silted up to the division wall at the boundary of their yard and the brewery, leaving an opening that would not take a quarter of the flow it formerly did, consequently, to protect their own property they had put stuff in the creek and it had remained there 2 years and 10 months before busybodies had discovered the water was flowing down the street and causing a lot of damage, even washing out trees if it were allowed to remain.  The Corporation officer had cut the obstruction through, he had given him notice about the matter and then placed the matter in his solicitor’s hands, who had advised him he could fill the course up; he had done so and he had been summonsed by Council and fined 5/- plus costs.  He felt inclined to appeal, but he would be fighting against himself as they were the largest ratepayers in the Ward.  He had, through his solicitors, served a notice on Council to lower the ford, but they had not.  He had since received a notice from Council giving him the levels which did not accord with those taken by professional men.  No one would gain by going to law except the lawyers.  We were willing to pay one third and Catchlove & Co one third of the cost of diverting the water.  He had no wish to go to law and would offer to pay half the cost and keep it in order for five years.

The Mayor said the matter was a legacy from the previous Council.

Cr Rabbich objected to some of Mr Lewis’s remarks.  They had no desire to go to law, but if the obstruction were removed there would be no division [sic] [diversion] required.

Mr Lewis: the court evidence said the creek at times came down a banker and was in places 10’ wide and 6’ deep.  Would the opening carry away such a volume?
