Flash Floods hit the Mid North again over the weekend as falls of up to 104 mm were recorded.  Washouts occurred at many floodways.  The Worlds End Highway was closed from the Thiele Highway intersection to the Industry Road-Three Chain Road intersection. Baldina and Newikie Creek pushed silt and mud across roads making them impassable.  Houses were flooded at Eudunda and rapidly flowing water damaged gardens, streets and floodways.  Fierce winds and hail were experienced at Gum Creek and Leighton, while Farrell Flat and Mintaro experienced intense hail, some the diameter of a 10 cent piece.

In Burra storm water flooded the rear of the Burra Hospital, the Open House Gift Shop, the Luck Dip, Saltbush, local garages and the CookO’Burra snack bar.

Crops have been damaged in a band from Whyalla to Morgan.  Unreaped cereals have been lost, with losses of c. $100 per ton as produce is downgraded to feed.  The Hut and Hill Rivers flooded.  The fall will put some moisture into the subsoil, but at a considerable cost.

Lightning damaged ElectraNet’s 132 kV Bungama to Baroota transmission line and cut power to 3,500 consumers.
