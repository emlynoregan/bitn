BCS Staff Profile: Mrs Vicky Moore

I will be teaching Year 8-12 English.  I live on a farm between Auburn and Manoora.  All my teaching has been in the Mid North; Gladstone and Booleroo Centre High Schools some years ago and more recently contracts at Clare and Riverton as well as some primary schools.  I am having to get used to full-time work after being part-time for the last 14 years.  I am married to Gerald Moore, whom some of you will know for his painting skills and his love of trees and the stage.  We have three daughters.  The eldest is attending the University of Adelaide, the second is a hairdresser in Adelaide and the third is at Clare High School.  I am involved in the Auburn Players and have umpired netball and am a member of the Min-Man Club.  I am also a Councillor for the Saddleworth and Auburn DC.
