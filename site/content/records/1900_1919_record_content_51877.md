Burra Town Council.

Officers retiring in November:

Mayor		E.W. Crewes

Councillors	Radford, Harris & Dane

Auditor		Frank Treloar

The wheel guards on the Bon Accord Bridge have pulled out and the logs will be renewed.

Cr McWaters has bought a harness, saddle & britchen for the Council and a young horse on trial at a rather expensive Â£40.

Cr Radford said it had been hard to find a good horse and although dear this was a good animal.

Sympathy has been extended to the families of W. Harris and F. Duldig on the loss of their sons at the front.
