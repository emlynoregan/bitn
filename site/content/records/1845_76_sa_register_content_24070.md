Obituary.  Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson aged 48 has died after being ill for some time.  About eight or nine months ago a change of place was recommended and he took a voyage to New Zealand for two or three months.  He returned apparently much improved, but the illness unfortunately returned and took a serious form about ten weeks ago.  From then he has been confined to bed and in extreme pain from ulceration of the bowels.  He was conscious to the end, which occurred at 10 p.m. on Thursday 10 August.  Society has lost a good citizen and a man of considerable scientific attainment.  Religion has lost a faithful and earnest teacher.

We believe he was born at Corfu in the Mediterranean and after schooling attended the College of Civil Engineers at Putney near London, completing his studies at King’s College.  About 1850 he was employed as a civil engineer on the metropolitan railway works in London, where he managed several heavy contracts.  His then partner is now the Metropolitan Engineer.  He then decided to devote his life to the ministry and soon afterwards set sail for SA, arriving some 17 or 18 years ago.  He was first stationed at Burra where his evangelical preaching and earnest piety secured a large following.  In 1862 or 1863 he succeeded Rev. A.R. Russell at St John’s, where he remained until his death.  After some years he also took the oversight of St Bartholomew’s Norwood, which was erected mainly through his exertions.  He was one of the very few Episcopalian ministers who practically exhibit any sympathy in the work of other denominations.  He was a member of the Evangelical Alliance.  He favoured simplicity in worship over Ritualism.  He has also taken on the education of a limited number of pupils for some years and given lectures on scientific subjects.  We believe he leaves a widow and four children; two daughters and two sons.  One of the latter has distinguished himself at an English University and is now in the service of the East India Company.

[Denzil John Holt Ibbetson died 10 August 1871 Adelaide aged 47.  SA Deaths CD gives Denzel as the first name, but the four children registered in SA record Denzil as their father’s first name.
