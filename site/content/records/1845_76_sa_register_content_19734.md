Kooringa News, 27 September

The Legislative Council Election passed off quietly in Burra.  Only 53 of 250 electors bothered to vote.

Rev. Lionel W. Stanton gave one of his excellent readings to aid the Owers’ Fund at the Burra hotel.  The building was crammed and some £9 was raised.

The Kooringa Auxiliary Destitute Board has called tenders for the supply of rations for destitute people.  This will save the Government money and please local tradespeople.

Mr Macaulay of the Road Board laid out the road from Kooringa to Redruth last Wednesday.  When completed it will be a great boon and its construction will employ many now out of work.

The railway committee pursues its aims with determination.

Rain in the last fortnight and warm weather has brought on growth and the farmers are in good spirits.
