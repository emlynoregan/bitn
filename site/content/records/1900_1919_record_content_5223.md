Supreme Court, Adelaide 25 February.

Mary Quinn appeared before the Chief Justice charged with murdering her baby and concealing the birth.  The evidence was essentially the same as that given at the inquest in Burra.  The judge ruled there was no case to answer as it could not definitely be proved that the child had been born alive.  He instructed the jury to find her not guilty on the murder charge.  The jury found her not guilty of concealing the birth.
