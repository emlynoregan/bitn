‘Back to Burra’ Requirements

Still needed for the procession on Saturday 24 October:

A bullock team – up to six would be welcomed

Mules and Spanish drivers

A group of miners in white moleskins, red handkerchiefs, blue shirts and beards, with crib bags and billies

A water carter with barrels as in the mining days

Someone to get the old mine bogey going: it may need some grease after being in one place for 45 years in the Mine Store

A Foo Foo Band (i.e. a temporary aggregation of players, hopefully of harmony, but not worried by an occasional discord)

Girls with umbrellas and perambulators

Boys to form a Nigger Minstrel Band
