Anzac Day was commemorated in Burra on Sunday at the Market Square War Memorial.  About 80 returned men marched, led by local RSL President, Mr C.M. Beckwith, Mr Ross Humphrys, President of the Air Force Association and Mr C.W. Knight, President of the Demobilised Soldiers’ Association.  The march left the RSL Rooms and proceeded to Kangaroo Street before returning to the Memorial where the service was conducted by Rev. L.R. Lenthall and Rev. D. Haydon.  The music was provided by the Marananga Band under Bandmaster Roenfeldt and afterwards they played at the Hospital.  Members of the Church of England Boys’ Club were helpful in assisting with the parking of cars and the distribution of hymn sheets.  Wreaths were laid by C.M. Beckwith (RSL), C.W. Knight (Demobilised Soldiers) and Ross Humphrys (AFA), W. Carpenter (Fathers’ Assoc.), The Mayor (Town Council) and E. Finch (Burra Burra DC).  A band member played Last Post and Reveille.

Rev. Haydon’s address is printed.

The Annual church Parade this year was held at St Mary’s, conducted by Rev. Lenthall.
