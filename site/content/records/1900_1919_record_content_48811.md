Burra Town Council.

Letter from English & Australian Copper Co. saying it intended to dispose of its property in January and asking if the Council wished to purchase any of it. The area included the Smelts.  A road starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Company’s property.  Councillors considered that the road should go right through.  Cr Radford believed the road had been surveyed through.

An arrangement had been made in a similar case at Penfold St [sic], but was not shown on the survey map.  A sketch plan of the land to be sold is to be asked for.

[There is no Penfold St, but perhaps Penglawdd St is intended.]

The Railway Commissioner appealed against the assessment of railway cottages.  A decision is pending in the Supreme Court.

The White Hart Hotel ford is to be paved.

T. Highett is appointed lamplighter at Kooringa at 1/- per week per lamp for 15 lamps.

J.B. Griffiths applied for the north end of town at 12/- per week for 5 lamps, an increase of 2/- a week.  Accepted.

G.A. Ridgway writes attacking Cr McWaters for his gratuitous insults on the women of the North Ward at the ratepayers’ meeting.  A bridge at the White Hart would serve a racecourse, showgrounds, sale yards and a quarry and in wet weather the way around involves a steep climb to use the Redruth Bridge.  Any argument that it is not required is equally applicable to the bridge just built in Kooringa.

‘Consistency’ writes complaining of infringement of the Early Closing Act – perhaps at Aberdeen, as that was his address.
