Patrick Le Vagueresse writes thanking the paper for the story about the theft and vandalism at the Burra Baseball Club.

Support, both verbal and financial has been overwhelming.  The club is again back on track to attend the SA Country Baseball Tournament in October thanks to the help and the money raised.  Special mention to the Burra Menâ€™s Shed, Burra Op Shop, David Smith of Burra Uniting Church, Darryl Venning, John Cummings of Pt Adelaide, those who donated at the SALA Festival, Kooringa Hotel, Burra Golf Club and Linda Badman of Mt Bryan.
