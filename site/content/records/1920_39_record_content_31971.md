The Governor’s Visit.  The Governor came to Burra on Saturday at the invitation of the Burra Burra Show Inc.  The President I.J. Warnes met the Governor at the station.  The official party then visited the hospital where they were met by the Matron, Sister G. Seigle and the Hospital Board.  They toured the facility.  They then went to the showgrounds where school students and staff were assembled and Boy Scouts formed a guard of honour.  A civic reception followed.  The Mayor A.B. Riggs welcomed the Governor who then responded.  Mr Warnes then entertained the official guests at luncheon.
