Burra Town Council.  Some further mysterious aspects of the actions to save money.

£10 has been taken from the Town Clerk

£7-10-0 has been added to the Overseer.

£1-14-0 has been spent to advertise positions

£10 has been taken from the Inspector

10/- a month extra goes to the Cemetery Curator, and pays him 6/6 instead of 2/6 for Sunday funerals.  About £12 p.a.

In all officers lose £20, but additional salaries come to £23-10-0.

Ratepayer writes saying Cr Rabbich is again trying to pose as the working man’s friend, but first slashes salaries.  They pay Mr Jenkins 6/6 a day and the Engineer £2-10-0 a week or just 7/- a day. (For a 10 hour day seven days a week.)  While Jenkins works an 8 hour day six days a week.  Where’s the justice?
