Accident.  A blow-out caused a panel-van driven by Mr J.W. Grover of Brighton to roll over about five miles from Burra last Saturday.  The panelling and cabin were torn off when the van rolled over and all passengers were thrown onto the road, where miraculously they all survived with only shock and abrasions.  The occupants were Mr & Mrs Grover and their two sons aged 3Â½ years and 4 months.
