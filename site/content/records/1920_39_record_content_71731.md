The motion to borrow by debentures was lost without discussion.

Mr M.W. Bednall said that as a consequence the Corporation could not borrow money to carry on and would have to default on payment of wages etc. or collect rates one month after they were declared – in August instead of next March.

Mr Worth then put the case for the Institute.  He said that on the figures put to them they would see the transfer of the Institute involved the Corporation in little if any extra cost.  The most recent balance sheet gave an estimated income of £322-7-6 and expenses of £330-4-2.  There is a mortgage to the State Bank of £3,161-18-3 plus £39-10-6 interest to 31 December 1937.  Assets are £5,905-12-10, leaving an excess of assets over liabilities of £2,704-4-1.  No cash other than the costs of transfer would be required.  In round terms for taking over a liability of £3,000 the Council gained an asset worth £6,000.  Why does the Institute Committee wish to surrender such an asset?  They feel the management of the Institute is a matter which should be in the hands of the ratepayers.

Mr A.B. Riggs moved that the Burra Corporation acquire the Institute, as the proposition was sound.

Edgar Pearce spoke against it.  The committee would, if it needed public support, get more than the Council would.

Mr Bednall said the transfer required:

The consent of the ratepayers

The consent of the Council of the Institutes Association

The consent of the Minister of Education

The consent of the State Bank
