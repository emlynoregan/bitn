Burra Hospital Board Meeting, 19 October

The cat nuisance is less, but continues.

Nurses have linoleum on their floors.

Inspector General of hospitals recommends transferring the southern part of the Apoinga District to the Eudunda Hospital for rating purposes.  The Board will write objecting to this suggested change.

Dr Steele said Burra should include North Booborowie, as he frequently is called there and said once Clare Hospital opens it is likely they will lose Farrell’s Flat to Clare.

There was discussion over whether to appoint a new Maternity Wing Committee or continue with the old one.  Finally the old committee remained with the new Chairman (Mr Hawkes) added to it.

Dr Steele commented on the paper report that the town doctors declined to work together.  He said he had never declined to work with Dr Ashton and Mr Davey was wrong to say that because they had a court case they could not consult professionally.  Dr Steele withdrew while the Chief Secretary’s reply about appointing two medical officers was discussed.  The change was not approved.

Applications have been received from both doctors to be appointed medical officers with the right of private practice, but without other remuneration.  Mr Davey moved they appoint both.  Mr Melrose said it seemed to be against the rules, but the motion was carried.  The Chief Secretary is to be advised of the appointment of two medical officers by the Board, which considers there is sufficient reason to alter Rule 8.  [Whether this was according to rules was a matter of divided opinions.]
