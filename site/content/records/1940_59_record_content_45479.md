Burra Hospital Board received a delegation from Burra Red Cross on Friday.  Given the amount of money raised by Red Cross for the Hospital, that organisation feels it is time women had a say in the management of the Hospital, with a woman on the Board.  This could require changing the regulations, which could be done at this yearâ€™s General Meeting.
