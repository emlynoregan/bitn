W.H. Hardy contributes about 11/5 columns on the Education System.  He comments on an article by a Mr Stetson who says that modern education has seen a decrease in the more brutal crimes of violence and brutish behaviour, but an increase in crimes using skill, such as fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation etc., because modern education ignores religious and manual training.  He comes to the conclusion that ‘Christianity alone is the health of the State’.
