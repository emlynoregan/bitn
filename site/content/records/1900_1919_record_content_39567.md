Burra Town Council

Cr Wicklein asked leave to make a statement.  Granted.

Of late many hard things had been said about him.  They had been repeated to him and he had done his best to ignore them.  He had been accused of disloyalty and cruel and false accusations had been made.  It was falsely alleged he had been born in Germany.  His father was of Hungarian origin but had been naturalised 50 years ago.  His mother and all his family were born in SA.  He was as loyal to his king and country as anyone, but under the circumstances he felt it would be better if he stood down from Council and he asked leave to resign.

Cr Radford said if it were him he would stick to his guns.  He acknowledged the suspicion and no doubt there were disloyal persons, but he was sure this was not the case with Cr Wicklein.

Cr Lane thought it a hard matter to speak to and Cr Wicklein was in a painful position and if he thought it would help to stifle the rumours if he resigned then perhaps it was the better course.

Cr Harris was shocked by the statement and felt much as Cr Lane.

The Mayor acknowledged the rumours, thanked Cr Wicklein for his services and considered his decision a manly one, preventing further unpleasantness for himself and his colleagues.

Cr Wicklein thanked the Mayor for his kind remarks and hoped to prove his loyalty in the coming days and to offer his services again after the war.  Even his children had not escaped slurs being cast at them.

Cr Lane moved Cr Wicklein’s resignation be accepted with the deepest regret and a minute be placed recording the best thanks of the town for Cr Wicklein’s service during his three years in office.  Cr Harris 2nd and endorsed the motion.

Cr Harris announced he would not be seeking re-election due to changed family circumstances.

Mr A.J. McBride has been asked to stand for West Ward.

Mr T. McWaters will stand for East Ward and there is a move to get C.D. Wilkinson to stand for Mr Wicklein’s seat on West Ward.
