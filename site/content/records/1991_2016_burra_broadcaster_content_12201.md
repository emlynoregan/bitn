Letter.  Russell Skinner, Chairman of the Main Street Committee writes to say he considers the closing of the ANZ Bank branch as but one aspect of the ugly face of the economic rationalism that is scorching rural communities as public utilities and commercial institutions centralise their operations.  He regards their conveyance of the information in a form letter, with less than a monthâ€™s notice for customers to re-organise their financial arrangements, as appalling commercial ruthlessness.  Perhaps rural communities like Burra need to consider establishing their own financial co-operative.
