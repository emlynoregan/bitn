W.A. Rabbich was charged with feeding a sow on raw blood and denied the charge.  John Morgan said the sties were about 100 yards from the slaughterhouse, which is situated alongside the railway line.  He did not see the sow actually feeding, but did see the congealed blood in a trough the sow had access to.  Mr Packard objected on the grounds that the charge related to Section 1 when the premises were on Section 2881.  The SM dismissed the objection, saying the accused admitted he was the person intended by attending to defend the case.  The defendant swore there was no blood in the trough and he had not killed since the Friday previous to the Monday inspection.  He was supported by evidence from Richard Carpenter & W. Reynolds.  The SM said he could not convict on the evidence and believed the inspector to have made a mistake.  He gave a verdict against the Council for Â£2-11-0.
