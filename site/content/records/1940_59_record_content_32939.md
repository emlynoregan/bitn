Burra Town Council will investigate the use of weedkiller to keep streets and watertables free of weeds.

Victoria Park.  The War memorial Committee assembled 20 men with axes and crosscut saws on Saturday, despite inclement weather, to fell certain trees.  Mr Maurice Pritchard lent a circular saw.  Three large trees were felled and produced wood which is for sale.  Several tons have already been bought by local bakers and others.  The new oval was measured and pegged out according to plans which Mr F. Gunthorpe has almost completed.  Several more trees are to go and another working bee is called for next Saturday.
