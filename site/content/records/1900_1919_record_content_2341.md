Characteristics of the paper in 1900.

The paper was little different from 1899.

U.X.L. continued to provide a serial.

Early in the year there was considerable padding as for example on 31 January when there was a whole column of jokes and half a column of household hints.

What were apparent stories turned out sometimes to be disguised advertisements.

‘Night’s horrid Plague’ that keeps thousands awake and made life a misery, turned out to be ‘protruding or outward piles’ for which Doan’s Ointment was the answer, as it was for eczema, hives, sores, chilblains, insect bites, etc.

In all the paper was very uneven doing well at times and on some issues, but missing on others and not following up on some.

Editorial comment was generally missing.
