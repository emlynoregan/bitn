Burra Mine

Scenic Roads are expected to be open for tourists by mid-October.

It is impossible to open the area at present due to the amount of large machinery working in the area, to constructional changes made to roads and to landslides.  Blasting in the near future is also a concern.  Fencing of the dangerous area will begin this week, after which work will be undertaken to admit tourists, possibly by mid-October, with views from near the water tank on the hill and from the southern hill.

The Kapunda Musical Society will present Lilac Time at Burra on 17 October at 8 p.m. [in the Town Hall] to aid the Burra Swimming Pool.

Vandals and careless tourists are causing concern to the Lewis Trust.  The site is a gazetted Historic Relic and under an Act of Parliament damage can earn a fine of $200 or six months in gaol.
