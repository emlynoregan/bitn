The ‘Sydney’ Appeal was launched on Friday at the Burra Institute, when 30 to 40 people assembled.  The disappointing attendance was perhaps due to lack of publicity.

The evening started with the National Anthem and two verses of The Song of Australia.  The Mayor read Christmas greeting sent to him for Burra friends from: Sister Mavis Riggs, Ptes Ken Walker, Clem Davey and Eric Smith (all from abroad).

Mr Dollman & Miss M. Halliday sang the duet I’m waiting for someone.

The Mayor then delivered his address, which was followed by Mrs Max Pearce singing The Star of Bethlehem.

Mr Glen Hawkes then spoke in support of the appeal and the Mayor read a list of donations already received, which totalled £108-14-0 along with promises to bring that to £136-14-0.

The Mayor then introduced Captain Naish of Clare, the District Recruiting Officer.

[The editor thought this inappropriate at a meeting with a specific objective.]

Captain Naish provoked a sharp response from A.B. Riggs when he said he thought people should hand in their rifles as a donation, rather than asking for compensation.  He said of 104 collected to date from Burra, only 14 had been given.

Mr Genders then spoke on the effort [which specifically is not stated] and thanked Mrs A. Tennant for her work in the War Stamp Savings Campaign and urged people to reduce their spending and put their savings into War Certificates or Stamps.

The meeting ended with the National Anthem.
