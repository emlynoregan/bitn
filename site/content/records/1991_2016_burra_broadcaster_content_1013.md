Flood Damage is estimated to be in excess of $100,000 in the Burra Burra DC area and the council has applied for aid from the Local Government Disaster Fund.  It is not hopeful of receiving assistance due to the widespread nature of damage across the state due to the recent wide-spread rains.  Council will continue to repair minor road damage, but wet weather continues to hamper efforts to clear culverts, and major repairs will have to be postponed till drier conditions prevail.
