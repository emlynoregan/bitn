Burra Hospital Board

P.A. McBride resigned, as he had left the district.

No charge-nurse has been procurable for the salary of £80.  [The going rate in Adelaide being £80-£90.]  With respect to a query from the Inspector-General of Hospitals the Board replied that it was not in favour of a resident surgeon being appointed, but if one were the question of his being allowed to charge private patients at the hospital would depend solely on what salary was paid to him.

There was considerable discussion arising from the Chairman’s previous suggestion that people who could afford to pay had gone to Adelaide and got free treatment.  The Adelaide authorities now wanted names!  Mr A.J. McBride (Chairman) said he had spoken generally.  Mr Radford and Mr Crewes seemed to want Mr McBride to talk his own way out of the difficulty, but ultimately the Board stood with him and said that he had been generalising and if a specific case came to their notice in future they would oblige with a name.
