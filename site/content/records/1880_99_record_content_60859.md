John Newcomb, a well-known identity in Burra, was charged in Adelaide with obtaining from C. Moore & Co. by means of a valueless cheque for £5, goods to the value of £4-18-7.  The outcome is not yet to hand.

[There are two earlier references to a John Newcomb, the first in VIII. 617, 4 Feb. 1887, page 2, where it reports that the confidence man, John Newcomb a.k.a. Charles Hope, who has been tried in Adelaide, has been sentenced to six months hard labour.  The second is very different and may not refer to the same person XIII, 1091, 11 May 1892, page 2:Last Tuesday John Newcomb left The Gums Station with his two-year-old daughter for medical treatment, but before he reached Mr Bell’s place at Baldina the child died and his horse was knocked up.  On examining the child Dr Brummitt said she had suffered convulsions caused by falling on a bottle with which she had been playing.  About six weeks ago the family had been travelling through Baldina on foot in a terrible state, not having had food for several days.  They were helped by Mr Kiekebusch who fed them and took them to The Gums where Newcomb found work.  For the outcome of this case see XV, 253 (2), 9 Dec. 1896, page 2. ]
