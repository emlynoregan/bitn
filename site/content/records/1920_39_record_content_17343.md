Back to Burra Civic Reception, Monday evening 26 October at Burra Institute.

On the platform were members of the Town Council and Mr Joseph Roberts (ex-Mayor of Port Augusta), Alderman S. Rawlings (Mayor of Broken Hill), John Mitchell (ex-Mayor of Kadina) & Messrs J. McLaren & E.W. Crewes (former Mayors of Burra) and Mr E. Bennetts.

Mr Collins greeted guests and was proud his father was present – undoubtedly the oldest man in the audience.  [Then aged 93.]  A number of those present could recall when people lived in burrows in the creek – one he had spoken to that day had lived in one for three years and survived being washed out three times.  The town had of late been full of happy faces and reminiscences of boys dropping stones down the creek chimneys into frying pans.

The idea of a ‘Back to Burra’ had first been suggested by a letter of Mr E.D. Bennetts of Broken Hill to the Record.  He personally had not contributed much, as he had been travelling interstate much of the time of the preparation.  The miners never envisaged that after the mine the district would become a great centre of wheat and pastoralism sending away in a year 50,000 bags of wheat and 100,000 bales of wool.

Crs Kellaway and Hammond supported the Mayor’s remarks.

The Mayor then turned the platform over to Mr Rawlings, an old Burraite who congratulated the town on its hospitality.

Mr Roberts then spoke and congratulated Mr Collins Sen. who was over 90.  He was glad to meet so many old friends and reminisced of being on the first council and of being washed out by floodwaters.  He had first come to Burra in 1854 in a bullock dray, taking six days and at 9 years old had to be on the hillside at 3 or 4 a.m. to get the horses to drive a wheel – the mine having just restarted after the exodus to the Victorian goldfields.  His father had been an engineman.

Mr Mitchell endorsed the remarks on the welcome received.  He came to Burra in 1857 and left it 60 years ago and until 1924 had not been back for 40 years.  He was amused at the improvements.  He had seen a mule team stuck in front of Drew & Co. for three days and in winter employees had to lay pieces of board across the street.  Now the roads and kerbing and footpaths put Kadina in the shade.

Major Harry Batchelor wanted to correct the statement in the Mail that the mine was extinct and also one in the souvenir crediting the Church of England Grammar School to Rev. Howitt instead of Rev. William Stanton.  Mr Perry and his wife at Redruth Gaol were wonderfully kind people.  He had left 45 years ago and not been back for 25 and the improvements since were wonderful.

Mr Bennetts said he had passed through in the beginning of the year and had so enjoyed the town that he thought other old Burraites would do the same.  Though he had been quite young when he left he had not forgotten either people or places.

Mr J. McLaren remembered Burra 50 years ago.  He said the absence of a town debt and of a debt on any public building was probably unique in SA.  The town had been barren when he came and tree planting had wonderfully improved it.  The Institute was the best conducted he had ever encountered.

Mr Birbeck reflected that he was still the ‘Little Jimmy Birbeck’ of the souvenir booklet.  His father had been a dispenser for a doctor and his mother one of the servants.

Mr J. Pryor had been manager of the Burra Mine when it was closed down.  He said he had the greatest pleasure in returning.  His parents landed in Adelaide in 1846 and it took several days to get to Burra.  He was born in the Burra Creek in 1850 and 11 children had been born into the family in less than12 years.  In those days with only five children it was not a family at all – averages were 10-18.  Boys began working at age 8 for 1/- a day and top wages for a surface man were 29/6 a week and 36/- for an underground worker.  The actual lodes in the mine had never been touched.  The company had only ‘pig-rooted’ just to exploit the carbonate deposits from the sulphide ores.  It was barely worked and badly financed and when it was necessary to prove the sulphide lode there was no money to do it.
