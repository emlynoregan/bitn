Bicycle Races on Saturday: 5-mile race won by F. Allen from J. Allen and 1-mile race won by F. Allen from S. Kuchenmeister.

Burra Show was held on 25 October in splendid weather and drew a record attendance.  The gate takings were Â£115.  A special train ran from Terowie.  An estimated 400 cars encircled the ring.

The Salvation Army provided the luncheon and afternoon tea.  The Hon. J. Lewis again attended.

Agricultural produce was down in numbers, but of good quality.

Dairy produce drew fewer entries, but splendid entries from Edwin Finch made up for this.

Poultry was good, but horses were fewer in draft, blood and roadster stock.

Horses in action were a very nice lot.

Cattle were of high quality, but both pig and dog numbers were low.

Agricultural implement returned.

Vegetables and fruit were well represented, though adverse weather cut the flower entries this year, despite which roses were good.

Cookery entries were down, Arts and Industries were well represented and the School Class was better displayed this year and well represented.
