Transport Control Board came to Burra on Friday to take evidence about the co-ordination of road and rail services.  The Mayor Mr Woollacott spoke of costs on the railways and also their unreliability and inconvenience.  Mr Lock, a carrier of Walkerville who works through to Booborowie, said a feeder service from Burra would not be suitable as it would cost more (plus 25/- a ton).

W.D. Thompson, carrier of Aberdeen, agreed with Lock.

H.N. Potter (manager for Drew & Crewes) said the firm did its own carting from the station, but parcel freight charges were excessive.  The railways had been more careful to prevent breakages since road competition.

F.T. Sara agreed that the road competition had improved the rail service.  Parcel service by rail was too dear.  The firm used rail except for petrol.

E.J. McKenzie, grocer of Kooringa, said he was satisfied with the rail service and carted his own goods from the station.

H.J.B. Jennison said rail charges on tyres were excessive.  Batteries saved 5/- on each one with road transport and road carriers were much better for rush orders.  Tyres were charged at parcel rates and even when prepaid to save 25% were still too high.

R.C. Lott, produce merchant, thought rail carriage was satisfactory, but the double freightage was a disadvantage.

H. Hill, railway carrier, supported Jennison’s complaint about excessive parcel rate charges.

I.J. Warnes cited excessive parcel rates, but also gave figures for wool cartage.

He carted 1119 bales of wool 80 miles by road to Mt Mary for £120.

The railway charge from Mt Mary to Adelaide was £358.

He then got a rebate, but even after that it cost £277.

If he had continued by road he could easily save £150.

[The £127 cost to Mt Mary included petrol, oil, wages and food.]

W. Kakoschke, carrier of Aberdeen, said all his carrying was outback.  He did not know of any wool going past Burra to Adelaide by road, but it was possible for pastoralists to cart their own wool.  A lot was carted to Burra railway station.

Other drivers present were S.R. King, H.O. James, J.G. Carpenter & W. Montgomery.

Some raised the question of back-loading charges.

W. Kakoschke said he carried back-loading free; it saved the lorries and if the drivers had trouble the sheep farmers never made a charge for their keep in the meantime.  He would rather take a cwt free and save his lorries.

Mr Warnes said if back-loading were to be charged for they would be seeking a reduction in forward loading charges.  All back-loading in the last 30 years had been done free.

Mr Hill said years ago it [back-loading] was 1/3 a ton and now it is 6d.

R.A. Bevan, passenger carrier between Aberdeen and Kooringa supported the previous statements about excessive parcel freight charges.  He did not believe lowering the charges would affect the amount of freight carried on goods trains, but the Chairman thought passenger trains would be overcrowded with parcels.

Mr Warnes said the present charges were simply driving the parcels to road transport.
