Burra Hospital

The Board of Management has estimated the cost of new Nurses’ Quarters at £8,000.  The present accommodation for nurses is both uncomfortable and inadequate.  The Chief Secretary has discussed the scheme with the Board and viewed it with favour.  On applying for a £ for £ government subsidy, the Board was asked for a new estimate of costs.  While this was being obtained the Board had purchased a block of land adjoining the Hospital grounds on the western side for the erection of the intended buildings.  J.R. Barker presented a rough plan of the proposed buildings, based on the fine hospital, which was built at Barmera some time ago.

Dr Steele also outlined a plan, which he had in mind and Mr Woollacott, as a builder, pointed out that building costs would be reduced considerably if the new building were erected on a broad front.  The site purchased would involve considerable excavation work if the building were to be placed far back from the main road.  No decision on the plan has been made, but it will include separate bedrooms for all nurses, fitted with bathrooms and shower cubicles, a modern laundry, sleepouts for the nurses and separate sitting rooms for Charge Nurses and Probationers.

We understand that the Board will need to raise further funds before the new building could be free of debt, even if the Government grants the sought for £ for £ subsidy.
