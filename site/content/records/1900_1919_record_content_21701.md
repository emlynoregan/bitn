Redruth Court, Monday.

Luke Day proceeded against Charles Streicher for £6 in lieu of one month’s notice plus damages of £15.  The defendant claimed £4-19-0 for unlawful detention of a book and £2-16-11 for the balance of wages.  The court decided in favour of Day and ruled Streicher should forfeit two weeks’ pay and pay £3 in damages, less £2-16-11 due for wages.  Thus the verdict was for £2-13-1 with the defendant to pay costs.

Pal Singh sued Ralla Singh for £8 for a horse allegedly sold to the defendant.  The evidence was so conflicting that the case was dismissed with each to pay his own costs.

Accident.  On Friday Mr J. Davey, employed by Drew & Crewes of Kooringa, was pouring bisulphide of carbon into a pint bottle when it ignited.  Some spilled onto his trousers and burnt holes there as well as on his socks and shoes.  Water soon extinguished the flames on Mr Davey, but great care had to be taken to prevent the spread of the fire to the shop.  Mr Davey was only slightly burnt himself.  The cause of the fire is unknown.
