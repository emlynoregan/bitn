The Status of Women in Burra District 1880-1940.  Research by Tanya Liebenau, BCS Year 12 History.

In 1900 there were three times as many men as women in paid employment.  Women were employed as teachers, storekeepers and hotel keepers.

1920.  The population of Burra was 1751 â€“ 832 males and 919 females.

1920.  47% of deaths were males and 52% females, but 60% of males had obituaries in the Burra Record, while only 40% of women did.

By 1920 almost 50% of males and females who died had more than one obituary.  [How does this fit with point 3?]

Obituaries for men tended to be significantly longer than for men throughout the period.

On headstones in Burra Cemetery 1880-1940 more information is recorded for men irrespective of marital status.
