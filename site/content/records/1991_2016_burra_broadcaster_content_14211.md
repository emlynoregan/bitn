Tourism Promotion is paying dividends with visitors and passport buyers for the first three months of this financial year up by 39% on the same period of 1996.  Interstate visitors exceeded SA visitors in September, probably for the first time ever.  Alan Botting has been working hard at promoting the town with new brochures and pursuing a major event in the form of an Arts & Music Festival in February-March 1999 that would include an innovative stage on the Mine Pool.  Other projects include a ‘Bluebird’ train service to Burra for special events, a Merino Capital Museum and a new range of local tours.  All this is having a positive effect on the local traders’ turnover.
