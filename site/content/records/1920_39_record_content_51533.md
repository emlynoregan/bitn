District Council Boundaries

The submission of the Mt Bryan DC to the Commission on Council Boundaries by I.J. Warnes & C.E. Collins is printed in full over some 2½ columns.  It outlines the history of the DC, saying it began about 1868, but the Hundreds of Mongolata & Rees were added in 1877.  Gradually the district’s main and district roads have been brought up to standard and now need little money for maintenance except when flood damage occurs.  Mt Bryan is the social centre of the district and the local Soldiers’ Memorial Hall is used for socials and dances and has a billiard room.  The submission outlines the economic responsibility and efficiency of the DC and their method of working.  It describes the geographical conditions.  The western half of the district is good agricultural land within Goyder’s Line and the east is purely pastoral with the promising goldfield at Mongolata.  The west naturally generates most of the income, but also has most of the roads requiring attention.

The submission is strongly against any amalgamation and outlines six grounds for their stance.

They took it as a basic principle that decentralisation was desirable and the effects of amalgamation on Mt Bryan would be deleterious.  Presently pay day at the Council generates a lot of business for local businesses and the Council finds it suitable to circulate a certain amount of its expenditure there too.  This would be likely to cease on amalgamation, unless Mt Bryan were the centre of the new Council, in which case the disadvantages of centralisation would afflict another small centre.

Amalgamation would likely see the control of the District Hall removed to more distant hands out of touch with local needs.

The presence of the District clerk was an advantage to locals who consulted him on Council business and other local matters.

To the west at Booborowie and to the south at Hanson the residents were out of touch with Mt Bryan people and shared little community of interest.

Amalgamation of land assessed at a much higher value would mean a new assessment and a higher rate to the disadvantage of the ratepayers here.

The move would run counter to local feeling expressed at a well-attended local meeting.

The present Council was efficient, well run and responsible in its conduct.
