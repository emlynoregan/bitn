Obituary & Inquest.   Robert T. Allaway died at the Burra Hospital on 24 May.  An inquest was held by F.W. Holder JP on 25 May.  [Aged 57.]

Dr Brummitt:

The deceased died from alcoholic poisoning.  He had been staying at Worby’s Hotel in Farrell’s Flat from 10 March to 15 May at £1 a week board.  He had spent about 9/- to 10/- per day. [In the bar.]

The jury concluded that the deceased died of alcoholic poisoning and that Arthur Worby ‘is quite unfit to hold a licence and should be most severely censured for his conduct in permitting deceased to spend all his money and also for sending him to the hospital in the neglected state in which he was.’
