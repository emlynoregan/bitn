Railway Extension to Burra

A public meeting was held at the Court House in Redruth, Wednesday 12 June, to consider the best means of advancing the cause of a railway to Burra.  About 100 attended.  Mr M. MacDermott took the chair.

Mr Goodridge said that it was desirable for the railway to be extended from Forresters to some point near Redruth and moved a motion accordingly.  [His arguments were basically as previously noted.]

He thought there was not the remotest chance of the Burra Mine being restarted unless a railway was built.  He believed the natural place for a temporary terminus would be just above the Bon Accord Mine at Redruth – he said temporary, as he predicted it would be extended to North West Bend.

Mr John Sampson seconded it and argued that Burra could offer more inducements than any other place for expenditure on a railway on account of the mineral wealth and because that would produce more traffic than 50 miles of agricultural land.

Mr West also supported the motion.

[In addition to the points already made he stressed the fact that a terminus near Redruth would enable the farmers of Mintaro and other villages to send their produce to the profitable market Burra would provide.]

The resolution was carried.

Mr Samuel Sampson proposed that Parliament commence the necessary works without delay and at various places.  He criticised the slowness of the northern railway so far – Parliament had approved the 25 miles to Forresters and as yet only 5 miles had been let.  He thought the route through Forresters passed through better country than an extension from Kapunda.  The line to Farrell’s Flat and then to Redruth would be most beneficial to the colony because it could be extended to the Murray – an easy extension because except for two or three miles the country was flat.

Mr Woollacott seconded the motion.  He said 600,000 acres had been sold along the line of the proposed railway and yet not £10,000 from that had been spent by the Government north of Forresters – rather it had been squandered on roads and fine buildings about Adelaide and down south.  Last season 1,000,000 bushels of wheat had been produced north of Forresters and that could more than double if there was a railway.  He predicted more people employed at the mine and in Burra than ever before.  When times were prosperous he himself had paid away £12,000 a year in carriage.  Carriage from Burra to Adelaide by drays would not pay so well as formerly because the land was all fenced and depasturing cattle on Crown Lands was now impossible.  He too complained of the slow progress of the line north from Roseworthy.  The motion was passed unanimously.
