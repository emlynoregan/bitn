The Jinker

The lightweight structure around the Burra Mine Jinker has been repaired after almost two years of resting in disrepair.*  It was damaged after a vehicle accident which also moved the jinker.  People have been concerned that the jinker is now very close to the side of the creek and could be threatened by another accident.  It has been decided to leave the jinker in its present position as being the course least likely to further damage it.  Artlab has evaluated the jinker and found it is in reasonable condition and did not require substantial repairs either through the accident or structural deterioration.  It is one of SAâ€™s oldest transport vehicles.  It once came to Burra from Adelaide pulled by 40 bullocks.  It was designed to transport an 18 tonne pumping engine.  A new shelter has been talked about for some years, but without any great progress.  [* This statement is incorrect.  The paper reported the accident in Edition No. 941, 16 June 2010, page 4.]
