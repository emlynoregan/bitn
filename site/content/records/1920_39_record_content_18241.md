Obituary.  Mrs Jane Prior who died on 8 January was born in Dublin Ireland on 4 November 1832, the daughter of Mr & Mrs Rasdell.  She arrived in SA in 1850 and came directly to Burra.  After a few years she married Mr James Prior who was killed in the Broken Hill mines 19 June 1900, after working there only a week.  They were both members of the Bible Christian Church and later she was a member of the Methodist Church.  She lived alone until the last five months.  She died peacefully in her sleep.  There were four children: Mrs H.W. Collins (NSW), Mrs John Honan (Hallett), Elijah Thoma Prior (Copperhouse) and Elisha Prior (Hallett).  There are 31 grandchildren and 74 great-grandchildren.
