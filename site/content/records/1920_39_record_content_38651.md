Mr Wedding: stopped using rail when they charged him demurrage on an old machine he could not collect for a few days.

A.R. Groverman (blacksmith): used road for everything as a purely economic decision.  Too often parcels did not arrive when expected by rail.

Wilfred Kain (farmer): lorry was not cheaper, but was better for small consignments of stock.

E.E. Gill (pig farmer of Spalding): used road service to Jamestown.

The Chairman said they had to consider closing the Clare-Spalding line or the Riverton-Spalding line.

Mr Gill said he was for rail to carry super and wheat were road could not compete.  The line was vital for wheat.

G.G. Hallett of Spalding (manufacturer): he sent stuff all over Australia and found the railways useless for state delivery.  He asked the railway for preferential rates, but they were only available for guarantees of so many tons.
