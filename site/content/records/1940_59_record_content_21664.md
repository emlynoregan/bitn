Burra Milk Supply is in danger.  The main supplier is R.H. Garrard of Hillside Dairy and he informs us that owing to overwork and the seeming impossibility of obtaining suitable labour, he will be likely to have to close his dairy at the end of the month.  This will mean at least 170 families will be looking elsewhere for their milk.  The remaining milk vendor refuses to leave the main road to serve customers in Burra and in any case would hardly be likely to be able to supply 170 additional families.  Mr Garrard complains of the amount of government forms to be completed, the problem of feeding so many cows in dry conditions and the trouble of finding feed for them.    He has been unable to get former employees released from the army despite support from local government bodies.
