Burra Town Council.  At the last meeting the question of petrol rationing came up.  Cr T.H. Woollacott considered country people were at a greater disadvantage than city folk, who could use trams and trains at almost any time of the day.  It was resolved that two delegates be sent to raise the issue with Mr P.A. McBride MHR.  Cr Bevan said he received only 14 gallons per month to deliver goods to the whole town.  Cr Baulderstone said that with a truck he could bring much higher quality fruit and vegetables to the town than could be delivered by train, but he had only enough petrol for a fortnightly trip to the market.

At present it is illegal to sound the fire siren for any fire occurring outside the town area.  After discussion it was resolved to seek permission to sound the siren if help was required to fight a fire within the district.

A letter was received recently in which G.R. King asked on behalf of a religious body called ‘The Watch Tower Society’ for the hire of the Town Hall for a lecture titled God’s Kingdom on This Earth.  Several Councillors spoke against granting permission and Cr Lee said he knew of disturbances that had been caused through this body and it had been banned from the city and suburbs.  It was decided not to grant the hire requested.

The Council will seek legal advice on the duty of the Electric Co. concerning whether the company’s agreement with the Council obliged it to have all wires covered 12 feet from the insulators on premises. This follows the recent death through electrocution of a young boy in Burra.

Royal Adelaide Show Society & SAJC Officials examined the Burra Racecourse and Showgrounds to see whether the Show Society & Burra Racing Club could both use the Syndicate’s grounds at Burra North without interfering with each other.  A number of committeemen from the three bodies concerned attended.  Mr Rowell, Stipendiary Steward of the SAJC and Mr Thurston, Curator of Morphettville Racecourse made suggestions that would improve the racetrack with little effort.  There was no definitive recommendation, though it seemed to be a general opinion that a move to the Syndicate’s ground could be advantageously carried out.

Mr Finniss, Secretary of the Royal Adelaide Show said the present showground could continue to be used, but it would never be possible to hold trotting races on the present ring.  The ring was not in good shape and the jumps were incorrectly placed.  He also said the practice of parking on the hillside was dangerous, though this could be rectified by terracing the slope.
