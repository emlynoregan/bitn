Christobel Warnes (aged nearly 4), daughter of Mr & Mrs Tom Warnes of Old Koomooloo – some 44 miles east of Burra, disappeared from her home on Tuesday morning.  Tom, Jim & Rex Warnes and helpers from their station searched for her all day.  When she had not been found towards evening the police were notified and a search party from Burra was organised and departed at 3.30 a.m. on Wednesday.  It began searching at dawn.

Black trackers under Murray Napier of Morgan Police Station arrived later and tracked the girl along the road to a dam.  Fortunately the tracks also led away from the dam, but were then lost when she appeared to keep to the road, which had had much traffic over it by then.  Appeals for more help led to over 150 people being involved by day’s end.  Searching was difficult due to high grass, thick bluebush and saltbush as well as trees and prickles.

The girl was found by Messrs Bert Villis & Max McBride when she was within two or three hundred yards of the homestead at Koomooloo.  Christobel suffered little from her experience.  She appears to have had a drink at the dam and was not unduly hungry, though she had prickles in her feet after taking off her shoes.  Apparently after the dam she had doubled back and so set the searchers off in the wrong direction.  Christobel said she had gone to find Daddy.

Mr & Mrs Tom Warnes express their heartiest thanks to all who gave so much time and effort in the search and the Mayor of Burra and Constable W.R. France of Burra North also thank all those from Burra & District and from Morgan who did so  much.  Burra was dead during the search with shops closed and people went also from Booborowie and surrounding towns.
