[The argument about the economics of the quarry in 1950 might be valid, but the first sentence is quite misleading.  The quarry seems to have started with the extension of the line north of Burra in the 1870s.  It was certainly mentioned for the extension of the line to Terowie, which was in 1880 not 1894 as stated.  After that it was certainly not abandoned.  It worked intermittently, but until 1912 at least it frequently employed between 20 and 40 men and sometime ran a night shift.  Years mentioned after 1894 as being busy included: 1899, 1904, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911 & 1912.  After that references seem to suggest minor working was carried on at various times for road metal, despite strenuous efforts to get it re-opened for ballast in the 1930s.]
