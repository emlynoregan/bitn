Mt Bryan DC has been newly formed and it is said a Chairman has been elected, an assessor appointed and a clerk and ranger chosen.  The only notice of their intention to do so seems to have been a written notice in the bars of two public-houses.  Ratepayers think they are entitled to know a little more of what is going on.
