Robertstown Asbestos Mine

There has been much activity at the new mine.  Iron sheds are replacing tents for the miners.  They were told there would be no pay unless the venture proved a good thing.  The mine was formerly run by SA Asbestos & Mining Co., but it closed down.

A report on 31 December 1920 said that a portion of a group of mines had been worked for a number of years and marketable asbestos had been obtained from the larger seams, but it is evident that hand-picking is not the proper method to pursue.  Practically all the pits were shallow, but there was plenty of asbestos in bunches, veins and veinlets.  It was fine, silky and of a French grey colour.

[The article then discusses the extraction and quality of the fibres.]

The report says Robertstown asbestos was identical with blue South African asbestos.

There was another report in the Mining Review of 1929.  Similar tests were carried out and Robertstown asbestos came out on top.  H.W. Gartrell of the Bonython Metallurgical Laboratory said that for insulation purposes it was superior.  The asbestos presently being obtained will be treated at Eudunda mainly by water.  Buyers will come up from Adelaide to spend a week on site when it is up and in full swing.
