Page 2 makes a couple of points about the history of the Burra branch:

The supplement celebrates the refurbishing of the office.

Elders began in Burra in 1890 in the then new handsome two storey building that is currently the Visitor Centre.  [Clearly, given the data on managers on page 3 of the supplement, 1890 is when Elders moved to their new office, not when they started in Burra.]

Burra was then a prime farming district, but its production capacity was nothing like its modern ability.

By 1902 Burra was recognised as the principal livestock market in SA.  Elders alone had yards to hold 40,000 sheep at a time.

Before going on to say how great the company is and how wonderful its range of services.
