St Joseph’s Catholic Church Centenary

Bishop Brian Gallagher of Port Pirie consecrated St Joseph’s Burra exactly 100 years from the day it was officially blessed and opened on 8 November.  The celebrations continued over the weekend.

On Friday the church was consecrated.

On Saturday there was a special Mass of thanksgiving and a Parish Picnic at Aberdeen Oval.

Seventeen priests from the Diocese of Port Pirie and the Archdiocese of Adelaide attended the consecration ceremony.  One was Monsignor W.H. Nesdale who was parish priest of Burra 52 years ago and is still active as Parish Priest of Georgetown.  Monsignor T. Toal of Jamestown is a brother to Dr M.F. Toal, who was a former Burra priest.  Fr Laurie Quinn came from Loxton.  Fr M. Kineavy, the priest previous to Fr Kevin Matthews, was also present [and the other visiting priests are listed.]
