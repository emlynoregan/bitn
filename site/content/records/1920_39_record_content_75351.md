A.B. Riggs responds to N.H. Pearse’s letter about TSRs.  He says that the area from Overland Corner to Florieton is as dry as anywhere in the state and stockowners have an obligation not to allow their stock to get into such a weak condition and there is no excuse to break the law, especially if exemptions, if sought, could be granted.  To put stock on a TSR for the sole purpose of feed may be a safe investment if they are fit to travel five miles a day, but because one Council allows the law to be broken is no reason to dub another autocratic for refusing to follow that mistake.  The fact that the TSR in question is not required for its original purpose and should be cut up and leased to adjoining properties (in which I agree with Mr Pearse) does not alter the case.  And neither does the fact of the ranger’s horses running thereon.  That merely constitutes another felony if true and proceedings should be taken against the ranger.  The fine was not the maximum as mentioned, but the minimum and should be considered reasonable agistment.  Criticism of findings and penalties should be undertaken only after mature and careful consideration.  They must reach their decisions only on the evidence before them and only then can they temper justice with mercy.
