Burra Town Council.  There was some debate whether kerbing was done better by tender or the daymen.  Cr Sampson said the daymen had done 3ch 2ft in 8 days, which made them cheaper than the tender.  After discussion no tender was accepted and the work in Welsh Place was left to the daymen.

A footpath is to be formed near the German Chapel.

About 3ch of footpath is to be formed on Mitchell’s Flat leading to George St.

Minor works to the wings of bridges to improve safety were approved: near the Police Station and near Mr Lewis’s.

There was concern about the wood reserve in the Hundred of Bright as it has been surveyed and its sale would seriously inconvenience the town.  A letter will be sent to the Commissioner of Crown Lands asking that it be neither sold nor leased.

The mayor believed that SAMA was liable for the interest on the construction of the main from the main road to the company’s houses in the Mine and a good sum must be due the Corporation.  The Town Clerk is to ascertain the cost of construction and collect the interest due.

A letter from W.T. Rabbich predicted a worsening employment situation.  Already there were 300 unemployed on the Barrier and Millar Bros work on constructing the Broken Hill railway was drawing to a close.
