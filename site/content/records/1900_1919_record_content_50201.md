J.S. Pryor forwarded his resignation as lamplighter for Kooringa unless the pay was increased to 1/6 a lamp per week.  The contract for lamp lighting was cancelled and new applications will be sought for Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Ed. Bowen’s quote to paint the Mortuary Chapel was accepted at £10-5-0.

Cr Dane said the continuous telephone service was failing at times when the exchange could not be raised.  The postmaster’s attention will be drawn to it.

Members for the District are to be asked if it is intended to restore the Saturday night train and if not then a deputation to the Commissioner will be arranged.
