Burra High School

Miss Pat Payne will be the new principal for 1975.

She is the first woman principal of a fully co-ed High School in SA.

Characteristics of the 1974 paper.

There was not a very comprehensive news coverage of Burra.  Sports get a reasonable coverage and reports from many societies’ AGMs are frequent, but anything actually written by the paper itself is sparse and often inadequate.  The reports on the two floods in Burra for the year are typical of this, being quite brief and lacking in detail.  Even the ‘Out & About’ column is less comprehensive than in earlier years.  There are many articles that act as ‘fillers’ and many items of general interest (particularly to primary producers), but also fillers giving hints to the handyman (on painting for instance).

After page 1 the layout of the paper varied from week to week, but the following outline is quite typical.

Page 1	Typically full of news, but frequently little of it relating to Burra.

Page 2	Large advertisements and sports.

Page 3	Large advertisements – typically more than half page – plus public notices and sports.

Page 4	Large advertisements and a mixture of sports, news and articles of general interest.

Page 5	Advertisements with some news and general interest items.

Page 6	Large advertisements, the cash column, public notices and entertainment.
