Sims Metal is recovering the old railway line between Eurelia and Peterborough.  They started at Eurelia in mid-September and they have reached Orroroo, expecting to complete the work in three months.  Much of the 50 and 60 pound line is likely to be used on Queensland sugar cane tramways.  The fishplates, bolts, etc. will go to China as scrap metal.  [Photos and further details.]
