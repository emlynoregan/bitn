United Labor Party Meeting, last Wednesday in the Institute.

Hon. J. Jelley and Mr Norman Makin addressed a gathering called for 7 p.m. to avoid clashing with the Patriotic Films.  At 7.30 about 30 electors were present and 20 girls from the Reformatory.  People then rolled in to fill the hall by the time the pictures were due to start at 8 p.m.

Mr Jelley outlined the 25 years service of the ULP to the people.  He was anti-conscription, but pro-recruiting.
