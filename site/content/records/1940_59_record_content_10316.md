Burra Town Council, 18 May

The Defence Department ordered that all bridges are to be numbered.

On the question of financial aid to the Institute:

His Worship said the general feeling was that they ought to do nothing until the new Council was formed.

Cr Marston said the committee wanted the Council to have the responsibility of raising money for it without any say in how it was spent.  He could not see how a donation of £50 would make much difference to the £3,000 odd the committee owed the State Bank.  £50 would nibble at it and confer no benefit to ratepayers.  Council had not shirked its responsibility and had gone to considerable trouble recently in offering to take over the whole property at the request of the Trustees of the Committee.  After much shuffling, this offer had been refused and now the Council was again being asked for financial assistance.  He believed the Institute’s finances would not see daylight until they were taken over by Council.  As far as he could ascertain some members of the Burra Burra DC favoured a takeover of the Institute by both Councils.  This would undoubtedly see it become a real civic centre for the district, which would give it support from a greater number of people and ratepayers generally would benefit, as they would own a building that could become one of the finest of its kind outside the metropolis.  The balance of power in Library affairs would remain with the Library Committee, composed of subscribers.  The Hall Committee would also not want to interfere with the present arrangements with the Burra Talkie Proprietors, which were very profitable to the Institute.

Cr Marston moved the Council place this proposal before the Institute Committee and if they were agreeable, place it before the Burra Burra DC.

Cr Samuel asked what points the Council and the Committee disagreed on and His Worship said on the Library Committee and Burra Talkies.  The former was provided for in the Act.

Cr Lott thought they should only take over the Institute after the war and then have some big celebration to pay off the debt.  At Present the Council paid £36 p.a. for the room.  They could make a donation of say £86 and have sole use of the room.  There were four other halls in the Burra District and he could not see the District Council coming in on the scheme.

Cr Samuel seconded Cr Marston’s motion.

Cr Lott moved an amendment that Council give the Institute £86 p.a. for sole use of the Council Chamber.  This was not seconded.  The motion was carried with Cr Lott opposed.

It was resolved that the footpath on the Commercial Road side of Paxton Terrace be screened to the width of the verandahs.

[This last sentence makes no sense – given that Kingston Street is a continuation of Commercial Street, does it perhaps mean the footpath on the Kingston Street side of Paxton Square?]
