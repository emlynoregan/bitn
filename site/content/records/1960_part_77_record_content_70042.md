Burra National Trust AGM

President G.R. O’Connor.  The year has been one of consolidation.  With the aid of three amazing young women from the Salisbury College of Advanced Education the restoration of the dugouts was completed after a long delay.  As a fund raising effort a fence building job was undertaken on behalf of Samin Ltd and resulted in a nett profit of $780.  The Bon Accord residence bathroom was rebuilt and better facilities installed – much of the rebuilding was necessitated by white ant damage – a problem which has re-appeared elsewhere in the house and must be addressed immediately.  The museum continues to be a success and to attract many visitors.

Early in the year an old horse works was purchased and this presents members with the task of making it operative. Three haulage skips in very good repair were also bought and brought to the chimney site.

Due to difficulties associated with mining the area, we have not been able to remove much of the old haulway tunnel, which includes the remarkably preserved wheel.  A serious fault in the rock structure has made the area dangerous.  Roche’s will do their utmost to retrieve as much as possible.  I am concerned that membership remains static.  This is common to most branches, but is nevertheless a concern.
