Burra town Council, Monday.

The Railway Commissioner expects the Bon Accord gong to be installed this week.

Cr Wicklein moved that the footpath from Streicher’s to S. Burns’ corner Chapel St be tar paved.  Carried.  Cr Lowe moved the footpath from Sara’s to the Black Bridge be tar paved.

Lamplighters are asked to overhaul all lamps in view of Saturday’s explosion.

On 1 December the following officers retire from Council:

Mayor		Mr McLaren

North Ward	Cr Lowe

East Ward	Cr Lane

West Ward	Cr Wicklein

Cr Wicklein & Mr McLaren indicated they would stand again. Cr Lowe said he would not.

Nothing has been finalised about ownership of the creek.  One idea was for the Council to own a chain road along the creek with openings for road access at certain points.  Another idea was for Council to have absolute control to the rear of the fountain [Jubilee Fountain in The Avenue] and perpetual lease on any parts the Council might plant.

Messrs Fuss and Milner waited on Council for a reduction in the charge made for the oval for the United Friendly Societies’ Sports, which had resulted in a loss.  After discussion a full refund of the £3-3-0 fee was carried.
