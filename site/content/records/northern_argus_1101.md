Free Bridge for Burra

The School of Civil Engineering at the SA Institute of Technology has offered a prestressed concrete test bridge free to any interested Council.  It is 11 metres long by 1.6 metres wide and could be used as a footbridge across the Burra Creek.  Burra expressed interest and the bridge was delivered last Friday and will be stored until it is decided where to site it.  A prefabricated pedestrian bridge of similar span would cost about $12,000 excluding siting costs.
