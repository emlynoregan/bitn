Municipal Election.  The ratepayers responded to our call to keep undesirables out of the Council and unearthed a worthy candidate in Mr Alfred Bennetts.  He was declared elected unopposed.

[While not provable, it is likely that the ‘undesirable’ candidate would have been W.H. Hardy in the eyes of the editor.]
