Burra Institute Committee Meeting.

Much of the debate was over whether a lecture series was:

Desirable to ‘raise the intellectual status of the town’. 

Able to attract an audience.

Would pay for itself.

Mr Nield thought that if they could pay £80 for a dance floor then £15-15-0 for three lectures was not too much.

Mr Johnson thought that the loss would be considerable.

Mr Fuss thought the lectures should be thrown open and the Institute bear the whole cost, which Mr Johnson supported.

Eventually it was decided that they would bear the cost of two lectures illustrated with lanternslides for £7-7-0, though Mr Wilkinson saw it as a dead loss.

The Secretary reported that with 121 subscribers the reading room was crowded.  The President thought of throwing the reading room and the library into one.

The Institute has between £200 & £300, which Mr Wilkinson says was wanted for building extensions.
