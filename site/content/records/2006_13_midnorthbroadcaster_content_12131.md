Burra Field Days created 	a positive spin-off effect for local accommodation providers and food and beverage establishments.  Visitors came from all over the state and from interstate.  Burra Visitor Centre was kept busy arranging accommodation.  Numbers were up and indications are also good for people choosing accommodation in Burra for other regional events.  Mrs Jones of the Visitor Centre said they were nearly booked out for the Bundaleer Festival in April.

Organisers reported the field days to be the biggest in years.  Greenfields Merino scooped the Field Day Ram of the Year and the Championship Pairs.   Greenfields also got third place in the pairs and second in the rams.  East Bungaree was second in the pairs and third in the rams.  In the new feature of Ram Lamb Pair Competition the judges favoured Collinsville based daughter stud Roemahkita Poll Merino Stud near Cummins.  Drizzly rain and frequent showers on Tuesday failed to deter visitors and the marquees were full and dry.

A feature of the sales was $6,000 for a young White River Poll Merino ram hogget by the Daniell Family Minnipa and Poochera to Ian Rowett and family, Mernowie stud, Marrabel.
