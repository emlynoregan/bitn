Redruth Local Court, 21 July

Liston & Shakes brought a case against Charles Edlin for £18-12-3, being the balance of money he collected as their agent, but had not handed over.  After arguments the bench ruled that Edlin had been entitled to £22-15-2 in commission and so, after deducting the £18-12-3, he was owed a further £4-2-11.

Stephen Smith, ploughman and mailcarrier, sued his employer William Gubbins for £11-16-0 in due wages.  Judgement was for the plaintiff for £1 plus costs.

Thomas Thomas, a shepherd of Farrell’s Flat sued John Jonas for £10 for having poisoned his dog at the Hanson Hotel [Farrell’s Flat] on 10 July.  The case was adjourned.

Gebhardt claimed £5-1-3 from Coombs for meat supplied.  Coombs said he had a crippled wife and a child and earned 5/6 a day.  He could not pay anything.  He was paid monthly and the next pay day was 5 August. He was ordered to pay 10/- on 5 August and then pay off the debt at £1 per month thereafter.

Henry Skewes claimed £6 for the use of a road through his paddock and the value of a tarpaulin sold to the defendants, Robert Bull & Mr Martin.  Judgement was for the plaintiff for the sum of £1-10-0.
