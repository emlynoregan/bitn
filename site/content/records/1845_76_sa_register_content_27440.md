The Educational Wants of the Areas

J.A. Hartley, President of the Council of Education, will visit the Areas to ascertain their educational needs.  On Tuesday 21 March he will leave Clare for Yacka and on Wednesday will visit Jamestown and Narridy.  On Thursday he will go onto Rocky River and Crystal Brook and then by train to Port Pirie.  On Friday he will return to Crystal Brook and thence to Gladstone and Laura.  He will reach Wirrabara and Yarrowie on Saturday and Sunday.  On Monday 27 March he hopes to be at Caltowie and Belalie East and the next day should reach Gottlieb’s Wells and Yarcowie, reaching Burra the same night.  He will return to Adelaide on Wednesday.  In several of the places mentioned applications have been made for schools and in others educational reserves have been declared.  Soon Mr Hartley intends visiting the country west of Port Wakefield and Redhill.
