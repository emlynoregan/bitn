[The squatters had protested loudly over the revaluation of their runs by Mr Goyder and the fact that they would have to pay their licence fees in advance.  They demanded and got a select committee to look into the matter.]

‘Bushman Now’ writes from Kooringa 14 November.

Squatters may have to pay their rent in advance, but they pay little else in advance or even when due.  Wages are often paid months and in some cases years after being earned.  I have known cases where a shepherd has left £400 and upward in the squatter’s hands without interest.  If capital is worth 10% the interest would match his annual wages of £40.  Meanwhile the squatter was getting the shepherd’s services essentially for nothing and charging a profit of 80% on all the necessaries he had to buy.

Squatters insist on their servants dealing at their store and rarely cash an order for a hawker – and when they do a charge of 10% is made.

Other ‘disadvantages’ of the squatter:

They can without charge cut down scrub to make fences, cut timber for firewood, for building, for timbering wells, for huts, for troughs or to make charcoal.  They are allowed to bark trees for roofing etc.  They have unrestricted use of limestone and building stone.  Freeholders and leaseholders in the Hundreds do not have such privileges.  Mineral leaseholders pay a far greater rent and yet do not have such privileges, though they employ more hands and expend more capital.

‘A few firms are interested to a very great extent indeed, and these firms are all represented three or four times over in Council*, and having this power, it would appear they are determined to use it.’

[* i.e. the Legislative Council.]
