  Obituary/Inquest
  
  J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at the Burra Hotel on 11 August on the body of Jane Goodfellow, wife of J.A. Goodfellow, who had been found dead in her bed that morning.  E. Lipsett, foreman of the jury.
  
  John Andrew Goodfellow, licensed surveyor, described coming home at about midnight, having supper and then taking a 20-month-old girl from the cradle and putting her with his wife in bed.  He did not try to wake his wife, as she was very tired after washing all day.  He got up at 7.30 a.m. to get milk from a boy at the door and returned to bed.  His wife appeared to be asleep.  The child awoke about 9 a.m. and when he tried to rouse his wife he discovered she was cold and dead.  He sent for the deceased’s mother and Dr Dashwood, who said the deceased must have been dead for some hours.  Deceased had not complained of any illness, nor had she taken any medicine to his knowledge.  He had no reason to think she was contemplating suicide.  There was no one else in the house except another child aged 8.
  
  Annie Mann, sister to the deceased, had seen her about 9.30 p.m. the previous night.  She had not noticed anything unusual abut her and she had not apparently been ill.  She said she had been washing and had a pain in her back.
  
  Ellen Bourke has seen her in the garden about 5 o’clock the previous evening and heard her peak to the children.
  
  Dr Cave said he had received a message from Dr Dashwood at about 11.30 a.m. asking him to see to the deceased as he was very indisposed and not able to attend to her.  [Cave then described the position and other aspects of the body and said that rigor was fully developed.]
  
  He saw no signs of external violence.  The deceased was apparently pregnant and death may have resulted from fainting or internal bleeding.
  
  The inquest was then adjourned for Dr Cave to conduct a post mortem.
  
  [The report then goes into considerable detail on the appearance and condition of various body organs.  The key discoveries were that the lungs were very congested and highly oedematous.  The right side of the heart contained a considerable quantity of clotted blood.]
  
  Dr Cave concluded that the condition of the heart and lungs were sufficient to cause death.  The heart had probably been affected for years, but the lungs only recently.
  
  The jury found that the deceased had died from natural causes.
  
  ‘Before the rising of the Court the Coroner said that the Resident Government Medical Officer, Dr Dashwood, had treated the Coroner and Jury in a very disrespectful manner.  He was the first medical man to see the body, and the proper person to have given evidence, but had sent a very lame excuse through Dr Cave for non-attendance, after having been requested by Lance-Caporal Smith to attend.  It was well known that Dr Dashwood had been attending private persons during the sitting of the Court, and if he could attend patients he could have been in court.  The Foreman said that the majority of the Jury fully concurred in these remarks.’
  
  [Jane Goodfellow is registered as dying 10 August 1875 at Kooringa aged 32.  She was born Jane Armstrong.]
