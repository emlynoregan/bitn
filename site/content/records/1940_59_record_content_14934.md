Weather.  Sheep have died in their hundreds, if not thousands, in a cold snap following early shearing due to zoning.  These regulations have brought shearing four to six weeks early in the district.

After the recent dry spell rain fell last week in cold conditions.  132 points were recorded locally.  Agriculturalists welcomed a soaking for the subsoil with over an inch generally reported.  To the east falls were patchy and reports so far show Ketchowla received 43 and Collinsville with 80 points was the highest figure.
