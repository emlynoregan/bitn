Obituary and Inquest.  J.D. Cave JP sat as coroner at Devil’s Hole on the body of Mrs [Ann] Nicholls, a widow, who had been killed the previous evening.  The deceased was crushed under a spring cart when the horse bolted on the way home from Burra.  Evidence was given by Bridget Gentle, wife of James Gentle and by James Gentle, a farmer living near Booborowie.  The verdict accorded with their evidence and the jury donated their fees to the deceased’s family.  [Died 17 June aged 45]
