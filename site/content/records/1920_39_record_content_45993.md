Frank Treloar: Looking Back

Four years ago I wrote a story of the Burra Mine based on some books saved from the debris of the mine by Alf. Walker and myself, from clippings from my father’s diary and interviews with early residents, most of whom are now deceased.  I said I would fill in gaps from another point of view that was then out of reach.  I now have that information.  My booklet started when Mr Burr was appointed Mine Superintendent and I will now go back to the earlier stage.  But first I will consider South Australian conditions in 1845.

The Governor was the ruler and money was very scarce.  Transport was by bullock dray with a maximum capacity of 2½ to 3 tons.  SAMA (SA Mining Assoc.) was formed 16 April 1845 with a capital of £5,000 and liberty to increase it to £20,000.  The capital was to be raised by scrip certificates of £5 on which a deposit of £1 was to be paid by 15 April 1845 and the balance by the 15 May.  The objects of SAMA were to purchase and sell mineral lands, to carry on mining when advisable and to let on royalty or otherwise.  There were to be seven directors chosen annually, three of whom must retire by rotation every year and became ineligible then for one year.  The first members of SAMA were:

W. Paxton	John Ridley	G. Bean

J. Dickens	John Newman	George Stevenson

G.S. Kingston	Jacob Hagan	Samuel Stocks Jnr

C. Beck	Henry Mildred	W. Peacock

E. Solomon	J.B. Neyles	Michael Featherstone

J.B. Graham	J.C. Sleeman

Holders of scrip certificates 1-359 were entitled to double their holdings at par before 16 September 1845.  SAMA’s attention went first to discoveries in the Adelaide Hills, but nothing of importance was found.  Then the Gawler Plains attracted attention.  Henry Mildred had oversight of these cases.  He became a notable citizen.  He was first Provincial Grand Master of the Freemason’s Lodge in SA and when a Lodge opened in Burra in 1850 it was he who gave the Provincial Warrant or Charter and the Lodge was called the Mildred Lodge.  Later on the Charter came from England issued by the Grand Master there, the Earl of Zetland.  Both Charters are preserved at the Lodge in Burra.  About this time a rumour in Adelaide suggested a valuable mining district had been discovered, but nobody seemed to know where.  Probably the talk began when a shepherd went to Messrs Bunce & Thomson’s, merchants in Rundle St and told him he knew of a valuable mining district and would tell him of it for a reasonable consideration.  Mr Bunce took the offer, paid the money and received the information.  He engaged a Mr Fink to check out the site.
