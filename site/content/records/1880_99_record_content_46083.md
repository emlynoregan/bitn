Burra Hospital Board, 14 July

It was decided to apply to the Government for the erection of a cottage for the porter’s residence and to fit up the rooms vacated in the hospital – one as a nurse’s room and the other as a ward for contagious diseases and for new windows in the men’s ward.  Cost estimated at £350.
