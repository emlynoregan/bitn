Local Board of Health

A letter from Dr Steele notes the report of the last meeting.  He says the resolution passed concerning his query on swabs misses the point.  It was not a question of what to do in an emergency.  What was needed was, as Mr Radford suggested, an advice from the Medical Officer which the Board then adopts as policy.  Dr Steele then explains the swab process in some detail and why it is done.  What Dr Steele wants to know is whether the Board is desirous of two successive negative swabs being the criterion for giving an isolation sufferer freedom.

Cr Kellaway and another considered the doctor’s letters both too long and too obscure.

The Mayor thought that Dr Steele should simply ask Dr Ashton what he recommended.

Cr Radford said the question was whether the Board should insist on swabs being taken and all they needed to do was to seek and accept the advice of their Medical Officer as he so moved.  Carried.

Dr Ashton writes a convoluted letter which essentially restates his now familiar position and suggests that had Dr Steele received the same treatment he had Dr Steele might have similar feelings in the matter.

‘A Ratepayer and Lodge Member for over 30 years’ writes complaining that the ongoing dispute with Dr Ashton was forcing a person to go to Adelaide for an operation at considerable expense that was an unfair imposition.

A Member of the Hallett Soldiers’ Memorial Committee writes defending the arrangements made at the unveiling ceremony and pointing out why a luncheon was not possible given the Governor’s arrival and also pointing out that as soon as the ceremony was over an afternoon tea was provided free to all returned men, their wives and children, who also gained free admission to the concert, supper and dance.

James O.V. Marron [check this name], Captain of the South Spalding FC, writes continuing the saga of the dispute in the Yakilowie Football Association.  [c. ½ column.]
