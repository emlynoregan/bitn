Expenditure

$5,000 was donated for the concrete steps.  Other expenditures included a new fridge, blind and front curtain, upgrading of the cutlery and crockery to 180 settings and some kitchen utensils.  We paid off the last $1,500 of our loan.  As the main committee has now lost the rubbish contract they will need more help than ever.
