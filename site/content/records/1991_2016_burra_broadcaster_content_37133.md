Burra Walk of Fame Committee met last week to consider two additional nominations for the Walk of Fame; Tony Ryan and James Tiver.  The Tony Ryan nomination came from the Council and James Tiver was nominated by the Tiver Family.  The basis for selection is as follows:

Candidates have made a significant contribution to their nation, state or community, whether in business, government, social welfare, sport, community organisations or work.

Candidates need not be born in Burra or have lived all their lives in the Burra region.

Nominations may be made by a family or by others with a knowledge about or connections with the candidate or by the committee acting on its own initiative.

Nominations should be accompanied by biographical detail and photographs where possible, with permission to reproduce that material.

The final decision rests with the Walk of Fame Committee.

The committee approved both nominations.

The Walk of Fame began with six plaques set into the footpath in front of the Burra Town Hall during Centenary of Federation celebrations, but can be expanded.  The original six were:

George S. Kingston 1807-1880

Sir Henry Ayers 1821-1897

Essington Lewis 1881-1961

Mary Warnes 1877-1959

John Collins 1859-1932

Sir Frederick Holder 1850-1909
