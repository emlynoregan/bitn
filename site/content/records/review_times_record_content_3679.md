Burra Creek.  The draining of the creek may lead to the cancellation of some of the public celebrations on New Year’s Eve if not enough water was in place by this weekend.  Mr S. Woolley secretary of the Burra Yacht Club said ‘you cannot expect people to enjoy themselves in stagnant water.’  Celebrations would continue, but without the water activities.
