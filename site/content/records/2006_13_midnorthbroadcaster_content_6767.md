Burra Christmas Pageant was held last Friday with decorated floats, childrenâ€™s bikes, horses and dogs and of course Father Christmas.  There was the usual barbecue (Burra Swimming Club) and drinks and lollies provided by the BBH Football Club.  The turn-out was the largest for a number of years.  The Wiech Family float was judged best.  [Other prize winners on the night are listed.]
