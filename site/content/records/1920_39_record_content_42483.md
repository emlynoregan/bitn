Burra Rifle Club held its AGM and Captain Bass reported on the year’s events.

The club was in credit £28-12-11.  Membership was c. 80.  Each ‘efficient’ is allowed a credit in cash and ammunition equivalent to 21/6 by the Defence Department.  The Burra Open Prize meeting on 25 April was run successfully despite rather poor weather and the club made £1 profit.  Over the whole year the club had spent about £13 more than it took in and Mr Riggs in moving the adoption of the report and the balance sheet hoped that next year this slide would be halved.  The depression was largely responsible.  Cr Jennison distributed prizes, as the Mayor had a prior engagement.

Poonunda Trophy went to C.H. Fearon from W.V. Bass.

The Championship was won by R. Nutt ahead of W.V. Bass.

The Handicap Championship was won by P.W. Hogan with J.E. Pearce second.

The Marksman’s Trophy was won by W.V. Bass

The R. Nutt Trophy went to S.E. Truscott.

In Group Prizes:

200 & 300 yards to S.E. Truscott.

500 & 600 yards to C.H. Fearon.

600 & 700 yards to C.H. Dixon.

800 & 900 yards to C.H. Fearon.
