Copperhouse School has been taken over by the children again after improvements were made.  The old school building was originally the Primitive Methodist Church and was bought by the Education Department from the Methodist Trust about two years ago.  At that time they did up the internal walls.  Last year lavatories were built and now alterations and improvements have been made.  The porch has been removed from the south side and a large window put in place of the door.  This with two other windows on the south side and two on the north side give good light.  A new fibrous plaster ceiling and two 9” ventilators were added and a stove placed in one corner.  There is a good wooden floor and 20 up-to-date desks.  On the northern end of the building an enclosed shelter-shed 30ft x 12ft runs its entire length.  Large windows have been placed on its north and west sides and a cement floor laid.  Wire doors and screens have been hung.  The grounds comprise 2 acres and adjoin the local tennis courts.  There is a 1,000 gallon tank and they possess a nice organ.  Mr J. Nickles is Chair of the Committee and Mrs Nickles the Secretary and Treasurer.  There is a nice little library and £4 in the bank for other needed improvements.  There are some fine trees in front and a garden at the rear.  The flag pole is the gift of Mr H.W. Tiver.  Miss E. Prior is in charge.  While the alterations were made the school was held in the nearby [Westbury] Methodist Church.
