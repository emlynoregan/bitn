Fire.  At about 10.30 last night a fire was reported in the two-storied building known in the past as the Kooringa Service Station and adjoining the Burra Hotel.  For some time the Girl Guides have used the premises as a waste depot and only yesterday Mrs Phelan placed it at the disposal of the Red Cross Circle as a depot.  The interior fittings and contents were burnt, but the roof remains intact.  Several cars were removed from the adjoining hotel garage.  The cause is undetermined, but an electrical fault or spontaneous combustion is suspected.
