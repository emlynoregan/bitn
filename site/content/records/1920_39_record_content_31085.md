‘Steel Beak’ writes again re the guns.  The writer takes a very religious view.  Killing is against God’s commandment and if men were forced to take up arms and kill then why do we want guns to remind us of this sad fact.  There is enough all around us to remind us of the boys who are gone and we do not need more.  We are drifting further from God’s path.  The guns would be better placed at the bottom of the Mine Pool.
