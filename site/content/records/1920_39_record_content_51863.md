Solomon Williams: More Reminiscences (Continued)

He continues the supposed conversation between two old Burraites remembering the 1850s or so.

Do you remember Johnny Paull the fighting man?  Yes.

He then describes a gathering on Limestone Hill when about 50 men met to watch a fight.  A couple of police came upon the scene and the two opponents pretended to be wrestling, but Johnny was arrested and taken away, but it seems that after a cup of tea with the police he was allowed to go, so it all ended in a farce.

Do you remember the 7 o’clock gun?  Yes, it was said to date from the period when all the men went to the Victorian Goldfields and was to warn all the women to be at home.

I think it was really to ensure the simultaneous closing of all shops and Drew & Crews used it as a time signal for many years.

Do you remember Charlie Oldham?  Yes he was a teller at the National Bank and a member of the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Society.  I remember him entertaining a meeting at the Institute with recitations and readings when the lecturer, who was a legal man, was delayed by his court case going on longer than anticipated.

Do you remember the garden on the flat below the Burra Hotel?  You mean near where the circus people used to pitch their tent?  Yes.  One then tells of raiding the garden for green almonds and the boys being scattered by the Burra Hotel barman Mr Brown coming down on them on a horse with a whip.

Did you see that Charlie Pearce has been secretary of the Rechabite Lodge for 58 years?  You know his uncle was ‘Sawyer’ Pearce to distinguish him from his brother ‘Tailor Pearce’.  Yes, I have seen him standing on a log above the pit guiding a pit saw.

A funny circumstance happened once when Kingston & Mildred were opposing candidates for the Burra District.  In those days voters sometimes wore colours and it was green for Kingston and blue for Mildred.  Businessmen mostly favoured Mildred and miners Kingston.  ‘Sawyer’ Pearce was known to favour Kingston, but he happened to be in Drew’s store one day and I saw Drew get a piece of blue ribbon and pin it on the back of Pearce’s coat.  He went along the street wearing the opposite candidate’s colour.  When friends asked if he had changed his mind and pointed out the ribbon he laughed and promised he would get even with Sam Drew yet.

One day when I was on the footbridge in Queen Street I say a man running along the bed of the creek.  He said a flood was coming and he ran on to warn any children playing in the creek.  This was a surprise because there had been no rain, but in a few minutes the creek was running a banker.  A thunderstorm had fallen in the headwaters.  It was soon all over, but it was a wise precaution to have taken.

I say have you ever seen an iron roof put on with the screws in the bottom of the flutes?

No. – Well the roof on Winnall’s shop was fixed that way.

But it would leak!

Yes and the screws had all to be soldered over.  I suppose it was the first time they had come across corrugated iron and didn’t know how to put it on.  I can’t say it is still there, but when I was in Burra 15 years ago it had been changed into a motor garage, but I don’t think the roof had been altered.  It was in 1863 when I saw it.  It would certainly be an oddity today.

Do you remember the soap and candle factory?  Yes it was across the creek from the slaughterhouse.  I went once, but saw nothing of soap-making, but Mr Atkinson was in charge of making candles for the mine.  They were not made in moulds were they? No – they were dips.  Rather a slow game I would say.  Not so slow.  In a room was a post with a number of projecting arms.  From each arm was suspended a frame holding several round sticks hanging from which were say a dozen wicks.  The frame could be pulled down to dip the wicks in a vat of melted tallow.  If each arm carried a frame with four dozen wicks it would not be so slow; even if several dips were needed to give the proper size.  You would have seen them stuck on the miners’ hats with clay?  Yes, but only a few miners wore them.  I think those who worked in the engine shaft needed them because of the danger of something falling from above and the light left the hands free to work and climb ladders.

He then recalls some members of the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Society:

J. Leggo who became a missionary in Fiji.  [He returned to Burra in 1886: see Burra Record VII. 508. 12 Jan. 1886, page 2.]

J.A. Burns became a Presbyterian minister.  [John Abraham Burns 1851-1919 & brother of a Burra Mayor, Samuel Burns.]

W. Richards was for some time a Methodist minister and later editor of the Yorke’s Peninsula Advertiser.

J. Bodinner was a curate of the Church of England.

W. Williams became President of the Victorian Methodist Conference and later President of the Triennial Conference.

S. Sullivan was a schoolteacher and local preacher.

C. Oldham was a local preacher.

T.W. Wilkinson, W.H. Skewes, S. Williams, W. James and E. Whitford were all interested in trade and commerce and W. Earl who according to the late Dr Basedow first discovered the Jewel Cave in the NT – later called Lasseter’s Cave
