This showed the importance of having the Mine and to have it in operation they needed a railway and needed it quickly.  He especially deplored the coition of the unemployed men’s wives and families.  He moved that the already surveyed line be carried out, as labour was plentiful and there were great facilities for obtaining capital from England.  J.R. Stephens seconded the motion and developed the arguments.  Mr Ernest Siekman also spoke in support.  He suggested that agriculture would be as big a supporter of the line as the mining industry.

The resolution was carried unanimously.

William Young moved that the meeting urge upon Parliament the desirability of commencing construction of the line from both ends and Mr Godson seconded.  He stressed the fact that the land through which the line would pass was already largely bought ready for agricultural development.

Mr Owen Harvey spoke in support, but Mr Siekman thought this move would be seen as selfish and thus be unpopular.  Mr Challoner then suggested that the work ‘start at various points on the line’.

Mr Ridgway supported the original motion and Mr Moody, Mr Challoner’s amendment, which was eventually carried.

A memorial for presentation to Parliament was then read by Mr Rosman.  As well as making the principal points discussed at the meeting, it suggested that the amount of traffic furnished by the Burra Mine would almost itself be sufficient to defray the working costs of the extension, as no less than 1,000 tons of ore per month could be raised, involving the movement of at least 12,000 tons of coal annually for smelting.  The extension of the line would result in the almost certain speedy resumption of work at the Burra Mine.

Mr Moody moved the adoption of the memorial and that signatures be obtained.

Mr W.H. Rosman seconded and Mr S. Drew supported.

Mr J. Rounsevell spoke, discussing the alternative routes and concluding that the Auburn area could better be served from Pt Wakefield.  He favoured a line from Forresters, the present terminus, to Riverton, Saddleworth, Farrell’s Flat and then into or near Burra.  He did not think a branch line to Burra was suitable for a place where ‘from the natural course the traffic and produce from the north, north-east and surrounding districts had always taken.’

It had been shown the railway would raise the price of copper about £10 per ton and would also raise the price of farmers’ grain 8d to 1/- per bushel by saving on cartage.  He also urged the establishment of a District Council or Corporation, which by raising modest rates would have them doubled by the Government and could ask for special funds for urgent works.

Mr W.H. Rodman pointed out that a Corporation would have the effect of requiring tenants of SA Mining Association to pay for improvements to land belonging to the Association.  The motion was carried.

A motion was carried that Mr A. McCulloch MP be requested to present the petition in the House of Assembly and Mr J.B. Neales MP be asked to support it and that in the Legislative Council Hon. J.H. Barrow be asked to present the petition and the Hon. Captain Bagot be asked to support it.  Carried.
