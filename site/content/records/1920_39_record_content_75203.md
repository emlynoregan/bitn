Obituary.  Mr Elisha Ford died at Phillip St Southwark.  He was a pioneer of the pastoral industry east of Burra.  He was a son of the late Joseph Ford of Kooringa and was born in Burra in 1863 and educated at White’s school and later at a school kept by the late Sit Frederick Holder.  As a young man he managed Sturt Vale Station for his father and later owned it.  He went to Coolgardie WA in the early days of the WA gold rush and also to the Teetalpa SA gold rush.  He resided in Adelaide for some time and there married Miss Bertha Theeuff of Kooringa.  He returned to Burra on the death of his father some 30 years ago and resided at Mallee-dale Station which he owned.  He also owned the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  He is survived by his widow, two sons and three daughters: R.F. Ford, L.G. Ford, Mrs J. De Freitas (Melbourne), Mrs N.C. Saunders (Black Forest) & Miss Annie Ford (Chapel St, Kooringa).  [Born 18 June 1862 near Kooringa: died 31 May 1939 at Southwark.]
