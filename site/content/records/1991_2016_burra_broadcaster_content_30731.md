Letter.  J. Pederson writes to commend the people at work in the Computer Centre.  He was able to do some research on a relative who once lived in Burra and even to get a photograph.  The three hour visit to Burra turned into three days.

[Note: in Issue 597, 16 April 2003, page 2 this report is corrected to indicate that the help was provided by the Burra Community Library Staff.]
