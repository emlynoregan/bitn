Police Court, Kooringa 12 May before W. Lang Esq. Resident Magistrate.

Tom Porter was committed to prison for failing to pay a fine of £5 for assaulting Dr Bull.

[Corrected in the Register of 5 June to a fine of £1.]

Margaret Watson, who appeared with a pair of black eyes, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the Sabbath.  She pleaded guilty and His Worship dismissed the charge with a severe reprimand after she promised to be more orderly and abstemious.

Mrs Trenary said she had been looking after a poor woman by the name of Betsy James who was afflicted in mind.  Now she was moving to Adelaide and asked what course she should adopt with reference to the poor woman.  His Worship said a certificate from a doctor was needed before he could commit the woman to care in Adelaide.

Mr Jones, tailor, obtained a summons against Charles Mosely, his neighbour, for using abusing language calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.

Captain Bath of the Princess Royal Mine wished to ascertain if anything further had been done in the case of some Miners v. the Princess Royal Mining Company, before he went to Adelaide.  His Worship said he could not account for the actions of Mr Fisher on behalf of the company.  He had asked for several adjournments.  His Worship suggested that if the Company agreed to let him settle the matter in dispute, he thought he could see a way clear to do so amicably.

Mr Rogers, mason, obtained a summons against Mr Stace of the Southampton Arms, Redruth, for the balance of account on work done.

13 May

Charles Mosely appeared to the summons of Edward Jones of Kooringa, for calling him a common informer, and also charging him with having robbed his lodge.  His Worship reprimanded both men for their unneighbourly conduct towards one another and in the hope they would in future heed his advice, imposed a small fine of 5/- plus 31/- expenses.  Each party appeared to leave the court considering himself the conquering hero.
