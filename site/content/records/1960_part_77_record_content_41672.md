Burra Primary School held a Gala Evening at the Burra Town Hall last Thursday to celebrate the Welfare Club’s 30th birthday.  Stalls were well stocked.  A series of Dutch auctions proved to be rewarding and it is estimated that profits of $220 will be added to the club’s funds.  Phil Lannan was MC.  Each child at the school appeared in at least one item.  Mr G. Baulderstone set up the lighting.  [Details of the performances are given in c. 1½ columns.]
