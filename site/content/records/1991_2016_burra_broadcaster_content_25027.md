Burra Picnic Races at Thistlebeds on Saturday were conducted in warm weather.  There was a good entry of horses, but attendance was down due to competition from Laura’s Fair, Kapunda’s Celtic Festival, the Wudinna Kalamazoo and an event at Quorn.  The next meeting in 2002 is threatened by a further hike in the insurance premium.
