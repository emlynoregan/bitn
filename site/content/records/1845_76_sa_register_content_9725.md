Local Court, Kooringa 3 April, before J.W. Macdonald, Stipendiary Magistrate.

Manuel Lopez was charged with stealing a watch to the value of £3-10-0 from John Fisher.

Fisher said on 31 March he entered the Redruth Arms to change his shirt, as he was wet.  He took off his waistcoat and laid it down, and afterwards could not find it until Wednesday morning, when he found it in the taproom among other old clothes.  When he took it off the watch was in the pocket.  He heard that Lopez had the watch and asked him for it.  Lopez did not understand English and His Worship adjourned the case in order to obtain an interpreter.

8 April

Rev. Ibbetson was sworn as interpreter.  Lopez said he and another Spaniard were entering the White Hart Hotel, with the other man in front of him when he noticed the watch and picked it up outside the hotel.  He went in and got £1 on the watch, which he later paid back for drink.

Committed for trial and admitted to bail, himself in £25 and with one surety in £25.
