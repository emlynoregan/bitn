‘Burra’ writes from Kooringa, 12 September:

Having read the report on the Tramway Bill debate at Auburn, I cannot understand hoe the speakers think they have made a good case.  Mr King says the Government would not build the railway to Kapunda unless it had some arrangement with the Patent Copper Company for the carriage of its goods.  I believe the arrangement was made after the line was built.  The company has a large amount of carriage, which renders it highly desirable to use an expeditious and cheap mode of transport.  It must be obvious that it was not because of a tender affection between the Copper Company and the Government that the company was offered a rate better than usual.  Neither did the company rush to support the railway for patriotic reasons.  It is simply an example of a common rule of commerce that a wholesale customer is supplied at a cheaper rate than a retailer.  This may not be a wise or a just decision by the supplier – after all, if the Copper Company paid the same rate as everyone else the general rate could be lower and this could see an increase in traffic.
