Burra History Group.

[An article publicises the work of Meredith Satchell and Eric Fuss in recording the town’s history, with Meredith’s special interest in family history/genealogy and historic photos and Eric’s in summarising the history from newspaper sources.  [Photo.]

Note that there are several errors in the report.  Eric’s ancestors came to Burra in 1848, not 1884 and his grandparents lived in Opie’s Hotel, not Oppy’s Hotel!]
