The recent harvest.  Despite the problems of locusts and red rust the late harvest has been ‘far from unsatisfactory’.  It averaged 7 bushels per acre from 1,850,000 acres and of the 12,950,000 bushels; 9,135,000 bushels are available for export after allowing for seed and food for 330,000.

i.e. an export of 245,000 tons worth £1,674,750.
