Burra Sing Australia Choir had an inspiring afternoon of singing in St Mary’s Parish Hall with special guest Colin Slater OAM, national director and founder of Sing Australia.  Mr Slater especially thanked the Burra group for raising $4,000 for Red Cross in response to the recent Victoria bushfires.  The choir meets every Wednesday night at St Mary’s Parish Hall with leader John Fuss and encourages everyone to come along.  [Photo.]
