Repatriation Day, 9 March.

The aim was the raise funds so that when the boys came home again there would be money to help them return to civilian life and establish homes, businesses etc.  Platforms and booths were erected in Market Square on Thursday night.  Allied flags and bunting decorated the place.  The sweets and cool drinks booth was run by the Cheer-up Society.  There was a huge marquee for luncheons and afternoon tea and large boards to record the votes of the ‘popularity’ competition.  There was also a baby competition.  A procession was organised by Mr Hann from the Railway Station to Market Square led by M-Cs McCarthy and Kane followed by Jack Hann under a huge cat’s mask.  Then came the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band comprising: Trix Pearce, Nelly Pearce, Annie Pearce, Hilda Hunt, Edie Harris, Dulcie McWaters, Lily Riggs, Doreen Pressick, Myrtle Isaacs, Lydia Burns, Ethel James, Olive Hopgood, Gladys Lawn.  They were followed by two decorated perambulators and the Soldiers’ Aid Society with a beautiful display on Robertson’s motor trolly.  Young ladies in white bearing red, white and blue umbrellas were followed by a couple of Red Indians before Britannia in a Golden Chariot, built by August Fuss and drawn by a crowd of little girls.  Military Cadets under Lt Phillis were followed by the Adelaide Locomotive Band, which in turn was followed by the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney and Lt Robinson and the Recruiting Staff.  Next were a quaint lot of little nigger boys in a ramshackle cart and a group in giants’ masks.  Following them was Mr [Jack] Allen as John Bull and Mr Hawkes’ decorated car labelled ‘Back to the Land’, which was decorated with primary produce, but framed as a boat.  W.H. Sandland’s car was fitted up as an aeroplane and was followed by other cars and traps.

At Market Square speeches were made by Rev. S.J. Bloyd, Mr Winnall, Mr Hawkes, Recruiting Sergeant Stacey and the Mayor.

A Union Jack sold under the Bugler system finally went to H.H. Thomas for 50 guineas, but raised in all £260-12-0.

The Babies Contest was won by Mr P.A. McBride’s boy with £26-4-3.

[Personal interest: Edna Maud Allen raised 17/2½, Dorothy Eileen Allen £3-12-6½ and Ruby Myrtle Bernhardt 16/5.]

A Band Concert in the evening was packed out.  The ladies Cheer-up Band played with the Locomotive Band for the overture.

The Mayor estimated the takings for the day would gross c. £2,000.  In fact so far the gross takings have come in at £1,999-0-9.
