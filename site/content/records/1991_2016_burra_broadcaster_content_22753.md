Burra Girl Guides held a successful International Night on Wednesday 28 June in the Guide Hall.  Twenty-five girls and sixty invited guests had a great night.  It took the form of an international flight with visits to five countries where they were greeted by a group of girls in appropriate costume and served food representative of that country.  The visitors ‘landed’ in Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Botswana and Japan.
