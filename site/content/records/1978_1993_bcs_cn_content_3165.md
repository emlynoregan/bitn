Burra Copper Festival 1980 was an outstanding success despite extremely difficult weather conditions on Sunday.  All expenses were covered prior to Sunday’s activities and profits will go towards beautification of the Burra Creek precinct.

The Burra Show was very well attended and the screening of ‘Breaker Morant’ at BCS was very popular.  Church services were also well attended and the procession was probably the best ever.
