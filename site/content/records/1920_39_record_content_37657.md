Mr Sara said the merchants were most unfortunate, bearing the brunt of it.  The unemployed had managed for 12 months, but now their clothes were vanishing with no means of replacing them.  In Burra there was more unemployment than in most towns, though not because the men were less industrious.  Here there were about 300 people on rations and in Clare only about 15.
