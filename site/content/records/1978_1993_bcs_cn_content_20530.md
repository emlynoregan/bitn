The Council to be elected on 5 May like all Councils will find it increasingly difficult to meet electors’ needs due to reduced income from diminishing grants from Federal and State Governments and increasing costs of operation.  As a Councillor for the past three years, a member of the Executive concerned with the management of many sensitive areas, Chairman of Works etc. and a member of the Tourist Association, I know I can bring valuable experience to support the Council in its next critical term.  I intend to take a strong stand on the question of amalgamation of Councils to the end that Burra becomes the centre of local government for this area and to continue to support the positive direction taken by Council on tourism for the past ten years.  I urge everyone to exercise their right to vote.
