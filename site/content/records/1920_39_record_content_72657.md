He was a member of the Hallett Institute for 40 years and President for a number of years.  He was appointed a JP in 1913 and for 28 years was a member of the Masonic lodge, first at Kooringa and then at Hallett Lodge SAC from foundation and was Treasurer until about two years ago.  He did much to bring about the inauguration of the local recreation ground and to bring it to its present fine condition.  He made many trips to Broken Hill with teams along with his father and claimed to be one of the first to carry loading machinery there.  He married Amy Ellen Williams, daughter of Dr A.J. Williams of Hallett, who died 11 September 1928.  He is survived by two sons and one daughter: Austil H. Richards, Thomas H. Richards of Hallett and Clarice and also a step-daughter Elsie Mrs W.J.
