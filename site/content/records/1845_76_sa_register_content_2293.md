Notice.  Public Meeting

‘THIS EVENING, at seven o’clock, at the Royal Adelaide Theatre and Bush Club House, Light-square, a political sermon, from the 94th Psalm, - “Understand ye brutish among the people; and, ye fools, when will ye be wise?” – will be preached by W.W.G. Nicholls, who will endeavour to open the eyes of his poor, deluded brethren, by showing them the real causes of all the revolutions in Europe and at large, and in these colonies in particular.  Poor and oppressed Ireland will be commented on; and the downfall of Old England clearly foretold.  The preacher will open a discussion after his sermon, and answer all objections to his views.  And the foundation of a new church, without selfishness or superstition, will be laid.

Doors open at a quarter to seven, and close at ten o’clock precisely.

W.W.G. Nicholls

Hindley-street, Adelaide

July 29, 1848

Price of admission, to defray expenses – Males 6d; females, free.
