The rate for the year was 1/- in the £ and the health rate 3d in the £. The health rate brought in £139-9-5 which was expended on the scavenger at 10/- a day, with satisfactory results. The ordinary rate brought in £559-17-9 (with a subsidy of £660-0-2) and the total income for the year was £1,916-12-10, of which £1,395-12-7 was spent on public works. At present there is a debit of £94, but there are expected receipts totalling £163, i.e. from the Govt. £84, from the Midland Road Board £40 and from purchasers of a road £29. [This total is actually £153 and the Govt. claim was at best doubtful.]
