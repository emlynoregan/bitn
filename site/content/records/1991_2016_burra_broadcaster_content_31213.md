Burra SES has just taken delivery of a new Isuzu truck as their main vehicle for call-outs.  It is large enough to carry all their equipment compared with the limited size of the previous Toyota Dyna.  SES still needs volunteers.  An extension to the shed to make a new truck bay will also benefit the MFS.
