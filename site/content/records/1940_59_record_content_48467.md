Burra High School Speech Night, Tuesday 12 December.  Prizes were presented.

The Headmaster’s Report

The enrolment in January was 66.  There are hopes that with larger numbers now coming on from the Primary School, some more will go beyond Intermediate.

The struggle in conjunction with the School Council, the Town Council and local MPs saw the Booborowie-Copperhouse bus operate from virtually the start of the year and this added ten students.

Miss Hannaford (Domestic Arts) is marrying in January and will be lost to the school.

The 1949 exam results were good, with six of ten getting their Intermediate Certificates and Elva Topsfield and Eric Clode each gained two credits.

After a long struggle, this year we were able to get the new septic tank system lavatories built and the school has been completely renovated, though the school yard remains untouched.

Numbers attending the night classes have been so poor that it is likely they will die out.

The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. has been active and is much appreciated.  The High School Ball, which they ran, was an outstanding success.

The annual sports day was a great success, with senior cups going to Maureen Halliday and Brian Brooks and junior cups to Joy Bourman and Bruce Stockman.

Burra came third in the Inter-School Sports.

Poliomyelitis restrictions were lifted in mid-year and Clare was able to come to play us at cricket, tennis and softball, winning all three.

A planned excursion did not come off because of polio restrictions in the first half and exam commitments in the second half.

The library has been completely re-organised and a special room set aside for it and as a result much greater use has been made of it.

A High School Progress Assoc. was formed last year, with the aim of teaching children procedure at meetings, public speaking and of finding things much needed for the school.  It has succeeded in each aim.

The school is now on the telephone, though the number (Burra 216) is not yet in the phone book.

[Brief addresses were then given by H.J.B. Jennison, G.S. Hawker MP & the Mayor, W. Carpenter and several items by students and the one-act play Elegant Edward followed.]

On Wednesday 13 December the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. gave their annual banquet in the High School Assembly Hall.  This was a return to custom after polio caused there to be no banquets in 1948 and 1949.

[A list of prize winners is printed.]
