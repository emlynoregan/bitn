Mr John Kellaway & Mrs Kellaway with their family the Misses Lorna and Verna and Master John, left Burra on Thursday to take up residence in the city.  Since returning from the Great War Mr Kellaway’s health has not been robust, yet he has assisted in the welfare of the town as well as he could.  He was greatly interested in football and pedestrian events and his presence will be missed at the forthcoming Anzac Sports.  He was a strong supporter of the ALP.  Mrs Kellaway was a dependable worker for the Salvation Army and for patriotic causes.  Mrs Kellaway’s sons by a former marriage are AC1 Richard Kearns who is in the RAAF in Victoria and Pte W. Kearns who is with the AIF Engineers somewhere abroad.
