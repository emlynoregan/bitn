Redruth Correspondent:

The report that two ‘Best’ lamps are to be placed in the north end of town was greeted with enthusiasm.

The Aberdeen Quarries are still idle, though hopes of a resumption of work are entertained.

The Old Smelts [dump], a landmark for many years, have now been reduced to a sand-like material.

Drew & Crewes have probably the largest wood and chaff works outside the city at Aberdeen.
