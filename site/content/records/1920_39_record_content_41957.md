Mongolata Goldfield

A substantial nugget has been found at last.  The prospector was E.R. Pexton who with his five sons has been working a claim on John Barker’s Wildildie Estate for eight months.  It is about two miles from Byles’ No. 1 claim, but close to Wildildie Goldmining Co.’s claim.  They currently have some 80-90 tons awaiting the battery and have a main drive of c. 180ft with drives off that.  The pocket of gold was found c. 80ft along the main drive where the reef is c. 18” wide.  The pocket contained 8 pieces of gold one about 20oz another 10oz and altogether about 50oz.

The field generally looks promising.  Byles have a fine body of ore.

Clark & Rampton have some good stuff in a narrow seam estimated at 15oz per ton.  The mine has been producing about 10oz per ton.

D. & A. Morrison have a claim 4 miles northeast if Byles’ in Black Hills country and have struck it rich.

The bore for water is down 150ft.

About 200 visitors went out on Sunday, many to see Mr Pexton’s find, including six carloads from Adelaide.

Hundreds of shares in the field’s companies have sold in the last few days.
