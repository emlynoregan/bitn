Cr Harvey said the concrete pillars at the end of the swing bridge at Gully’s Wharf were loose and he moved that a concrete pillar be placed in the centre of the bridge to take its weight.  Cr Fisher seconded.

The Mayor said it was a waste of money, as in a flood it would trap debris and be swept away.

Cr Harvey said if it were streamlined that would not happen.

Cr Fisher said there were many pillars in the middle of bridges across creeks in Victoria and they were successful.  The motion was carried.
