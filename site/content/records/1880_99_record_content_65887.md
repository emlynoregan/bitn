Rev. A.G. King, who has been the incumbent at St Mary’s for over 7 years has been appointed to St Paul’s in Port Pirie and will probably leave about mid-April. A meeting of seat-holders will be held on 7 March to decide on appointing a successor.  Since being here Rev. King has worked hard and leaves the parish in a flourishing state with mission churches established at Black Springs, Hallett and Gum Creek.
