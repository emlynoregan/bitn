Burra Regional Art Gallery held its AGM on 22 November.

Chairman Peter Harvey’s Report

The Board’s aim has been to develop a strategy to meet the objects and purposes in the constitution; to create a community-based facility that will play a significant part in Burra events and tourism, while creating a focus for art development in the region – which will include bringing to the gallery as many interesting and stimulating shows as we can afford.

Attendance for the year was 3,261, which compares well with other country galleries.  In NSW and Victoria, as well as three other regional galleries in SA, the funding comes through Councils, State Government and benefactors.  Burra is the only regional gallery in SA without paid staff.  We must therefore be all the more appreciative of the work of our volunteers and especially of curatrs like Susan Roche, Mary Woollacott and Hazel Newcombe.  The volunteer guides are also vital to keep the gallery open seven days a week for most of the year.  The Board will continue to pursue funding options.  The Leonard Bence Retrospective attracted 1,600 visitors.

Elected: Chairman, Peter Harvey; Secretary, Colin Endean and Treasurer, Val Rivers.
