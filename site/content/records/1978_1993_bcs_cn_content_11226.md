1 August 1985

The Woods & Forests Department invites people to participate in the tree scheme to celebrate the State’s Jubilee Year 1986.  The charge for seedlings is just 55 cents each.

The Jubilee 150 Procession on New Year’s Eve in Adelaide will open the Jubilee Celebrations.  In 1936 Burra contributed a float to the State’s Centenary Celebrations and has been asked to do so again.  The Burra District Advisory Committee will establish a committee to oversee this.
