Fires

On 28 December 1998 a header comb hit a rock and started a fire at ‘Flagstaff’ and about 95 acres of vetch was destroyed along with a stubble paddock.

On 6 January a seized bearing on a road train trailer started a fire 4 km north of Burra.  The fire destroyed the trailer and burnt grass along the old railway reserve.  [Photo of the 28 December fire.]

Australia Day Celebrations this year will be held along the banks of the Burra Creek adjacent to Bridge Terrace.  Pauline Venning has been named Citizen of the Year.  BCS’s 120.20 Concert is Event of the Year.
