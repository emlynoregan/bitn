Burra Swimming Pool.  The £500 appeal has reached £524-11-3.  Sunday’s working bee was a great success.  The waders’ pool was completely fenced.  The inside walls of the pool were repainted.  It is intended to use the pool for swimming this week, although at present the conveniences in the caravan park will have to be used for changing.  Some swimming lessons for High School students will be given in the middle of the week and if it is hot the pool will be open from 4.30 to 7 p.m. for other swimmers and from 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  1/- adults and 6d children.
