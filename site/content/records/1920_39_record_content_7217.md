Burra Football Association, Annual Meeting at Burra Institute, Wednesday.

Mr J. Allen was elected Secretary pro tem after E.J. Davey declined to stand again.  Other elections were held over.  The Association is in credit £1-5-5.

Applications to join came from Mt Bryan, South Booborowie & Burra Gymnasium.  South Booborowie was approved.  Mt Bryan’s acceptance was moved and seconded, but the report does not say it was carried.  Consideration of the Gymnasium application was held over because the Kooringa Club had not yet had a meeting.  Meeting adjourned for a fortnight.
