Mr William Thomas Rabbich has been defeated as Mayor of Boulder and the Sun (WA) commented on his defeat:

‘It is as well that Mr Rabbich should be reminded in good time that he has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.  Therefore it would be wise for him to take philosophically the lesson he has been taught, which, however painful and expensive, seemed to be necessary in order to teach him modesty and humility.  When the citizens want him henceforth, if ever they do, they will doubtless tell him.  Till then, meek retirement will excellently become Uncle Tom.’
