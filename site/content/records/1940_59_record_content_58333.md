Fire.  Last Friday fire at Gum Creek burnt about 940 acres of heavily grassed country.  Five landowners were affected:

H.W. Player lost 400 acres of grazing and some fencing.

Alf McWaters lost 220 acres of grass and fencing.  Stock was saved by a lull in the wind.

Lynch Bros lost 220 acres and nearly all their fencing.

Jack Gask lost 30 acres of grass and a dividing fence.

Peter Drew lost 30 acres of grass.

The fire started from a spark from a bulldozer near the stone wall on the Leighton-Hilltown Road and it took about 30 minutes for help to arrive.
