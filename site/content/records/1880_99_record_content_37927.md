Editorial on the new Government’s policy.  Some aspects are good while others are very bad.  The mooted taxation changes favour the rich and the Premier now proposes to end the free breakfast table, the provision of which he supported last year.

2nd Leader is an attack on the pro-protection stand of the editor of the Barrier Miner who is described as ‘A Protectionist Windbag’. 

The Bulletin in praising Holder’s speech in the recent no confidence motion debate says it justifies their prophecy that he is a future premier of the colony.

The Dissolution Movement is gaining public support.

The Bible Christian minister, Rev. J. Stoyel, has been ill, suffering from ‘affection of the heart’ and Rev. Peters of Hallett has filled in.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis we hear have withdrawn their suit against the Council Overseer.  [And thus against the Council.]
