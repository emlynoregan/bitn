Health Care

At the Mid North Health Board meeting on Tuesday Chairperson Ruth Robinson said two issues were currently facing the hospital system:

The new Health Care Plan for four general hospitals across country SA.

The legislation to be introduced in September that will abolish hospital boards.

The minister wants to have one streamlined line of responsibility from nurses to him and the boards are seen as an impediment.  Ms Robinson said the board disagreed and thought high standards could be met under the existing structure.  If the legislation were passed the boards would remain until 30 June 2008, after which Health Advisory Councils would be formed.  Their role would only be advisory.  The Board would be seeking further clarification about the role of hospital auxiliaries within the new structure and also on the status of the independent ambulance services at Peterborough, Jamestown and Booleroo.
