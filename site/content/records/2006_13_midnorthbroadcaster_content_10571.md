Dr Dharma Dissanayake has returned to her Burra practice after a hiatus of more than six weeks due to being detained overseas during a two week holiday in Sri Lanka.    She and her husband Dr Lakman Fernando flew into Adelaide on 27 July ending an ordeal which saw the couple fall victim to criminal elements while in Sri Lanka.  The couple had to stay in Sri Lanka for a subsequent court case.
