‘One Interested’ writes strongly supporting the Black Springs secretary.  Red Cross had free use of the hall for 10 months and then were offered effectively a year’s use for 10½d a meeting.  They should realise that the interest on the hall loan has to be paid, war or no war, and they have had a very fair go.
