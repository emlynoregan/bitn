Burra High School Reunion

Students reminisced about the ex-army truck that used to convey students to Burra from Willalo and Hallett, owned and driven by Mr Arnold Hanlin for more than seven years from 1946 – a khaki covered Chevrolet with a gun flap in the cabin roof and a canvas canopy on the tray.

Rex Anderson used to ride his bike four miles to the Willalo starting point – he was Dux of School in 1948 and went on to Roseworthy Agricultural College.
