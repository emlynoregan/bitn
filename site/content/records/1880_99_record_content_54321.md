Burra Town Council

[At the last meeting of Council, after the most acrimonious of discussions about the Waterworks Engineer, the Council resolved itself into a Waterworks Commission to give all orders for the running of the Waterworks.]

There was a discussion on the basis and standing of the Waterworks Commission and the Waterworks Committee of Council.  The Mayor is to get some legal answers.  Burra is said by the Town Clerk to be the only Corporation in SA that is in charge of its Waterworks.

Faulding & Co. will supply their poisoned wheat for 17/6 a bushel â€“ this price was deemed absurd.

Public Works Committee will inspect the kerbing work redone by Mr D. Rogers.
