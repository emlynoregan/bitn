Dulcie (Tiny) Hill nee Bourman is approaching her 95th birthday [on 11 July] and will celebrate the occasion with a small gathering of family and friends.  She credits good living, hard work and a positive attitude for her longevity.  Mrs Hill was born in Ayers St, Burra in a house built by her father.  She was one in a family of five sisters.  She left school aged 13 in order to earn a wage, going to work for Mr & Mrs Marsden at the Burra Record as proof reader and office girl.  She stayed there until the great depression when staff had to be cut.  Tiny was lucky to get a job with Arthur Bence of Bence’s Limited, [drapers and clothiers.]  She said entertainment at the time was sport, choir and local dances.  It was through the Methodist choir that she met her future husband, Johnny Hill.  She was married in 1937 at the Methodist Church and had a daughter, Mary [in 1951.]  The family’s joy was tragically cut short when Mary was killed in a traffic accident in Market Square when just seven years old.  Mr Hill’s tailor shop achieved a high reputation around the state and the couple worked hard both at their business and in community service.  Mrs Hill also recalls the social occasions around the piano in the home of friends around the town.  Bridge was another popular pastime.  Johnny used to play weekly with the butcher, the barber, the publican and the Catholic priest, Mrs Hill recalled.  Mr Hill died some 30 years ago, [actually in 1982] since when Mrs Hill has continued to help others.  A three month overseas trip when she was 70 is a highlight of her life and the holiday of a lifetime.  She relocated to the Chapel Street cottages five years ago and says she has never been happier, with very caring neighbours.  [Actually she moved into the cottage occupied by Sylvia Pearce who died in March 2005.] [Photo.]
