For want of room this building was annexed as a transept for the church at a later date.3

The Sunday school was transferred to Jubilee Hall 4 – the former Primitive Methodist Chapel.

In 18765 £200 was paid for land near the chapel for a Sunday school and this was opened 7 February 1925, free of debt much to the credit of Mr James Reed.

In 1889 the Redruth Circuit was created – cutting links with the Kooringa Circuit.

The first Redruth minister was Thomas M. Rowe, 1889-90.

United Methodist came in 1900.

The first Methodist minister was Rev. W.H. Rofe, 1900-01.

In 1940 the circuit became Burra-Redruth when Rev. Neil Usher was incumbent.

Rev. A.S. Barratt 1943-46. (Father of Mrs Olive Oates.)

Rev. C.L.H. Pitman 1947-50.

1951 Rev. C. Christopher was followed by Rev. D. Haydon, Rev. R. Jenner and Rev. M. Edwards.

Redruth Church closed as a centre for regular worship in 1970, since when all services have been at the Kooringa (Burra) Church.

The Redruth Trust Committee then decided that the property would become a conference and camping centre and additions and changes were made.  The church building was made available as a worship centre for campers.

[1. Tregony Street.

2. This makes no sense.  The two buildings were on different sites.  All the evidence suggests that the second chapel was on the site of the first.  The cost cited alone suggests the original walls were reused.  The Tregony street property was sold only in 1876 and circumstantial evidence suggests it was used as a private school.

3. This was done in 1879.

4. This is at best misleading.  In 1879 the Sunday school was transferred to the Lutheran Church and the Wesleyans continued to use this until Methodist Union.  The Methodist Church continued to use it until the Jubilee Hall became available in 1902 – a total of c. 23 years.  The Primitive Methodist Chapel became available in theory from 1900, but it was in a poor state of repair and before it could be used the rear wall was demolished and rebuilt ten feet further back.  The enlarged building became available for use only in 1902.

5. Actually in 1882.]
