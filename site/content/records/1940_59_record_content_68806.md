Wayne Sibly writes of another stage of the Youth travel Scheme.  The Otranto, he says, is narrower than the Oronsay and pitches about more.  He survived the tossing about in the Bay of Biscay.  He reports going to Wimbledon before leaving England and was able to see Rosewall defeat Davidson on centre court.  He then saw Rose and Wirthington play in a doubles game.
