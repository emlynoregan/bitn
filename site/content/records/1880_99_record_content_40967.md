St Mary’s, Annual Vestry Meeting, 2 April.

Rev. J.S. Wayland presided.  The Sunday school had 102 pupils and 11 teachers.  There were 119 communicants, of whom 90-100 were active.  There were 11 confirmations last year.  Hospital services are held every Friday afternoon and Sunday evening.

Mr Barker Sen. was intending to present a stained glass window and Mrs J.M. McBride an altar frontal and Mrs W.G. Hawkes brass rods and curtains for the sanctuary wall.

A Sunday schoolroom was much needed, but so far only £26 was held for that.  The year’s income of c. £350 was about £4 over expenditure.

Details of church officers follow.
