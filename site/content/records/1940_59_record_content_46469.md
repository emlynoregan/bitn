Burra Town Council, 3 July

Mr Bednall advised that he felt Council should pay their portion of the costs of surveying a road at Burra North because they bought the land 12 years earlier for the purpose of widening the road.

Approval was given for the erection of a shelter shed at Burra North.

Alterations to R.B. Martinâ€™s shop in Market Square were approved.

Mr F.T. Marston will continue as Council representative on the Burra Hospital Board.

Water is leaking into the Town Hall and the Mayor and Town Clerk will investigate.
