Leighton Hall AGM.

Liabilities are at present £250 to the State Bank, less £27-11-0 cash in hand.

This is the same as last year, but during the year we had repairs of £39-18-4 and £134-8-3 has been paid to the Ladies’ Guild.  Now that money will not be required for patriotic purposes in the way it was during the war, our liabilities should be reduced and more attention can be given to classes and amusements.  Elected were

President	I.J. Warnes

Secretary	E. Cock

Treasurer	A.D. McDonald
