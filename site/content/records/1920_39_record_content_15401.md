M-C F.W. Lown was farewelled at the Institute on Tuesday last week prior to his departure for Cockburn.  The Mayor gave a speech of appreciation for M-C Lown’s suppression of larrikinism and presented a silver teaset on an oak tray.  28/- was over and he hoped that would go in the children’s money box.  About a dozen others present spoke in support.
