Adchem has received an award from Bekaert, in Belgium, for being their Best Supplier of the Year 1999.  Bekaert has plants all over the world and uses Adchem copper oxide in its plant in Ubisa in Spain where it is used to coat steel cord in tyres so that the rubber bonds with the cord.  Simon Kibble, Operations Manager for Adchem said the award was significant because it recognised all the work done in quality assurance by Nigel Winzar and staff.  Adchem expects the 1999-2000 financial year to see record production.
