Baldina School Concert on Monday evening was a success, but the attendance of parents was disappointingly small.  Dr Sangster Sen. presided.  He was impressed with the quality of the schoolwork on display.  Four Compulsory Certificates were earned, but Leslie James and Roy Winders were over 13 and so are not entitled to one.  Two Certificates were thus awarded to S. Honeychurch and A. Winders.
