Burra Cheer-up Society

There was a social on 1 April to welcome L-Cpl James & Pte Seeley and to farewell Bugler Jennison.

[The Secretary berated members for the low attendance – Saturday night’s other entertainments being deemed no excuse.]

Actually neither L-Cpl James, who is quite ill, nor Pte Seeley was able to attend either.  Pte Davis of Wallaroo was welcomed as a visitor.

We are to lose both our Lady President, Mrs Nield, and Vice-President, Mrs A.J. McBride due to their removal from the district.  Mr G. Parrott, another active member, has also gone.

In the week farewell parcels were sent to Ptes Hammer (2 of them), Ockenden & Speckman [sic, for Spackman], who were unable to attend socials.

Photos of Ptes A. & L. Carey & Allen have been received at our room.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc.  The main activity of the ladies is making dressing gowns, shirts and pyjamas.
