Burra Swimming Pool.  The line of pennies was laid down from Bence’s corner to Jennison’s Tyre Service.  The Mayor spoke at the opening of the effort and placed the first pennies.  He said that of the minimum £800 that was needed to make a start £600 was in sight.  When the Mayor had laid 240 pennies on behalf of Clarkson’s Ltd Mr Lott had several pounds worth to follow on.  By 5.15 it was said there were only three coppers left in the town unaccounted for.  Youngsters were enrolled in the big pick-up and after the event 160lb weight of coppers and a few silver coins produced an amount of £35-2-0.
