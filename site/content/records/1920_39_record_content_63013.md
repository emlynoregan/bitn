R.T.F. Rogers claimed £20-10-6 damages to a Freelite Plant on his farm at Hanson, from the carrying firm of Rofe & Co.  The claim was that in removing a tractor from the farm the carriers had entangled a wire stay and damaged the Freelite.  Evidence was given that the defendant was well aware of the Freelite Plant.  The magistrate found that the claim by the defendant that he did not see the wires involved, was hard to believe given the evidence before him.  He was an experienced operator whose daily business was to measure loads on vehicles and calculate their heights in relation to overhead obstructions.  He had failed to exercise due care and judgement was for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.
