Burra RSL.  Annual Report of President H. Cornelius

Members have not given the club the support needed for it to continue.  A few willing members who are overworked are making all the effort.  Weather forced the Anzac Service to be held in the clubrooms and it was again conducted by the Ministers Fraternal.  Fortunately conditions afterwards improved and allowed the march to take place.  Remembrance Day proved very popular and greater interest was shown by the public.  The RSL Ball in the Town Hall was very enjoyable and owed much to the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  Between 60 & 70 diggers attended the annual dinner.  A Christmas party was held for members’ children.  We are still maintaining two Legacy Wards at £25 each.
