The Aberdeen Ballast Quarry is acknowledged as one of the finest in the state and the Government holds a 99 year lease on it, and yet it allows the quarry to lie idle.  The quarry used to be in full operation, employing quite a number of men and supplying tremendous quantities of railway ballast.  At the time the Government built a railway line right to it and the trucks were loaded directly.  Now the Government obtains its railway ballast from Sleeps Hill and Stoneyfield, both of which are quite near Adelaide and centralisation.  At Sleeps Hill the stone has to be carted half a mile or more in motor trucks to the crackers and then reloaded and finally unloaded onto railway trucks.  At Stoneyfield on the eastern side of Adelaide, the stone is treated, then loaded onto motor trucks and carted through Adelaide to hoppers at Mile End.  Most of this extra handling would be eliminated if the quarry at Burra North were utilised.  On a recent visit the Premier said a few pounds would not matter to the Government if a secondary industry of some sort could be opened at Burra, and yet here is one that offers an opportunity and nothing is done about it.  The rental on the quarry is Â£10 per annum and the owner Mr Reg. Ford would get 2d a yard royalty.  Having obtained the lease and then done nothing with it, the Government is not keeping faith with Mr Ford either.  
Despite paying many thousands of pounds every year in taxes, this town and district is seriously neglected by the Government.  We doubt that the State Electricity Commission will deign to supply Burra with cheap power and despite Murray water flowing through pipes to the Burra Railway Station, Burra householders cannot get access to it.

Despite the quarry being within the town, the Burra Town Council only recently had to get crushed stone from Adelaide for road-making.  The new Hanson road will soon force the District Council to do the same.

Burra Rifle Club fired a return match against Spalding at Spalding on Saturday.  Burra 933 defeated Spalding 876.

North Eastern Football Association, Second Semi-Final at Burra Racecourse on Saturday:

Burra 12.14 defeated Booborowie 7.10.

Tom Kallio was given a presentation and farewell at the RSL Club Rooms on Friday night, prior to his departure from the district.  He had been a resident and club member for about 30 years.
