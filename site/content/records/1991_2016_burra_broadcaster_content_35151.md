This event, and the evident enthusiasm of the residents of this ‘Australian Country Town’ to become involved, has astonished me. I can only imagine that as a ‘grumpy old man’ I am the only resident to be rather nauseated by the thought of our town being turned into a ‘theme park.’ Now, I have repeatedly told myself that this is harmless fun that will provide Touchdown TV viewers with a few innocent laughs at the girls’ and our expense. No great harm in that. We are told that ‘we need your (our) help to make this TV show a success - we are therefore, of critical importance; the NZ TV ratings depend on us being willing and enthusiastic participants. Perhaps our performance might help the TV company recoup some of its outlay and make it such a success that the show is marketed outside NZ, thus bringing in valuable revenue!

Sadly, Madam, in the hope that a reader or two may agree with me, I feel compelled to voice my conviction that this is not necessarily a good thing. (On the other hand, readers may write to you and explain how wrong I am.)

As I have indicated above, ‘Miss Popularity’ appears to be in the genre of reality TV. If so, this form of entertainment has been described as representing a high point (or should I say low point) in the ‘Culture of Narcissism’. This rather strange label describes a society totally wrapped up in individualism - a dysfunctional and warped society that is preoccupied with self. This kind of extreme individualism has been associated with the decay of public values. Such individualism is rooted in the belief that the desires of the individual are greater than the needs of society as a whole. It indicates a kind of society that is destined to fail.

Then there is the particular ideal of ‘Popularity’ itself. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines this as ‘the action or practice of courting popular favour’, and ‘the fact of being admired- approved or beloved by the people’. Being popular naturally means not offending people - in itself not such a bad trait -and, at a mundane level, I feel for the nine girls who will be voted failures in the popularity stakes. Has society come to this, I ask myself? After all, in the world of great ideas, music, literature, art, science, and all other forms of human endeavour, true achievement has not depended on being popular - often quite the reverse.

Perhaps, though, I’m just an old wowser. Perhaps we should all simply enjoy this new experience, and be a part of the pantomime without thinking too much about what it means for our society.

Yours faithfully,

Roger Cross, Burra.
