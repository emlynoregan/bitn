Northern Mail Routes.  On 2 June a deputation waited on Mr Todd the Postmaster-General to urge the route via Farrell’s Flat for the conveyance of the mail to Canowie and Blinman.  The Farrell’s Flat area (with c. 100 farmers) was poorly served for mail with post offices up to 20 or 25 miles distant.  The proposed route would be 10 to 12 miles shorter and the gradients much easier than from Kooringa.  Mr Todd did not give a definite answer, though he seems to indicate he was leaning towards leaving the Blinman mail with Kooringa.  A service for those between Farrell’s Flat and Booborowie would likely be by horse rather than by a vehicle.  He would make a personal investigation of the roads before a final decision, or if that were impossible he would send a responsible officer.
