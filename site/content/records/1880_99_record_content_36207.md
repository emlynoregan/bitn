F.W. Holder is presently Treasurer in the Cockburn Government.  He is a South Australian by birth, being born at Happy Valley.  His father was a State School teacher and he entered the same field holding positions under the Education Department.  He left teaching to take charge of this journal which he at present owns.

He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1887 and has been Chairman of the Select Committee on the Barrier Trade and Break of Gauge.  His policies can be summarised:

Protection to the producer and increased facilities for land settlement.

On taxation he would maintain income tax and introduce a progressive land tax.

On duties he favours the free breakfast table with removal of duties on tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate and kerosene and reduced duty on sugar.

Railways: he would maintain the mid-north system as now and extend the Transcontinental line 280 miles to the McDonnell Ranges.  He believes the Queensland connection depends on the Queensland Boundary Railway Commission Report.  He wants a new railway station for Adelaide.

He would advance the water conservation schemes at Mannum and Lake Bonney and supports artesian bores in the interior.  Oswald Brown to advise on the city water supply.

Mining: he would encourage development and pass acts to extend it on private land.  He would extend safety inspection.

Education: he would defer consideration of capitation grants and favours free education as soon as SA can afford it.
