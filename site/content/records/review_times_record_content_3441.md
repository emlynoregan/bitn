Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project will be opened by the Minister of Mines & Energy, Mr Payne at Morphett’s Enginehouse this weekend.  Mr K. Bonython, Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee, will be the guest speaker.  The three project sites are Morphett’s Enginehouse, the Bon Accord Museum and the Kingston Street wing of the Paxton Square Cottages.  These cottages are prime heritage sites and the restored cottages will be used for tourist accommodation.  ‘Morphett Enginehouse was imported from Cornwall and used to pump water from the mines.’  [This is obviously incorrect; its design was imported from Cornwall.]

‘The roof has been restored with slate and its chimneys and floors have been re-timbered with imported wood, Mr Wright said, because no mills in Australia were big enough to handle the size of timber needed.

[Sic: its chimneys have been re-timbered!  It had no chimneys and the chimney that served the adjacent boiler house was demolished in the 1920s.  It has not been restored.]

The top section of Morphett’s Shaft has been re-timbered and the side entrance to it has been re-dug and opened to visitors.

Mr Wright said the Bon Accord Mine site was originally intended to tap into the [lode of the] Monster Mine, but it was never a success.  Instead it became the source of Burra’s main water supply.  [That is prior to the town’s connection to Murray River water in 1966.]

The Bon Accord mine shaft is covered with glass so visitors can look into the shaft.

There is a display of shovels, picks and other mining artefacts recovered from the mine during open cut operations in the 1970s.  There is also a display of the social history of the town and a model of the Burra Burra Mine made by Pam Marlow.  Burra was significant Mr Wright said, because it and Kapunda were the first two mines in Australia to pay dividends to owners.  Mining had begun here in 1845.
