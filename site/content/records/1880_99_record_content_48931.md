Rev. Daddow’s address in his church on 13 February in reply to Mr Hogarth’s lecture on the National Defence League is summarised.

The planks of the NDL are too narrow for most of the population.  Daddow said the NDL owed more to personal considerations than to national interests.  It claimed its platform to be broad, but in fact it was very narrow.  Daddow believed the times were critical and the future depended on the wealthy sharing their wealth with the toilers: the wealth was produced by the land and labour.  Reformers were very necessary and possible and ‘any man who honestly attempted in an intelligent way to bring about the necessary reforms was to be commended even if he did belong to the Trades and Labor Council.’  Hogarth denigrated the Trades and Labor Council because its members disagreed about principles, but Daddow thought that if the NDL was dynamic and progressive it would also be true of them.  The Snowtown branch of the NDL for instance opposed all forms of progressive taxation and was for the indefinite postponement of federation.  How could members of the NDL agree with this and then say Advance Australia?  National reformers in the NDL ranks were few.  The NDL was like the spider and the fly: pretending to be the farmers’ friend, but the friends of the NDL had shut up the best land so the sons of farmers had to leave the colony or take up the dry country.  As to capital and capitalists – he didn’t think either was very patriotic.  Hogarth said wealth had got into private hands and we had to accept the condition.  But much had got there through capitalists taking more than their fair share of the wealth produced by labour.  Is it right it should remain there?  Is there to be no redress for the sufferer?
