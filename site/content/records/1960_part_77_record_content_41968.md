Burra Swimming Pool.  The opening of the swimming season has been put back two weeks by lack of support for the working bee on 15 September.  Apart from committee members or their families only one other person turned up.  Preparation and painting will cost $300.  High School boys are helping preparations in their sports period and further working bees are called for 5 & 6 October to paint the surface.  If these are successful the plant should be able to be operated the following weekend and the pool opened on either 26 October or the 2 November.
