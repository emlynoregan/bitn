Paxton Square

An informant to the paper reports that living conditions in the square are appalling.  One family cannot keep a pet alive for long because of the poor conditions and one of the children now has TB.  (Though the child did not contract TB in the Square, the conditions would accentuate her complaint.)   Also three elderly men living there are in very unsanitary conditions.  It is said that any one door key will open the door to any of three adjacent prenises.

The square was built about 85 years ago when sanitation and hygiene did not have the same importance they do today.  The houses have little ventilation and some have flagged floors.  In 80 odd years dampness has crept in and vermin have made their nests there.  If an epidemic broke out there it would doubtless spread rapidly and extend from there into the town.
