Boer War.  When news of Mafeking’s relief was received at midday on Saturday arrangements were made for a patriotic demonstration in Market Square.  About 9.30 between 300 and 400 assembled to show their loyalty to the Queen and appreciation of the gallantry displayed by Colonel Baden-Powell in the defence of the town.  There were songs by Miss Pearce, Messrs Tiddy, Page and Winnall, with Mrs Winnall on the organ.  The Burra Defence Rifle Club fired three volleys.  Over £600 has been raised locally to assist the war effort.  Children of the various schools have been granted a holiday on Wednesday and businesses will close.  Sports will be provided for the children at Victoria Park.  When the news reached Auburn Kruger was burnt in effigy.
