R. Brummitt writes a letter in reply to a couple of letters expressing concern over the Methodist Union in the previous issue.  His answers include:

The alleged clash of the Redruth Wesleyan Bazaar and the Bible Christian Anniversary was an ‘accident’ of the calendar in 1899.  The bazaar was always held on the first Friday in September.  The anniversary was celebrated on the Eight Hours Day Holiday.  This year they happened to coincide.  Preparations were too far advanced to change before it was noticed. Both were a success.

The tennis in the afternoon which ‘G.C.’ saw as an evil rival of the dinner actually served as a preparation for it and many went from one to the other, indeed the dinner was so well patronised that there was not sitting for all – a strange result of antagonism and enmity!

There were complaints of the clash of the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Anniversary with Wesleyan Special Services.  The latter are world wide services for Children’s Sunday.  With five Methodist churches in the town some overlapping is inevitable says Brummitt and surely the remedy anyway would be union.

As for expressing appreciation of our minister – this is surely understandable and any recommendation for the future will go to the United Conference – along with those from other meetings held before the Union and the decision on the placement of ministers will be made by that body.

Brummitt says he has long advocated union and rejoices in its imminent consummation.  Those who look for offence in the inevitable difficulties of adjustment will find it even where none was intended.  Rather try to put a favourable construction on our brothers’ acts.
