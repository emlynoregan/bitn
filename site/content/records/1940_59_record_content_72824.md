Obituary.  Brian Dearlove, formerly of Hallett, was fatally injured on Friday at Worumba Station, twenty miles from Hawker, when a horse he had been riding rolled on him.  An emergency operation was needed.  Dr A.N. Turner of Quorn called for help from Dr G. Gibson of Quorn and surgeon O.W. Leitch of Adelaide.  Two inches of rain had brought creeks down and jeeps had to be used to get the doctors through.  The operation was performed at Hawker Hospital, but the patient suffered a relapse and died late on Friday afternoon.  He was the second son of Mr & Mrs Dearlove of Ketchowla Station.  [Brian John Dearlove born 21 December 1923 Norwood: died 11 May 1956 Hawker, residence Worumba Station.]
