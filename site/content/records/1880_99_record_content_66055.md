F.W. Holder’s Address at the Institute on 14 April.  John Sampson, Mayor, presided.

Holder looked back on 12 years of political life: almost six of them as a minister.  The last six years had been troubled by a combination of poor seasons and low prices for a longer period than ever before.  The Government has been constrained in what it could do by finances.  Many things in the public interest have not been possible due to cost.  Departmental expenditure has been cut by £97,000 p.a.  An Export Department has been created.  The Northern Territory runs at a deficit from year to year of £60,000 to £70,000.  The territory actually pays its way except for the Pine Creek railway – almost all of the deficit goes in its arrears.  The deficiency is not a burden on the SA taxpayer as the accounts of the NT are kept quite separately from those of SA.  SA does however, guarantee the NT debt and does from time to time make large advances to enable it to continue.  Such advances are in time to be returned and the NT pays interest on them in the mean time.  Special prospecting rights in the NT hold hopes that minerals will eventually pay for the Territory.  The Government has been redeeming bonds for which the interest was 6% and consolidating debt, so reducing interest charges by some £30,000 p.a. and redemptions are saving some £25,000 p.a.  A surplus is anticipated this year.  Tax in Australia per head on the latest figures:

NSW	£1-17-11

SA	£2-7-8

Victoria	£2-9-6

Tasmania	£2-17-9

Queensland	£3-4-4

WA	£6-18-2

Last year income tax yielded £47,000 and income from properties £50,000.

In these difficult times the Government has passed a very liberal Pastoral Act and Seed Wheat Acts have provided grain to keep farmers in business.  So far the sums distributed:	1st year	£4,979

2nd		£59,019

3rd		£27,132

4th		£1,368 so far
