Rain caused a six ton load to become stuck at the entrance to Henderson’s Yard.  Eventually Eli Jones added his four horses to Drew & Crewes’s five and by taking down the division fence between Fred Kemble’s and Henderson’s, the load was shifted after a delay of over two hours.  George Lawn was the original teamster.
