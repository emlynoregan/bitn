Burra Primary School Parents & Friends Assoc. held its AGM and elected: Chairman, M.G. Stockman and Secretary/Treasurer, D.H. Field.

Improvements at the school in the past year included extending the yard and the erection of a new eastern fence.  Negotiations are being held to have much of the yard asphalted in the coming year.  Existing asphalt has been top dressed.  Arbor Day was held and the school has many young trees being cared for by the children as part of their education.  The first picnic for many years was held at Gum Creek and was voted a great success.  During the year the school staged a fine concert.

The first tender for a lunch room was rejected as unsuitable by the Architect-in-Chief, but we are pursuing other tenders.  There is practically enough money in hand for this project.  Following the illness in April of the headmaster, Mr Pattrick, staffing has been unsatisfactory with teachers coming and going.  Mr Morrison has done an excellent job as acting Head Teacher despite the staff shortages.  We thank the ex-teachers who returned to assist in this crisis.  A Junior Teacher has been appointed and we are due for a permanent Headmaster after May holidays.  The enrolment of 270 means we are due for a seventh teacher and have applied for a further classroom.
