Inquest held at the Bon Accord Hotel on Wednesday afternoon, 4 January, into the fire at New Aberdeen on 31 December.  Most of the witnesses were relatives of Government employees and seemed to be very reluctant to say anything that would confirm that the fire might have begun from sparks from the Waterworks chimney.

Miss Nellie Roach was very evasive, saying at one point:

‘I won’t say any more; I am only a woman and you can’t expect much from me I cannot speak like a man.’

When further instructed to answer she continued:

‘Oh I don’t want them; [i.e. the questions] I don’t like questions; I can’t stand them.’

Mr Winnall, who was appearing on behalf of Mr E. Camp, who had sustained £80 damages was clearly annoyed by this and said: ‘We will give you a chair then.’

[M-C Phelan then provided a chair, though whether Mr Winnall’s sarcasm was meant to be taken literally is unclear.]

Elliott Camp claimed he had traced the fire back to still burning chips and cinders close to the Waterworks shed.

The verdict was that there was strong circumstantial evidence that the fire started at New Aberdeen on 31 December, by a spark from the Burra Waterworks chimney.

The coroner was C. Bartholomaeus and C.A. Fuss was foreman of the jury.
