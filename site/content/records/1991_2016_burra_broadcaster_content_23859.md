Chairman Jock Duncan reported a good year for the homes, despite a minor fire, some storm damage and the arrival of the GST.  Apart from routine maintenance the re-bituminising of the rear driveway of Pearse Row has improved the complex.  Two new arrivals during the year were Mrs Jean Ryan and Mrs Phyllis Neale.  Quotes will soon be sought for the introduction of air conditioning in the Chapel Street row.  Jock Duncan has been re-elected for a further term as chairman.
