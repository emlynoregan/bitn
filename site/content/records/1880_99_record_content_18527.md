Editorial on the letter from the Hydraulic Engineer.

[This editorial represents an abrupt about face by the editor on the issue; a change sparked by what must have been the unexpected and shocking disclosures of the abuse of power by the Government and their obvious breach of faith with the Council.]

The Department has clearly acted ‘to disobey the orders of a Minister.’

The old Aberdeen Waterworks were essentially to serve the Railway Department.  The Government has added to them to supply the whole town with the works being, on completion, handed over to the Corporation as lessees on payment of interest on the cost of construction.  The total cost of construction as certified by the Hydraulic Engineer, on which interest has been demanded, was £5,652.  Cr Ridgway believes this is an overcharge of nearly 75%. The sum of £960, which is put down as the value of the portion of the old works, is manifestly a fraud.  The tank of 30,000 gallons, in ground and roofed, is absurdly priced.  As to the service pipes - the Department stands convicted of charging a profit of nearly 100%.  The minister promised they would be charged at cost and instructed the Engineer accordingly.  The Council will probably seek the support of the guarantors, who as it means the difference between 6/- and 3/- per 1,000 gallons and will see an increase in the demand for water, will certainly support them.
