The Burra History Group held its AGM last month [actually 28 March] and President Meredith Satchell reported on the year’s activities and accomplishments, including:

The purchase of six 1800 x 1800 mm wheeled pin-up boards to mount displays in the Town Hall.

Digitising a large photo of Belgian Flag Day (WWI).

Supervising the digitising of photos and videos for the Burra Community Library.

Mounting and framing the Chynoweth sampler.

Holding a dinner for Stephen Holder, grandson of Sir Frederick Holder who visited from the US and who unveiled a plaque in Holder Garden provided by the Group with the co-operation of Goyder Council.

Repainting of the Town Hall Supper Room, courtesy of Roy Taplin and the rehanging of its historical photographs.  Julian Ratcliffe produced a catalogue for these photos.

A stall at Redruth Gaol Craft Fair raised $152.

Purchase of an enlargement of Mounted Cheer-up Girls and its framing.  [See page 3 notes below.]  Don Lloyd donated $100 towards the cost and Cheryl Hutchins organised it.

Jessica Lumb, under the Flinders University Industry Practicum Placement researched and created a database to record burials at the Burra Cemetery, assisted at the Craft Fair and has offered ongoing assistance.

Cheryl Hutchins has continued to research and transcribe letters sent home by WWI soldiers and to research photos related to the same.

E. Fuss has continued the task of summarising the history of Burra as reported in local papers.  The Burra Record.  Bound copies of 1942, 1946, 1960 and 1961 [actually 1966] were recently found by staff of the Mid North Broadcaster and have been lent to the Burra History Group for Mr Fuss to summarise before depositing them with the Burra Community Library for preservation.

Ms Satchell & Mr Fuss continue to work on collection information about WWI & WWII soldiers.

Geoff Marshall transcribed the Burra School Register 1920-27.

Julian Ratcliffe completed a booklet on the smelting works.

The Burra History Group continues to oversee the production of the [Heritage] Plaques in Goyder, in collaboration with the Goyder Tourism Office.

Assistance has been given to many people seeking information related to their family history research and a number of them have in turn donated items of historical interest to the town or district.

New surplus history books were donated by the Burra Community Library and are for sale by the Group along with a bundle of out-of-print books purchased from the Burra Visitor Information Centre.

$400 was received from the SA Murray Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board for research by Mr E. Fuss for an information board at World’s End Gorge.

$200 was donated by the producers of the TV program Who Do You Think You Are? For research into a Burra family that may be used in a coming episode.

The Burra History Group was saddened by the death of long-time member Evan Hawke in November.  He is greatly missed.

The Burra History Group is interested in collecting photographs of Burra and the surrounding district and is calling on people to lend their photos for digital copying.  Photographs once copied will be returned.  They are particularly interested in photos of WWI soldiers at present [with the centenary of the war rapidly approaching] and any photos can be left at the Town Hall between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
