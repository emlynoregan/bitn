The Federation Roadshow is presently on display in the Burra Town Hall.  It will be there for five weeks and it seeks to use artists and model makers to show the changes in Australia since 1901 and to answer the questions: ‘Did Federation make a difference; has it had an influence on the everyday lives of South Australians today?’
