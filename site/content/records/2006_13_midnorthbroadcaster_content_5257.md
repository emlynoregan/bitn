Pygmy Bluetongue lizards feature in a documentary to be shown on Channel 9 on 28 April.  It was made by Sir David Attenborough as an episode Dragons of the Dry in the series Life in Cold Blood.  Sir David visited Burra in 2006.  Life in Cold Blood is the first documentary to show footage of the pigmy bluetongue lizards in their burrows, including mothers and their young.  The level of parental care shown by them is unusual in reptiles.  The lizard is a small brown skink about 10 cm long and was thought to be extinct for decades until one was discovered in the stomach of a brown snake in 1992.  A search subsequently found several small colonies across the Mid North and so far 24 colonies have been found from Auburn to Peterborough.  Each of the known colonies is on private property so co-operation and goodwill of landowners is vital.  [Two photos.]
