Kooringa Methodist Sunday School.  The 22nd Anniversary was held last Sunday & Monday.  There were large congregations to hear Rev. E.T. Pryor of Riverton.  On Monday there was the usual children’s and public tea followed by the public meeting.  Removals etc. have considerably depleted numbers of both scholars and teachers.  Proceeds were £27.
