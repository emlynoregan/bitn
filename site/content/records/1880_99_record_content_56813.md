[The ‘first ship’ statement is clearly wrong.  The ships bearing settlers to set up SA in 1836 arrived between July and December.  The Duke of York on 27 July 1836.  Lady Mary Pelham arrived 30 July, John Pirie on 16 August, Rapid on 20 August, Cygnet on 11 Sept., Emma on 5 October, Africaine on 3 Nov., Tam O’Shanter on 20 Nov. & Buffalo on 28 Dec.  Research suggests Osborne arrived on the Cygnet.  Before the settlers there were sealers active along the SA coast after 1803 when Pendleton of the Union exploited seals on Kangaroo Is.  Grant in the Lady Nelson had run along the southeast coast in 1800.  Flinders & Baudin in HMS Investigator & Géographe explored the coast in 1802.  In 1809 the Eliza found sealers living on Kangaroo Island and trade in skins and oil from Kangaroo Is. was established from 1814.  And that is without considering earlier Dutch or Portuguese landfalls.  See: Ronald Parsons, Southern Passages, 1986, Wakefield Press, Adelaide.]
