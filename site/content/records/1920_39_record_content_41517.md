Mongolata Goldfield

No great developments occurred in the last week, but a parcel of 7 tons from Byles’ Claim returned 95oz 3dwt 22gr at Peterborough, which is remarkable.

The men are questioning the quality of the drinking water from the Reformatory tank.

Salter & Hogan intend to float a local company if possible.

Installation of a more powerful engine at Peterborough will delay work there for some five weeks.
