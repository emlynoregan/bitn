Kooringa News, 29 January

A series of robberies has latterly been reported:

T. Richards [boots]

Mr Parks – bacon, cheese, a cake, onions, potatoes, envelopes, tea, etc.

Wesleyan Chapel – a glass bowl and a pair of brass candlesticks

Mr Morris’s shop – pickles, sugar and bottled fruit

Mr Lane’s shop – door wrenched open, but nothing taken

Mr Warnes’ hut at Devil’s Hole – twice – blankets, rations, a small telescope and a ring

Gum Creek – blankets

Mr Parks’ shop was again entered on Sunday night and watch was set.  About 3 a.m. Thursday morning Mr Dyer and George Leinig saw a light in Mr Richard’s shop.  When they investigated a figure fled.  When the police investigated they found a skeleton key in Mr Richards’ lock and a strange door handle.  (Mr Richards had removed his doorhandle to prevent the door being opened even if the lock were picked.)  The key was found to open Mr Parks’ and Mr Morris’s front doors.  Next morning Messrs Drew’s porter found three pairs of ladies’ uppers and a pair of ladies’ cashmere boots in their WC, apparently left there as the thief fled.  Acting from the description of the man, Corporal Shaw issued a search warrant for the premises of one Charles Watts, a journeyman shoemaker of Kooringa, where they found a collection of stolen goods that were readily identified.  Mr Waters, shoemaker, identified a whole lot of items. By the time all had been identified some 200 people had assembled and Watts was arrested.  His wife was also arrested for receiving stolen goods.

Identification of many items was difficult in court and so Watts was charged on three accounts of entering and stealing from Mr Richards, James Waters and Thomas Parks’ shops and one charge of stealing from the Wesleyan Chapel.  The prisoner came originally from Swan River and had conducted himself well around Burra for the last three years.  His conduct in the court was most insolent and it was clear he was not unacquainted with such proceedings.  He was committed for trial.
