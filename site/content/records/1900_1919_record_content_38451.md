Letter from S. Kellaway complaining that contrary to its rules the Burra Football Association dismissed a complaint he made about a player who had abused him.  They also dispensed with his services as an umpire when he refused to go to Terowie â€“ but he had already had three appointments to Terowie and one at Hallett.  He should not be sent away every match.
