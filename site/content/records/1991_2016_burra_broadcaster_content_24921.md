Obituary.  Wally Scott, who used to run the Kooringa Hotel with his wife, died recently.

[Hedley Charles Jones and his wife Ellen were the proprietors of the Kooringa Hotel from 26 February 1951 to 24 July 1962.  Mrs Ellen Scott alone was the proprietor from 25 July 1962 to February 1969.  H.C. Jones died 24 July 1962.   Ellen then married Wally Scott in 1969 â€“ licensing records suggest in February, but the item above suggests April.  As Mrs Scott, she was the registered proprietor until 8 June 1975.]
