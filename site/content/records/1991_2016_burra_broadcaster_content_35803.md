Letter.  Julie Christie, Executive Producer of Touchdown Television, writes to say that on Sunday 6 February Miss Popularity 2005 will begin its run on TVNZ (for 11 weeks).  She asks that if anyone in Burra is contacted from New Zealand that they reveal neither the results of any elimination, nor the result of the final.
