Burra Mines

A report prepared by Mr C.E. Gregory, Bachelor of Engineering and received by the Burra Progress Association.

The SAMA operations ran from 1845-77 and in that time produced 234,648 tons of ore averaging over 22% copper.  The mines closed down at a time when mining equipment and metallurgical treatment methods were much more primitive, transport difficulties were great and labour supply was limited.  In these days with modern methods and equipment and with the price of copper pegged at £76 per ton a deposit of 3½% can yield a satisfactory profit if properly developed, equipped and managed.  Since 1877, apart from some diamond drilling, no deep exploratory work has been undertaken and the bottom levels of the mine have not been de-watered.

The mine comprises 288 acres freehold, with mining rights over a further 11,450 adjoining acres.

Dumps of low grade oxidised ore on the surface have variously been estimated at anything from 170,000 to 440,000 tons and samples of it have yielded 0.86 to 2.77% copper from tests in 1899 and 1901.
