Water over rate allowance 2/6 per 1,000 gallons

Cr Watt asked about a chimney at the Chinaman’s house in Market Square.

Waterworks Committee recommends that water be laid on to the Public School from the main in Kingston St so that the property at the front of Paxton Square and the Brewery would be assessed.

Cr Sampson wanted to know who was employing the Engineer during the repairs to the well.  He felt the Government should be paying him.

The Chairman of the committee said the Government had been written to about it, but so far had not replied.

Cr Watt asked who had told the Engineer to work at the repairs.  No one could say.

Cr O’Leary thought if Cr Sampson had been doing his duty at the time we wouldn’t be asking such questions now.

Cr Sampson replied that he had called attention to things being done by the Engineer without authority on several occasions.

Cr O’Leary said Cr Sampson knew the well was in a state of collapse and the Engineer had to work, or the repairs would never be done.

The Mayor asked that personal feeling be restrained and asked Cr Rabbich to sit down when he rose to speak.

Cr Rabbich tried to move a motion, but was denied.

He apparently moved it anyway, as the paper reports a motion of his that the Government be written to asking to allow the amount of the Engineer’s wages during his time on repairs.

Cr O’Leary moved an amendment that the Engineer be paid as usual by the Council.  It was pointed out that if the Government placed it on the Capital Account the ratepayers would be paying for it forever.

Amendment lost and motion carried after Crs Sampson and O’Leary had indulged in a further series of exchanges.

It was also resolved that the town’s main be flushed.
