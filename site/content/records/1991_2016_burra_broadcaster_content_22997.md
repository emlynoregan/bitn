A Public Meeting at the Courthouse on 16 August at 7 p.m. will hear the results from surveys conducted recently in Burra.  The University of Canberra conducted surveys comparing three historic mining towns: Burra, Charters Towers and Maldon.  The theme was the value of tourism in heritage mining centres.  The other survey, run by students from the Cultural Tourism Course at Flinders University was an evaluation of the Burra Passport system.
