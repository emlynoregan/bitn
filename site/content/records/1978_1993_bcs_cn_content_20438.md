Ron Shipard

I live at 10 Queen street and am married with two grown children, both in business in Burra.  I have been associated with the district for 31 years, having farmed at Hanson and Nyngan in NSW in that time.  I am now retired.  I have worked with tennis clubs, Agricultural Bureaus, the Show Committee, School Council and Anglican Parish Council and have been involved in church activities.  I was first elected to the Burra Burra DC in November 1989 and if re-elected will work to make Burra a cleaner and tidier place and will strive to get value for the money spent.
