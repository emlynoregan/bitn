Wheat at Stations.  [Presumably for the last season.]

Burra received 55,000

Hanson received 75,000

And at 3¼ bushels to the bag this is 422,500 bushels total for the district.

With 1¼ bushels reserved for seed and 25 acres of every 500 being cut for hay, then the average yield was 15 bushels per acre over a cultivated area of 33,200 acres.

Burra despatched 5,365 bales of wool.
