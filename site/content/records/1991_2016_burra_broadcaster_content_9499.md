Council	Amalgamations

Burra Burra DC is in consultation with representatives of Clare, Saddleworth-Auburn and Riverton Councils.  Nothing has been settled.  Local councils must have in place a proposal for amalgamation before 31 March, to be acceptable by the Minister of Local Government by 31 December, to enable elections to be held in May 1997 â€“ if not there will be forced amalgamations and in any event there is no guarantee that any merger proposal will be accepted.
