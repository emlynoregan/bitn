Harvest.  The late harvest has been very patchy.  Some farmers did well and others very poorly.  Some with yields between 16 & 18 bushels per acre but others only got 1 bag per acre – due not only to patchy rain, but also to varying application of fertilizer.  To the east few have even recovered seed wheat.  A farmer at World’s End got 1 bag from a 150 acre paddock.  [He is named as W. Prior on page 5.]
