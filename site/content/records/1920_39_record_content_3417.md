Burra & District Ambulance Committee

When all accounts were paid about Â£18 would be left, practically all of which was owing to the committee for the hire of the ambulance.  A meeting of subscribers is called for 8 March to consider handing over control of the ambulance to the Town Council, which is the preference of the committee.  The garage is now complete.  (The proposed meeting has since been postponed.)
