SA Housing Trust Chairman, J.P. Cartledge, writes to deny any lack of interest in building in Burra.  Its officers have made five visits to the town to obtain offers of land and carry out inspections of sites.  Land has been bought and pegged out in accordance with a subdivisional plan.  Tenders for the erection of homes have been called and the date extended.  Negotiations have been carried on, so far unsuccessfully, with several builders.  The Trust takes strong exception to the misleading headline of 27 February [Housing Trust Not Interested in Homes for Burra.]  The evidence of Mr Ellis, as cited, is quite wrong.  He did not call at the Trust Office and was not informed as stated.  Mr Ellis has since stated that the report was without any foundation in fact.  Mr Ellisâ€™s first contact with the Trust was initiated by the Trust on 5 March, long after the Council meeting.  The Trust is very willing to build in Burra as soon as a satisfactory price can be negotiated.

[The editor then apologises for the headline and says townspeople will be delighted to hear that negotiations are proceeding with Mr Ellis and that local builders are invited to participate.
