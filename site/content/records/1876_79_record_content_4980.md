Burra Lodge. (MUIOOF) At the meeting on Wednesday evening W. Davey was presented with a splendid hunting watch and gold Albert by W. Pearce. [A hunting watch had a hinged cover to protect the glass and an Albert was a watch chain.] This was an acknowledgement of his long service and hopes were expressed he will fare well in the place to which he is removing.
