6 p.m. closing of bars will be subject to a referendum at the next election.

Early Closing in Burra.  The petition has been lodged with the Minister of Industry, Hon. H. Homburg, and after being checked for validity a certificate will be issued to fix a date for counter-petitions.  If there are none the Governor will fix a date on month after which the Act will come into force.
