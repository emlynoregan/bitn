Editorial on the way the SA press had greeted the no confidence motion in Parliament that had seen the defeat of the Playford Government.  In long and convoluted sentences the writer considers the press has become profoundly partisan and degenerate.

2nd Leader on the role of the state in regulating social behaviour.  The writer believes it likely that after debate the state will become increasingly involved.  ‘We think . . . it is a melancholy fact, that civilization is mostly attained by complication.’
