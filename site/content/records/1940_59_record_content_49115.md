School Bus.  Last year Mr Lehmann ran the school bus from Booborowie via Copperhouse for 1/4 a mile.  This year he demanded 2/- a mile and when he got no reply from the Education Department at the opening day of school, he did not run the service.  Twenty-five children are being brought in by private car, but this cannot long continue.
