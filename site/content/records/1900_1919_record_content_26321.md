J. Newland, Labor, was for abolishing the property qualification for the franchise and hoped at least to get it down below the present Â£15.  Everything was done in the interest of the farmer and nothing in the interest of the labourer.  NT should belong to SA and the recent negotiations on it were so secret that even the blotting paper was destroyed.
