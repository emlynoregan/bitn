Municipal Rating Systems

There is a three-column-length article on this topic by A.R. Hutchinson, Research Director of Land Values Research Group.  He discusses the Assessed Annual Value System and the Unimproved Capital Value System (Site Value.)

The first was the only one used till 1887.

The second was used in 1887 in Queensland, where the Queensland Government decided the older system penalised ratepayers who were making good use of the land and favoured those with no development.  The new system was almost universally favoured after a trial of five years.

From 1902 it became optional in WA for Road Boards â€“ the equivalent of Victorian Shires, and has become the overwhelmingly dominant system there.  From 1949 it became possible for WA Municipalities to adopt it.

From 1905 NSW Shires had to use the site value system for general revenue.

In SA it has been less widely used because it requires a local vote of 60% of voters to bring it in.

Victorian authorities had the option of site value rating from 1920 and it has spread to 25 Councils.

Tasmania is the only state where it has not been introduced at all.

Recently authority has been given for Councils there to make the change, but as yet none has exercised the right.

Only one Council in Australia has reverted to the old system.

[The writer then outlines ten arguments in favour of the Unimproved Capital Value system.]
