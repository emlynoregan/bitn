Burra Cycling Classic is to be held this weekend, 2 & 3 August.  The classic event this year is to be dedicated to the memory of the late Vic. Dodman.  Vic was a dedicated cyclist who competed for more than 60 years.  He was a keen amateur as a teenager and a professional in his 20s.  After a bad fall he had to retire in 1949.  At the age of 51 he made a comeback when doctors recommended ‘a little exercise’.  He trained some 300 to 400 miles a week and in 1968 won the Adelaide to Burra Race.  He then went to Victoria for the Lakes Entrance Race of 197 miles, coming 7th.  He came 5th in the Melbourne-Warrnambool race of 161 miles.  He travelled to Europe and competed in a number of veterans’ events.  He continued to compete in Australia till illness forced his retirement, when he moved to Burra with his wife, Gill.  The 2002 event was won by Brian Toseland, a cousin of the famous Deane Toseland, who took fastest time honours in 1938.  This year’s event will feature a race to Eudunda and back over 140 km.  There will be junior races in the afternoon and on Sunday an 8.5 km town course.  [Photo of Vic. Dodman in 1978.]
