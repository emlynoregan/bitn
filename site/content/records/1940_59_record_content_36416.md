Letter.  ‘The Man Who Sees’ writes to commend ‘Ratepayer’ for taking up the cause to slay ‘the giants in revolt who are against Strict Sunday Observance.’  He says as far as he knows there has never been an occasion created by special request from any outside organisation for any such motion as referred to by ‘Ratepayer’.  The writer considers the whole question has been handled wrongly.  If there is a desire for change there are provisions for a petition for it, which would then be handled in a prescribed and proper manner.
