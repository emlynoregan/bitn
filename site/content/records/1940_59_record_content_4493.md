Weather.  Monsoonal rains coming south from the north-east have extended to Burra and the eastern pastoral country, though they petered out as they neared agricultural areas.  Oakbank recorded 220 points, Quondong 113, Sturt Vale 59, Koomooloo 30, Woolgangi 43, Braemar over 50, Baldina 14 and Burra 15.  1940 was a very dry year to the east.  Koomooloo received less than one inch and few stations received more than 350 points.
