Fire Brigade

The Superintendent and chief Officer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board waited on Council.  They had looked at the town and thought the best solution was to apply the Fire Brigade Act of 1913 and form an auxiliary brigade.  He thought at present people were taking tremendous risks.  Four firemen would be appointed: the foreman to get £55 p.a. and three firemen £35 each.  They would be reimbursed if they lost wages while fighting a fire.  Two of the firemen always to be in town and one to sleep at the station each night.  The station to have a phone.  The town had sufficient fireplugs and lacked only men and equipment.  [The division of costs would be as outlined previously.]

The cost of setting up in the first year:	Ford Truck	400

Hose etc.	175

Uniforms	44

Rent	12

Salaries	160

£791

Of this £175 would have to be found locally.

Subsequently the annual cost would be c. £40.

Insurance premiums would drop 15%.

The Superintendent thought the water supply would be adequate, but the plant should be duplicated and he would support any deputation to that end.
