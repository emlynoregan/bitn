The Gulf Road Re-enactment began on Monday.  Marquees were filled with food while bullocky Jim Kelly and his off-siders yoked the bullocks.  They then went to the Smelts area where the teams were hitched to their wagons and loaded with ore for their three week trek to Port Wakefield.  When they got back to the creek Jim Lowe was ready with his teams of mules and donkeys.  The Chilean Cultural Attaché attended and a Scottish band played.  The travellers then set off to Hanson for their first overnight camp.

The Copper Festival 1986 attracted thousands.  It is estimated 1,500 took part in the procession, which featured Burra’s magnificent Jubilee 150 float, band, cars, people in period costume, carts, horses, donkeys, Clydesdales, etc.  After the procession attention turned to the Burra Yacht Club’s annual regatta, at which the winners were:

Boys:	Aaron Schiller & Justin Smart in Nautyless

Girls’ & Women’s	Mandy Baker & Jane Villis

Open	Rikki Loffler & Aaron Slape in Pink Panther

Nautyless won the Tracker James Memorial Cup.

The new event for dragon boats was won by the Matulick team.

In the afternoon the crowd enjoyed bands, buskers, clowns, food stalls etc.

The National Trust sites were open and large crowds visited the newly opened Morphett’s Enginehouse and business was brisk at the Bon Accord Mine Museum, where the mine model and the illuminated shaft attracted favourable comment.
