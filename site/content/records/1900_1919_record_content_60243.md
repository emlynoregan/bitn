L.H. Foote writes to correct the accusations made about the transfer of Mrs Medwell to the Isolation Hospital.  He repeats the information supplied by the Matron, but he endorses the view of the place as cold.  He said he called the ambulance ‘a wind shoot’ and the Isolation Hospital ‘The Freezer’.  He continues to say that taking someone from a warm home to a cold store was inhuman and senseless, when the house was neither quarantined nor fumigated.  Conditions have since been improved, but at the time of the Medwell case were shameful.
