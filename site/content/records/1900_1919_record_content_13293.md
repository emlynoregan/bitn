Burra to Broken Hill & Back by Motorbike

Mr P. Baynes left Burra on a Richards Motor Bicycle powered by a Minerva engine on 1 March at 6 a.m.  He had breakfast at Nackra [sic: presumably Nackara] and dinner at Mannahill and reached Broken Hill at 6.30 p.m. having covered the 233 miles in 12½ hours including breaks.  The road beyond Nackra was in a terrible state, being full of rabbit burrows.  The return trip beginning at midday on Saturday also took 12½ hours.  Mr Baynes says he is unlikely to repeat the experience.  The running cost for the return trip was 3/-.
