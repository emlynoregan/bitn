Burra Mine.  A trip to the top of Peacock’s Chimney on Saturday made my [Mary Woollacott’s] day.  The tradition of drinking a barrel of ale on top of a completed building was honoured in a modified way when a couple of the men who also made the ascent, downed two stubbies instead.  There are photos of the above as proof.  Abut a dozen folk (including some youngsters) made the ascent before the scaffolding was dismantled.
