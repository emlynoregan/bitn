The Red Hill Railway

A speech of Mr C.A.S. Hawker MHR is reported from Hansard.  [c. 1½ columns.]

He considered the various possibilities with respect to the tangle of gauges involved, particularly with an eye to defence needs.

One possibility was to reduce the gauge of the Pt Augusta-Kalgoorlie line to 3’6”, which would have linked the whole of the WA network with that of the Northern Territory line and those of northern SA.

A second possibility would have involved converting the Pt Augusta-Kalgoorlie line to 5’3” and perhaps extending this to Perth, thus giving one gauge from Melbourne, through Adelaide to Perth.

The Defence department wanted a standard gauge line from Broken Hill to Pt Augusta, giving an unbroken gauge from Sydney & NSW lines, through to Kalgoorlie.

He also mentioned the fact that 1st class passengers were deserting rail for aerial travel.

[Somewhat ironically, in view of his death in October 1938 in Australia’s worst aviation disaster.]
