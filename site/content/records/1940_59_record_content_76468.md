Booborowie North School has 20 on the roll with five new enrolments.  The teacher is Mr A.A. Pye.  Numbers are down, as two families have left the district and other children have completed Primary Education.  Margaret Brooks and Ashley Sutton gained their Progress certificates and are now at Burra High and Ivon Garrard, who turned 14, has found employment.  Mr W.J.M. Roberts, Chairman of the School Committee, has sold his farm and left the area.  He was given a farewell at the school.  The Twigden family have also left for Mt Bryan and the school lost Daryl, John, Kaylene and Pamela as a result.  The Wilkes family have moved in, bringing Dorothy, Brian, Kae and Dean to the school.  Stuart Catt will soon be a new pupil.
