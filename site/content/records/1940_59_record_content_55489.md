Burra Air Force Assoc. has raised over £1,000* (including subsidy) for the Burra Hospital, in twelve months, despite having only 40 members.  Of this Mr Harry Giersch of Black Springs has contributed almost £100.  One source has been the collecting of dead wool.  In the near future the Assoc. expects to have a modern bathroom built for patients at the hospital, at a cost of about £800.

[*This sum was corrected in the paper 79, 33, 19 Aug. 1952, page 8 to a little over £700.]
