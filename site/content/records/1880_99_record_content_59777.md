Election Meeting, Tuesday 7 April.  The Mayor, Dr Brummitt, chaired a meeting addressed by Hon. F.W. Holder. His two-hour speech is reported in just less than two columns.

Three years ago he had thought the Government deficit would be £60,000, but it had become £200,000 and since then revenue had fallen sharply in all lines to make the situation worse.  This year railway income was down over £½ million and customs income was down £¼ million.  In the last 5 years taxation per head had been cut from £2-12-8 to £2-4-1, though admittedly income tax had risen.  He then went on to outline the reasons for a new loan of £839,500 – largely to fund obligations entered into by the previous Governments.  He felt that the present indications were for rising revenues and that things were improving.

He spoke of the Village Settlement Schemes.

He dealt too with changes to the Pastoral Act, which removed from the Government the obligation to pay for improvements and passed that duty on to the incoming lessee.

He spoke too on the Butter Bonus Act, the Mining Act, the Workman’s Lien Act and the 1894 Conciliation Act to remove the disastrous effects of strikes.  He also referred to other Acts like the Factories Act 1894, Vermin Districts Act 1894, The Homestead Act, Adult Suffrage and the State Advances Act as well as the Federal Enabling Bill.  He praised the operation of the Export Depot and favoured the reduction in qualifications for voting for the Legislative Council.

[Some farmers had lost their L.C. vote because land values had fallen.]

He supported the idea of a capitation grant [i.e. a payment per student to non Government schools], but would not support reading the Bible in schools.

Thomas Pascoe.  [Check what’s going on here as advertising suggested Holder spoke on 7th and the others on 8th.]

He made a personal explanation of his withdrawal from the previous election campaign.  He favoured an adequate, but small public service.  He did not believe in a single tax policy and was a strong advocate of a wealth tax rather than land and income taxes.  He was a free trader and in favour of Federation.  He was for the retirement of one member of the district at each election rather than both of them.  This move would provide continuity and do away with plumpers.  All classes should be represented in Parliament, especially farmers and producers.  Education should be free up to the compulsory standard.  Beyond that those who could pay should pay.  He did not favour the capitation grant.  He was not present to advocate the requirements of the National Defence League.

Thomas Carter was for the State Bank and the Government Export Depot.  He would not advocate changing the present educational system – though he would support any better arrangement if it were proposed as long as it preserved equity.  He supported the present land and income taxes and thought a wealth tax would be too easily evaded by the wealthy.  He favoured the payment of Members of both Houses of Parliament.  He was for reducing the L.C. voting qualification to £15 and the LC term to 6 years.  He was not in favour of referendums except to resolve deadlocks between the two Houses of Parliament.

W.T. Rabbich.

He had lived in Burra 41 years and had been brought up in the town.  He had travelled widely in SA and had always taken a keen interest in politics.  He had been connected with the Town Council for 7 years and filled other important positions.  He favoured a reduction in the qualifications for L.C. electors.  He would do away with ⅓ of the Members of Parliament.  He believed Members of L.C. should be paid.  He was for free compulsory education and for a capitation grant to private schools equal to what their existence saved the State.  He favoured referendums and liberal land legislation.  Land south of Goyder’s Line should be reserved for agriculture.  Improvements on leases should be paid for by the incoming tenants (less an allowance for wear & tear.)  He would support repurchase of good land for closer settlement.  He was in favour of Federation and believed the Government should assist in the opening of mining ventures.

C.R. Goode.

He had worked in Burra in his youth.  He had been largely connected to the Pastoral and Central Land Boards.  He felt it was good for the Government to sell the outside country and use the money to buy up arable land and settle people upon it.  He did not favour the present secular education.  He wished children to be brought up with a knowledge of the Bible in denominational schools.  He was for capitation grants and against referendums.  He favoured absolute Sunday closing and was for payment of Members of Parliament, but would reduce the level.
