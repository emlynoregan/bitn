Burra Burra DC

Garbage for collection must in future be placed in polythene bags tied at the top.  Maximum three bags per pick-up from a regulation bin with a lid.  No garden refuse at all is to be collected.  Landowners are requested to install approved incinerators to burn paper on their own property.

The Savings Bank of SA has granted a loan to be repaid over 5 years at 9.5% to enable the Council to pay its $10,000 towards the cost of a full scale gymnasium at BCS.

Council has arranged with Northern Salvage to remove old car bodies from the district.  Cost $10 per body.

Following the purchase of ‘Cousin Jack’s’ building in Market Square for a Tourist Office, Council has decided to retain ‘Cousin Jack’s’ as a registered name and also that the name ‘Johnny Green’ and a corresponding symbol be registered.

Two officers of the Tourist Bureau visited Cousin Jack’s and the Caravan Park with a view to obtaining a subsidy or setting up a tourist office and enlarging the park.
