Burra Town Council, Monday.

Council will attend the opening of the new Methodist Church in Kooringa.

A petition seeking work for the 50 unemployed men in the district was received.  A meeting is called for Tuesday night.

Cr Radford suggested they ask the Government for a £200 advance on the annual grant in order to raise road metal – preferable to a loan which would have to be repaid and would increase the assessment.

The Mayor thought they needed a special grant.  (To be repaid via the annual grant.)

This was what was eventually carried.

Cr Harris moved the garden in Chapel St be called the Holder Garden.  2nd Cr Wicklein & carried.

Cr Radford moved the electric lighting scheme submitted by Messrs Turner, Robertson & Co. last year be not accepted.  Carried.
