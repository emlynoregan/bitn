Methodist Church Union.

There is a lengthy report on a meeting in Melbourne on Wednesday that had been chaired by the Lieut.-Governor of SA, Chief Justice Way.  He said there were no doctrinal differences to overcome.  The differences lay in church government.  The biggest change would in fact be in the name.  The advantages would lie in the greatly simplified executive functions.  Four executives would be reduced to one.  In rural areas overlapping Methodist denominations would cease and various schools and colleges would cease to compete with each other.  Methodists could speak with a united voice on ethical questions.  The surplus of ministers created by union could be accommodated in missionary enterprise.  Debts could be consolidated.

Mr S.J. Larke from Canada spoke of the success of Methodist Union there.

Rev. H. Heathersaw spoke for Primitive Methodists in support of Union.

The motion calling for Union was carried unanimously.
