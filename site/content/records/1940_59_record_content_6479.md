Burra Town Council, 7 July.

North Ward 	R.M. Reed	re-elected unopposed

West Ward	F.T. Marston elected unopposed

East Ward	S. Kellaway	76

The Mayor’s allowance was increased by £10 due to the extra effort required by patriotic work.

Council agreed to supply the school with 12 trees for Arbor Day in August.

The Progress Association had a scheme for planting 50 almond trees in the town. Council agreed to accept the offer of almond trees from Mr Kuchenmeister.

Council agreed to the use of the Council truck to take waste material collected by the Girl Guides to the railway station as required.

Cr Lott said the town lights were cut off when it was moonlight.  This happened even when it was cloudy and the place was dark.  It was resolved to write to the Burra Electric Supply Co. asking for lights to be turned on when the moon was invisible.
