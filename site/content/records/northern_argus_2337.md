Derek Rayfield of Burra North writes re the Burra Creek Plan.  The Burra Creek certainly needed tidying up, but does it need a plan orchestrated by our former engineer for the Council and estimated at 1986 prices to cost $186,000?  The burden will largely fall on Burra ratepayers in the form of yet another large loan and the cost will also fall on residents of Booborowie, Farrell Flat and Mt Bryan, though the Council does little to improve those townships.  Surely it is time for a public meeting and for work to be done when funds become available and not by going into another enormous debt.
