Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs B. Stockman (re-elected); Secretary, Mrs M. Tiver (re-elected); Assistant Secretary, Mrs J. Bowden and Treasurer, Mrs P. Dignan.

The secretary reported on a year devoted to money-raising.  Financial members were 45 and average attendance was 22.  $1,159 was received and $1443 was spent on classroom equipment.  Participation in the new School Council has been most rewarding.  On the sports day the Club raised $359 and a Walkathon raised $480 for the Home for Incurables.  With little notice at the end of July a band of mothers from the Primary and High Schools organised a canteen at the school and with Mrs Webster as Supervisor a voluntary roster system was worked out and by the end of the year there was a $400 credit.  The club has also participated in the Education Symposium and other meetings, which gave a better understanding of modern education.
