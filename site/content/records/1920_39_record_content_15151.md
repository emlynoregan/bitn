The Seaside Trip to Glenelg took place on Saturday 14 February.  It is estimated 1050 people took the trip comprising residents of towns from Hallett to Mintaro.  People were astir by 3.30 a.m. to catch the trains.  Each train was headed by two locomotives and the first reached Glenelg about 10 a.m. and the second at about 10.20 a.m.  Many went to the beach, but others sought train and buses for the city.  Many old Burraites joined the visitors at the beach.  The return journey began about 8 p.m. and took about four hours.
