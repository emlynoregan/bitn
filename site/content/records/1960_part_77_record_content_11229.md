Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting: Report continued from last week.

The Mayor said he felt bitter that after the 1961 ratepayers’ meeting rumours circulated that about £1,000 repaid to the Council by the Police Department had not been accounted for and ratepayers had been misled.  This money (£961-5-4) was received on 29 June 1960 and the amount of £493-13-7 due to the Pictures account and £467-12-1 to the general account and this appeared in the 1960-61 balance.  Neither he nor his Council had anything to hide and as Chairman of the Finance Committee for ten years he could answer any question put forward.

[Check this statement because if, as it seems to imply, the sum received was divided between the two accounts, it doesn’t quite add up.]

On Council amalgamation he reported two meetings with the District Council, but after discussion neither he nor his Council could see any major gains in rates or administration and therefore had decided against it.  He thanked Councillors and others including Mrs Baulderstone.

Mr S.J. Woollacott expressed dissatisfaction on the views about the amalgamation, stating he had spent many hours gathering the petition.

Cr Cornelius said he had originally been in favour, but after consultation could see no gains and changed his mind.  Mr Baulderstone said it had been ‘harped’ on for some years and although he had been in favour, he would not support it at this time.

Mr Woollacott also felt that more should be spent on premises owned by him considering the rates he paid.

[Check.  Presumably he meant of services like roads and footpaths adjacent to his properties.]

Mr Jennison commented on the unsightly sandbags used for the traffic island in Market Square.

The Mayor said it was hoped the Highways Department would do something towards implementing a plan that had been approved.

A.J. Bruce commented on the unfit state of the ladies’ conveniences near the Fire Station.  The Mayor agreed, but blamed the travelling public.  Mrs S. Scroop supported this view.

Mr J.G. Carpenter wanted the eradication of noxious weeds enforced.

Mr R. Jennison thought the Aberdeen Playground was in a sad state and Mr W.H. Lloyd (Committeeman) said the swings were in a sorry state, but some new equipment had been added.  There were also questions on cemetery upkeep.

Mr D.T. Jacka, in commenting on town progress, said 24 new homes had been built in Burra since the war.

Mr R.M. Reed asked about the whereabouts of funds donated for school crossing lights that had not eventuated.  The Mayor blamed the previous Town Clerk for inaction here [and for lack of action on cleaning water-tables.]

Dr Pitcher supported the Mayor, saying they had been led to believe there were complications involved, but recent discussions with the Highways Department suggested there would not be difficulties and the matter was being taken up again.  Mr Woollacott queried the competence of the Council in blaming the former Town Clerk for inadequacies and Mr Baulderstone said he would not stand again and so give the town a chance to install a capable Council.

Mr Jennison proposed a vote of thanks to the Mayor and hoped Mr Baulderstone would reconsider his decision regarding a further term as Mayor.
