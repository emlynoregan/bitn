Burra Town Council, 9 April

Cr carpenter moved that a series of dances be held to aid Town Hall Funds.  The Town Clerk said he had tentatively booked the remaining three Fridays not already taken in the year.  He will obtain prices for bands.

The Mayor reported that a recent sacred concert raised £14-9-1 for the Food for Britain Appeal.

Street signs.  Cr Baulderstone suggested vertical signs.

Cr Woollacott agreed they were the modern trend.

Enquiries re costs will be presented at the next meeting.

SAR advised it did not feel justified in spending £400 on the exit road and instead proposed to make an exit to the present entrance road.

Cr Kellaway moved that SAR be advised that such a move would create a dangerous bottleneck.  Carried.

Cr Woollacott moved the matter be brought to the attention of the District MP.  Carried.

Joseph Parkes wrote concerning Paxton square and also asking how many cows in Burra had been tested for TB, why the Hospital could run water across the road to a stagnant pool which bred mosquitoes and why the Hospital was not obliged to cut its Bathurst Burrs.

Pools in the creek will be treated [for mosquitoes].
