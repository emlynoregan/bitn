J.S.R. Oborn writes saying that suggestions re school work at the Show were forwarded to the secretary as soon as the annual meeting was advertised.  Various committee men have told us that a meeting of teachers would be called to revise the prize list.  It was not done and we have taken the stand we have as the only means of bringing our requests prominently before the committee.
