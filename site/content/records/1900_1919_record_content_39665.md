Patriotic Fund Committee

Mr Radford suggested that a portion of the fund be given to the Belgian Fund, but Mr Crewes said he did not believe it possible as they were committed for specific purposes.  Also the Red Cross ladies have said they have enough to do without getting involved with the Belgian Fund.

The Methodist Sunday school children have given up their annual picnic and donated £10-10-0 to the Belgian Fund.

Mr C. Fuss moved that the request of the Belgian Committee be acceded to that for a time all patriotic fund raising from the various subcommittees go to the Belgian Fund.

Leighton Patriotic Fund: £55-9-10.
