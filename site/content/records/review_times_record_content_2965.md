By noon most protesters had left the scene and the Council Chairman Mr James Hawker had returned from Clare.  He said at this stage the Council had no plans to change its mind unless new information was presented to it.  Some of the allegations about changes to the rose garden and the War Memorial were wrong, he said.  He had received no official request for a poll.  In December electors had asked them to seek professional advice and they had done that.  Council had not seen the petition circulated by the Burra Preservation Organisation, but he believed it showed that Queen Street had been closed off, which was a ‘blatant inaccuracy’.
