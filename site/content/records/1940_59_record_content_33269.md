120-mile Burra-Adelaide Wheel Race

Officials of the League of Wheelmen & Committee of the Burra Cycling Club were entertained at dinner by the Mayor and Burra Councillors on Friday night prior to the race.  Speakers were the Mayor & Mr T.H. Woollacott.  The League President Mr J.A.B. Williams responded.  The Mayor said he hoped that some day, next year perhaps, the race would be run from Adelaide to Burra.  The President said many of his colleagues were in favour of that.  It presented a number of practical advantages.  The referee H. Stephens also spoke in favour of the idea.  The Mayor handed over a tea & coffee service worth £10-10-0 as the winner’s trophy and a cheque for £5-5-0 for the first country competitor to finish.  R.A. Bevan President of the Burra Cycling Club said he hoped the Adelaide-Burra Race would come off next year.  Also speaking were V.P. Elliott (Steward) and Dean Toseland on behalf of the riders.  Quite a number of people gathered in Market Square on Saturday morning to see the race begin.  The race was won by R. Woolston off the 24 minute mark.
