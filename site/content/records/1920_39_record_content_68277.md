RSL Fancy Dress Football Match

Last Saturday at the Aberdeen Oval this match aided local distressed diggers.  After assembling at the clubrooms there was a parade around Market Square before taking lorries to Aberdeen where there was another procession before re-boarding the transport to the oval.  There the local team of veterans met Birdwood’s Diggers.  Eventually the Diggers won 6.3 to 3.2.

In the half-time interval a mock battle was staged.  The ambulance men ‘were enough to frighten a sick man to death as they, one and all wore butchers’ aprons’. 

Bill Young, Don Halliday & Bill Kellaway Jnr staged a spectacular display of car driving – at speeds over 60 m.p.h. through a flaming arch with just enough clearance for the car and each time they went through a loud explosion shook the place.

Two bicycle races were held in the other intervals of the match.

A successful dance followed at Aberdeen Oddfellows Hall.

The Distressed Diggers Fund will benefit by c. £23.
