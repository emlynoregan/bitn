Burra Town Council

Council resolved to meet the Local Government Department Inspector at Burra on 20 August to discuss the problem caused by the narrowness of the Mine Bridge.

The Burra Schools Centenary Exhibition Committee was granted permission to use Victoria Park on 5 October.

[Cr Dow again carried on his complaining about trees in West Ward.]

It was resolved that the Public Works Committee will supervise the ongoing planting of trees.

Cr Dow reported that the floodlighting at the Fallen Soldiersâ€™ Memorial was nearly completed and it was decided to request Mr Pickering as President of the local RSL Sub-Branch to perform the opening ceremony on Friday 21 August.
