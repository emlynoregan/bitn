Burra Co. MR.  18 men eventually went to the Gladstone encampment and returned Monday after a few days hard fighting.  They left Burra about 9 a.m. Thursday and reached Gladstone about 6.30 p.m.  There was a long drill Friday morning amid heavy showers.  Another afternoon drill and an unexpected call-out at 9.30 p.m.  About 200 men attended in all so picket and outpost duties fell a bit heavily on the same men.  The exercise Battle of Rocky River was held Saturday night after field firing Saturday afternoon.  There was a Fife and Drum Band entertainment before bed at 10 p.m.  The bugle was to announce an attack at some unknown hour.  The Mounted Rifles were victorious about 3 a.m. Sunday morning.  It was all very successful, the only dampener being the loss of J. Pearceâ€™s horse which broke a shoulder when it panicked on returning from being watered and tried to jump a fence.  It is likely the Government will compensate Mr Pearce.
