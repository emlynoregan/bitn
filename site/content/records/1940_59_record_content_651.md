Burra Mine.

Engineers, C.E. Gregory & E.A. Richards, visited the mine recently and we understand that a shortage of copper caused them to investigate the possibility of the mine’s restarting.  Pumping could now be easily done with modern technology.  In 1907 there was a big attempt to float capital, both English and Australian, but a sudden drop from £105 to £61 per ton stopped all work.  W.A. Horne, a well-known mining man of the time, was said to have paid £1,000 for an option for 9 months, during which £15,000 was to be expended.  Further developments are awaited.

An extract from a diary of 9 April 1846 is printed.  It had been printed in the paper of 31 July 1907.  It tells of a visit of the Governor Sir George Grey with Mr Thomas and Capt. Finnis.  They inspected the surface and underground workings with Capt. Ey.  On 10 April 1846 it talks of a survey of 120 acres for the township and the marking of the boundaries of the blocks.  On 11 April it reports the departure of Mr Gleeson on a day so dusty that candles had to be lit inside to write by.  Wallace finished the first cottage in the town, which was then ready to roof.  Mr Kingston finished his survey of Kooringa, having laid out 65 half-acre blocks, 3 blocks of 2/2 acres [sic?] for cottages and 10 acres for Crawford.  131 tons 13 cwt of ore was sent to Adelaide that week.
