Ron Dewhirst writes about the new Mid North Football Association arrangements.  He is sorry to see so many Burra players from last year’s premiership side deserting their team instead of defending their team’s honour this year.  He maintains that Burra cannot field two ‘A’ Grade teams.  Each team needs at least 25 players to account for injuries, sickness etc.  Burra has won about three premierships in 25 years – hardly an indication it can field two ‘A’ Grade teams of the strength to repeat last year’s performance.  At any rate the new team has yet to be cleared by NEFA and as we were not recognised by the SA League last year they cannot rule over our own league.  If clearances are not granted (and he thinks they should not be) they would have to appeal to the National Council – a time consuming thing.  The players should reconsider and stick to their former team.
