Obituary.  Mr Hedley Harris who died at Fullarton 13 September 1942 is well known in Burra. He was born in Kooringa in 1876, the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs John Harris, bootmaker.  On leaving school he had a wood merchant’s business, but later went to Hallett where he had a grocery and general store, which he carried on successfully for more than twenty years.  On selling it he moved to a similar business in Fullarton with several branch stores, which he operated successfully.  He married Miss Margaret Bown, second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Bown of ‘Springbank’ near Burra in 1903.  Heart trouble supervened about six months ago and complications in the last few weeks proved fatal.  He was a member of Parkside Methodist Church.  He leaves a widow and a grown-up family of four. He also leaves two brothers, Mr Frank Harris of Burra and Mr E.J. Harris of Glenelg as well as a sister Mrs Frank Pearce of Burra.

[William Hedley Harris born 27 June 1876, Kooringa.  He was the youngest surviving son.  Three younger sons died in infancy; in fact in a family of 14 children 9 died as infants.]
