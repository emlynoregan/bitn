Bowls.  Swarms of grasshoppers made it uncomfortable on Saturday.  They had eaten the green quite bare of grass and interfered with the bowls, being flattened by them and then deflecting them.  A previous such attack took place in 1935 or 1936.  Burra Gold 101 defeated Burra Green 83.

[The appropriate reference would seem to be 55, 51, 19 Dec. 1934, page 3.]
