Burra Town Council, 16 July

The Burra Institute Committee has replied to Council, saying it would meet them on 18 July to discuss the Councilâ€™s taking over of the Institute.

A letter from the Secretary of the Nuriootpa Band offered to buy the Burra Ban Instruments.

It was decided not to entertain this idea.

Cr Jennison was welcomed as the representative for North Ward, before business began and Cr Carpenter and the Mayor were also congratulated on their election.
