The Golf Club Ball was held in the Institute on the evening of 30 May.  S.E. Stewart & A.L. Bence provided near life-sized caricatures of some of our prominent golfers as part of the decorations.  They were wonderfully well done and caused much amusement.  Music was by the Gawler Syncopators Jazz Orchestra.
