Baldina Methodist Church.  The new church was opened last Sunday when Rev. W.G. Clarke preached.  The public meeting on Monday was crowded.  The building cost £125 in cash and labour and there is an outstanding debt of £20.  [This refers to the stone building which replaced an iron building: the former was known as the Tin Pot Church and there is a reference to the new church as the Stone Jug Church by comparison.]
