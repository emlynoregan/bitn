Opening of the Burra Railway.   The formal opening of the new line will take place next Monday.  The people of Kooringa are sparing no effort to make their special demonstration a great success.  His Excellency the Governor and Lady Edith Fergusson, some of the Ministry, departmental officials and a large number of ladies and gentlemen have been invited and favoured with free passes by the Commissioner of Public Works.  A train carrying first and second class passengers will leave Adelaide at 7 a.m., calling at all stations and expected at Burra Station at 12.30 p.m.  The Governor will then declare the line open and will receive an address.  Luncheon will follow in the goods shed at about 1 p.m.  Toasts will be limited to allow the visitors to see the neighbourhood before rejoining the train at 4 p.m.  There will be an entertainment in the evening at the Burra Hotel presented by Rev. Stanton and others.
