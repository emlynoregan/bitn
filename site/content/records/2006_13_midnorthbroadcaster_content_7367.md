Helen Szuty writes concerning Morehead St trees.

As the spokesperson for the Ratepayers Action Group I expect local residents to be consulted concerning the removal and ongoing maintenance of historic street trees in Morehead St.   We have lived with these trees for 60 years and owe it to ourselves and the amenity of our community to make the most appropriate decisions under the circumstances.  My own street survey identified only two trees that have actually died.  All the rest have signs of regrowth.  I call on the Regional Council to consult with residents.  There are places in the street where trees have already died and not been replaced.  Additional mature trees could be planted to fill these gaps.    Street trees improve amenity, contribute to higher property values and provide habitat for birds and native animals such as possums.  It is commendable that the councilâ€™s heritage advisor was consulted.  All that remains is for the local affected residents to be consulted.
