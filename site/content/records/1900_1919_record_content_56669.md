After much discussion, which is reported in just over 1 column, it was decided to retain Mr F. Smith to assist Mr Winnall in defending the case brought by George Lawn & Co.

[Part of the difficulty in discussing the matter arose inevitably because Cr McBride seems to have also been part of the ‘& Co.’ bringing the case.]
