Burra Burra Oddfellows Lodge

On 25 March about 50 members had a dinner at the Burra Burra Hotel where Mr Barker provided a sumptuous feast.  At the head of the table were T.W. Powell (Chair), PGM W. Pearce (Vice Chair), Mr Macdonald SM, Dr Mayne JP, PG Brewer and NG Birbeck.  Past Grand Pearce was presented with a silver hunting watch in appreciation of his past service to the Lodge and in particular for his role in the re-forming of the Lodge upon the return of some of its members from the gold fields.

[Other members mentioned as playing a role were PGM Brother Brewer, GM Brother Dawson, PGM Brother Wells, Mr Weir, Warden Corey, Mr Thomas, PGM Brother Pinch & Mr Johnstone.]

[In one response to a toast NG Birbeck said that about three years ago there were scarcely enough members to form a lodge and now they had 96 good on the books.]
