Combined Physical Culture Team from 26 different Metropolitan Clubs visited Burra last Thursday.  They were to have gone to compete in Ballarat, but the infantile paralysis epidemic in Victoria forced a revision of plans.  A fine display was staged in the Institute in the evening and on Friday they visited the old mine before leaving.
