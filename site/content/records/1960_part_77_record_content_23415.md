Arthur Jordan.  An article from the Gawler Bunyip of about 12 months earlier is reprinted.

Arthur D. Jordan of Gawler is 90 today.  One of his most vivid recollections is likely to be the day, 78 years ago, that he climbed the Smelters’ Chimney at Burra.  The young ‘Art’ Jordan shinned up the 85 ft stack with townspeople looking on.  Since then he has become a citizen of Gawler and a Life Member of the Gawler Jockey Club.  He managed A. Sheard’s Essex House in Gawler for 25 years and had his own drapery business for 27 years in the store occupied by Gordon Ames.  He was Secretary of the Gawler Chess Club during its active years.  He was born in Clare.  [Born at Kooringa: see below.]

[A couple of verses of the poem When Arthur Climbed the Chimney are printed.]

[See Burra Record 57, 45, 10 Nov. 1936, page 3: Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward.  Arthur Jordan was the son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.  Arthur Dawson Jordan born 8 March 1873 Kooringa: died 28 October 1965, Gawler.]
