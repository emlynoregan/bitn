‘Archie’ McLagan was well known in Burra, having entered the banking service here four years ago.  Here he was secretary to several clubs and a member of the Burra Orchestra and PCR in the Foresters Lodge.  He left Burra 18 months ago to fill a position in the Perth Bank.  He was entrusted to take £2,000 of the Bank of Australasia’s from Pert to Kalgoorlie and went missing.  He and two associates have now been charged with the theft of the money.
