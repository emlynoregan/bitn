The English & Australian Copper Company

An advertisement recently in the London Times announced that an English & Australian Copper Company was about to be formed with a capital of £350,000, of which the whole was to be paid up.

The Times on 1 December commented:

The company is in the hands of parties of experience and respectability, and the object is to carry on certain works already established at Swansea and in SA.  These works have previously been carried on by a private association of a few persons and their transfer to a joint stock body is stated to be on account of their increasing size and importance.  A contract has been made with the Burra Burra Company for smelting the whole of the ore from that mine for five years from 1 October 1851, upon receiving a fixed proportion of the produce, and the process is to be conducted under the exclusive possession of Napier’s patent, which applies to France, the United States and the colonies as well as to Great Britain.  The assignment of this patent, together with the works, lands, wharfs, etc. is to be taken from the existing proprietors upon the terms at which they are now held, and upon condition of allowing to those parties for five years one half of the net profits after dividends of 15% shall have been paid to the shareholders.
