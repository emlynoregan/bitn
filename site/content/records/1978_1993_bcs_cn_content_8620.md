Council is considering proposals for the Reserve and will soon announce its plans.  Years ago Redbanks was a well-known overnight stop for resting and watering travelling stock.  More recently it has become a recreation area.  Some months ago the Council received submissions from surrounding landowners concerning off-road vehicles leaving the reserve and entering private land.  The Department of Lands then reduced the area of the reserve by allowing landowners adjoining it to fence down to three chains on the Baldina Creek portion and on the northern side of Redbanks Reserve, as requested by the landholders.

The Department then offered the Reserve to the Burra Burra DC with a suggestion the Council should consider maintaining the off-road vehicle section as this facility had been available for many years and allowing the Council to make its own decision on the sub-leasing.

From the recommendations of the Redbanks Reserve Committee Council accepted a proposal to fence the Reserve, providing an area for off-road vehicles, an area for recreation and one for controlled grazing.  There would need to be an easement for water from Baldina Creek for the Radford Familyâ€™s irrigation block on the north side of the Reserve.

Chairman of the Council, Mr Janes Hawker, said the Council was aware of the value of tourism to the town and it had been ascertained that off-road users do contribute to the viability of certain traders.  Council was also aware of the previous unruly element sometimes seen at Redbanks.  Council believed that the offer recently made by the motor cycle clubs will bring about self-regulated control by the clubs under Council supervision.
