Mary Warnes Community Room (The Baby Care Room)

The room will be officially opened on 24 April.  It will be opened by Carolyn Cooke, granddaughter of Mary Warnes.  It was first mooted as a project in 1994, when the old swimming pool facilities were vacated.  They proved unsuitable and after consultation with the Council, they made the space between the Visitor centre and the former Boulger store available.  Many of the townâ€™s contractors have worked on the site and have donated a wide door for double pram and wheelchair access, a sink with hot and cold water, a large change trolley and bench and a playpen area for toddlers and comfortable seating.  The CWA, which was founded in SA by Mary Warnes, has also been a supporter.
