Burra Cheer-up Society

The Hon. J. Lewis has loaned a piano to the Society for the duration.

Mr Pearce has had acetylene gas lighting installed in the room.

On Wednesday Lieut. Stevenson, who was on a farewell visit, called in on us.

Some members attended St Mary’s Schoolroom at the invitation of Rev. Bloyd on Thursday last to help farewell Rev. Durnford who was about to leave for the front.

[This was probably Wednesday as elsewhere he is said to have left on Thursday morning.]
