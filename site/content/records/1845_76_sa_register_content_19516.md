At Redruth Court today a man named Hockey was fined for assaulting Mrs Veal.  He impudently said he would not pay and when told he must, he behaved in a most unbecoming manner and was removed by Corporal Shaw and two assistants.  His wife then assaulted the complainantâ€™s husband in open court and tried to rescue her husband from custody.  Hockey was then imprisoned for seven days and his wife reprimanded.
