Influenza.

Local Board of Health, Monday, ordinary meeting.

Dr Lyndon attended in place of Dr Williams, who had influenza.

The secretary E.J. Davey reported that the telephone had been connected to the Isolation Hospital (The Boy Scout Room).

Mr Crewes said he had spoken to Dr Ramsay Smith when the outbreak began.  He had expected to receive instructions by telephone, but got none.  He had received a wire asking for a report and had replied by wire, but still got no response.  The Board had then met and on Dr Williams’s advice had decided to close the schools and use the Burra School as an Isolation Hospital.  Mr Hitchcox refused to close the school unless instructed by the Minister of Education.  Mr Crewes then wired Dr R. Smith who asked if the Medical Officer wanted the schools closed.  Dr Williams was by then ill, but Dr Steele had arrived home and after consulting with Dr Williams it was decided not to close the schools.  Dr Smith then wired asking who had authorised the Town Clerk to ask the Mayor of Peterborough to send Central Board of Health equipment to Burra.  Dr Smith was sending equipment for beds without blankets or sheets, which patients should supply.

Dr Williams reported the first case of pneumonic influenza on Sunday 11 May.  He was taken ill the following day, but Dr Steele had arrived.  Dr Steele selected the Scout Hall as the best Isolation Hospital.

Dr Smith sent a Matron to take charge and a VAD to assist and an orderly.

Cr McBride was somewhat annoyed at not being involved, but no one seems to have known that he arrived in town on the Tuesday and the Board had also believed Cr Bartholomaeus to be away, when he was actually available.  He wondered why the Burra Hospital was not being used, but isolation problems there were explained.

The medical Officer said 10 cases, 3 serious, had been reported.

Dr Steele said serious cases should go to hospital and mild ones be treated at home.

There was some considerable discussion about where patients could and/or should have been treated.

Cr McBride was clearly annoyed at not having been involved and that there was little in the way of written records of what had been done.

[It should also be remembered that he was Chairman of the Burra Hospital Board.]

Dr Smith had stopped the movement of equipment from Peterborough.  The Town Clerk thought Dr Smith, or Ramsay Smith as he called himself, had behaved unfairly.

The Town Clerk is to write for the loan of the Peterborough equipment – there have so far been no cases since the initial outbreak.

The Minister of Education had written to say the Department was anxious to assist, but would not do so under compulsion.

Burra Hospital reported three cases of influenza there.

Messrs Dring & Medwell, relatives of the late Mrs Medwell formed a deputation complaining that:

The home where Mrs Medwell had been had not been fumigated, though there were three small children in it.

Neither had it been isolated.

Mrs Medwell had been sent to a cold, barn-like place without a ceiling.

Mr Medwell was in the same place still.

The Isolation Hospital ‘was a den and highly discreditable to an important town and to remove a woman in Mrs Medwell’s condition to such a place seemed to him inhuman.’

The sanitary conditions in the neighbourhood of where his son lived were abominable and should have been supervised.

The ambulance was popularly known as ‘The Freezer’ and Mrs Medwell was moved without stockings or a blanket.

Dr Lyndon said heaters had been put in and professional nursing was the patient’s only hope.

Mr Dring suggested a bagging ceiling might at least prevent condensation from dripping from the roof onto patients.

Cr Dane moved all infected houses be fumigated at once and all possible be done re the ceiling.

Despite the risks Dr Lyndon said he favoured using the Burra Hospital, but pointed out he was only Dr Steele’s locum until next Friday.

Cr Bartholomaeus and Cr McBride moved to get part of the hospital set aside as the Isolation Hospital if the Hospital Board was willing.

Dr Lyndon thought if they were prepared to risk spreading the infection it was worth the risk.

Cr McBride was sure the Board would be.  Passed unanimously.
