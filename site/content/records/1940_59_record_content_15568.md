Burra Police Court, 25 November

J.C. Murrray pleaded guilty to common assault on G.G. Lines.  The fine with costs etc. amounted to £49-12-6.  The trouble had arisen over the fact that Lines had been driving sheep over a road rented by Murray.  It was alleged that Lines had also cut certain fences and the sheep of the two had become mixed.

Fire.  Dunnage at Burra Railway Station caught alight on Saturday morning.  It belonged to the Australian Wheat Board and about £20 damage was done.  Permanent way men had been burning off grass when wind blew the fire into the dunnage heap.

Fire also caused about £25 damage to the wheat stack at the station.  The fire appears to have started about 80ft from the southwest corner and burnt the protective curtains and some bags, causing them to burst.  On investigation it was found it actually started on top of the stack, possibly caused by a cinder from a locomotive.

A.D. McDonald has won LCL endorsement for the next election.
