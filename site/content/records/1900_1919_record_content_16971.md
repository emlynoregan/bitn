Accident.  On Saturday last Mr Allen, on going to H. Roach’s Flour Mill missed the stallion Bellatrix from the stable.  The horse was found, having fallen into an underground tank whose roof had fallen in.  Tom Vivian got to the site before Mr Roach and set to work to get the horse out.  Slings were arranged and the tank bailed out till it got down to 4’6”.  By then a winch and ropes and pulleys were procured.  When it was ten months old Mr Roach had practically sold the horse for £100, but reneged on the deal and now it is 2½ would not sell him for £250.  He is a fine horse 15.3 high.  Much of the credit for the successful rescue goes to the quick and effective work of Tom Vivian.
