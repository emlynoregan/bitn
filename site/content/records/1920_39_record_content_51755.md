Premier’s Visit to Burra

Last Friday Premier Hon. R.L. Butler accompanied by Hon. S.W. Jefferies Minister for Education, Employment and Attorney General visited to discuss Burra’s unemployment problem.  District MPs G.F. Jenkins, A.D. McDonald and Alex Melrose also attended.  They were met by the Mayor T.H. Woollacott and the Councillors.

After lunch they went to Copperhouse School where they met the head teacher Mr Nelson and members of the school committee.  A deputation waited on the Minister re a land survey and a shelter shed for the students.

The Minister of Education then visited Burra Primary and High Schools.  The Primary School was decorated with flowers and gum tips.  Mr McConnon the headmaster of the Primary School received the visitors who were also welcomed by the school committee.  The Minister said it was a pleasure to see the children in a well lit and well built school that was not overcrowded.  After addressing the pupils he regretted that on this occasion he could not grant a half holiday, but he said that the September holidays this year would be extended by four days to mark the Royal Visit of the Duke of Gloucester.  Each class then received a visit.

The party then proceeded to the High School where the Minister met the staff and addressed the students.  The visitors then made their way to the Institute, picking up the Premier en route, for the main object of the visit.  A deputation of the Mayor and Councillors expounded on the unemployment situation in Burra.  They requested funding for local unemployment relief work.  Mr McDonald in introducing the deputation pointed out that the Council had done all it could in this way and their actions had placed severe strains on Council funds.  Burra’s location meant that unemployed from a large district gravitated towards the town.

The mayor took up Mr McDonald’s argument.  He said that in 1930 their revenue had been over £3,500 while now it was only £2,000 and wards that had received £500 for their work now got only £150.  As an old town Burra had many old building that produced very little in rates.  Out of the £2,000 income unavoidable expenses such as the Burra Hospital contribution (£170), street lighting, fire brigade, salaries and rent took about two thirds of it leaving little to be expended on the town.

Funds expended on unemployment relief had been:

1931-32	£58-10-0

1932-33	£44-18-0

1933-34	£104-7-0

Total	£207-15-0

An additional £290 had also been expended in extra labour employed to assist the unemployed in payment of rates etc. making a total pf over £500.  As things stand now the Council will end the year with a deficit of at least £200.

Being located as it was with Goyder’s line only six miles east many local men were employed on sheep stations in good years, but because of the depression and the drought employment there was now minimal and the wheat farmers were in a similar position.  As a result Burra was a centre to which much unskilled labour had gravitated.  There was a population of about 1,800.  Shearing used to be another source of employment for local men, but now most was done by companies that moved from shed to shed.  When men were allowed to work off their rates they received no income for their labour, but the Council received no money either.  The Mayor had a list of 70 unemployed men, many of them married.  These men were not part of any union activity, nor were they of any particular political party: all they wanted was work and that urgently.
