In his report Mr Quinn thanked staff, board members and the community for their support and congratulated the CEO Mr Chilton and Director of Nursing Mrs Phillips and Senior Staff for developing and planning renovations and obtaining Health Commission approval and funding of $200,000 for the project.  The transfer of the Day Care Centre function to the Aberdeen Football Clubrooms also attracted a $76,000 Government grant.  The relocation is expected to occur in October.
