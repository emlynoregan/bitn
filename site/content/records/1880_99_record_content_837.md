Burra Town Council 19 April

A deputation of Messrs Roberts, Snell, Coglin, Geake & Morris presented a memorial with c. 40 signatures calling for the Thames St Bridge to be proceeded with immediately.

The footbridge at the courthouse is to be renewed.

There is a proposal for a direct road from Hampton to Redruth, through the Police Paddock, but not this year.

It was recommended that there be a road in conjunction with the District Council to go west from the hospital to allow direct access to the town from that direction.

C. Rawling’s tender of £94 for the cemetery bond of £100 was accepted.

Mr A. Bartholomæus’s tender of £267-17-0 for a bridge in Thames St was accepted.

Both tenders for the widening of the bridge in Queen St were considered too high.

Father Kriesll’s and Mr Ullmann’s offers of trees were accepted.
