Six Letters to the Editor expressed concern over the removal of figures from the Nativity Scene in Market Square.  Some writers were angry and others moved more by sorrow and disappointment.

Shirley Broad’s letter revealed that Baby Jesus had been found on a car in Welsh Place, a Wise Man appeared at a policeman’s residence, a camel was found in Kangaroo Street, two other figures were at Richard’s Garage and one was found pumping petrol at the Aberdeen.  A bull was recovered from Thym’s lawn, but two twin lambs and a shepherd boy remain missing.

Both the Anglican and Uniting Church ministers condemn the action, but urge people to place it in perspective as a tasteless prank and not to blame all the town’s youth for the actions of a few.
