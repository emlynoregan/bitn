Ulooloo Diggings.  Affairs here are progressing.  On Wednesday last some 150 persons were here and about 60 more have now joined them.  Some men are making good wages.  Payable ground has been found for two miles.  The Northern Argus reports that many men have caught the gold fever since the discovery of the 12 oz nugget in December.  By Tuesday morning some 250 were on the field.  They are sinking depths of from 18 inches to 5 ft through alluvial drift on a bottom of perpendicular slate.  The main workings are on tributaries of Ulooloo Creek.  Average earnings appear to be between 5/- and 6/- per day.  Several reef claims have been taken up, but only one has been developed yet.  Their shaft is down 14-15 ft.  The recent floods damaged the workings.  We would not advise anyone in regular work to throw it in and go gold seeking here, but the unemployed would do no harm in giving the place a good trial.
