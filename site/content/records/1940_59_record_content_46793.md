Burra Hospital held its AGM, presided over by Chairman F.T. Marston, who welcomed subscribers and ratepayers and said it was the first meeting of its kind held for many years.  He hoped a similar meeting would be held annually in the future.  He reviewed the year and said the overdraft had been reduced by £800 – mainly due to the collection of outstanding accounts and increased patient fees.  Mr Marston had taken over from E. Finch on the latter’s resignation, due to ill health, in May 1950.  Matron O’Neil had resigned in May 1949 and Matron Tscharke, who had been in charge of the Midwifery Section for some years, had succeeded to her position.  Dr Steven resigned as MO when he left the town, after being connected with hospital for 27 years.  Dr Heddle became the MO.

The costs of materials and salaries have both risen sharply and patients’ fees had to be increased.  Strong action to collect outstanding accounts was also needed.

Staffing has remained difficult, though domestic staff have not been quite such a problem as previously.  Quite a lot of equipment needed to be replaced and the Red Cross was a great help in this area.  Public subscriptions allowed the installation of a coke stove and new stoves were also installed in the Maternity Wing (gift of Dr Heddle) and in the second kitchen (gift of Mr J.R. Barker.)  The maternity Wing is being painted and a new sink installed.  The kitchen is receiving similar treatment.  The report on the sanitary condition of the Hospital in April has jolted the Board into action and aroused dormant public interest.  Many of the places needing attention dated from the time the Hospital was founded.

The visit of the Chief Secretary Hon. A.L. McEwin, Dr Rollison (Director of Medical services) and Mr Scantlebury (Secretary of the Hospitals Department,) resulted in the news that, while permission for an entirely new hospital could not be given, additions and renovations were possible.  Mr Dean Berry, architect, suggested a large addition to be used for medical purposes be built, to form a T on the east end of the Maternity Wing and the present building housing the Men’s Ward, Women’s Ward, etc. be used as the Nurses’ Quarters.  This report will soon go to the Chief Secretary.  The cost will be about £50,000, which means this district will have to raise £25,000.  [Rather than the £250,000 actually printed!]  This will give Burra a modern hospital.

The Board has approved new rules, which have yet to be approved and so cannot operate this year.  They allow for subscribers and ratepayers to elect three members to the Board.  Women’s Organisations are to elect one, the Chief MO will be a member and seven will be elected by the rate-contributing Councils.

[The balance sheet is then printed.]

Dr Heddle presented the Medical Report.

Admissions of 622 were up 100 on the previous two years and up 50 on 1946 & 1947.  The daily average was 18.6 patients compared with 29 in 1946-47.  Maternity cases were 77 in 1946 and 95 in 1946-49.

Additions and improvements in 1949-50:

A gas and oxygen machine in Maternity

A new autoclave for the Theatre

Electric sterilisers for the Theatre to replace the kerosene heater

An Esse (coke) stove in the General Kitchen

New wood stoves in the General Pantry and the Midwifery Pantry

Painting of the Midwifery Section and Kitchen is in progress

New rubber floor covering has been laid in the Labour Ward and new lighting installed.

[Dr Heddle also referred to the desirable changes and renovations as previously described in the report on the sanitary condition of the Hospital.]
