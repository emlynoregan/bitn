Editorial on the Burra Election

The four candidates offer very similar policies and so the voter needs to look to their personal fitness.  The whole colony will be watching to see if Burra voters ‘have or have not so lost all sense of their own decency, and the decency of Parliament, as to return one who, not so many months ago, stood darkly out as too black to be any further maligned.’  [This was clearly a reference to Ebenezer Ward.]

He had just passed through the court after squandering thousands of his creditors’ money, the estate paying, so it is said, 2/- in the pound.

[The blistering attack goes on for c. 1½ columns and the outrage is not principally about the money mentioned, but seems to have concerned a libel case over matters too indelicate to specify, but clearly well known to the readers.]
