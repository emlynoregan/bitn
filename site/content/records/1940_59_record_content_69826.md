Burra Burra DC at its last meeting expressed deep concern over the moves to transfer Booborowie and Leighton Wards.  The Council deprecated the attitude of Spalding Council in having the area canvassed, starting a move to annex a large portion of the Burra Burra Council and making promises and endeavouring to whip up feelings of animosity towards the Burra Burra Council.  They also felt the move would completely unbalance the Burra District by bringing the western boundary to within five miles of the town.
