Burra Rifle Club held its AGM 26 June.  Elected were: Captain, T. Lynch; Vice-Captain, K. Spackman; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt; Treasurer, D.H. Field; Armourer, J.H. Schwier and Handicapper, J. Brown.

The Captain reported on a successful year.  During the war part of the range changed hands and is now owned by Mr Eric McWaters.  He has generously allowed the club continued use.  Four inter-club matches were fired in the Lower North Teams Contest:

At home v. Auburn and Salisbury

Away v. Tanunda and Eudunda.

There was a visit to Waikerie and a team entered the Country Teams Championship at the Dean Range.  [The report then covers some of the trophies won, as already reported.]

Tribute was paid to the late member Cyril Collins who had died in the last 12 months.  He was prominent in the club for many years and paid ‘possible’ money for many years.  He was a life member.
