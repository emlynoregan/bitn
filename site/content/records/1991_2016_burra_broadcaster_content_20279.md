The Venning Family Celebration

About sixty descendants of early Venning settlers converged on Burra for the weekend to celebrate 150 years of settlement in SA.  There was a barbecue on Saturday night, a church service on Sunday morning followed by a luncheon catered for by the church ladies and then a tour of Burraâ€™s heritage sites.

Darryl Venning outlined the Burra connection: Richard Jasper, a local policeman had married Jane Venning in the Church of England in March 1850.  Other sections of the family had settled in Saddleworth, Auburn and other nearby towns and districts.  [Photo.]
