Rev. M. Wilson preached special sermons on Sunday on behalf of Wesleyan Missions and promoted the same cause at a public meeting on Monday and to young people on Tuesday.

On one of Mr Tylerâ€™s northern stations recently a flood swept away the huts and total possessions of two men named Moore and Brooks who were living there with their wives.  They all had a very narrow escape and are now penniless.  I understand Rev. Hancock is endeavouring to obtain relief for them and will gladly receive contributions on their behalf.

Shearing is now over and wool carting is rapidly proceeding.  I believe the clip has been a tolerable one in this district.
