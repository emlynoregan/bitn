Post & Telegraph Office for Redruth/Aberdeen

A meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel on Wednesday.  P. Lane (Mayor) presided.  W.R. Ridgway JP said the postal affairs in Redruth and Aberdeen had long been in private hands and should be under Govt. control.  They wanted a central building to replace both the present post offices.  The offices handled 100,000 letters.  He was supported by D. Wells and Mr Carmody together with Cr Rabbich.  [The reasons became clearer in Cr Dunstan’s speech as the privately controlled post offices did not handle telegrams or issue money orders.  The latter came only from the Kooringa P.O. and the former from there or the railway station.]  Many places of lesser importance had better facilities. (The North Ward had then a population of 900.)  [858 in the recent census returns.]  The north end of the town had two banks, two flourmills, a steam sawmill, five hotels, nine stores, blacksmith’s shops and other businesses.
