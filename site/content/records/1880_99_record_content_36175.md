Editorial.  There are again almost two columns against protectionism.  This time sparked by celebrations at Gawler after Martin & Co. completed 50 locomotives for the SAR.  Locomotives which could have been imported much more cheaply.  Protection may help the city, but it ruins the country: ‘it made Melbourne, but it has so far ruined the country’.
