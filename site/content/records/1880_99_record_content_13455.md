Redruth Court, 13 June.

Samuel Nesbitt, a coloured man, was charged with obtaining from Alexander Harris, 1 ton 19 cwt of iron valued at £4-19-5, by falsely stating he was employed by William Watkins of Adelaide.

Harris gave evidence that Nesbitt had obtained the iron and had said the boss, Watkins, would send up a cheque.

Case adjourned to obtain the attendance of Watkins.

16 June, case resumed.

William Watkins, general dealer of Currie St, Adelaide, knew the prisoner, who was not and never had been in his employ.  Nesbitt had sold items to Watkins.  Watkins received goods from him last on 8 May and in the last two weeks had received a telegram saying 13 tons of old iron was on the way and asking for a cheque for £2 at once.  The cheque was sent.  Had sent prisoner money to buy stuff, but only as a loan, not as an agent.

The bench said that there being some evidence of an agency no jury would convict the prisoner, who was discharged.  Watkins expenses to be paid by the Government.
