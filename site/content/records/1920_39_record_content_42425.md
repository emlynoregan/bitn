Weather: Frost and Ice

In the last week there have been more severe frosts than any remembered by the oldest residents.  In the mornings the frost has looked like a covering of snow.  Small pools have frozen solid and the large pool in the creek froze over sufficiently to bear the weight of a man.  School children had delight in running up and down on it and some had nasty falls.  Water in hand bowls in iron bathrooms froze solid as did water in a glass holding one woman’s false teeth.  Many garden plants were ‘burnt’ black.  Over 100 water mains burst and where they could not be turned off the second day brought icicles from the spray.  A particularly beautiful display was that on the ‘carrot fern’ behind the RSL.  At ‘The Gums’ N.H. Pearse reported it was 30°F at 9 a.m. on Thursday morning.  He has lost much of his garden including shrubs planted 12 years ago.  A 40,000 gallon galvanised iron tank froze over.  Alex Low at ‘Yakilo’ Spalding said dams there froze over ¼-inch thick and dams also froze completely over at Mt Bryan.  W.J. Bryce reported it thick at the edge, though thin in the centre.  This is the first time dams have frozen completely over as far as we can determine.  Milder conditions arrived on Saturday.
