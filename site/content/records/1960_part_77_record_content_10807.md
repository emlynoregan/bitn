John Biddle was Assistant in Charge with Edna Grosvenor newly appointed and enrolment was 44.  An Old Scholars Assoc. was inaugurated.  On 21 September all classes went to the top of the hill to observe the solar eclipse.

1923

Lancelot Carthew was Assistant in Charge with Miss O.G. Mawley & R. Davis.  Enrolment was 36.  On 24 March Miss Mawley transferred to Adelaide when attendance fell to 29.  On very hot days the boys were taken to the Mine Pool during the last lesson and the girls were dismissed.  Heavy rain made the road to Clare impassable for sports on 19 July and it wasnâ€™t much better on 22 September when teams arrived at Clare at 10.30 and had to leave early on their return.

1924

Enrolment was 35.  Domestic Arts was introduced with Miss Forss (part-time).
