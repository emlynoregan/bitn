The Protestant Rally at the Institute on Thursday evening was addressed by Pastor J.G. Train, Grand Master of the Orange Lodge in SA.  Attendance was comparatively small.

[The addresses were a typical attack on the temporal power of Roman Catholicism and on its perceived ambition to rule the world.]  At the end some 48 names of those willing to join the Protestant Federation were handed in.
