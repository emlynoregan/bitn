The Mayor’s Report for 1917.

The last wheat/hay harvest was exceptionally good, but the mice plague and the damp winter have led to severe losses in storage.  The Government commandeered the crop and so far has paid 3/- a bushel.  The coming harvest looks like also being a good one.  The pastoral industry has been prosperous and lambing has been encouraging.

The war continues and the revolution in Russia and setbacks for the Italians have made it more difficult for the Allies.  Burra & District have continued their strong support for all patriotic efforts.

The seaside trip on 24 February was a great success and over 1.000 adults and children went to Glenelg.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band

The Burra Coronation Band did creditable work, but as more and more boys enlisted it finally collapsed with only one or two players left.  The idea of a Ladies’ Band emerged and Mr James Bentley was approached to do the tutoring.  The old instruments, which were cheap to start with, were found to be mostly useless, but the girls set about raising money and were soon practising.  Much of this effort was due to Cr McWaters.  Since the foundation of the band Mr I.J. Warnes has proved a strong supporter, together with others on various occasions.  The band has provided valuable assistance at all local patriotic occasions and has also visited Adelaide and other towns and been enthusiastically received by the public.

Anzac Day on 25 April saw a public demonstration in Market Square with a march of school children and speeches at the Rotunda.

A Memorial and Intercession Service was held in the Institute on 29 April and the hall was crowded.  Addresses were given by the Mayor and Mr J.E.H. Winnall.

Repatriation Day on 9 March was held to provide funds to help our boys on their return.  There was a procession headed by the Ladies’ Band and the Adelaide Locomotive Band visited.  There were patriotic speeches by the Mayor and Messrs Hawkes, Winnall and Rev. S.J. Bloyd.  A Union Jack was auctioned under the Bugler system and various stalls did brisk business.  The Locomotive Band gave a concert in the Institute in the evening.  A little over £2,000 was raised.

Red Cross Day on 1 June took the form of a fete in aid of Red Cross and Trench Comforts Funds with the sale of gifts in the Institute.  About £225 was raised.

Violet Day on 6 July was held in appalling weather and the auction of a bunch of violets under the Bugler system raised £185 and the total for the day was £356, which under the circumstances was encouraging.

The Anniversary of the War on 5 August saw a large gathering in Market Square.  The Ladies’ Band attended and speeches were delivered by the Mayor & Messrs W.G. Hawkes, J.E.H. Winnall, Rev. Father Prendergast, Captain Trigg & Mr H.J. Penno.
