Redruth Court, 15 May

There is a long 2¼ column report of a case in which Frederick Gebhardt was found guilty of being unlawfully on the premises of Louisa Jane Willmott on the night of 11 May.  He was fined £2 plus £3-10-0 costs or in default 14 days.

On returning home at c. 10.30 p.m. Mrs Willmott started undressing when she heard a noise under her bed.  A man emerged and she ran out the door screaming – first to Mrs Moore’s and then to Mr T. Harrop’s.  On investigating they found that a back window had been broken and opened.  The following day Mr Gebhardt offered her £5 to withdraw her complaint.  Mrs Willmott said she was married, but had not lived with her husband for over seven years.  She had lived with other men and currently with James Voumard.  She had eight children, of whom five were with the State Children’s Dept.

Sydney Clarence Willmott aged 7 said that the man had said to him when they got outside that ‘It is only Fred Gebhardt’.  [He also said that he knew another Fred Gebhardt who worked at the baker’s.]

Frederick Gebhardt, station overseer, gave evidence which said he was just passing the Willmott house when he encountered the young boy.  Mrs Willmott had approached him with regard to a settlement as she feared losing her boy to the State Children’s Dept.  He denied offering money to quash the case.
