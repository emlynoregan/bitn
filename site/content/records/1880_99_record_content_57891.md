Burra Town Council, 6 August.

Tree guards are to be lent to St Mary’s at the request of the church warden.

The work of planting trees towards the cemetery is proceeding.

4 tenders were received for carting rubble from the Aberdeen Government Quarry from 1/- to 1/1.

It was decided to divide the work evenly.  Messrs Tiver were given the tender for the south end at 11½d.

Cr Harris, before tenders were opened moved that 1 chain more of kerbing be added in Kangaroo St to complete its full length.

Tenders of Short & Prior £2 per chain, J. Snell £2, Launder & Co. £1-17-6.

Cr Harris moved acceptance of the lowest tender.

Cr Rabbich pointed out one was yet to be considered.

Cr Harris: ‘Whose?’

Cr Rabbich: I think there should be one from Mr Rogers.  And there was: for £1-16-0.

Cr Hardy moved the lowest be accepted.  2nd Cr Rabbich.

Cr Harris moved Launder & Co.’s be accepted.  Not 2nd.

Tenders for North Ward kerbing were then opened.

The same four tendered as above, except that Mr Roger’s was this time £1-14-0.

Cr Hardy moved acceptance of Mr Roger’s.  2nd Cr Rabbich.

Cr Harris was disappointed in his attempt to prevent this.

Cr Parks then tried to rescind the Kangaroo St decision.

[Strangely no one seems to have pointed out for some time that this infringed standing orders.]

After some discussion Cr Parks gave notice he would so move at the next meeting.
