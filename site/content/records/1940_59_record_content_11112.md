Burra & District Soldiers’ Welfare Committee

A.B. Riggs reported at the meeting of 16 August that they had only seven watches on hand and that six more were available at £5-5-0 each, after which supplies would be hard to obtain.  Consequently funds were not available to carry out the resolution that watches be sent to all of H.M. Forces after six months in camp.  It was then resolved that the seven on hand be sent to eligible members of the forces by priority of service, soldiers having gone overseas and returned without being farewelled to be the first presented.

Future presentations would be a small token and a cheque not to exceed £3 combined, for a soldier with six months’ service with priority to be on length of service.  Eligible soldiers:

Soldiers’ parents to live in Burra

Soldier to have attended Burra School

Or to have worked in Burra for the 12 months immediately prior to enlistment.
