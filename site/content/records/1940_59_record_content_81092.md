Car Stolen.  A 1953 Morris Oxford sedan was stolen from Mr Murray Odgers of Burra from in front of his house in Kangaroo Street early on 8 April.  Around the corner was found a 1936 Buick sedan that had been stolen from Barry Donald McVicar of Plympton Park and reported stolen at 7.30 a.m. the same day.  The occupants of the Buick had been involved in a garage break-in and larceny at Marrabel and articles from there were found in the car.  Police are investigating.
