MUIOOF.  A New Hall for the Loyal Burra Burra Lodge was opened last Wednesday.  The old hall has become the supper room and the addition is a fine hall 41’ x 31’6” plus a porch 6’ x 5’ and a kitchen 11’ x 6’.  The additions were urged by the great increase in both adult and juvenile lodges.  Opened by Grand Master Bro. I.R. Hanan.  [Personal interest: Bro. C.R. Fuss was pianist.]

The speeches at the following banquet are reported at length.  The contractors had been Bros. Fred Pearce and Wall.  There is mention of an Aberdeen Lodge, but also a statement that after the mine closed the two amalgamated under the present name.  At one time No. 10 Lodge used to meet in the Old German Church and when that was burnt the records of the lodge went up in smoke.  Bro. Motley said when he joined they used to meet in the former secretary’s house and then in what is now the supper room.  He made special mention of the great work done by P.G. Bro. Fuss who had been a tower of strength to the lodge.
