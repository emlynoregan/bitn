Chris McCabe received a tribute – the combination of two contributions.

He contributed far more than the normal hours of work in a school day for the past six years.

He was notable for his diplomacy, foresight and concern for others.

He came to an old school that was a clutter of prefabs behind the old building, with a division into Primary and High Schools, with low student and staff morale and with poor facilities and a poor image.

He oversaw its transformation to a Community School offering education from Kindergarten to Year 12 and beyond with facilities second to none.

A great deal of the success of this transition is due to his tireless effort and meticulous care to keep track of changes, new ideas and problems as they arose.

He played an important role in the Burra District Advisory Committee and aided the establishment of the Senior Citizens Club.

He took an interest in heritage matters.

He was also largely responsible for setting up ‘Community News’.

In all this he has been strongly supported by his wife Denise in church and sporting bodies and on committees as well as personally.
