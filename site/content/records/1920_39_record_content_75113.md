Early records show that Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church in Kooringa in 1847 when there was no other place of worship within 70 miles and there were then only three Wesleyan and one or two Primitive Methodist ministers in the colony.  The first Bible Christian ministers came three years later.  Work was chiefly done by local preachers and about 60 members were reported.
