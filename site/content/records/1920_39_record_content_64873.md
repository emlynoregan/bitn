Hanson School

A Back-to-School on Monday drew about 150 people.  Speakers included D. McQueen (present head teacher), J. Brereton (Chairman of the School Committee), H.E. Atkins (Secretary of the School Committee), Miss E.E.C. Ayliffe. [Ellen Esther Cecelia Ayliffe 1857-1940] and Mr Thomas Rogers [1858-1940] who spoke of building the present school 35 years ago.  Miss Ayliffe was the teacher who had marched the children from the old Council Chambers to the present school.  About 30 old scholars marched in the answer the roll call.  Some games followed and then a sumptuous afternoon tea.  The ‘eldest boy’ was Tommy Goodridge who had enrolled here in 1882.  [I can’t trace a Tom Goodridge who would have enrolled in 1882.]

A photo was taken.

On Tuesday there was a combined concert with Gum Creek School and on Thursday the combined sports at Gum Creek.  [Results are printed.]

On Friday Hanson school entertained Ayers School at Hanson.  In the morning Ayers won the cricket match and in the afternoon Ayers 6-38 beat Hanson 6-25 at Tennis.

A Children’s Frolic and Dance was held on Friday night.  [Prize winners are listed.]
