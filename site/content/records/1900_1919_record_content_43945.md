Sgt R.J. Baynes writes from Gallipoli dated 12 Sep.  He is on a hill called Sari Bair and he describes the landscape: ‘I cannot describe to you what a bayonet charge is like.  It is a very awful affair and is like getting drunk – it is alright while the fun is at its height.  You have no time to think, but after it is all over is when you feel it.’

‘Nearly all the chaps who landed here are either gone away wounded or sick, I have only four left out of fifty-nine I landed with.’
