Theft.  For some time Mr Crewes of Drew & Crewes, who has oversight of the chaff works has suspected that someone was stealing hay from the large stack at the Aberdeen chaff store.  On Wednesday he and M-C Grosser set out to watch the stacks.  Before they could get prepared a man was seen getting onto the haystack.  He was seen to take hay and descend from the stack.  M-C Grosser tried to intercept his, but he evidently saw something and fled.  M-C Grosser called on him to stand in the Kinâ€™s name, but he did not and a shot was fired by the policeman.  The police followed and another shot was fired.  The thief got away in the deep shadows around the railway bridge across the creek to the ballast quarry.  The chase was continued and a man seen in a back yard, evidently trying to transfer suspicion to the owner of the premises, but when disturbed he ran off and was seen making for the Redruth Post Office.  Tommy King, a black-tracker, was wired for.  He did some clever work and is said to have confirmed a theory the police had.  The habit has clearly been to drop the hay over the fence for horses to feed and they arrived before their master on this night too, ready for a feed.
