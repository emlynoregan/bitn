Obituary.  Sir John Melrose of Ulooloo Station died at Calvary Hospital Adelaide on 16 September aged 78.  He was born at Rosebank 12 January 1860 and educated at Prince Alfred College.  He spent a year in an Adelaide mercantile office to get business experience and then assisted in the management of Wangaraleedini Station, Franklin Harbour, till the end of 1883.  He then went to manage his father’s Ulooloo Station which he purchased from the trustees of his father’s estate eight years later and lived there ever since.  In 1887 with the late Henry Dutton of Anlaby near Kapunda he purchased North Booborowie Estate of 32,000 acres from the estate of Dr W.J. Browne with its flocks.  In 1910 the property was sold to the Government for closer settlement.  In about 1901 he lost his sight when aged 41, but that did nothing to deter him from directing his enterprises and he continued to be able to judge the type and conformation of stud sheep and the quality of wool with remarkable success.  In 1924 he financed his nephew the late Jimmy Melrose to compete in the England-Melbourne Air Race, promising him £500 if he won.  He gave away more than £20,000 to charities, agricultural research etc.  In 1927 he gave £10,000 to the Waite Institute.  He was knighted in 1928.  In Burra his chief interests were the Burra Show and Burra Hospital, both of which he supported generously.  He paid for the show pavilion to be shifted to the new showgrounds from the old.  He gave a total of £75 towards the new Centenary Hall at the showgrounds.

He and Mrs William Pitt Barker between them built the Maternity Wing of the Burra Hospital which Mr J. Tennant furnished.  He was until recently a Board member of the Hospital, holding that position for over 20 years.  He was also a generous supporter of sporting bodies.  In Hallett he donated £500 towards the new Institute and then offered to subsidise an effort to raise money for it of a £ for £ basis, which cost him a further £200.  This and other timely donations brought his overall donations to aid the Institute to about £1,000.  The Hallett Methodist Manse Fund was also generously assisted.  He was a member of the Hallett DC for many years and a chairman for some of them.  He gave generous donations to assist the unemployed and aided camp funds for boys sponsored by the News and the Mail.  In 1895 he imported the first Dorset sheep and in 1913 the first Percheron stallions and mares from France and in 1928 the first Wensley sheep from New Zealand.  He was the first founder of electric smelters in Australasia.  He is survived by one son A.J. Melrose MP, President of the LCL and one daughter, Miss Lily Melrose of Ulooloo.  He was buried at Rosebank Cemetery (Mt Pleasant.)
