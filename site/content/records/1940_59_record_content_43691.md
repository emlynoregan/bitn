Burra Town Council, 21 November

Permission granted for a neon sign at E.T. Baulderstone’s & J.A. Scott’s.

Cr Jennison reported on a conference with the Housing Trust representative Mr A.B. Hastings and moved that a meeting be called for the purpose of discussing housing on Monday 28 November.

Council will construct a playground for the CWA.

Ownership of the property opposite the Scout Hall is to be investigated.  [The old mill site.]

World’s End Cricket Club was disbanded some time ago and sent its equipment to the Burra Primary School and now it has also forwarded £13-10-0 for the purchase of sporting materials.

Booborowie School Welfare Club AGM is reported in just over 1 column.
