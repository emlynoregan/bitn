Burra Town Council, 6 March

Council will attend the dedication of the memorial windows in St Mary’s Church on 12 March.

The Fire Brigades Board estimates Council costs for the fire brigade for 1922 at c. £205.

Tenders for the fire brigade building have come in at £450 or £150 over budget.  Specifications will be revised to reduce cost.

The Mayor produced a report on the proposed electric light scheme.  The cost was estimated at £8,712 and expenditure in the first year of £7,000 was suggested.  ‘It estimated the net profits for the first and second year at 10½% interest on £900’. [?]  The Mayor said the consent of ratepayers to borrow the money would be needed.  After discussion the correspondence was to lie on the table until next meeting.

The Great Eastern Picnic was held on 25 February at Quondong under the patronage of Mr J.H. Gallagher, President.  Entertainment and a dance followed.  Results of the athletic events are printed.
