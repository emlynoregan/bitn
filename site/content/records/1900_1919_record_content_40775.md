Burra Town Council, Monday.

The cost of tar-paving Commercial St was £6-17-1 per chain, which rose to £7-4-6 where some shouldering was required.  Three chains in Aberdeen, where no shouldering was needed were done for £6-16-2 per chain.

There was debate over the need for a pound within the town as the present one at Ford’s was 1¼ miles out and it was difficult to get old milch cows so far.
