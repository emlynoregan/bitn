Utica Mine.  Prospecting has been continuing with shallow pits and open cut workings.  Surface indications are good.  There are two parallel lodes about 2½ chains apart, the lode 3-6’ wide.  A site has been selected for an underlie shaft to be sunk in earth to at least 100’ and sinking is in progress.
