Football

A scratch match of Girls versus Footballers was arranged to raise funds for the Footballers benevolent Fund.  The men players were not allowed to bump or throw an opponent, use their weight and only interfere with the ball occasionally.  The girls were not allowed to slap or scratch.  The game was rough and tough and the 36 girls not only won in the end by about three goals, but also inflicted considerable damage on the male players.  Ray Bevan received a cracked elbow and Kelvin Bruce a sprained wrist.  Other players received numerous scratches and other minor injuries.
