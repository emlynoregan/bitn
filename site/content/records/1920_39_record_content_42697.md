Mongolata Goldfield

Bitumen sheets have been laid down and excavation for the installation of a 35,000 gallon tank for a domestic water supply have been completed.

Mr Grundy, Government manager for batteries, has selected a site for the Mongolata Battery: 200 yards down slope from the entrance to Byles’ No. 1 property.  The imminent arrival of a battery is encouraging development along the line of the field.

Wilton Hack, mining engineer from WA, has been appointed to manage Byles’ claim.  More men have been put on.  The shaft is being timbered by Mr Zimmerman.

Mr Carpenter has improved his boarding house.

The tennis court has been levelled.

Mongolata Alluvial Co.’s main shaft is at 153ft.  Roy Kirkham & Hedley Neale are erecting a temporary poppett head to allow sinking to continue.

The Hallett Masonic Lodge installation is reported in one column.  Bro. W. Phin is the new WM.
