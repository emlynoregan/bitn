Editorial on the Burra Hospital X-ray Machine

This has been considered by the Board for some time at a cost of £410.  Red Cross gave £150 in consideration of the town’s patriotic efforts during the war.  I.J. Warnes has now promised the balance of £260.  The cost of setting up a room for the machine will be taken from the Henry Thomas Bequest.  The late Mr H.H. Thomas bequeathed £200 to the hospital in five yearly instalments.  Another person who had intended to leave a bequest has agreed to pay the sum intended at once if the Thomas bequest is used as a lump sum and this donation will be used for an isolation ward.
