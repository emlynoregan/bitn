Letter from Patrick Ward of Ulooloo on three topics:

Compulsory teaching of drawing at schools: he was opposed to it as being unnecessary and in any case the Education Department has little knowledge of it to impart.

Tree planting by schools (Arbor Day): also not favoured.

Technical Education: also opposed because in the first place this is an additional responsibility for which the teacher did not contract when taking on the task of teaching and secondly this represents too much money ‘expended in a superfluity of useless fruitless branches’.
