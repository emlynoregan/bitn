Burra Town Council has agreed to let the Burra Electric Supply Co. to light the town for 15 years.  The company will supply 25 street lamps and more if needed at a fixed price.  The total cost will be less than is now taken trying to light the streets.  The plant is to be installed within six months.  All shares have been underwritten (a prominent townsman being prepared to take the lot), but are being offered to the public.
