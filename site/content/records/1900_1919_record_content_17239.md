Burra Town Council

The Postmaster General has replied that it is impossible at present to connect Burra with Adelaide by telephone because there are electrical difficulties in the way and even the connection with Clare is far from satisfactory.  When there is a possibility of a good connection it will be made.

Council has decided it cannot pay the 3d a week rent to W. Henderson to rent a shed to house the lamps.  If satisfactory arrangements cannot be made fresh tenders for lighting will have to be called.

Condolences were sent to Cr Burns on the death of his sister.  [Not readily traced.]
