Accident.  F.T. Jones brought into Burra yesterday, Arthur Abbott, aged c. 24 and a son-in-law of Mr C. Stasinowsky of Baldina.  Abbott had suffered concussion while riding a bicycle from Mr Jones’s house to his hut, a distance of some 34 miles, with a load of about 20 lb of mutton.  The accident happened on Monday and he lay near the road on Tuesday morning and was unnoticed by a passing teamster before being seen by Mr Jones’ men.  His case is considered very serious.
