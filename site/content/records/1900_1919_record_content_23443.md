Burra Band Meeting.

The Mayor (Dr Sangster jun.) said it was almost a disgrace to have to call in a band from elsewhere for the recent church parade and for the annual show.  He proposed a provisional committee be formed to get out subscription lists and collect money through the town and district.  He hoped to occupy some of the youth of the town currently ‘gracing the kerbing around the streets’.  They could start with a band of 12 performers, which would cost c. £177.  16 would run to c. £247, or 20 to c. £350.  He hoped the larger sum could be raised over three years.  Mr Middleton spoke in support and moved the meeting deemed the formation of a band desirable.  C.A. Lott 2nd.  Carried and a committee elected.

Iron Mine Methodist Church re-opens on 31 January.

Rev. R.C. Yeoman leaves Redruth in April after four years in the circuit.

Sparrows & starlings are proving very troublesome.

Cricket.  Burra Automobile Club 180 defeated Morgan 79.

James Knevitt, late of Burra, was sentenced to 4 months and bound over for 12 months in sureties of £50 at Broken Hill last Monday.  [Since no crime is mentioned to explain this, it may well be connected with the miners’ strike then going on at Broken Hill.]

Tennis.  At Manoora on Monday Aberdeen 11-100 defeated Manoora 8-64.

Petersburg Sports, Monday.  R.J. Johnson won the Sheffield (£10) and Cecil Lord won the bicycle tilting.

Burra Rifle Club recently at Watervale: Watervale 865 defeated Burra 861

A team of Burra riflemen visited Morgan on Saturday and Burra 335 defeated Morgan 314.
