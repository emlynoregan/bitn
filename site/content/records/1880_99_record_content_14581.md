Editorial on the Silverton Railway Routes.

Only those from Petersburg, Terowie and Burra deserve comment.  The others are out of the question due to the country passed through.

The Petersburg line would be of 154 miles.

The Terowie line would be very similar.

The Burra line would be 182 miles.

The character of the country is similar in each case after the first few miles, though the Petersburg line may be the easiest for a railway built without ballast, as there are fewer creeks.  The Burra line has some difficult country initially.

There is no doubt that 99% of the traffic will be between the Barrier and the port or metropolis and so the distance between these two points should be noted.

Via the Petersburg line it is 307 miles, the Terowie line is say 298 miles and via the Burra route 282 miles.  The Government is sticking to the Petersburg option.
