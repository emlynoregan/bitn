Football.  At Saddleworth on Monday.  A special train which took the team and supporters down was poorly patronised, probably due to the recent heavy rains.  The field was very greasy.

Burra Assoc.		1.2	4.6	5.7	8.11	(59)

Mid-North Assoc.	4.0	4.0	6.2	6.2	(6.2)

[Mid-North might have ended with 6.3, as the commentary gives then a point in the final quarter, or perhaps they had 6.1 at the end of the third quarter.]
