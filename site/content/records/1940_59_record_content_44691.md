T.H. Woollacott MBE was accorded a Civic Presentation last Wednesday in recognition of his many years of service to the town.  He has as Mayor guided the town through the hard years of the Depression and WWII and in recognition had been awarded the MBE.  The town hopes to name the proposed caravan park the T.H. Woollacott Caravan Park.  Speeches were made by the Mayor F.T. Marston and H.J.B. Jennison.  The latter paid tribute to Mr Woollacott’s hard work in farewelling and welcoming soldiers in the war years and in assisting those in need during the Depression.  He had organised many successful badge days and the fine furniture in the Town Council’s Chamber could be attributed to Mr Woollacott’s efforts.  Mrs Woollacott was to be applauded too, as a help and inspiration to her husband.  Mr S. Kellaway endorsed these remarks and spoke of Mr Woollacott’s work on the High School Council and for the Burra Hospital. Mr L. Thomas also spoke concerning Mr Woollacott’s humour from the platform and that his ‘little mannerisms would always remain a happy memory to his hearers’.  Others to speak were J.G. Sara and W. Carpenter who made special reference to the debt owed Mr Woollacott by the Mongolata miners.
