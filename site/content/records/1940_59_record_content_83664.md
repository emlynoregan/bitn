Bushfire Control.  The Burra Burra DC is installing a tw0-way radio for the fire season.  One unit will be in Burra and the other will be despatched to fires.  Landholders could add their own mobile units or install a converter on domestic radios to hear news of fires.  (The cost of such a converter is c. £6 installed.)

The Women’s auxiliary has met and discussed catering problems for fire volunteers.  Fire danger this season is expected to be extreme.
