Redruth Court, 10 November

Claude Attrill was fined £2 + £2-13-6 costs or 7 days in Adelaide Gaol for assaulting A.W. Kakoschke on 27 October.  The dispute was over an unpaid gambling debt Attrill was said to owe Kakoschke.

A.W. Kakoschke was charged by Attrill with assault on 6 November, but the case was dismissed.

Attrill then pleaded guilty to a second charge of assaulting Kakoschke and was further fined £5 + £1-12-6 costs.
