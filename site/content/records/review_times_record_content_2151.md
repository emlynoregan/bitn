Mr McCabe called on Dr Hopgood to officially open the school.  Dr Hopgood drew attention to the vast number of people and organisations that have come together to make such a project possible and to make it a success.  Apart from building a school for the children, the Education Department wanted the people of Burra and the surrounding district to share and be part of the new school.  A key feature was the recreation facilities and another was the Community Library.  The Department of Further Education had also made a valuable contribution.  He hoped the co-operation evident to date would long continue.  [He then went on to develop the idea of whole community involvement in education with wide ranging use of school facilities every day of the week and throughout the year.]

He was sure a problem solving and child centred approach was the way forward.  He said budget constraints would prevent this type of facility from being put everywhere in SA, but future building programs would certainly aim to be as flexible as possible so they could accommodate where possible community purposes.  He said community education required some definite guidelines:

An openness of attitude and ease of access for people of all ages.

The community needs to be actively engaged in the education process.

A loose relationship with other services is essential.  Too often schools have been seen as the only resource for the community.

It must be realised that Community Education allows for extensive involvement and community participation in the school and for school participation in the community.  Schools can make their resources available to the community and the community can reciprocate.

In some schools like Burraâ€™s this sharing can become quite complex with special management groups and committees to co-ordinate participation.  He ended by praising the Public Buildings Department, which had completed the project sixteen weeks ahead of schedule and saved on the budgeted cost.  He declared the school open and granted a half-holiday.

Mr McCabe called on Mr Graham Gunn, Member for Eyre, to propose the vote of thanks.  Dennis Thamm and Roxanne Hall, representing the students, presented a collection of Burra booklets to Dr Hopgood.
