Elders-GM Annual Stud Ewe Sale was held on Wednesday 13 October and drew a small, but very interested group of local and interstate buyers.  There was keen support from WA buyers. The highest price went to John Collins & Sons for eight specially selected strong woolled 1Â½-year-old May-born ewes, which sold to 52 guineas and went to W.J. & J. Wade of Narrogin WA.  [Prices are printed, with other details and the promise of more in the following issue.]
