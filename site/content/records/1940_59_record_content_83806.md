Obituary/Murder.  Mr Neville Lord of Pine Valley was shot through the head with a .303 rifle as he lay asleep in a bed at about 9.30 p.m. on Sunday 23 November.  Mrs Lord was attending to her two-year-old son Andrew, in the next room, where her daughter Robyn (6) was also sleeping, when she heard the shot.  Mrs Lord ran into the next room and a man ran past her saying: ‘Keep quiet or I’ll shoot you.’

She told police she recognised the man.  Detective Sgt S.M. Jones was called from Renmark and Detective B.E. Kelly of Renmark with Sgt E. Sparrow of Morgan also attended along with a CIB squad from Adelaide.  Early on Monday a tracker from Berri was called in and another two, Morgan Williams and Richie from Pt Augusta, were taken to Pine Valley early Wednesday morning by Constable M. Clift of Burra.  Heavy rain over the weekend hampered tracking.  The man being sought was John Whelan Brown alias Stone, who had been at Pine valley five days before he disappeared.  Earlier in the year he had been employed on a nearby Station as a colt-breaker.

A.D. Radford was kept busy organising searchers.  It was difficult to find men who knew the country in which the search was taking place.  Mr John McBride helped with his plane.  Brown left Pine Valley and headed northeast before turning south or southeast towards Renmark.  To try to keep him within the area Mr Milton Mitchell and others were called upon on Friday morning to patrol the Canegrass to Yabalia Road.  During this patrol Brown was found by Messrs Les and Charlie Warnes of Woolgangi in one Jeep and Messrs M. Mitchell and A. Hempel in another.  He surrendered and was taken to Canegrass where he was turned over to the police and returned to Pine valley.  It appears he had been camped in a hut for about two days and had caught and killed a sheep for food.  Tracks indicated he had at one stage left the hut for the south, but heat and lack of water forced him back.

Mr Neville Lord was one of three sons of the late Mr Percy Lord and a grandson of Mr J.V. Lord who founded the ‘Lord’ Stations now operated by J.V. Lord & Sons.  He was 31 years old and well known in the surrounding country and towns and popular with both owners and men.  He had been managing Pine Valley for ten years.  He and his wife were well known to many River folk, having played an important part in functions conducted at Canopus Station over a period of years to aid the Flying Doctor Service.  He was buried privately in Adelaide.

[Neville Montgomery Lord born 4 June 1926 Adelaide: the death is wrongly recorded on the SA Deaths CD as 23 November 1959 Pine Valley Station instead of 1958.]
