Anzac Commemoration Service

The weather was inclement and so the service was held in the Burra Institute, though the crowd exceeded the capacity of the hall.  There was a procession from St Mary’s led by the Burra Brass Band, then the returned men who were followed by the Light Horse, the Scouts and the school students.  The front line of marchers included Mrs D. Keynes formerly Nurse E. Armstrong.  There was an unusually good turnout of returned men.  The service was conducted by Rev. J.S.W. Coles (Anglican) assisted by Revs F.J. Barnes of Aberdeen & H.S. Jarvis of Kooringa (Methodists).  Rev. Barnes gave an address.  After the service a move was made to the Soldiers’ Memorial where Major R.C. Sexton laid a wreath for the RSL followed by relatives and friends of the fallen.  Last Post & Reveille followed and the returned men then marched to the RSL rooms.  In the evening there was a service at St Mary’s.
