BCS students and staff are preparing a Centenary of Federation production to be presented at Burra Town Hall on 6 & 7 December reflecting Life in Burra at the Turn of the Century.  Sue Ryan would like to video wedding gowns worn last century by women who are living in or have lived in Burra and District.

Please contact BCS if you can help.
