Booborowieâ€™s 39th Reunion of past and present residents was held at the Renaissance Tower Restaurant in Adelaide on 30 August.  66 people attended.  Reunions began in Elder Park in 1962 when 31 people attended.  65 attended at the Botanic Gardens in 1966.  When only 16 attended the reunion there in 1998 on a Sunday, it was decided to change to mid-week and to the Renaissance Tower Restaurant.  41 people came along in 1999.  The 40th reunion is planned for Wednesday 29 August.
