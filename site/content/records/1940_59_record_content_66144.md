Burra High School Speech Night was held in the Burra Town Hall on 14 December.  The door collection amounted to £20.

Items and short plays were followed by an address from Mr C.A. Richards, Senior Inspector of High Schools.

The Headmaster presented the 42nd report of the High School.

Transfers in the year:

In February Mr Ron Walker transferred to Kapunda and was replaced by Mr Pillar.

Miss Inglis went to Nuriootpa High School to be replaced by Miss Miller.

Mrs Jeffery replaced Miss Hallewell.

Mr Pederick, the Headmaster, went to Unley High School after eight years here.

The opening enrolment of 68 was a slight decrease.  Eleven left during the year as parents moved to other towns in search of better employment.  Six transferred in.

It is hoped that 1955 will open with c. 80.

Last year 15 sat for Intermediate and 2 for Leaving.

They gained 11 Intermediate Certificates and 1 Leaving Certificate.

This year 11 sat for Intermediate and 4 for Leaving.

On 23 May the school visited Wayville Showgrounds to see the Queen and Burra High School had a very good position for a close-up view of the Queen and Prince Philip.

The Governor, Sir Robert George, visited the school with his aide Capt. Peter Samuels.

The High School Ball in the form of a Debutante Ball was a great success and 14 girls were presented to Mr & Mrs Stanley Hawker.

At the annual sports day on 23 April

Senior Girls’ Cup		Robyn Tattersall

Senior Boys’ Cup		Ian Allen
