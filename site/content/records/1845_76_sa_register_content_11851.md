The Burra Creek.  ‘Viator’ writes that accidents at the creek are a frequent occurrence due to the stoppage of flow caused by the silting of the creek from the workings of the Mine.  The bed of the creek has been raised 12 to 14 feet in the last ten years due to sand from the workings.  Last Friday a boy with a four-wheeled carriage and horse was nearly drowned opposite Mr Woollacott’s and that at a place supposed to be a ford.  Every week some incident arises at this place.  What is the use of petitions if no notice is taken of them?  Mr Peake’s petition has seen no action.
