Court.

Richard Gully was charged with assaulting Thomas Rodda James Reynolds at Aberdeen on 24 October.  Several witnesses, friends of Gully, told stories in which they claimed to have seen what had happened.  They were generally so unbelievable that the bench clearly thought them guilty of perjury and contempt of court.  Gully was fined £1-10-0 plus costs amounting in all to £5.
