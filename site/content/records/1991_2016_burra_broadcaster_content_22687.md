Goyder Council has received an application to convert the ETSA Depot into an MFS fire station.  The current MFS premises are too small and the Market Square site has limited expansion possibilities.

Council is also seeking ways of obtaining assistance regarding future planning, finance and maintenance for Paxton Square.  The cottages have been generating reduced returns and Council is also seeking ideas to improve occupancy rates.  Loans associated with the restoration of the square are due for their final repayment in September 2003.
