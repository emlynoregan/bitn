Kooringa News, Dooner’s dissolving views were exhibited last week at Mr West’s schoolroom in Redruth and for two evenings at the Mechanics’ Institute.  The first two occasions were well filled.

A committee has been appointed to procure a piece of malachite to form the handle of the trowel which His Royal Highness is to use when laying the contemplated foundation stone.

Splendid rains fell yesterday and today.

No scab has yet been found in local flocks.
