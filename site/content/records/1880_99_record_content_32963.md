Reprint of an article from the Barrier Miner saying inter alia:

‘[We] do not think he has a personal enemy either here or anywhere else.’

‘Those who have watched Mr Holder while occupying the humble position of editor of a not over-flourishing journal the Burra Record cannot but have marked him almost the ideal of the honest man; philanthropic and public spirited; genuine, yet not a canting humbug; unassuming, yet not trading upon that characteristic.’

‘[The] mere fact that he was at the last election returned at the head of the poll; far in advance of two of the most generally popular men of the colony, proves unmistakeably the high esteem in which he is held by those who best know him.’
