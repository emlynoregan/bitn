Burra Pictures.  The costs of running the show are about $40 per night.  At times ticket sales struggle to reach a third of this.  Few adults attend because of the behaviour of ill mannered children.

‘I wonder if it’s really worth continuing weekly shows here at all after the current series of films runs out next year?  It’s debateable.’
