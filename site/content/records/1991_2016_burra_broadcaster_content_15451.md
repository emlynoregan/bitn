The Baby Change Room

The triangular room between the Tourist Office and the Lucky Dip has been completely gutted to remove old fixtures and a rotted floor.  Plumbing and wiring have had to be routed through the Tourist Office.  Burra’s Craig Berryman, new apprentice builder with Michael Gill, has been hard at work on the renovations.  [Photo.]

[Note: the room was actually located on the other side of the Tourist Office, between the Office and Drew & Crewes’ Building.
