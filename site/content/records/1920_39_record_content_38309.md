Obituary.  Mr Ernest Sellars died at his home on 21 May.  He had never regained his previous robust health after an operation some years ago.  He was born at Aberdeen in 1861, the eldest son of Mr & Mrs Fred Sellars.  He married Miss Elizabeth Cundy of Kooringa who survives.  Of a family of seven, six survive: Roy (Aberdeen), Ethel Mrs Fred Lewis (Aberdeen), Rita Mrs E. Delo (Adelaide), Gertie Mrs Bruhn (Adelaide), Miss Gladys Sellars (Sydney) & Miss Sylvia Sellars (Aberdeen).  There are 13 grandchildren. [Birth seems not to be registered, though the surname is a problem, appearing variously also as Seller, Selle, Selles, Sellears & Sellers.  Death is registered as 21 May 1931 aged 69.]
