[The report proceeds in considerable detail to try to account for the accident and to detail the transfer of the victim to Gawler where he was placed in proper care.  The man was Thomas Attenborough, a ganger of Farrell’s Flat, who on this day had been acting as signalman at the first level crossing south of Farrell’s Flat.  He was seen to be holding his white flag and then to have fallen across the line.  It was thought he may have a fit, as he was said to be subject to them.  He was married with five or six children.  Oddly his death cannot be traced in the SA Deaths CD!]
