A.W. Farley writes a ½-column letter dealing with certain irregularities in recent DC elections for Apoinga and subsequent moves at the Council meeting.  Those affected appear to be N.H. Pearse, Mr Hentschke and Mr Launer.

[I have not noted the argument, which is reported in the paper of 8 July 1931 at some length and Cr Farley disputes the accuracy of the report which ‘was not taken down verbatim, hence its omissions and half truths’.]

‘Oats for Goats’ also writes about the Apoinga DC and in general supports the position taken by the majority against Cr Farley.
