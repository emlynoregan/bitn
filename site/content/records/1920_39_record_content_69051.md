Obituary.  Frank Blight died last week and the following history of the family is of some interest.  The founder of the family James Blight of Devonshire arrived in SA by the Lysander in 1849 and bought land at Gumeracha.  He then made two trips to the Victorian goldfields and had some success there in 1869.  He then bought land at Cartapo near Hallett and was a farmer, being the first man to grow wheat north of Burra.  He died on the property aged 90, then holding some thousand acres.  Frank Blight was the youngest of 12 children and was born at Gumeracha in 1864, coming north with his parents when 5.  Later he and brothers Richard and William took land near Ketchowla and property near Franklyn and Yongala.  Before his fatherâ€™s death Frank took over Cartapo.  On the death of William they moved to Burra and lived there for some years before retiring to Glenelg.  Richard died soon after; leaving Frank to carry on the Blight Bros. name till he died 22 November 1937 [at Glenelg] aged 74.  [Born 15 December 1863 at Gumeracha.]
