Burra Sewerage Scheme

Don Wilson Chief Inspector of the Central Board of Health has outlined a sewerage system to serve the main business section of Burra.  It could be operation as early as 1966.  Mr Wilson visited Burra on Wednesday and with the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and Town Clerk W.A. Holness, inspected the shopping area, which has most problems regarding the installation of septic toilets and hand-washing facilities.  A meeting of the Local Board of Health discussed ways and means of overcoming this problem.  Mr Wilson outlined a scheme to provide 50-60 premises with a full sewerage system at a comparatively low cost per owner.  The plan would have one sewerage pipeline commencing at the Post Office Exchange building and extending round to the vicinity of Dr Miller’s residence.  A second would commence at the rear of Jennison’s used car lot and extend along Commercial Street to the main creek, taking in all businesses on the south side of Market Square.  These pipes would connect with a treatment plant on the bank of the creek and effluent could possibly be used for the establishment of trees and shrubs etc.  A similar scheme recently installed for the whole of Berri cost £25,000.  At Berri the effluent is being used on the golf links.  There is no likelihood of unpleasant odours from the treatment plant.  Soakage pits and septic tanks would not be needed on the properties concerned.  It is unlikely that if it were decided on, it could be in operation before January 1966.  Once this scheme was decided upon the installation of septic tanks would become compulsory, without exception throughout Burra, unless connected to the sewerage drain.  Depending on demand the Council is likely to term this phase 1, with other areas perhaps eventually added to the service.  The Central Board of health would handle the survey, designs, plans and estimates of cost, at no charge to Burra.
