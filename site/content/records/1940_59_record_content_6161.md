Burra & District Soldiers’ Welfare Committee held its annual meeting on 11 June.  The committee appeals for more people to support it with donations – only 66 subscribers are currently supporting the cause, which supplies watches to soldiers.  Information at hand suggests a further 25 watches will be needed soon for farewells.  A.B. Riggs, Treasurer.

Burra Anzac Sports & District Fete produced a credit balance of £993-12-4.

The Annual Catholic Ball on Wednesday was the best yet despite fears that petrol rationing would reduce attendance.  Proceeds amounted to c. £30.
