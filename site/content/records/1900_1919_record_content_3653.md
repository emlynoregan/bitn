Stock Route Cases.

A letter to the editor complains that W.H. McKinlay was fined £2 plus costs to a total of £7-8-0, for failure to give notice of intent to travel across a property despite having given such notice by mail – the judge agreeing that mail was insufficient, though the Stock Diseases Act in Clause 20 clearly defines how and when such notices shall be given, but does not specify as to delivery or posting – merely that proof of delivery is sufficient.  Secondly Mr Collins of Mt Bryan proceeded against Mr Harris for crossing his land without notice.  The SM ruled that notice was required for the main road and not the one used by Mr Harris and dismissed the case with costs to the plaintiff.  This makes a confusion of Clause 20.
