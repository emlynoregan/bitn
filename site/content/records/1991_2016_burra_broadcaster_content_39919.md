Burra Craft Fair this year had somewhat smaller crowds, due to competing attractions, but was nevertheless a success.  There were plenty of stalls and a big range of craftwork.  Stallholders look forward to another event in 2015.  [2 photos including one of two Daleks made by J. Pollard.]

BCS staged their ‘Year of the Farmer’ Fair at the town oval last Friday.  Each class had its own stall and the school choir provided live music.  The Fair [formerly a Continental] is a major fundraiser for the school and was well supported, with about 500 people attending.
