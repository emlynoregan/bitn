Local Board of Health, 21 January

Mr Topsfield, butcher, wrote that under the present Federal Award he could not deliver meat in Burra.  Present coupon ratings would complicate the matter and though it would cost him £12 a week to provide the service that could not be recovered from customers.  He also stated that he ‘had yet to learn where any council of Board of Health had authority to interfere in the domestic affairs of a private business.’

The Mayor took exception to this statement.

Cr Carpenter agreed with the Mayor.

Cr Harvey considered the £12 cost cited to be absurd.

The Mayor said other towns had bread and meat delivered and could not see why Burra should not have such a service.

Messrs Bachli Bros. expressed astonishment at the tactics adopted by the Council.  They had always endeavoured to provide the best service and considered the threat by the Council to look for opposition bakers ‘was quite out of order’.

Price control meant it was unlikely they could get permission to increase the price of bread delivered and to deliver it in Burra for 6d per loaf was not possible, given the scattered nature of the town.

The Mayor said that the population was about 1,800 and not a house was empty, but for the first time there was only one baker.  He could remember when there were four or five bakers in the town and all made a good living.  Other small towns like Riverton and Auburn had two bakers and bread was delivered in both.  He considered it was nothing to do with price control.

Cr Harvey said there was a baker in Burra North prepared to start if he could get premises.

The Mayor said the late Mr Park’s bakehouse was in fair condition.

Members of the Board also commented that bread was still being sold unwrapped.
