Burra Creek & Princess Royal Station Wines has an increased export potential after an invitation to China where purchasers gathered at an organic wine exhibition.  The company produces from 30 acres of ‘dry grown’ Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Manager Lisa Rowe was invited to Chongqing (pop. 35 million) to attend an exhibition where wines were introduced to a group of 200 potential purchasers.  This follows a substantial order for four of their lines.  Organic Certification was a point of difference.  The Chinese market is emerging and education on the handling and consumption of wines will need to be addressed.  The Burra wines were well received and orders are anticipated.
