Early last season the committee decided to invite the associates to nominate two delegates to attend committee meetings so that associates’ interests could be represented on club matters concerning them.  This has proved most successful.  The club began the season in credit £271-8-11 and spent £287-3-7 on extensions to the clubhouse and other capital items and £145-6-11 for course improvements and weekly labour.  It finished the year in credit £70-0-10.  The new season will start on 30 April.
