The Fallen Soldier’s Memorial was floodlit on Friday.  A crowd assembled at 9 p.m. to witness the switching on of the lights.  The work at the base of the memorial to accommodate the lights has enhanced the memorial.  Mayor T.H. Woollacott introduced W.F. Pickering, President of the RSL who performed the ceremony.  He said Council had been considering how to enhance the appearance of Market Square for some time.  It gave a poor impression of the town to visitors if the square was badly lit and the memorial was one of the best in the Commonwealth.  It was very a very appropriate move on the eve of the state’s centenary.  He thanked Mr Allan Dane who had assisted in the installation of the lights.  Mr Pickering expressed his appreciation of the Council’s move in installing the lighting and it gave him much pleasure to turn it on.  Rev. D.L. Redding moved a vote of thanks to Mr Pickering.
