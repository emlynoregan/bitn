Wind Farm Protestors also attended the opening of Hallett 2.  Four opponents of further wind farms in the Mid North were on hand to make their opposition known: Dennis Dale & Liz Traeger of Yacka, with Bob Lamb & Ally Fricker of Brady Creek.  They held large placards decrying the loss of visual amenity and claiming that wind farms ruin lives.
