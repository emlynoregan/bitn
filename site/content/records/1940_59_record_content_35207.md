Local Board of Health

Health Officer Dr W.E. Steven reported on a visit to each house in Paxton Square.  Most houses were in fair repair, but living conditions were bad.  The small water tanks were all practically empty and the town water supply too far away.  None had bathrooms and the privies did not comply with provisions of the Board of Health.  There were no provisions for the disposal of waste water.  The houses varied from very dirty to very clean.  The report suggested that when any of the houses became vacant, it should be pulled down â€“ it would cost a fortune to make the houses into standard dwellings.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said it would not be easy to pull the houses down when they became vacant.

Inspector E.R. Davey said in his opinion the living conditions were appalling.  Many of the houses had cement floors, and others wooden ones built on the ground.  The calico ceilings harboured rats, mice and other vermin.  Some backyards were filthy and hardly any of the privies had lids.  He had personally inspected 21 of the 33 houses and saw only one bath.  There was a glaring shortage of fresh water.

The Board decided to inspect the Square before taking any action.
