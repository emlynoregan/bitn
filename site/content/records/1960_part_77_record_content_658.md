Porter Lagoon Picnic Day saw about 100 cars there in the afternoon.  It was windy and the rough conditions meant that the boat races had to be abandoned.  The only boats on the water were those of Lance Fiebig and the Dunn Bros. of Black Springs.  Some water skiing events were also abandoned, but R. Taylor and P. Williams staged a contest and Gerald Day, impersonating a ballroom dancer, successfully went over the ski jump.

A Dart Competition was won by Miss J. Fiebig from Mrs P. Calda 98 to 91.

Mr K. Calda won the shot putt.

The children kept the boat-owners busy after they offered free rides around the lake.
