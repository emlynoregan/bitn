Burra High School Speech Night and 50th Annual Report.

In the last year the school celebrated it Golden Jubilee, had a Vice-Regal Visit and was host for the combined High Schools Sports Day.

The year opened with an enrolment of 146: made up of 77 boys and 69 girls and we expect it to be 160 in 1963.  If staff permits we will make a second 1st Year Class.  The only staffing changes in 1962 were the resignation of Junior Teacher Kym Horsnell and the arrival of J. Murphy from England.  Now we say farewell to Mr Sladden and Mr Hillman; the former to Gawler and the latter to Henley High.

Religious Instruction continues to run smoothly.

Last year I reported the Education Department agreed to rent the area southwest of the school and to make available a subsidy and to grant £135 for initial ground formation.  This has allowed the completion of two tennis courts (also two basketball courts) and two half cricket pitches in the last year and the grassing of the area for athletics, football and softball, together with a water reticulation system.  Backstops are now planned for the courts at the front of the school.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has continued its good work and catered very well at the school’s sports day and also the combined schools’ sports, when they catered for 300 adults and 700 students.  £100 was raised. At the Jubilee Ball the gross takings were £160.  The Jubilee Birthday Party was also organised.  The Jubilee ‘Statton’ playing area will be a memorial to their effort to mark the school’s 50th birthday.

Improvements this year have concentrated on improving the playing facilities.  56 girls can now be absorbed in basketball at a time, compared with 14 previously.  Cricket and tennis facilities have also increased.  On Arbor Day trees were planted. This year the asphalt paving area was resurfaced, a gas stove installed and two new £4,000 buses for the Hallett & Hanson runs arrived.  A new £5,000 laboratory is to be commenced in January 1963.
