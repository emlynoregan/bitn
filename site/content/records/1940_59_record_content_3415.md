Burra Bowling Club AGM, 17 September.

The financial position of the Bowling Club is not as good as last year, due to the smaller membership and increased expenses.  The Croquet Club financial support has enabled the budget to balance.  Subscriptions for the year fell from £94 to £81.  Water rates rose £7 to £21, but for the coming season will come down to c. £13.  One esteemed member, Mr J.A. Andrews died.  Interclub matches resulted in the retention of the Kapunda Cup, but a failure to win the shield from Clare.

Elected: Patron, Dr D.M. Steel; President, S. Kellaway; Vice-Presidents, G.E. Dane & R.J. Grant; Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.
