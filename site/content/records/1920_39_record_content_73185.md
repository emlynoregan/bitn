Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co.

Mr I.J. Warnes spoke at a meeting of shareholders on Wednesday.  He considered the continued closure of the mine had serious implications for the whole field.  The company presently owed £34 to creditors and £92 to the Government.  The meeting was adjourned to 16 December due to the absence of the Chairman of Directors who was interstate and Mr Warnes urged a good attendance on that date.  Lack of funds will prevent formal notification of the meeting to shareholders.

An article published on 17 May showed that 35 tons 10cwt of ore averaged 6oz 14dwt 1gr from 8 November 1937 to 13 May 1938.  This was obtained under local management, but the management reverted to putting all through the battery, which was a method that had not worked according to the report.  The results are now seen in the closure of the mine.  The company seems to have worked on principles followed in other places where they own mines even though the geologists have said that at Mongolata there is no reef stuff, but gold has to be found by following seams – a process which on Byles’ could be carried out on a much larger scale than on other successful mines on the field.  Shareholders should safeguard their interests at the meeting and ensure the mine is carried on using methods that have proved a success in the past.
