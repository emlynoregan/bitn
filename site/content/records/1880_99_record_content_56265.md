Waterworks.

They are running well at present.

Cr Hardy asked if any payments had been received for water taken from the standpipes in Aberdeen or Kooringa.

The Town Clerk said no.

It was resolved to lock the standpipes, as water had (at least) been used in conjunction with the building of a house near the station.
