Letter.  Elic Gillett from Hampshire writes as a third time visitor and with due respect to comment on the public meeting re policing â€“ which he understands to be largely in relation to spot fines on drivers who had exceeded the legally permitted amount of alcohol in their blood.  Firstly he is surprised that a fine is considered appropriate, because in most European countries the penalty would be loss of licence for three to twelve months.  Secondly he is surprised that a small number of people think it worthwhile to arrange a public meeting to criticise the police for carrying out the job they are paid for.
