Weather.  Snow fell in Burra on Sunday.  The first fall occurred at 8.20 a.m., but rain followed soon after and washed it away.  A heavier fall at 9.55 a.m. lasted till about 10.30 and this snow was in evidence for some time.  More fell at about 1 p.m., but rain again followed.  Snow was reported intermittently throughout Sunday at Hallett.

In Burra the fire siren sounded at 12.45 p.m. for a minor chimney fire in Paxton Square.  The familiar red of the fire brigade and the white of the snow combined to make an unusual sight as the call was answered.
