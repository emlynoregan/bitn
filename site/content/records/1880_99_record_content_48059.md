Characteristics of the 1892 paper.

Page 1.

The usual larger advertisements, many of them local.

Page 2.

General business advertisements with public notices and notices of sales etc.  Births, deaths and marriages are not commonly reported and obituaries seem rather thin this year.

Most issues had an editorial and some a second leader as well.

Sometimes the editorial didn’t start till page three.  Some issues begin without an editorial and with a column simply headed ‘Current Topics’.
