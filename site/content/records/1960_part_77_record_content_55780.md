Burra Cub & Scout Group Committee is raising funds to erect a shower and toilet block at the hall.  A bottle drive is being held with a sorting day 17 April at the Burra North Depot.

Milton Edwards as President of the Group Committee reports on their second year:

They have solid backing and support.  Regular bottle drives would be sufficient to provide funds now that the initial needs have been met, but it has proved difficult to co-ordinate them and establish a routine.  The facilities at the Cub and Scout Halls have been improved and the change to ETSA power has been a great help.  A shower and toilet block is essential for weekend camping at the Halls.  The birthday social on 16 October was a wonderful success.  Thanks go especially to Secretary, Mr Peter Mengersen, Treasurer, Mr Bob Mason and Group Scout Master Mr Brian Ashdown.
