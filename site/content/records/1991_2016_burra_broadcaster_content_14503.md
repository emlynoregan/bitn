Morgan –Burra Road.  With the sealing project nearing its completion, locals are getting together to plan an opening celebration.  There will be a meeting for people interested or who have ideas at the Burra Ambulance Centre on 25 November.  It seems the logical site for the event would be out at ‘The Gums’ halfway between Burra & Morgan.
