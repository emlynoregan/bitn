Peter Brodie writes expressing concern at discovering that there has been no X-ray service at the Burra Hospital for the last 2 years.  He goes back over the Dr Dissanayake saga and links the two issues.  He says the three Burra Doctors have said they are all prepared to do whatever is necessary to gain or regain the authority to operate the X-ray machine.  He suggests that the machine was rushed out of Burra before the doctors returned from leave at the weekend.
