Farrell’s Flat.  People are extolling the government town of Hanson judging from the recent land sale.  Planned, or in course are a flour mill, a machinist’s, blacksmith’s, hotel of 15 rooms and general store.  There is a daily coach to Clare and twice a week one to Booborowie to catch the Blinman mail.
