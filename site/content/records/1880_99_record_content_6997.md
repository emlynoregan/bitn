Cricket notes by Serjeant Buzfuz.  He blames the dismal performance of this season on the lack of practice and poor organisation rather than lack of ability.  They played 6 matches: against Manoora, Oxford Association, Clare, Hindmarsh, True Blues and the Wanderers at Mintaro - and beat only the True Blues.
