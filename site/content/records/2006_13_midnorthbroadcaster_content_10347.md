Paul Dowd, Managing Director of Phoenix Copper Ltd, writes in response to the open letter circulated by Paul Marsson.

I had hoped that the meeting with stakeholders on 16 June would have clarified the company’s position and allayed some of the ungrounded fears.  It was therefore unfortunate that the open letter was circulated on that very day, as it contains several factually incorrect statements.

It is asserted that the intention is remove the water from the mine pit.  This would be expensive and unnecessary for exploration.  Should exploration be successful and should future development require the removal of the water Phoenix Copper is aware that an appropriate water management plan would have to be developed.

It is asserted that it would necessitate the destruction of Heritage-listed mine buildings.  This would be an act of delinquency beyond any reasonable person’s contemplation.  In any case there are relevant authorities who would not stand by and allow such a heinous act to occur.

There are other incorrect statements, but I would rather engage in a constructive dialogue.  Such a dialogue would further promote the wonderful Heritage of the Burra area.  Phoenix Copper supports the World Heritage Listing.  An Exploration Licence does not permit mining.

Other State and Federal regulations already in place regulate activities and standards within the area even if the ‘reserve’ was lifted.
