Burra Show Society met on Friday to consider the Finance Committee’s recommendation to end the sheep dog trials because they always ran at a loss, even if only by a few pounds.  The Chairman said the loss was due to the free members’ tickets.  It was decided to hold the trials this year on 30 & 31 July.
