Burra Motel

Five new rooms are approaching completion in time for the gourmet weekend on 16 & 17 May.  This brings to twenty the number of rooms and caters for large bus groups.  Manager John Stuart expects to benefit from being able to accommodate touring groups.  The new development includes a restaurant to be opened in June – probably to be called ‘Jumbucks’.  The licensed restaurant will offer an à la carte menu and will welcome diners who are not guests at the hotel.
