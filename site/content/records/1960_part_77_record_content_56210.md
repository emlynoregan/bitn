Burra Mine: The Powder Magazine

What is the evidence for its erection in 1847?

Ian Auhl forwards copies of the letters written at the time by Thomas Burr, Superintendent of the Burra Burra Mine, to the Directors in Adelaide.

Letter 1: 18 September 1847

The plan and sections of the new powder magazine have been drawn by me and in a day or two the builder will give an estimate.  Dimensions are 12 ft x 20 ft x 6 ft to the springing of the arch, which is semi-circular.  Side walls are to be 2” in thickness and the end walls 2 feet.  [Sic: this must be an error, presumably for 2 ft.]  To be roofed in slate.  [Auhl says this was an overall roof – long since dismantled.]

I will forward plans as soon as I can make duplicates, but given the heat and the unsafe nature of the present structure and situation, I will proceed with the new one without delay.  To secure life and property I advise that shoes of a peculiar construction be made forthwith (three or more pairs) for use of those visiting the magazine or engaged in moving powder.  To be made of soft leather and fitting like a sock.  Having visited the magazine and seen loose powder scattered on sandy and gravely floor, it is apparent a most disastrous consequence might ensue with total destruction of the workings and great loss of life.

Letter 2.  20 September 1847.

I have marked out the site and work will commence at once and should be done in a month.  Site chosen is on top of a hill in front of this house.  (Auhl says that is the Mine Manager’s residence – now destroyed.)  From its commanding view it will be a landmark and will be well ventilated.

Letter 3.  25 November 1847.

I would be obliged if you would expedite the sheeves (i.e. the slates) as the building cannot be completed without them.  I wish to have the powder moved before the height of summer and we usually get a day or two of rain at the end of November or early December, which would be a good time to move it.

The sheeves arrived and the powder was moved early in December 1847.
