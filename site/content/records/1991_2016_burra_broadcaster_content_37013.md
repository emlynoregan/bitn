Goyder Council decided yesterday to increase its rate revenue by 4.62%.

Robertstown Ward rises by 3.99%

Hallett Ward by 3.81%

The single rural rate has changed to different rates in 13 areas.  The rates this year will be made up of a fixed charge of $195 (up 20%) and a rate based on capital value of the asset.

Andrew Glen, manager of Burra Visitor Centre has been elected Chairperson of the Visitor Information Network Working Party.  This aims to raise the profile of Visitor Information Centres and to maintain consistency across accredited centres.
