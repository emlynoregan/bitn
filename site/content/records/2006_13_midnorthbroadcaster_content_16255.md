Friends of Burra Parks looked back on a rewarding year at their AGM on 30 January at La Pecora Nera.  This year they got 8 km of fencing done at Mokota Conservation Park, which will allow sheep grazing trials in a native grassland system.  In September there was a talk by guest speaker and senior geologist Wolfgang Preiss as the group walked through Tooralie Gorge.  Other monthly activities saw members visiting the Pandappa, Paradise and Redbanks Conservation Parks and some also visited the Arid Lands Bimbowrie Conservation Park.  Wendy Cliff who was senior ranger at Burra Parks will now be based at Clare as Community Ranger.  Another ranger will soon be appointed.  [Group photo & Tooralie Gorge photo.]
