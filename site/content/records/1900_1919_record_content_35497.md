South African War Service.  Military authorities have asked chief military centres to organise memorial services for those who fell in the South African War.  The Light Horse, Infantry and Cadets will parade at the Rotunda on Sunday 14 September at 3 p.m.  The service will be led by Rev. J.H. Nield, a late chaplain of H.M. Forces in the South African War.  The Burra Coronation Band will play.  The offertory will aid the Soldiers’ Graves Fund and the local hospital.  Hymns chosen are: O God Our Help, Lead Kindly Light, Onward Christian Soldiers & Kipling’s God of Our Fathers.
