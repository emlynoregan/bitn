Cricket.  Arrangements have been made for the visit of the Port Adelaide team over Easter.  There will be an Easter Saturday match at Kooringa and an Easter Monday game at South Booborowie.  They will be two separate matches, though the teams chosen are substantially the same.  There will be a smoke social on Saturday evening at the Burra Hotel and on Sunday a motor tour of the Mt Bryan District.
