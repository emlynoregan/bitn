Maurice Collins’ speech at the Burra Institute 10 March is reported.  Mr Collins had been Mayor of Burra for six years.  He complained at the decision of the ABC not to allow him air time.  He accused the Liberal Government of ‘pinching’ extra Parliamentary time by extending three-year terms to five years.  He accused them also of misrepresenting various matters relating to the supply of milk to children and of flouting the people’s wishes by introducing a permit system which allows hotels to open after six o’clock.  He touched upon Government extravagances:

Laying the Tod River Scheme water pipes underground.

Spending over £1,000,000 on constructing Anzac Highway to create ‘a speedway for road hogs and nothing else’.

The removal of a bend at Little Para at a cost of £8,300.

Lowering the road at Dead Man’s Hill by some 3 feet at a cost of thousands of pounds

Another bend at Morphett Vale.

What was needed was work on reducing soil erosion.  Areas are overstocked and trees have been destroyed.  Closer settlement in the South East and Kangaroo Island has been marred by speculators.

He was apparently opposed to the present voting system, but the report of his views here is unenlightening.
