Accident.  A man named Owers, while working on a well on a neighbouring sheep station, was handling a charge of powder in a piece of rock when it exploded.  The damage to his hands was so bad Dr Dashwood had to amputate both and there is no hope he will earn a livelihood again.  He has a wife and three children.
