SAIT Members at BCS write re the recent stoppage.  It was not about pay rises, but against continuing cuts to schools:

Increased class sizes of 30+ in Years 5-7.

Less choice of subjects in Years 11 & 12.

Loss of one school service officer.

Practical class sizes that exceed safety limits.

Less time for children with learning difficulties.

Prospects of further cuts in the 1995-96 budget.
