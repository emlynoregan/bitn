The ‘Man From Snowy River’ Competition was held at Corryong, Victoria, in the past week.

The event demanded competition in all aspects of horsemanship, including shoeing, bareback stock horse riding, cross country – including a rugged mountain ride that was ‘almost straight up’.  Shane Cooper, Burra’s dog-catcher, took out 3rd place, with top scores in the bareback and stock-saddle buck jump.  The winner was Bill Willoughby of Booleroo Centre.  (1st prize $10,000, 2nd $1,500 and 3rd $500.)
