Kooringa News, 6 November

Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held yesterday at Gum Creek Station before Mr M. MacDermott SM to inquire into the sudden death of Donald Ross who had resided there.

Margaret Ross:

Am wife of the deceased.  He went to Adelaide last Thursday week and returned last Friday in very poor health.  He had spent two nights in Kapunda and took some medicine there.  He had great difficulty in breathing, but would not keep to his bed. He had pains in his lower chest and sometimes spat up blood.  He died at 1.25 a.m. this morning.

Alfred James Williams:

Last Sunday I called to see deceased who was up and dressed.  He looked very feverish.  I asked if he had been drunk in Adelaide.  He said not, but from his appearance I thought he had been.  He complained of a bad cough and difficulty in breathing and pain in the lower part of his chest.  He had medicine from Kapunda.  I made him go to bed and applied a mustard poultice to his chest.  He did not appear dangerously ill at this time.

Dr T.H. Mayne:

Having seen the body I am of the opinion he died from inflammation of the lungs.  There were no marks of violence visible on the body.

The jury returned a verdict of death from natural causes.

[Donald Ross died 4 November 1861 at Gum Creek Sheep Run aged 45.]

The Primitive Methodists this week held their annual conference meetings here.  There were special services and a camp meeting.  On Sunday morning a large number of people paraded the streets and stopped at street corners for prayers and exhortatory addresses.  They then proceeded to the Paddock; a vacant piece of land north of the township, where the rest of the morning was devoted to devotional exercises.  In the afternoon a large gathering was held there for the same purposes.

The annual meeting of the Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Kooringa Branch was held on Tuesday 5 November in the Bible Christian Chapel.  The proceedings began at 6 p.m. and by 7 p.m. the spacious building was completely filled.  Mr MacDermott SM was voted into the chair and Rev. W. Davidson read a detailed report of the year’s activities.  This year the branch issued 250 Bibles and 247 Testaments compared with 231 and 116 respectively the year before.  In this year these issues comprised 483 English volumes, 13 Welsh and 1 German.  Arrangements have been made to open a depot at Black Springs.  Income this year was £116-10-0 exclusive of sales at the depot.  (£96-2-3 came from subscriptions.)

[The report continues at some length with further details of the work of the organisation.]
