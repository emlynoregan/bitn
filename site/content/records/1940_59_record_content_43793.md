Fire.  The first outbreak for the season was near Copperhouse on Friday when about 40 acres of feed was destroyed, but damage to fences etc. was minimal due to prompt action of local fire fighters.  It is thought to have been started by a six-year-old child playing with matches.  The fire started near E. Threadgold’s residence and threatened his house and with a northwest wind soon threatened Roy Threadgold’s too, but fortunately it was soon extinguished.
