The family afterwards moved to Ironmine and later made their home at Peterborough.  Mrs Earle remembered Peterborough before there were any houses there at all.  She married Mr Earle, then of Yongala, at Peterborough Methodist Church in 1908.  The couple then went to Ironmine to reside.  They carried on a successful farm.  She was a consistent member of the Methodist Church.  She leaves a husband, one son, one daughter as well as five brothers and three sisters: Mesdames A. Gill, A. Lloyd & Miss M. Richards and Messrs W.H., J.G. & T.E. Richards all of Peterborough and Mr D. Richards of Croydon.
