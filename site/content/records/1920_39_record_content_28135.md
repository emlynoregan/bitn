Burra Court, 27 & 28 September

Defeated candidates attempted to have the seats of Crs Hawkes and Schuppan, who were successful at the last election for the District Council of Apoinga, declared vacant.  The ground were purely technical in that notices concerning the elections were not displayed at the Emu Downs and Brady Creek post offices, also that certain names were incorrectly entered into the Assessment Book and the nomination paper of W.G. Hawkes did not confirm to the Act.  The court dismissed both informations with costs against the informant.  Briefly the reasons were that objections to the roll needed to be made in the prescribed manner on election day and the complainant had not shown the signatures on the nomination paper were not those of ratepayers of the ward.
