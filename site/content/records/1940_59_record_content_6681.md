Letter.  Sgt Reg. Lee, son of Mr & Mrs Billie Lee writes of conditions in England.  Among other points he says:

The only lights are seen in the London tube and dimly on other railway stations.

Traffic in the city is light and almost absent at night.

On moonless nights pedestrians feel their way about.

Business stops at 4 p.m. to allow people to settle down in the tube stations for the night.

Tube stations are crowded to absolute capacity and bunks have been erected along the walls.

Babies sleep in suit cases and the like.

Big bombers drone overhead for hours on end.

The screech and explosion of bombs and the terrific barrage of AA guns fills the air.

He also writes of bomb damage to houses and of an AIF hospital.
