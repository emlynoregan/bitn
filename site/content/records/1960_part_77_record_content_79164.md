BCS. Community Week this term will offer assessment drives for licensed motorists.  Computing courses will also be offered.  One course will cater for students with some tertiary education and one for people with no Maths background or tertiary education.  The student driver education course has commenced at the school, using a loaned new HJ Holden.
