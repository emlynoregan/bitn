They have dispensed with the dayman which the editor feels is a mistake.  It is important to have a man available when needed for footpaths, roads, culverts etc.

The Waterworks needs closer attention than it has had for some time.

‘There are fire plugs, etc. that has [sic] never been seen since the waterworks has been finished and when they are found it will be a matter of impossibility to move them from the dirt and rust.  There are several mains that has [sic] never been flushed and many that has [sic] been ordered to receive attention has [sic] been neglected.’
