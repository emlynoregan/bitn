The Northern Mails.  The irregularity of the mail is a cause for great complaint.  Last week was particularly bad.  On Saturday the mail did not arrive till about 10 oâ€™clock.  There was consequently no delivery that night, but the postmaster Mr Powell very kindly sent around the letters to the principal tradesmen of the township.
