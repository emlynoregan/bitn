Jubilee Avenue

[Note: this is a detailed account of this enterprise and the best account of it I have found anywhere.]

Jubilee Avenue was designed as the town’s memorial to the Jubilee of both the colony and of H.M. the Queen.  The Mayor felt any such memorial in Burra should include work for the unemployed.  Charity often does not relieve the most deserving and work was what was needed.

Some time ago it was planned to complete the formation of the eastern side of the road from the Mine Bridge to Kooringa.  The formation of a footpath with a row of trees on either side would be an immense improvement, but beyond the means of the rates.  The proposal was to do it without using the rates by employing men at 5/- a day over 2-3 months. [The money to be raised by subscription etc.]  First though it was necessary to define the western side of the road.  The Road Board was requested to do so and it agreed and it was done.  The western side then had to be cut back to its correct place, which varied from 1 to 4 feet from the existing alignment.  The soil etc. from this formed the filling on the east side which then only required the removal of an old fence and levelling.  A double line of post and wire fence was needed to enclose the new footway.  The Mayor suggested a row of sugar gums on the creek side and of white cedars along the road.

The distance was 26 chains with an estimated cost of £70 with trees coming from the Forest Board.  The Mayor did not suggest this be dignified by the name of a Jubilee Memorial, but thought ‘it would be memorable as having been carried out during the jubilee year’.  When it was adopted on 6 June it became known as Jubilee Avenue on the motion of Captain Killicoat.  The Council began spending the money and the Mayor set about raising it.  He got 81 subscribers and several entertainments were got up by ‘public spirited gentlemen’ to aid the cause.  Ultimately the work was extended to more than double the length originally proposed.  SAME gave £20 and Mr McCulloch £10, Mr C. Furniss £5 and the Children’s Demonstration Committee gave £15-16-0 for the erection of a drinking fountain.  £166-13-6 has been raised and the Mayor has made up the balance to the £183-6-4 actually expended.  Some small work and supervision by the daymen has been paid from ordinary funds.  The North Ward dayman was paid for eleven days out of the Ward Funds.  Future control will lie with East Ward.
