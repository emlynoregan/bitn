Hanson Post Office was closed on Friday after serving the community for 84 years.  Hanson will now be served by private boxes at Burra or Farrell Flat or by the Mail Run.  Hanson was a non-official office.  The first office was at the Hanson (then called Davieston) Railway Station and was opened in December 1890.  Mr I. Rippin was the postmaster with a daily mail service by train.  E.S. Blunt was postmaster 1897-1902.  A telegraph worked by telephone was installed in 1913.  Local residents built the next post office by the schoolteacher’s residence and until 1947 postmasters were the schoolteacher’s wives or immediate relations.  E. Dawson was the schoolteacher in 1915, Hester Oakley was schoolteacher 5 January 1916 and Miss Janie H. Fedd from 1 July 1916 was the sister of the schoolmistress.  Lilian Mabel Bishop was a temporary appointment 25 March 1920 and Margaret Ellen Marshall was the teacher from 15 April 1920.

Margaret Barbara Trenter	6 October 1923

Margaret Ellen Marshall 7 July 1924

Elizabeth Ellen Craigie 1 April 1926

Gladys Ida Eustis 19 April 1926 (temporary)

Edith Daisy Boehm 26 July 1926

Mrs Vera Lavina McQueen 22 May 1935

Mrs Alice Lillian Maude Cawthorne 16 May 1941

Mrs Barbara Esme Daw 3 February 1947

A telephone exchange was established c. 1920.  When Mr Syd Robinson took over the Hanson store in August 1948 the office moved there and operated until last Friday – the last working day before 30 June.  He and Mrs Robinson have given sterling service to the district over the past 26 years.  They will continue to live at Hanson in retirement; the store having been closed several years ago.
