Letter.  Peter Brodie writes re the suspension of the local doctor from accident and emergency cases at the Burra Hospital.

He was told he would never find out who were the eight doctors on whose authority the doctor was suspended.

He now has the names of the six people on the panel and some are not independent GPs.
