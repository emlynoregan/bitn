Aberdeen Croquet Club Opening is reported in exhaustive detail in 2¾ columns.

The Mayoress Mrs A.B. Riggs opened the club on Saturday 16 February.  The green is at the rear of the site of the now-demolished White Hart Hotel.  It has been only nine months since it was first mooted and now there is a well-fenced grassed green with a garden and a well-built and commodious shelter-shed and a well-appointed kitchen.  Ideal weather encouraged a large attendance.  Mrs J.G. Sara as President welcomed members and visitors.  Miss Len[a] Bartholomaeus, Treasurer, read a financial statement showing receipts of £192-14-9 and expenditure of £185-7-10.

Mrs J.G. Sara reported the first meeting and foundation of the club was 12 April 1928.  Consideration was given to part of the playground site in Redruth.  Then two lots near the railway line were offered, but the club decided one was too costly to level and the other was apt to be very dusty from saleyard sheep.  By the second meeting the club had decided on the site and called a working bee for 26 May 1928 and a large pepper tree was removed.  Enough stone was excavated to build the pavilion and club room.

[Exhaustive detail of who did what follows for ¾ column and the main points have been previously noted.]

Mrs A.B. Riggs was then called on to open the grounds and perhaps she did so, but the report’s next paragraph details a speech by Rev. W.O. Harris.

Then the secretary Mrs Goble handed the deeds of the grounds to the Mayor who received them on behalf of the Town Council.  The gift carried the proviso that the property not be used for sport of any description on a Sunday.  The Mayor accepted and spoke, followed by Cr Woollacott.  Then the President asked the Mayoress to declare the green open [and this time she is actually reported to have done so.]  A sumptuous tea was then served followed by a number of competitions using the greens.
