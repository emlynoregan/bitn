A.J. McBride writes as Chairman of the hospital Board in response to the letter of L.A. Morrisonâ€™s suggestion that the Board was well off and therefore indifferent to the sufferings of the poor.  He says the first consideration has always been for the poor.  There is nothing to prevent either of the doctors from admitting any patients they like to the hospital and attending to them as far as the Board is concerned.  Burra people like Mr Morrison who take their sick to Adelaide or Jamestown etc. are helping those who want to see our hospital kept idle.
