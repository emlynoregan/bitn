The Anzac Commemoration Service at the War Memorial on Sunday drew about 800 in mild weather.  The ex-Navalmen’s Band from Adelaide provided the music and led the march of returned servicemen and the local CMF.  Ian Richardson, as President of the local sub-branch of the RSL, was in charge.  The RSL later entertained the Band at afternoon tea.  Rev. C. Christopher, Rev. F.E. Tregilgas and Captain Lamont of the Salvation Army all took roles in the service.  (Captain Lamont was deputising for Captain Lawrence of Burra.)  Rev. R. Pettet gave the address.  [Which is printed.]

Wreaths were laid by: I. Richardson (RSL,) R.C. Lott (Air Force Association & Ex-Navalmen’s Association,) A.G. Woodman (Demobilised Soldiers,) G.H. Dollman (Fathers’ Association) and Mayor, W. Carpenter for the Town of Burra.
