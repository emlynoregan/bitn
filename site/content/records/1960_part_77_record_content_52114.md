Obituary.  People of Hallett and District were saddened by the death of Lillie Owen-Smyth of Ulooloo Station, who died suddenly only a fortnight or so after the death of her husband the late Gaynor Owen-Smyth.  She seemed forever young and enthusiastic with a disciplined and determined approach to the many tasks she undertook for the local community despite exceeding her three score years and ten.  Her great love was the Red Cross, for which she was approaching her 50th year of service and a laurel wreath.
