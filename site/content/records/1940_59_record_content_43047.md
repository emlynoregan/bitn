Burra Town Council

Cr Lee asked whether it was legal to wash cars and trucks in the street.

The Town Clerk said no by-law prohibited it.

A ‘no-parking’ area is to be created between the Burra Motor Co. & the RSL rooms.

Buffalo Lodge was granted permission to hold its Christmas tree in Market Square on 21 December and for a portion of the area to be roped off.

The Hospital Department advised that the Council’s contribution to Burra Hospital would be £253.

The Highways Dept. advised that the District Road Grant would be £300 and the Council’s contribution would be £100.  [Sic: but note that in the report in 75, 42, 25 Oct. 1949, page 4, it says £400 and £150 repsectively.]

Mr J. Scott is to be written to finish pulling down the house he has been demolishing opposite the Kooringa Hotel.

The painting of Phillip Lane is to be sent to Adelaide for repairs.
