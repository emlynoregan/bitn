Palaeontology Week held in conjunction with the SA Museum’s Fossil Festival saw increased interest in Burra’s Redbanks Conservation Park.  Four tag-along guided tours took some 70 people of all ages and backgrounds on an exploration of the heritage park.  They were able to view fossils and explore waterholes.  Many locals had no idea such waterholes existed.  Professor Rod Wells and Dr Adam Yates addressed an audience in the Town Hall supper room the day before the excursions and spoke of the dinosaurs and megafauna that have been found in the park.  Tour guide Neil Nicholson said Red Banks needs to be used more.  It is not really recognised as being part of Burra’s attractions.
