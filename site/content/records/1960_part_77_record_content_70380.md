Miss Tanya Moiseiwitsch visited Burra on Saturday.  She is in the state for the Arts Festival production of Moliere’s The Imaginary Invalid.  Her mother was Miss Daisy Fowler Kennedy who was born in a bedroom of the Commercial Hotel in Burra in 1893.  Joseph Kennedy, Daisy’s father, was a headmaster and the headmaster’s house was not ready, so the family stayed at the hotel until the house in Kangaroo street was available.  Daisy Kennedy became a well known violinist who went to Vienna to study when aged 15.  She later married the famous concert pianist from Odessa, Russia, Benno Moiseiwitsch.
