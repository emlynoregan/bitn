Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

1867-68 saw economies practised.  Wages were cut as far as possible, but returns were falling.  The cost of the big engine was a problem in lean years.  The directors decided on getting advice from a mining engineer from England to make a thorough examination of the mine and then advise on what methods could keep the mine working.  A careful record was kept of Morphett’s engine every week and for six months it averaged 59, 254 lifts.  In 1867 there was a bushfire north of Aberdeen and also the stables, horse traps harness, hay and stockyard of the Burra Hotel (later the hospital) were burnt and the hotel and brewery were only saved with great difficulty.

In July the Big Drought ended with 4 inches of rain in June and the creeks ran high right through July.  It was the best season in 14-15 years.  Signs of creeps in the mine occurred for some considerable time.  The mine was then employing 217 men, boys and officers.  Copper was at £75 a ton and Morphett’s Engine was using 100 tons of wood a week.  In April 1868 two of the reserve boilers were out of order and boilermakers had to come from Adelaide for repairs that were worrying and costly.  Early in 1868 Captain Roach resigned after 22 years service and as far as I know Captain Saunders took his place with Captain Paul second in charge [sic: for Sanders & Paull.]  In May 1868 news came that Mr Darlington was on his way from England to examine the mine.  On arriving in Adelaide he perused the plans and about mid-July 1868 began his investigation of the mine.  He began at Karculta with two inspections and as a result all future work was condemned and demolition work started, including the engine and boiler.  The land was later sold to Mr Duffield and is now part of Koonoona Estate.  Mr Darlington then made a detailed examination of the overground workings at Burra followed by the underground.  I do not know exactly what Darlington reported, but in September 1868 the mine stopped buying firewood and relied on its reserves.  At Morphett’s the 20” and 14” lifts were ordered dropped to 40 fathom level and water was allowed to rise to the 50 fathom at once.  As soon as pumps were fixed at 40 fathoms water to be allowed to rise to 30 fathom level until tributers had cut out their contracts.  At Graves the men working on a drive south at 50 fathoms were called out and paid off although within about 4ft of their destination.  The whole effort at Graves: shaft, engine house, timbering and drive was wasted.  In October at Morphett’s the water rose to 40 fathoms in three days.  Half the shaftsmen were paid off and the engine slowed to 4 strokes a minute while tributers cleared up underground. And in December 1868 Morphett’s engine stopped and was overhauled ready for a restart at some time.  50 horses were sold off in Adelaide.  To simplify management Mr Challoner was appointed overall manager.  All stores and equipment not likely to be used in the new working was to be returned to Adelaide and Wallaroo Mines became a large purchaser thereof.  Many men drifted to Wallaroo Mines which were booming.
