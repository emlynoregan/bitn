Letter.  ‘The Visualiser’ writes re the Racecourse as a sports ground.

The writer says the idea is the sanest of the various suggestions.

Victoria Park is a useless piece of ground.  It is not large enough, with too little space for parking and cannot be expanded.  Currently its only facility is a derelict building suitable for catching pneumonia.

[The writer then goes on to describe the improvements that could readily be made at the racecourse to render it a suitable sports ground.]
