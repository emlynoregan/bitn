SA Mining Association 15th Annual Report [Editorial]

The 15th annual report will be presented to shareholders next Wednesday.  Despite the title of the Association, its activities are virtually confined to the Burra Burra Mines.  The operations at the Pompurne Mine have been discontinued and a loss of upwards of £1,230 written of in the company’s ledger on account of that venture.  At the Karkulto Mine, from which so much was expected, and into which so much investment has been made, work continues, but we understand that here too the Directors are likely soon to advise that it is to the company’s advantage to cease operations.  After 15 years then the Association is virtually left solely to rely upon the Burra Burra Mine.  The Directors do not seemed disheartened however, and have secured leases of mineral lands in the north adjoining the sections of the Great Northern Mining Company and apparently they intend in the near future to test the value of their property there.

The quantity of ore raised in the last six months was 6,924 tons of about 22-23% copper.  Nearly 1,000 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide at £100 per ton.  A still higher price is now being realised.  The cost of producing the ore has been £12-5-8 per ton in the last half-year.  The nett amount realised was £14-14-0, leaving a profit of £2-8-4 per ton.  This is not as favourable as 12 months ago, when the profit per ton was £3-7-8.  The cost of raising ore has risen due to deeper workings, more machinery, greater timbering and various other factors.  The Directors are investigating ways of reducing the costs associated with ore dressing.  They are looking at further machinery to cut costs.

The entire expenditure in the last half-year was £80,881-6-9 and the nett proceeds of ore raised were £96,796-3-7.  The entire amount to credit in the profit and loss accounts is £74,259-13-6.  Against this must be placed the aggregate amount for the 40th and 41st dividends of £24,640 and a further sum of equal amount, which the Directors have deemed it necessary to transfer to stock account to represent the additional inconvertible property of the Association.  These sums, together with the losses on working the Pompurne Mine, reduce the balance available for dividends to 31 March to £23,748-15-1.  As a result the Directors have proposed to declare one dividend of 100% in the current half year.  It is necessary to note that a further profit of £22,158-15-7 will be realised on copper and ore raised, but not yet sold.  Thus the shareholders have no great reason to feel dissatisfied, despite there being only one dividend and that of only 200% per annum on their original investment.

Captain Roach’s report reveals the Mine is operating deeper and deeper.  There are 96 tribute pitches at work.  The state of the mine was very satisfactory.  Employed at present:
