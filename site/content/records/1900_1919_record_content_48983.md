Burra Town Council.

J.G. Sara wrote applying for the Aberdeen Post Office to have a half-holiday on Saturdays in line with other post offices.

The rates for 1917 were set: General 1/-, Health 6d (down 1d), Parklands 2d & Lighting 4d (up 1d).

Repairs to the cemetery wall are progressing well.

Cr Harris asked if it was Council’s intention to have a roll of honour.

The Mayor said a motion to that effect had been passed.

The idea most suitable was similar to Mt Bryan’s Roll.  The cost was about £20 for the 1st 50 names.

Given the large number two rolls might be needed.

He estimated the cost at £100 to £150.

Cr Dane had seen a diagram for 400 names at £60-£80.

The Mayor counselled delay at this time.

Cr Harris feared the records of some men might be lost.

The location suggested was the Hall or the Public Reading Room.

The proprietor of the Record offered to publish all names available with a view to obtaining others not on the list.
