Post War Development Schemes for Burra

The Council forwarded idea to the Local Govt Dept as requested.  The Council believes industry should be decentralised, immigration encouraged and preference given to returned soldiers and their dependents.   Suggestions were:

All roads and footpaths in Burra to be resurfaced and where necessary new ones to be built.  Cost £3,000.

25 substandard houses to be removed and the SA Housing Trust or similar, with local contractors to build new houses using bluestone.  Cost £15,000 over two years.

Re-afforestation work costing £3,500 to be undertaken along three miles of Burra Creek in reserves.

The policy of closer settlement be pursued on the great lucerne flats and similar places around the district to encourage dairying and for the construction of a factory in the locality for dairy products.

Other suggestions embraced a new police station to be built and a grant of £500 towards a swimming pool and for the water mains in the town to be standardised.
