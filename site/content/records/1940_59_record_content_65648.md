Hallett Strawberry Fete last Saturday took £184.  The fete was opened by Noel Tiver.  After about half an hour of trading business closed while concert artists provided entertainment.  Clem Davey played two piano solos and Mrs Satchell sang two solos, the Youth Club performed two amusing sketches and school children sang two songs before business resumed.
