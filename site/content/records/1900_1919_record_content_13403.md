Henderson’s Whistle, the usual signal for a fire, awoke many in Kooringa about 3 a.m. one morning last week.  It had people looking everywhere for the blaze and eventually many trekked to Henderson’s only to discover it was a hoax.  Those going home again seemed to have had a tacit understanding not to reveal this to those still hurrying to the works.
