Peace Day Meeting at Leighton School last Saturday.

Mr Warnes took the chair and said they could have had a celebration at Leighton or have joined in at Burra.  To have a Leighton celebration was much harder work, but it would be remembered by the children.  He did not think collecting for the soldiers’ memorial was appropriate on that day, but Burra had so decided.  Was Leighton to have a separate memorial?  He had started a fund for that purpose for Mt Bryan and World’s End had decided to go on its own.  In 20 or 30 years a Leighton Memorial might be neglected while a Burra one would not, on the other hand Burra would get 99% of the credit.  The Districts were never asked to be represented on the big days, but were always asked to contribute when money was wanted.  If it was to be a district affair then all districts would have to have a say and a quota of money to raise.

Mr Fairchild congratulated Mr Warnes on his candour and favoured a second Peace Day for the children locally, even if they went to Burra on their day.

A separate Leighton Peace Day was agreed upon.

Mr McDonald said the Mayor of Burra should ask for representatives of districts to attend a meeting about a memorial.  He was not much taken with the idea of a memorial Market Square in marble or granite, which is what seems to have been taken for granted.

[He seems to have favoured planting avenues and beautifying parts of the town.]

Mr Fairchild feared some ‘inartistic thing’ might result and also favoured tree planting and perhaps a weir in the creek to create a beauty spot.

The meeting called for a conference of district representatives.
