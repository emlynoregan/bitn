The ninth siting examined Mr McNeil, who was received as a candidate for the ministry.

The twelfth sitting concerned local matters:

The anniversary services of the chapel were deemed to have been of a high order and the collection of £21 was good considering the state of Burra.

The thirteenth sitting settled the ‘stations’.  [That is the postings of the ministers to chapels and circuits.]

A tea meeting followed in the evening, with addresses by Messrs James Way, S. Keen, J. Ashton, T. Hillmann and J. Hancock.  The collections and tea raised almost £50.  The trustees and friends were pleased that in five years almost £1,000 of the debt had been paid off.

Tuesday was spent on correspondence and further consideration of financial matters.

S. Keen Chapel Secretary reported that in the past year there had been much progress with ten new chapels accommodating a further 1,500 people and two chapels ready to open in a month would accommodate 400 more.  One third of debt on chapels had been paid off.

Wednesday saw a sermon by Messrs Richard Stoye & Rock and the appointment of a committee to act with the General Committee on the Marriage Bill.

[This long article gives considerably more detail and ends with an acknowledgement of satisfaction with Cobb & Co.’s services.]
