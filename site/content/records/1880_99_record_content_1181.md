A deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works asked for a passenger carriage to be attached to the morning luggage train from Adelaide as a great convenience to businessmen.  This would depart Riverton for the north at 1.25 p.m. and so enable people who came south in the morning by the early train to get home at a reasonable time.  At present the journey can be done, but it requires a 2/- telegram each time to get permission.  [The luggage train departed Adelaide at 7.57 a.m. and reached Hallett at 6.20 p.m.]  The Commissioner was not enthusiastic.  Passengers were not allowed on goods trains in the UK and were generally discouraged everywhere.  Their presence in guard vans was much to be discouraged.
