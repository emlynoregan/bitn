Local Board of Health

One case of enteric fever was reported.

Mrs Thamm sought a reduction in the bill from the Local Board of Health (£30-17-2) for nursing expenses etc. associated with the influenza outbreak.  There was a prolonged discussion, particularly from Mr McBride, but eventually the amount was reduced to £23 with the blankets to be taken over by the Board.
