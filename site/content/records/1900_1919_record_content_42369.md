Soldiers’ Aid Society.

The society is growing and meetings are well attended.  A large parcel of goods is ready to be sent and sufficient is retained to equip Abberton Park as a convalescent hospital if needed.  Mr Morton’s Bible Class social raised 10/6.  Seven little girls from Hampton gave a concert there and raised 12/6.  The Society will provide luncheon for the sheep dog trials.  Mr Jesser will give his billiard hall for one Saturday afternoon.

So far the fund is £25-10-4½.
