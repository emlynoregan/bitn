Kevin William Wallis

I live at 6 Queen Street.  Married to Barbara and have three sons at BCS.  Have resided in Burra for three years, but as a newcomer I can see the areas of need in the town:

Recycling the rubbish instead of burning it.

Tree planting in Burra and the district.

Sealing of the Morgan Road.

A tidier town.

Tourism â€“ more efficient managing and new ideas.

To help local businesses where possible.

Manage rates to give more value for each dollar.

Residents of Burra will see their ideas and complaints get a fair hearing of more local residents are elected.  The Council needs new blood.  Local elections normally only have a small turn-out of voters and I urge you to vote on 5 May if you normally do not.
