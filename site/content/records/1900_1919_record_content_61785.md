Weather.  On Saturday morning 6 September there was driving hail, sleet and snow and just before midnight the wind dropped and heavy snow fell.  It was several inches deep when morning came.  Snow continued to fall and snowmen and snow-fights followed.  Views from the hills, especially towards Mt Bryan were magnificent.  The fall stopped just before midday.  Rain on Sunday afternoon removed the snow, though some remained in sheltered spots on Monday.  Rainfall to Tuesday was 1.22‚Äù and extended well to the east.
