Obituary.  C.C. Williams died on Saturday 25 November.  He was born in Brighton, Sussex in 1839 and left England in 1866 on the Amor, but in a storm the ship was driven ashore.  The passengers were rescued and returned to London.  Six weeks later he again sailed, this time on the Trevillion.  He stayed briefly in Adelaide before going to Mt Gambier where he was employed by Charles Aubrey, general storekeeper.  After about 3½ years he came to Burra where he worked for several years for Young & Drew before buying the ironmongery business of T. Builder, which he conducted till about two years ago.  He was active in civic and church life and was a prime mover in the establishment of the Burra Institute* and was a committee member until recently.
