Burra Pony Club.  The new round-yard was opened by Mavis Spackman at the clubâ€™s Christmas wind-up.  Also unveiled was a memorial plaque for Colleen Spackman, donated by members of the former Burra Bootscooters.  Colleen was instrumental in the decision to donate money from that group to the Burra Pony Club, thus enabling the purchase of materials and the erection of the round-yard.  [5 photos.]
