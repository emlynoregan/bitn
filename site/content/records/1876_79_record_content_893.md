Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter III.  Appearances Past and Present.

Bushmen are to be found who can tell how a certain shepherd who lived in a hut on the Mine Hill was struck with the peculiar brown metallic stones with which his hut’s chimney was built.  He took samples of the stone to Adelaide and this led to an inspection in which the hut’s chimney was almost entirely carted away as malleable copper by a company being formed, which brought miners into the locality.  These soon housed themselves in dugouts in the creek bank, excavating good-sized dwelling rooms and sank well-like holes into the upper surfaces to form chimneys.  The door entrances were towards the creek, then with a forest of gums and mallee along its banks.  These cosy dwellings were ruined by a storm which swept their primitive furniture down the rushing creek.  (Fair remains of a few rooms are yet to be seen in the banks east of the Baptist chapel.)  By this time the forest was much thinned for firewood and fair building stone had been discovered.

The company and miners erected substantial houses on 21 year leases.  An abundance of copper ran the £5 shares up to more than £100 each.  In time expensive machinery was needed to keep the water down in the mine, but the profits justified the expense and the town grew to good proportions.

In laying out the township the company’s directors determined that only one hotel and two inns should be upon their property: viz. the Burra Hotel, the Miners’ Arms and the Pig and Whistle.

The hotel was well-planned, but in building insufficient attention was given to keep the storm waters coming down the hill from running into the cellars.  These filled with water, which damaged the walls and led to the building of unsightly abutments to keep them up, which in turn provoked Governor Ferguson’s expression that ‘it looked like a prison’.  Its unsightliness is increased by its approach ‘at present, a disordered boulder-stone surfaced sideling.’  No attempt has been made to improve it.

‘Having formerly driven my buggy and pair to the front of Burra’s – then only stately edifice – to alight therefrom upon either of the two grand flights of steps, (i.e. with untrimmed and otherwise roughly bedded slate steps), to gain the superb promenade (also paved with rough, untrimmed slates, with jagged edges which, without careful treading, fling one down), where wealthy persons were in conversation, some leaning against the magnificent pillars (roughly squared and planed common wood, with the edges taken off, which support the equally primitive verandah, gaping for paint.)  Others reclining upon the accurately carved and polished rails (i.e. names &c., carved with penknives, and polished by lolling elbows), perhaps awaiting the summons of the ponderous-sounding dinner-bell preparatory to the demand for the many half-crowns for the really sumptuous ordinary.’

The position has become rather remote since the opening of the railway.

The cellars are very large scale and worth inspection.

One wonders how the large room has not tumbled ‘for even as long ago as ten years, the floors were rewedged up upon deals endwise, and notwithstanding this, new keepers were never deterred from undertaking the risk of the thumping from large audiences on the frail flooring.’

I believe the hotel consists of about forty rooms in all.

The two inns have also provided well for their keepers.

As far as housing ‘the township could boast of nothing better in appearance than labourers’ common cottages for private dwellings until the last two or three years, which gave the stranger, at entrance, the common idea of poverty, nothing more delusive can be conceived, for within are furniture, pictures and articles of virtu, the  owners of which can afford, and have spent to the tune of twenty pounds sterling weekly upon their families, although the outer appearance and construction of the dwellings would fail to give the stranger an idea of the interior other than a three-legged chair, and broken crockery to match.  Most of the dwellings are in no better state at the present time, and the exceptions so few that the stranger fails to distinguish anything different at first sight.

Herein is a peculiarity, the likes of which is never met with elsewhere; and stranger still, the inhabitants have become so familiar to the poverty of exterior by old association of memory, that like labourers when taking possession of recently-ruined castles, they think themselves very grand, and expect strangers to imbibe the like notions, which would certainly be another peculiarity if adopted.’
