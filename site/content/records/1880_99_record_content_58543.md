Appeal Court.  Another aspect of the Appeal came to light when the Overseer put in a claim for 3/- pay for the afternoon he attended the Appeal Court on his own case.  Apparently he was authorised by Cr Hardy.

‘Who gave Cr Hardy the authority to make a “weapon” of the overseer, and also would the latter have attended the Court of Appeal if he had thought or knew that he would lose half a day?’
