The untiring efforts of Father Kriessel reduced it to £1,004 by 1880.

Then the erection of the school and convent in 1887 [sic, but see above 1881?] and in 1885 the presbytery saw it rise to £2,430 by 1886.

The debt then grew until by in 1890 it was £2,882.

Since then the debt has been reduced by £876 and on 30 September, a month prior to Rev. Father Redden taking charge, it stood at £2,006.

But in the last four years it has crept up again and on 30 September 1905 it was £2,230.

Rates, taxes and insurance premiums are c. £150 p.a. and sundry expenses such as repairs and lighting etc. cost c. £25 p.a.

The bazaar raised over £100.
