Goyder Council at its meeting on 17 July decided to raise rate revenue by $2,951,000 to a total operating revenue budget of $7,932,315.

[This cannot be correct: to increase by almost $3 million in a budget of $8 million is not believable.  Could this have been an increase of rate revenue to $2.9 million out of a total budget of $7.9 million?]

There will be a fixed charge $225 for 2,836 rateable properties.  The CWMS charge for Burra will be $260 per property unit on occupied rateable land and $195 on vacant land. Property on the Upper Thames St and Welsh Place extension of 2005 will incur a service charge of $410 per property unit.
