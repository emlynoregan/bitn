Obituary.  Tony Ryan OAM has died.  He was very well known Australia wide in the shearing industry.  When he was awarded a place in the Shearersâ€™ Hall of Fame in Hay, NSW, students from the Burra Community School, led by teacher Roger Boehm, created a special sculpture to recognise the event and Roger took it to Hay in time for his induction.  [Anthony Joseph Ryan born 8 November 1923 Kooringa.]
