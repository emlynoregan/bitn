Letter on a call to invite tenders for a waterworks engine driver who should be obtainable in these depressed times for £2 a week when the Council is said to be paying £3 a week.  Labourers are now getting only 4/- to 6/- a day.  [i.e. £1-4-0 to £1-16-0 a week.]  Make the saving and allow the water rates charges to be dropped.
