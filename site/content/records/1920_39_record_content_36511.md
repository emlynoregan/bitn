Fire.  On Thursday afternoon fire broke out in Alan Drew’s wheat paddock at ‘Beridga’ Leighton.  About 400 cars responded and the fire was extinguished, but with the loss of 200 acres of crop, 500 acres of feed and 600 bags of wheat, though it is thought much of the wheat from the burnt bags is recoverable.  Messrs John Drew Jnr and Max Jacka share in the loss as they are on halves with Mr A. Drew.  The source of the fire is believed to be the fusing of a wire on a lorry.  A fire also burnt an area of grass in Burra Creek just below Wright’s Motor Garage on Saturday morning.
