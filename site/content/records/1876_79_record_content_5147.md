Crops. Harvest prospects are looking better after recent rain, but some parts of the Eastern Plains in Bright and Baldina are past recovery. Though there is some good wheat at Mongolata over 4’ high and in good ear, the rabbits and kangaroos are playing such havoc in many places that the only safe plan will be to cut it for hay, especially as the shortness of most crops is likely to make hay prices higher this year.
