The Smelts Walk was opened by Professor Geoffrey Blainey on Saturday 9 December.  Many of the ruins of smeltermen’s cottages, chimneys and the smelthouse were uncovered in a recent archaeological survey.  The walk shows how ore was brought from the charge yards to be mixed with the flux and loaded into the furnaces.  The walk also takes you through the stages of the smelting process.  [Photo.]
