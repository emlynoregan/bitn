Eastern Road: Midland Road Board refused money to rebuild the Kooringa Bridge because of its `not being on a main line of road.' The council also had more discussion on the NW Bend road. The Council decided to appeal to the Commissioner of Public Works for funds for a Kooringa Bridge.

Footpaths: Cr. Roberts drew attention to the virtual complete lack of footpaths in the town and especially to the poor approaches to places of worship.
