Adelaide to Darwin 1908

Photo of the Talbot car that was the first motor vehicle to cross Australia from south to north in 1908.  An attempt in 1907 had been thwarted by the wet season in the top end.  The 1908 Talbot accomplished the journey in 51 days – 42 days of actual driving.  Although still in working order, the Talbot will make most of its 2008 journey on the back of a truck.
