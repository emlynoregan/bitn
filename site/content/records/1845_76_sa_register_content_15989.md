Kooringa News, 15 October

Wool carting has commenced with several loads having already passed through the township.

A small quantity of wood, logs and slabs is being carted to the mine.

The Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel celebrated its Anniversary last Sunday and on Monday Rev. J. Read one of their ministers delivered an address on Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress.

Accident.  On Monday a little son of Mr J. Edwards, butcher, was thrown or fell from his horse and sustained a severe fracture of his collar-bone, but is said to be making good progress.

Accident.  Today Mr Whitford, a hawker, has been brought in by Mr Edwards, the butcher, with a very badly broken shin bone.  Apparently he was driving his cart on the road towards Crossroads when the reins slipped from his hand and the horse bolted.  He jumped down in an attempt to catch the horses’ heads, but fell and fractured the bone just above the ankle.  The bone punctured the skin and made an awful wound.
