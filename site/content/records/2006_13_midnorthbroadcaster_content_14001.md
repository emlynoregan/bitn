Burra Ward Citizen of the Year is Lorraine Stevens who has devoted many years to helping others through a variety of committees and organisations.

Rhiannon Phillips was the Young Citizen of the Year.  She has contributed in the SA Ambulance and sporting areas.  The Event of the Year Award went to the BBH Football & Netball Clubs for their hosting of the North Eastern Grand Final last September, which saw more than 4,000 people descend on the town and raised about $15,000.
