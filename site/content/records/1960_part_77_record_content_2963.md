Burra Town Council, 4 July

Advertisement to be placed in the paper advising that fortnightly rubbish collection will commence on Monday 18 July.  [An advertisement on page 2 of this issue carried the necessary information.]

It was resolved that the Mayor’s allowance for the year be £100.  (Unchanged.)

The contribution of the Council to the Burra Hospital will be £410; the same as the previous year.

Council resolved to enforce the by-law concerning dogs and to employ a dog-catcher if the nuisance does not abate.

It was resolved that the previous assessment be adopted for the current year with the necessary adjustments.

Councillors will inspect the Mine site and select a suitable place for a new town dump.
