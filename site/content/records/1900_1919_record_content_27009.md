Obituary.  Rev. Father Redden died on Wednesday last aged 38 at the residence of his parents at Pekina.  His first mission had been at Burra, where he had been very popular both in connection with his duties and in general social life.  He took an active part in athletic sports.  He was a patron and supporter of the local football clubs.  For a time he was president of the Burra Association.  About six years ago he left on an extended trip abroad in a search for health, but on his return developed consumption.  [James Patrick Redden died 1 June 1910 at Pekina, residence Kooringa aged 40.]
