Mineral Discoveries

A public meeting ahas been called at Kooringa for next Saturday afternoon to consider alternatives to the present system of land purchase for Mineral Lands.

The discovery of gold in neighbouring colonies has sharpened interest in the issue, with the hope of a change before similar discoveries are made in SA.  With the threat of a drainage of our labouring classes and the setting in of a pernicious gold fever, how much better it would be if there were a scattering of mines up and down the length of the colony. Under the present system in SA any discoveries are not revealed because people have no guarantee of securing for themselves either the land or an adequate remuneration for their secret.
