Douglas Alexander Burra Heritage Advisor completes four years with the Burra Burra DC in June 1991.  Recently the role was simplified when the Minister delegated her authority for the purpose of giving advice, to the local Heritage Advisor.  This simplified the consideration of an application, which previously had to be determined in Adelaide.  The function of a Heritage Advisory Committee to meet every second month is also an improvement.  The Heritage Advisory Service is jointly funded by a National Estate Grant and the Burra Burra DC.
