Cpl A.T. Winders MM (with bar), the last Burra boy to return to the town, who has been in the Military Hospital at Bedford Park for two years has now been transferred at his request to the Burra Hospital.

[Since his obituary says he returned to Australia in April 1919 the ‘two years’ is something of an exaggeration.]
