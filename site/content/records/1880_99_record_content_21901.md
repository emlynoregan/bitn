Police evidence from M-C Williams adds details of the accident scene.  Williams believed the deceased to be a Swede aged c. 60, unmarried and a heavy drinker.

William Midwinter gave evidence that Jacob Jansen had stayed at his hotel from 19 to 22 March and had left with a quiet horse in the company of a German who was sober.  Jansen had had no more than a few glasses before he left.  [Registration of death gives the date as 30 March and his age as 60.]

The jury found that death was due to the horse bolting while going down hill and no blame attaches to anyone.
