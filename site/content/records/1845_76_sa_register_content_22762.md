Dr Berncastle.  [Another item deals with this much publicised practitioner who claimed to be an eminent oculist and aurist.  The paper says it is yet to find a single well verified case in which he effected a cure, but reports on some very bad outcomes.  The Doctor had eventually fled back to Victoria.
