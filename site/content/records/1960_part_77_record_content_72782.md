Burra Burra Hospital Board

Cr R.B. Jennison has retired after 16 years service to the Board and Mr L.A. Beinke was appointed in his place.  Chairman R.K. Pearce delivered the 97th Annual Report.  This year had been very successful financially.  Reserves had been built up sufficiently to enable the alterations to the hospital to be made without a public appeal.  They cost $253,926 of which $169,225 was Government subsidy.  Expenses have been controlled.  Wages have risen $18,787 and a corresponding increase in fees of $50,716.  It is likely wages in the coming year will be $150,000.  The average bed cost rose $1.11 to $17.40, but we still showed a surplus of $26,617 and there is a credit balance in all accounts of $30,000 on deposit.  The building program for now is complete.  We have a new Maternity Wing including an Emergency Labour Ward, store rooms, Children’s Ward and kitchen and this brings the hospital to a high standard.  The laundry and incinerator rooms have been modernised.  Nearly all the rooms and passageways are now air conditioned and the other parts of the hospital and the Matron’s and Secretary’s residences have been renovated and painted.  Gardens and Lawns have been re-sown.  In the next year we will bituminise the car park and erect a car park for nursing staff.  The Secretary’s residence will be renovated inside.  This will only leave the painting of the old private rooms and wards to be done.  A new X-ray plant has been purchased for $4,600.  Daily occupancy is 24 and 33 babies were born.  The Hospital Auxiliary continues its important support.  The Burra 7 District Fund Raising Committee this year donated $1,000.  Matron Phillips has been quietly efficient.  Sister Good has been an able Tutor Sister.  The Meals On Wheels continues to carry on with great success.

[Mr Pearce concludes with the usual widespread acknowledgements of support and gives special mention and thanks to retiring Board member Mr R.B. Jennison.
