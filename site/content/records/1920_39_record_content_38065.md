Mongolata Goldfield

Those on Terryâ€™s claim seem quite satisfied to date.  It is now down c. 40ft.  They expect to send another 4-5 tons of ore to the cyanide works at Peterborough within a few days and expect at least 4-5 oz to the ton.  Unfortunately the vein is still very narrow.

Messrs Clark & Rampton are also getting excellent ore from a narrow leader and soon expect to have a similar amount ready.
