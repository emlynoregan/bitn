Last Wednesday an extra piece of pipe was successfully added to that already in the well at the Waterworks by the engineer, Mr Lapidge.  When the engine was started it was found not to be drawing much water.  It was then discovered that the plate to which the new pipe had been attached was cracked and the extra leverage had caused it to break.  The Waterworks Committee met and it was worked out how to carry on with one set of pumps instead of two.  The town was without water from Wednesday till midday Sunday.  The engineer worked in the well at some risk for 48 hours without a break and on Sunday again raised the column in the well high enough to allow the removal of the broken piece and make it ready to receive the new plate which had to come from Adelaide. Water for the town had to be carted from wells.  The Market Square well proved equal to the task and water from there was taken to the Reformatory and the Hospital.  A printed notice on Saturday afternoon announced that a limited supply for domestic purposes was being restored.  The lack of water prevented the early extinguishing of the fire at the Hospital.
