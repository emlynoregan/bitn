Adelaide Share Market

On Saturday the price of Burra Burra shares was £120, but the price has been so uncertain this week that tomorrow at noon two lots of five and six shares each will be auctioned, evidently to ascertain their full value for parties interested in ascertaining that.

There are prophecies that they will fetch £100 and even parties who predict a price of £50.  As we know a number of parties quite willing to buy at £100, we do not apprehend a drop to such an absurd price.  Even if the dividends were reduced to one half, the yield at a price of £160 would be 12½%.

About 40 Burra shares have changes hands at £110 since our last and today the price asked is £130.

The list of mining share prices quotes:

Burra Burra £5 shares at £128

Princess Royal £50 shares paid to £37 at £40.
