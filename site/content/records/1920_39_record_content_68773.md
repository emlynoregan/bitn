Salvation Army.  The Congress Hall SA Silver Band was welcomed on Saturday at a tea attended by the Mayor Mr S. Kellaway.  Afterwards they played in the main street and then gave a fine program in the Army Hall.  On Sunday at 9.45 they played for the Burra Hospital and at 11 a.m. at a service in the Salvation Army Hall.  At 2.15 they laid a wreath at the War Memorial and gave a musical afternoon at Mt Bryan.  A Salvation Meeting was held in the Burra Institute at 7 pm.  The visit raised Â£20 for the local corps.
