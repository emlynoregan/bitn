‘W’ writes re the naming of new hundreds.

In the next few months a large number of new hundreds will be proclaimed.  I would urge that where the district has ‘some euphonious native name’ that it be retained by the hundred rather than name it ‘say Figg, or the name of some other ex-Hindley-street magnate’.  

[He makes an exception for Goyder – saying that he fully merits being remembered in that way.  He develops his points at some length.]
