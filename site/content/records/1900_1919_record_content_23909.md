Aberdeen Sports Ground.  The new grounds mark a new era in sport for Burra.  Four years ago cycling was killed off by ‘crook riding’.  [i.e. fixed races]  Now a fresh start has been made.  Despite the bad weather the recent meeting of the Burra Cycle and Athletic Club was a great success.  The club ended the meet with a credit balance of £23-2-9.
