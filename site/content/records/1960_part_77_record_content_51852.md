The District Council and Housing Trust met last week with the result that a number of houses are due to be built in Burra.  The District Clerk Mr Perry said the move follows requests from Samin Ltd and the Council.  The Company expects to employ up to 60 men and some of them will require homes in Burra.  The Housing trust has bought several parcels of land in the town, of which the most important is that which fronts Smelts Road and Paxton Terrace, formerly owned by Mr M. Pritchard.  This will be sub-divided for 32 homes.  It is expected construction will begin in July and the first allotment will possibly be for 12 houses.  Investigations are under way to see if an effluent scheme will be necessary.  Road works will also be required.  A plan of this subdivision is available at the Council office.  It is expected the open cut will soon be fenced to ensure safe operation.
