Editorial on Municipal Matters

Writing before the Ratepayers’ Meeting begins, we cannot predict the outcome of a meeting to consider appointing an Inspector for the rest of the year at £110 p.a.  We do not believe this is a time for appointing more men or paying more money than is absolutely necessary.  If by appointing the curator of the cemetery or the dayman as Acting-Inspectors for the rest of the year and money can be saved, then save it.  There is no doubt this could be done.  The present Acting-Inspector, against whom we have nothing to say, is appointed pending a permanent appointment and so all delay in deciding reduces the money to be saved.  Surely the Mayor will see that on the death of the late Inspector the Council was freed from any legal or moral obligation and is still free.  There are only three operative minutes on this topic.

That applications be invited for an Inspector at £110 p.a.

On 18 January the application of Mr Dow was accepted.

July 1886 New applications to be sought to fill the vacancy.

None of these need to be rescinded.  No application has to be accepted and the last of the minutes ceased to have further effect on the applications coming in.  There is no now no minute that sets the salary for the year 1886 at £110.  The situation allows the Council to work for the rest of 1886 with one officer less and a small sum of not more than £1 a week will suffice for the Inspector’s work.
