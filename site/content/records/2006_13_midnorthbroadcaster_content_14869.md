The Pine Creek Bridge on the Barrier Highway was reopened to all traffic on Saturday after repairs.  Crews had been working on it from March following flood damage.  A temporary road was constructed while repairs were undertaken.   The bridge is about 6 km from the NSW border.  24 piles each 15 metres long were driven through the existing bridge to reinforce the structure.  The waterway was lined to protect the bridge from further erosion.
