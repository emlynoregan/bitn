Burra Town Council, 20 September

The Government main road grant this year will be £200 with the Council to contribute £65.

The wall around Victoria Park is to be repaired and shrubs are to be planted.

Complaints were received about the bridge being used by cyclists.  Rails are to be placed to force riders to dismount and anyone riding is to be prosecuted.  A letter notifying this is being sent to the head teachers of the schools.  [The context suggests the bridge was the Kooringa swing bridge.]

The Smelts Bridge is to be repaired.

Cr Carpenter said there were problems with stray cattle, to which Cr Harvey added sheep.

There was no pound at present that could hold sheep and pig wire was unprocurable at present.
