North Eastern Football League held its AGM at Booborowie 12 March.

There will be ‘A’ and ‘B’ teams from Booborowie, Burra, Hallett and Spalding

The President Mr J.T. Jenner reported on 1961.

There were four teams in ‘A’ Grade and 3 Colts.  (Hallett was unable to field a Colts team.)

Aberdeen Club was re-formed and applied to join, but was refused and had a successful year as part of the Mid-North Association.  Leighton Club, after being part of the North Eastern Association in 1960, went into recess in 1961, having lost players to Aberdeen.

[He then went on to report on inter-association matters and finals.]

Congratulations to Keith Warrior for his 1961 Mail Medal – his 5th over several years and to John Dewhirst for the Burra Record Trophy and to John Brooks as leading goal-kicker for the season.

He reported that the association was in a sound financial position.
