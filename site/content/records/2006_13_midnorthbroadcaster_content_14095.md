Cameron Garnsworthy, Senior Managers Renewables Development, TRUenergy, writes to complain that the large majority of wind farm supporters are being misinformed by a select few.  He says they are cost effective and reliable.  They provide local jobs and conform to strict noise guidelines.  Independent tests show that at wind speeds up to 40 km per hour the sound at 1 km distance is below 40 decibels.  If this level was a problem we would have to discard our refrigerators.  For those concerned with facts TRUenergy has made a considerable amount of information available on its website.  This includes all plans, noise assessments, visual diagrams and independent studies required for our proposed wind farm at Stony Gap.  We have held an information day at Burra and we are the first wind farm operator in the Mid North to establish a Community Liaison Group.
