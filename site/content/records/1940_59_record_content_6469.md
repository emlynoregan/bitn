Obituary.  Mr Horace Hill of Burra died on 3 July from pneumonia.  He was born at Kooringa on 11 August 1894, the fourth son of Mrs and the late Richard Hill, of Quarry Street, Kooringa.  He spent all his life in the town except for his long service in the 1914-18 war, enlisting at the age of 21 in 1915 in the 9th Light Horse.  When the war ended he did not return immediately, being attached to the Company compiling War Records as a transport driver.  His long sojourn in Palestine affected his health to a certain extent.  On his return he worked for a time on the Cable Service at the Post Office and later as Dr Steeleâ€™s chauffeur.  In 1924 he started his own business as a general carrier, which he carried on successfully until his death.  In his younger days he was a keen athlete and later a supporter of all sport and acted as a judge and handicapper.  He was a prominent member and committeeman of the local RSL sub-branch and was for many years a member of the local Fire brigade and also a staunch supporter of the Buffalo Lodge as well as being a member of the Foresters Lodge.  He was a regular supporter of charitable appeals and of activities for children.  He married Miss Myrtle Allen, eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs John Allen of Kooringa, who survives.  There are three children; Misses Melva & Barbara Hill and young Robert.  He is also survived by his mother, sister Mrs J. Quinn of Prospect and brothers, Ben Hill of Burra and Charles Hill of Pt Pirie.  Two brothers Privates George and Sam Hill died in the Great War.  A semi-military funeral was held last Friday, attended by many returned men and members of the Foresters and Buffalo Lodges.  [Further details of the funeral follow.]
