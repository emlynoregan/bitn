Obituary.  [Reprinted from the Register.]

A.J. McBride passed away at Middelburg, Cape Colony on 4 February.  They had arrived at Durban on 31 December, spent four days there before going to Pretoria where Mr  McBride waited upon Gen. Kemp the Minister for Agriculture, at the Union Buildings, in a conversation on wool production, marketing etc. lasting three hours and visits to farms upon the Karoo were arranged and this led to the visit to Middelburg.  The party then went to Mafeking, Bulawayo & Victoria Falls and then back to Bulawayo.  A week was spent in Johannesburg where Mr McBride met many notable people.  Then they went to Middelburg in Cape Province to a typical Karoo sheep farm and to the chief Agricultural College at Grootfontein.  A day later Mr McBride caught a chill and influenza and then pneumonia followed and his heart failed on 4 February.  On the following day a temporary interment took place.  The rest of the party then drove to De Aar and took the train to Cape Town for the Ceramic and home.
