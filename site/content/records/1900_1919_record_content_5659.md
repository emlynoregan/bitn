Redruth Methodist Jubilee will begin to be celebrated on 16 June and will be attended by the President and Secretary of the Conference and will embrace the opening of Jubilee Hall, a convention for deepening spiritual life, a banquet, a tea and historic and platform meetings.

The hymns being learnt for the occasion by the choir, led by Mr N.J. Tiddy, are:

All people that on earth do dwell.

Blow ye the trumpet, blow.

The Churchâ€™s one foundation.

How charming is the place.

For the beauty of the earth.

Jesu, lover of my soul.

Was there ever kindest shepherd

Onward Christian soldiers.

Rejoice the Lord is King.
