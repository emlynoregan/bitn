Burra Hospital Board Meeting of 20 November

Summonses are to be issued to recover between £400 and £500 from unpaid accounts.

General Grant for the coming year is to be £1,500 and a special grant on a £ for £ basis up to £1,000 for building an isolation block.  The Board had £700 in hand.

It was resolved to proceed and the present ward is to be disposed of.

Incorporation of the hospital was discussed.

One complication was that the Town Council holds the fee simple for the land on which the original buildings stood and the Government owns the land on which the Maternity Ward stands.  The Chief Secretary is to be consulted.
