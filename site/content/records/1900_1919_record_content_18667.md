Weather.  A heatwave set in last week.  On Friday, Saturday & Sunday the temperature reached 94Â°F before 10 a.m.  Flower gardens were destroyed and birds sought refuge in houses.  Others fell dead from trees.  A number of valuable fowls also succumbed.  Monday was cloudy and somewhat cooler, but very sultry with a cool change in the evening and a few points of rain.
