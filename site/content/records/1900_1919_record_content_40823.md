Redruth Police Court, 26 February.

Percy Clark was charged with unlawfully assaulting M-C Horace Queale and in turn charged M-C Queale with assaulting him.  Queale said he had entered the Commercial Hotel at 11 p.m. on 30 January and asked 7 or 8 men to leave.  They did so and then Clark abused him and told him to get out of his hotel and then struck him a blow on his lip, cutting it.  Clark seemed the worse for drink and threatened to fight him in the yard as well.

Queale said he was on duty at the picture carnival till 10.45 p.m.  He had then had two glasses of beer at Clark’s and then stood on Dalgety’s Corner till 11 p.m. before returning to Clark’s.  W.H. Stevenson, who was one of those in the parlour who was asked to leave, gave evidence supporting Queale’s account.

Percy w. Clark, hotel manager, claimed he had warned the men in the parlour to leave and had told them not to ride bicycles without lights as the John Hops were about. [The others had denied this.]  He claimed to be sober.  He said that Queale, on coming out of the parlour had shaken his cane at him and he had grabbed it and a wrestle had followed.  He denied hitting him with a fist. All witnesses were mistaken about his condition and he did not offer to fight Queale.
