Telstra says mobile phone coverage in Burra should come in three to four weeks (or a bit longer).  An easement for power to the tower site has just been approved.  Reports from heritage authorities are said to be in favour of construction of the tower.  Eudunda’s problems with its tower are said to be capable of being solved by some ‘fine tuning’ – there were reports it could not be used in the main street, only 2 km from the tower!
