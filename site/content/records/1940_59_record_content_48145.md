Fire.  A 70-ton haystack of P.N. Collins at Booborowie was destroyed by fire last Sunday morning.  Fire fighters managed to prevent the fire from spreading.  It was about 50 yards from the Spalding Road and some 7Â½ miles southwest of the Booborowie Township.  The fire seems to have stared near the road and spread to the stack.
