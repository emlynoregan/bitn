Burra Town Council, 23 January

C.H. Cummings of Chapel St complains of damage to his property from the roots of suckers from cork elm trees.  Woods & Forests Dept. advice will be sought.

Burra Burra DC requests a fire break be ploughed around the rubbish dump behind Victoria Park.  The DC will be advised that the ground cannot practically be ploughed and burning off has been tried unsuccessfully.  Owners of nearby property will be asked to plough or skim and Mr Pritchardâ€™s permission will be sought to burn a break on his property adjoining.

The cemetery is to be cleaned up and the gates painted.

The Highways Dept. will be asked for permission to use the quarry for road building stone and the ownership and leasing are to be ascertained.
