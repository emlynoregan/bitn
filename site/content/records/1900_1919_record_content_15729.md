Petherton Estate is to be offered for sale, but the costs imposed appear to be such that no one will be able to make a living from it.  It will be two years before a crop can be reaped and before that a hefty interest payment will fall due.  To meet it the crop will have to be 12 to 13 bushels per acre and at present much of the adjoining land is yielding only 7 or 8 bushels per acre.
