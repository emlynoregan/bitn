Advt.  There is an elaborate four side advertising supplement with photographs and articles promoting the visit of ‘The Kilties’ Canada’s Greatest Concert Band.  They would play at the Burra Institute for a matinee and evening performance on 17 May.  The size seems to have been somewhat larger than A4.
