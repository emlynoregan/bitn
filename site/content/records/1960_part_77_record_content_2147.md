A Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Town Hall last Tuesday night.  Thirty-one people attended to hear the report of the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone. [They are listed.]

Mr Baulderstone expressed his disgust at the attempt by some to arrange the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils.  He said he would oppose this because he did not wish to see the townspeople give away what their ancestors had fought for.  The Town Council gets much abuse about its roads, but Burra is scattered along miles of road, many of them with low rated properties.  The roads are not any worse than in other towns of comparable size, though some footpaths are not as good as they should be.  The town also has quite a number of bridges to maintain and many of them are old.

They had received quite a lot of criticism regarding the main [foot] bridge, which is now almost completed.  They had made mistakes there, but they had been rectified.

The Council has been criticised for removing street trees in some places, but they had planted many in the past five or six years.  Many old trees were unsuitable or were planted in the watertables.  I am confident that for every tree removed twenty or thirty have been planted.

Jubilee Avenue.  The row of trees planted along the creek side of the Burra North Road provides a golden opportunity for beautifying the town and providing a good caravan park area.

The War Memorial Oval is mainly controlled by its committee and they have achieved quite a lot with little public support.  A turf oval would be something to be proud of and I think should be more the responsibility of the Football Club.

The first public meeting in 1956 called for a swimming pool and by 1959 the Education Department was using the pool for its ‘Learn to Swim Campaign’.  I congratulate those few who went ahead with action and not just words.

When the Council decided to raise a loan to buy the Mine area we didn’t receive any objections.  It will cost the ratepayers little, with grazing rights offsetting much of the cost.  The area can also be controlled for rubbish dumping and road metal is available there where previously the Council had to pay a royalty for it.  In addition old mining relics can be preserved and the area developed as a tourist attraction.

With ETSA having taken over the electricity supply, there are more and brighter street lights.

Naming the streets is another idea and with gradual placement of the signs it would cost little.

The cemetery is proving a problem.  It covers a large area and finance is very limited.

Burra is getting a fair share of new buildings and the main street compares most favourably.

The Fire Station has been leased to the Fire Brigade Board for £10 p.a. for ten years with the right of renewal and the Board is now responsible for repairs and improvements, such as those being carried out at present.

The Town Hall had been allowed to get into a bad state of repair.  Until about ten years ago the hall was costing the taxpayers money.  It was then decided to operate the pictures for the benefit of the hall.  Money was borrowed to set this up and now the income has allowed the hall to prosper.  £6,000 has been borrowed for the new supper room, but it is all being paid for by the pictures.

Most of the health budget goes on scavenging.  In recent years this seems to have slipped somewhat.  I would like to see a regular fortnightly collection.  This would mean each ratepayer paying £1 p.a. for the service.

Septic tank systems will have to be mandatory within a few years.

There is now an urgent need to do something about getting a town ambulance.
