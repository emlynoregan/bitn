Infantile Paralysis at Burra [Polio]

The Advertiser on 7 February reported that a young man from Burra was admitted to Northfield Hospital with infantile paralysis.  Apparently he came to Burra last Thursday with a travelling circus and the same day was admitted to Burra Hospital and was diagnosed on Saturday and removed to Northfield on Sunday.  He has no other connection with Burra.

Local Board of Health met on Saturday 5 February and decided that all Sunday schools and public schools would be closed till 1 March.  These restrictions will also apply to Girl Guides, Brownies etc.
