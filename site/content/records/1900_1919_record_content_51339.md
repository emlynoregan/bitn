History of the Burra Burra Mine, by James Thomas Snr, No. 7.

In the early years of the colony the Sa Colonization Assoc. got a grant of the colony to sell at not less than 12/- per acre with the revenue so obtained going to an emigration fund.  Control of the company’s affairs vested in a body of commissioners and a Governor nominated by the Crown.  In 1838 Governor Hindmarsh was recalled after acrimonious dissension between the Governor and Commissioner over the allocation of choice blocks in Adelaide.  Colonel Gawler took his place and was also Resident Commissioner.  He had a scheme of public works which was not approved and he too was recalled to be replaced by Governor Grey who had a policy of retrenchment.  Eventually a constitution for self-government was framed in 1856 and an election of members took place in 1857.  Voting in Burra took place in the original Burra Hotel.  Voting then was open, with no secret ballot.  The candidates were G.S. Kingston and Henry Mildred.  Beer flowed freely and men shouted for either candidate and waved green or blue ribbons.  Members did little for Burra for many years.  By this time two or three fairly good schools had opened.  Rev. Ibbetson, the Anglican minister was a chief mover in getting the Institute built and in securing a library.

[Thomas then goes on to talk of SA history generally and of the colony’s acquisition of the Northern Territory, rather than of matters of local concern.]
