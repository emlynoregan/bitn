Thomas Tapley, landlord of the ‘Emu Springs’ gave evidence essentially confirming the above and said he and another man had gone out and collected Ryan after Bridget Lynch had reported him lying insensible.  Ryan had been ‘rather intoxicated’ when he left the hotel.

Jones deposed that he had been at the hotel, had left, and returned because he had broken a bottle of grog and came back to get another.  The road to his house was in a different direction from Ryan’s and he did not know anything about the robbery.

Jones was committed for trial.
