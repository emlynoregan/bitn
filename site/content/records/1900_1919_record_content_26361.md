Obituary.  Mr Isaac McNeil, son-in-law of Mr E. Cock of Ayers Forest, met with a fatal accident on 5 March at Redhill.  The horse in a spring dray would not start and he got down to induce it to move.  In getting back onto the dray his foot slipped on the wet step and he fell in front of the vehicle which then passed over the lower part of his body.  Although medical assistance was to hand he died in less than 40 minutes.  He was married to the only daughter of Mr & Mrs Cock about 2Â½ years ago.

[Born Isaac McNeil 31 December 1878 at Bundaleer: died Isaac McNeill 5 March 1910 at Redhill.]
