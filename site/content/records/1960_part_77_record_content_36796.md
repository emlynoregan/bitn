Burra Hospital.  A start will soon be made on Phase 3 of the building plan and the Board is this week launching an appeal for funds.  In this phase a new operating theatre and facilities, casualty room and domestic quarters will replace the old theatre block and old hotel section of the building.  The Government has approved the plan and will, as in the past, offer a subsidy on a two for one basis and donations are tax deductible.  The approximate cost of the alterations will be $100,000.  Funds already held by the Hospital are insufficient to enable completion so an appeal is being made for $25,000.  Donations are acknowledged for $2,117.
