Bible Christian Church Demolition.

The Lieut. Governor Sir Samuel Way writes to the Record concerning the demolition and photos of the Bible Christian Church.  He says the architect, Mr Cole, always insisted on very heavy roofs for Gothic buildings.  He asked for a set of photos.  Rev. Thomas Flood has asked for a set too.

Burra Band.  At a meeting at the Institute on Friday night additional seating had to be brought in and still proved insufficient at the meeting to form a band.  It is estimated that £177 is needed to buy instruments.

Burra Music & Dramatic Club.  The half-yearly meeting on Tuesday showed them in credit £14-0-11.  President W.B. Page and Sec. P. Milner.

Fire.  Two lads, smoking as they walked across a paddock of J.A. Riggs in Kooringa on Sunday, set it on fire.  It was fortunately extinguished with the loss of about 1 acre of grass.

Burra Automobile Club had a run to Morgan on Saturday, returning Monday.  They left Burra at 8.30 a.m., got to ‘The Gums’ at 10 o’clock for refreshments with Mr & Mrs T.H. Pearse, and reached Morgan a little after noon.  The afternoon saw cricket and rifle shooting and the club gave an evening concert in aid of the Morgan Institute.  On Sunday they went on the S.S. Federal to the New Era Co.’s vineyards and fruit drying works.  8 cars took part.
