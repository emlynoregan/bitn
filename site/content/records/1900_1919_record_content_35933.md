Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary public tea meeting was held on Monday.  Rev. J.H. Nield said that so far the amount promised for the new church was £993-15-9.  The sale of the old Bible Christian manse raised £717-10-0 and the fete raised £154-2-8.  Of the promises so far £366-18-3 had actually been paid and of the remaining £635, some £600 of it was promised by just six persons.  Tenders for the new church have been called.

Rev. Burgess had been invited to conduct farewell services, but was prevented by age.  Rev. W.G. Clarke has now been asked.  Rev. Howard, President of Conference, would come to lay the foundation stone.  He reported losses to the congregation by the removal of residents, particularly from the east of the circuit.  Last Sunday at World’s End the congregation was 5 and at Douglas the other day it was 13.  Baldina congregations had also declined.  Everything was being concentrated upon Kooringa and the outside churches grew worse as the years went by.  Mr Bailey had helped in the circuit till he went to the college.  Mr Nelson had replaced him for six months, but would soon retire.
