SA Ambulance Recruitment Drive

Gail Edwards profile.

We returned from travelling around Australia to live in Burra 9 years ago with two teenage children.  I knew my greatest commitment was to the church, but also wanted to give something to the community and so responded to a call to join the Ambulance Service with some trepidation.  After training I felt terror at my first call-out â€“ as it happened there was one at 7.30 a.m., another at 9.30 a.m. (a trip to Adelaide) and a third at 4 p.m.  At present my time is divided between the Ambulance Service and my role as First Aid Instructor with St John.  At times it has been difficult to give as much as I would have liked, but I have never been disappointed with the decision I made to join.
