Review of the late Criminal Sittings

[After a list of the cases and some statistics of the types of offences before the court, the editor makes some comments on the sentencing of His honour Judge Cooper.  The editor has no complaints about the judge’s decisions except in the case of Keirnall.  He considers that Keirnall, though convicted of manslaughter, was virtually guilty of murder and ‘as a question of morals the man was an undoubted and brutal assassin.  He contrasts Keirnall’s seven years transportation with the ten years awarded to another German youth called Disseldorf, ‘a mild tempered, talented, but foolish young man, who wickedly stole two horses, which were recovered by the owners, and who confessed his offence by pleading guilty.’  Surely Keirnall’s offence called for a more severe punishment than that inflicted on Disseldorf.]
