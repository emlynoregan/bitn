Burra Burra Hospital

The Building Materials Office has refused building permits for the new Nurses’ Quarters.  This is very disappointing as the existing facilities are ramshackle and the Board has raised nearly enough money to meet the cost of additions to the hospital.  It is also odd because buildings to house nurses are being erected at the RAH.  The advice was in a letter from the architects Dean W. Berry & Gilbert.  The reason given is an acute shortage of building materials with no change in sight before next year.  It was implied in a telephone conversation that a permit would be granted as soon as materials were available.  The decision was ‘to give first preference to the erection of homes, which are urgently required by the many families living under appalling conditions.
