Burra Town Council, 20 October.

Mr West says the fixing of guttering along eaves overhanging footways has again been referred to the [SAMA] directors.

The Finance Committee had gone into revenue and expenditure of the part of the town now in East and West Wards and found c. £50 had in the past year been expended in West Ward and £555 in East Ward.  They recommended that the Middle Ward credit of £7 and South Ward debit of £62 be both given to East Ward so that West Ward begins without a debt and East Ward with a debit of £55.

Cr Sampson wanted to consider this further, but the report was adopted.

Mr R. Bartle was appointed Waterworks Engineer at 54/- a week.

H. Pinch offered to rent two unclaimed allotments in Redruth for 10/- p.a. for ten years and he would have them fenced.  Granted.

The ford and footbridge in Aberdeen are to be tarred and painted.

110 more trees to be purchased.

Waterworks: no reply yet from the Department re the cost of meters.

The cost of laying on house services including the fixing of meters would be:

30/- for ½” service

40/- for ¾” service

60/- for 1” service
