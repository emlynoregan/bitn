Visiting Day & Speech Day at Burra School was held last Friday.  The headmaster Mr J.T.F. Johnson gave an address of welcome.  Mr Thomas reported on the High School where the numbers were 33 (17 boys and 16 girls) at the start of the year, but were now only 21 (9 boys and 12 girls).  In 1914 the numbers had been 26 in January and 24 in December.  In 1913 there had been 28 in January and December.  This year boys had left to fill the gaps created when others volunteered for the war effort.

Captain Chaplain Nield and Signaller Ross Harris were welcomed.  Mr J. McLaren as chairman of the School Board of Advice said it was probably for the last time he would serve as such as the new Education Bill proposed to abolish the Boards and substitute a committee for each school.  The present system did make it hard to keep in touch with the condition and needs of each school in the district.  Mr Winnall spoke as a Board member and Mr Crewes as Mayor.  Captain Chaplain Nield spoke of Egypt and a visit there to the El-Ahzar University which had 11,000 students, all male, and whose 500 teachers were each paid just 6d a month.
