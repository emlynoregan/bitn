3rd Leader on The Land Board

The visit of the Central Land Board has seen applications dealt with in a most extraordinary manner.

For example: Section 244 of 139 acres was applied for by a landless man who would immediately fence it and reside on it, but it went to an applicant with land, for a non-residential use.

Secondly: the man who applied for Section 93 was allotted Section 107, which was not applied for.  The application was then withdrawn.

Local JPs should deal with cases rather than a Board that knows nothing of the merits of cases.

Details of the decisions of the sitting at the Burra Institute last Wednesday are printed elsewhere on the page.
