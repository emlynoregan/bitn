Grasshoppers

The pests invaded Booborowie last Wednesday, moving in from the north.  They seem to have mostly affected lucerne being left for seed.  Cereal crops were too ripe to be attractive.  Despite spraying, ‘Anama’ has been largely stripped of lucerne.  Old Bungaree has also lost lucerne.  Grasshoppers have extended to Andrews, Stanley Flat and Clare where they forced the cancellation of bowls play on Wednesday night.  Spalding has also been invaded and last Saturday’s bowls match was postponed.  Not too much damage seems to have been done, as they ate mainly the native grasses and left the couch.  Some invaded Hallett on Monday last week, but little damage was reported.
