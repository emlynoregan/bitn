Burra Town Council, 5 September

Burra Electric Supply Co. confirmed that negotiations are in progress with ETSA and the company will continue to supply power until negotiations are finalised.

The Town Plannerâ€™s Office agrees that the trailer pump should be controlled by the DC and further advice will follow.

The PMG is considering the relocation of the street letter receiver in Ludgvan Street.

A.S. Tillett is to be advised that unless he amends the condition of the house on the corner of Kingston St and Bridge St [actually Bridge Terrace] Council intends to take action within the powers of the Local Government Act.
