Mrs Luke Day, one of the town’s foremost knitters who taught many girls to knit for the war effort has formed a knitting circle to aid the unemployed.  The Unemployed Relief Fund has granted a sum for wool.  It will be known as the ‘Trix Pearce Knitting Circle’, as a tribute to the late secretary and organiser of the Cheer-up Society.  Any wool donations will be welcomed.
