Obituary.  Miss Mabel Piggott, eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs L.H. Piggott of Porter’s Lagoon who died on 9 April was born at Booleroo Centre district some 24 years ago and came to Porter’s Lagoon with her parents when aged 7.  She was a pupil of Burra High School who later joined the Education Department and taught on the West Coast at Bunoora and latterly was in charge of the Brady Creek School.  She retired from teaching last Christmas on sick leave and it was hoped her illness would respond to an operation.
