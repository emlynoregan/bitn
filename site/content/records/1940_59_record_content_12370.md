Obituary.  Mrs M.A. Phelan died at her residence on Monday afternoon. She had been associated with the Hotel Trade for many years and was a highly esteemed, large hearted and public spirited woman.  Some years ago she had lived in Burra and then had moved to Peterborough before retiring to Glenelg.  She returned to Burra in 1941.  She became indisposed a few weeks ago, but a fatal conclusion was not anticipated until the end of last week.  Sympathy is extended to the family: Mr & Mrs Lance Phelan, Miss Melva Phelan of Burra and Pte Tom Phelan of Darwin.  She will be buried in Peterborough where her husband was interred following his death 23 years ago.

[Margaret Ann Phelan nee Hoobin died 21 December 1942 Burra aged 68.  She married Richard James Phelan in 1899.]
