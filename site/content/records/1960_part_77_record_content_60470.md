Burra High School.  The proposed site for the new High School was inspected by Mr E.C. Allen MP and the Public Works Standing Committee [members of which are listed].  It is expected tenders will be called later this year for work commencing in 1973, for occupancy in 1974.  The brick building is square in design with about 100 feet square of lawn and shrubs at the centre.  There will be tennis courts, a hockey field and oval and two footbridges and one vehicle bridge over the creek.  The party also visited the Mine area.

[The site proposed at the time was not spelled out, but subsequent discussion suggests it was on the western side of the bypass road a little south of the railway station â€“ between the bypass road and Copperhouse.]
