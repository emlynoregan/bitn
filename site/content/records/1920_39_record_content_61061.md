Burra Town Council, 5 May

Council received a letter from the RAA complaining about roads in Hampton.  The Mayor was offended and questioned the right of the RAA to interfere in the matter.  It was decided to write them a letter saying the Council had not been approached about the roads and resented the Association’s interfering.

A suggestion was tabled through the Town Clerk that a cement drive be launched for the Swimming Pool.  The Mayor said he had been promised 20 bags. Owing to the small attendance, consideration of the Swimming Pool was deferred.

Council considered money to tidy up the place for the centenary.  One eye sore was the walls around the old Mine House on the Main Road.  [Meaning the old Mine Store at the Mine Entrance.]

Cr Jennison agreed.  The path from Bleak House to the Mine Bridge was a perfect eyesore.

The Town Clerk suggested Council buy one of the beautiful etchings of the old jinker, to be seen in Drew & Crewes’ window.  The Mayor agreed – it was his grandfather who had brought the big engine to Burra on it.  The purchase was approved.

The Mayor and Town Clerk were authorised to order 500 trees for the Centenary Planting Project.

The present contract for the upkeep of gardens at Aberdeen was cancelled because of their unsatisfactory state.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 19th stage of the Koonaburra Trophy over 200, 300 and 700 yards.

Best scores for the day were from E.C. Collins, H.H. Byles and A.G. Heinrich.
