Referendum Meeting.  Burra Institute on Tuesday 11 December.

Hon. R.P. Blundell, Minister for Industry and Mr Peter Reidy MP spoke to a fairly large audience (reduced no doubt by the downpour just before the start).  They supported the YES vote at the referendum on conscription.  [Referred to as the Reinforcements Referendum: it was to bridge the gap between numbers required and volunteers coming forward.]

Mr Winnall presided, as Mr Crewes was stormbound in Clare on his way back from Adelaide by road.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ Band began the night’s proceedings.

The speeches are reported in 1⅔ columns.
