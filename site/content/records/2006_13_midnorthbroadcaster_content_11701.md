Burra Community School

As part of the Federal Government’s ‘Building the Education Revolution’ program the school is getting new ceilings, lighting, cupboards, and other fittings and reverse cycle air-conditioning in the old building.  The building has also acquired a new galvanised iron roof.  The primary classes will end up with entirely refurbished rooms and the renovations will extend to the library one the classrooms have been finished.  Again there will be air-conditioning, new carpets and a new circulation desk.  The overall contract went to the Clare firm of I.J. McKendrick, with specialised sub-contractors.  In placed the work has involved lifting floorboards and there have been some finds from beneath them.  Books and sheets of paper have been recovered, some of them much decayed by damp and dirt, but others quite readable.  One such was an exercise book of Cecil Rogers from 1927 in which one page records:

‘Our school is built on the side of a hill in Kooringa.  It has been built for many years and is very large.  I go to Burra School, and I am in grade five.  While we are at school we must work and be obedient.

[Cecil Charles Rogers born 18 June 1916 York; an Adelaide suburb.)
