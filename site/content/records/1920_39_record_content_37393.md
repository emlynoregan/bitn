Aberdeen Croquet Club.  Kooringa visited on Wednesday.

[Scores are only given by name of player and as far as I can judge each side won two games with Aberdeen scoring 88 overall to Kooringa 86.]

On 19 February four ‘A’ players went to Kooringa.

[Again, if I have allocated the players correctly Aberdeen won both games and thus the overall results 52 to 40.]
