Mr Crewes in seconding the adoption of the report warmly praised Mr Warnes’ generosity.

Mr S.H. Robinson endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks: ‘he had heard it said that Mr Warnes would give anything so long as he had his own way.  He (the speaker) would like to deny that.  As a matter of fact, the President was just the opposite.  He did not like to do things off his own bat and always consulted his committee.  He was far from running the show on his own.’

Mr Crewes moved that Mr Warnes be elected a life member.  Mr Radford seconded.  Carried with applause.
