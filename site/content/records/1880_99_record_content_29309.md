Editorial on the recent outbreak of disease with the patients actually dying of pneumonia, but with typhoid-like symptoms as well.  It is strongly suggested that diseased animals were sold, slaughtered and eaten, with those who contracted the disease preferring their meat underdone.  The connection, though not definitely proved, seems highly likely.  Steps need to be taken to protect the public and the current laws seem inadequate.  The surviving sufferer remains critical.
