‘Back to Burra’: Thursday

The morning saw 200-300 old scholars go ‘Back to School’.  Many came in costume with schoolbags or trundled hoops.  The girls came in pinafores and sun bonnets or wide-brimmed hats.  In the yard they played marbles, ‘nuts and may’, ‘kiss in the ring’, ‘chivvy’ and ‘legging day today’.  Fall-in was called at 10.30.  Mr Oborn called the roll and then placed Miss Annie Snell (Mrs Young of Long Plains) in charge of the unruly class.  She was first assistant at the school and her sister Martha (Mrs F. Carey of Adelaide) was the first monitor.  Dr W.G. Torr (of Brighton) took another class.

[A list of some of the old scholars present is then printed.]

In the afternoon charabanc trips were made to Clare and World’s End Gorge.

The evening included a dance in the Institute and a concert at Redruth given by the visitors.
