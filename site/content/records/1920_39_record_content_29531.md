Fire at the Films.  Last Saturday at the picture show at the Institute the film caught fire creating a mad rush to the exits in which several people received minor injuries.  The panic was quite uncalled for, as the projection room is fireproof and in any case the fire was soon extinguished.  The film soon continued.
