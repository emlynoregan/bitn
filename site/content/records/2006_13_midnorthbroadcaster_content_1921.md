The Environment Resources & Development Court has resolved that Goyder Council should reverse its approval of a feedlot application on Princess Royal Station. Simon Rowe said he would appeal the decision.  The application for a 1,500 head cattle feedlot was received by the Council two years ago.  Council and the Environment Protection Authority approved the proposal.  Graham Whetstone & John Lindner challenged this in the ERDC on the grounds that the withdrawal of groundwater would have a significant impact on surrounding properties.  The ERDC agreed, but Simon Rowe took the matter to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the ERCD had not considered the matter thoroughly, instead focusing on environmental concerns.  After reassessing the case the ERDC has now ruled in favour of Lindner & Whetstone.
