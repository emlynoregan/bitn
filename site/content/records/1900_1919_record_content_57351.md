The report mentions four bands, but it is not clear which are intended; presumably the Ladies’ band, the Naval Band, the Men’s Band and the Fife & Drum Band, assuming the Tin-can Band was just a bit of procession fun.

The report then describes the usual stalls.  By the end of the day c. £634 had been raised.
