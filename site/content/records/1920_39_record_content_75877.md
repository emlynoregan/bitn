Burra Improvement Society.  A meeting at the RSL Rooms on Tuesday night last formed this organisation.  Members aim to help with any movement pertaining to the town’s welfare.  The Mayor said he was in full sympathy with the aims of the society.  Mr R.C. Lott said Burra needed more publicity in the daily press.  Mr Jennison deplored the cliques that divided the town, but Dr Steele didn’t think them much different from any town, though Mr Jennison thought them much less evident in towns along the River Murray for example.  Elected were Chairman, F.T. Sara; Secretary, R.T. Bowles & Committee comprising in addition Dr Steele with Messrs S.C. Genders, H. Jennison & A.L. Bence.
