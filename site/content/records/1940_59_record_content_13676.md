Recognition Social for Sister Mavis Riggs & Lieut. L.H. Thomas MC

This was sponsored by the Redruth Methodist Church and held at the Redruth Memorial Hall on 3 May.  Rev. A.S. Barrett presided.  People were pleasantly surprised when Lieut. Thomas entered with only the aid of a walking stick.  The Mayor gave an address.  He referred to Sister Riggsâ€™ leaving in March 1940 and serving in the African Desert and later in New Guinea.  Mr S.C. Genders spoke for the RSL followed by Mr G.S. Hawker, F.T. Sara, M.J. Morton & Rev. Barrett.  The responses by Sister Riggs & Lieut. Thomas are printed.
