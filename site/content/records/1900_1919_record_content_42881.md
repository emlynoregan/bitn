Cr McBride said the offer was absurd.

The Council had £150 and he suggested the Department be asked for the other £150.

The matter will be taken up with the local members.

The Aberdeen Bridge certainly did not need £400 spent on it.

Eventually it was decided to ask for a £600 special grant.

Kooringa has been brought under the Public Amusements Act.

Aberdeen will get private post boxes, but none are presently in stock.
