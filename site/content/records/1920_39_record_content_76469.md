Burra as the Town Name

At Council a letter was received from the Director of Lands suggesting the post offices be called Burra & Burra North rather than Burra & North Burra.

The Mayor said it would still lead to confusion until the whole town was covered by a postal delivery service.  [Only Kooringa was then being covered.]

The letter is to lie on the table until next meeting.

The Mayor said road signs were also confusing with some giving distance to Burra and others to Kooringa.
