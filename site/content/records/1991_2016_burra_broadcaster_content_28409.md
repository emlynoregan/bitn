Burra Cycling Classic.  This year there were changes to the course.  It was promoted by the Norwood Cycling Club and supported by the Goyder Council and others.

Originally a race from Burra to Adelaide or vice versa, from 1985 it has started and finished in Burra, due to the heavy traffic conditions near Adelaide.  Racing this year commences opposite the Commercial Hotel at 11 a.m. Saturday and goes to Burra North, then the Morgan Road to the Robertstown turn-off.  It continues to Robertstown and Point Pass before returning to Burra for a total of 118 km.  Sunday will have graded scratch events using an 8 km circuit and there will also be junior events on both days.
