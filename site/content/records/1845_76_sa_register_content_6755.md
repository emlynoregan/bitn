Obituary/Inquest.  On Wednesday 18 June W. Lang, coroner, conducted an inquest on the body of James Thompson at the Smelters’ Home Hotel.  A girl aged about 10 said the deceased, who had been drinking at the Redruth Arms, in attempting, while intoxicated, to cross the Burra Creek on his way home, lost his footing and was thrown down by the stream.  The body was recovered today and taken to the Aberdeen Hotel, where the jurymen came to view it.  In declaring a verdict of accidental death, Mr Gollin, as foreman recommended that the Burra Mining Company be asked to place footbridges across the Burra Creek at appropriate intervals and either repair or remove the damaged bridge to the Smelting Works so it does not impede the flow.  He also said that the law should be change to make 12 rather than 24 menthe number for a jury, as it was inconvenient for him and others to be called so often from their businesses.  12 were sufficient in Adelaide.  Mr Lang thought such a change would have to wait till the new Legislative Council met.  There was also a complaint that the officers of the Mining and Smelting Companies were not inconvenienced by having to sit on juries.

[James Thompson died 17 June 1851 aged 52.]
