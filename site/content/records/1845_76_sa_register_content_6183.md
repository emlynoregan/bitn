Burglaries.  The house of Mr John Higgs was forcibly entered on Sunday evening while the family was at church.  Among items stolen was Mr Higgs cash-box, which fortunately only held an order for £3.

Mr Thomas Bath has, in the past three weeks, been robbed in a similar manner of £100.

It is apparent from these and other offences that an organised gang is operating in the neighbourhood.  While the diligence of Sergeant-Major McCulloch cannot be doubted, the want of sufficient police at Burra is deplorable.
