Goyder Council

Heidi Nicholson of the Goyder Animal & Plant Control Board has been appointed to the Redbanks Reserve Management Committee, which has just revised its management plan.

Council is to recommend to Transport SA that the disused rail corridor extending from Eudunda to the River Light be transferred to adjoining landowners â€“ with the landowners then obliged to control weeds and vermin.
