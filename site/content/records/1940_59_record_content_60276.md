She came to Burra as Molly Simpson in 1869 and was educated at Burra Model School.  [This seems unlikely as the school did not open till 1878 when she was 9Â½, but she may have completed her education there.]  She played the organ at Redruth Methodist Sunday school before moving to Hamley Bridge, where she married A.A. Jefferies and the couple later lived at Wallaroo, Medindie and Reynella.  In 1912 they took up land at Mt Bryan, where Mr Frank Jefferies is currently carrying on the farm.  Mrs Jefferies came to live in Burra after her husband died in 1941.
