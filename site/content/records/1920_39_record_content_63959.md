Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward

The Miners

What were the miners like?

They were mostly married men with families, hard working and industrious and their wives clean, thrifty and industrious also.  Anyone who has tasted their pasties, seedy and saffron cake, their curranty buns, their apple pies and tarts, the ‘thunder and lightnen’ bread and cream zigzagged with treacle – could tell that.  The children were ruled with a firm hand.  If the girls were rebellious a word or two or a slep or two from mother would soon quiet them.  If the boys were unruly they may sometimes succeed in getting around mother. But if the matter was serious enough for ‘feyther’ to be telled that was a different affair.  They were up a tree there and would be ‘sent’ sure enough.  I remember a conversation between two women, one a little trim person, all spit fire, was in my father’s shop purchasing some goods when another woman entered.  She was a fine tall woman evidently in great distress.  They wished each other ‘Good mornin’’ then the little woman said “Be anything the matter with ee? Youm looking whist sure enough.”  “I’ss” said the other, “it’s my bebby, he du be getting brave and sassy lately ee gove me a fine passell of cheek this morning in sure enough.  But I’ll tell his feyther for un when he du come home and he’ll soon make ’im behave hisself”.  “I’ss” said the little woman sympathetically, “tell his feyther for un.  He woulden ’low he to give ee sass he’d soon put un in ’ees place”.  “But” she added, “why diden ’ee seat un yerself?”  “Aw I woulden”, said the poor woman, “he runned away and I coulden catch un, and he’d only ha gove me more sass if I had”.  Then the little woman fired up.  “Mine don’t give me no trouble, he don’t give ME no sass, he dasent; ef he did, I’d knock un down.  Iss I’d knock un down, ef he was as big as a house, I’d knock un down.”

Many families were connected with the various churches and were members of the choirs.  They possessed fine voices, and excelled in part singing.  Many fine anthems were sung such as “Who is the King of Glory?”, “How Beautiful upon the mountains” and “The Earth is the Lord’s” etc.  To hear them sing “Pope’s Ode”, “Vital Spark of Heavenly Flame” sung usually at Memorial service of a member of the choir or church was awe inspiring.  Many of the miners were teachers in the Sunday Schools, others were local preachers.  There was Joseph Sleep, Isaac and Mrs Goss of the Wesleyans, little ‘Jimmy’ Bennetts of the Bible Christians, and ‘Jackey’ Jacob Burrows of the Primitives, men who will never be forgotten.  The women were in their element getting up ‘dennors’ and ‘tay’ meetings which they did in fine style.

Many of the younger men and boys were employed at the Mine.  On Saturday nights these would line the shop verandahs and footpaths regaling themselves with fruit and lollies, others would form bands and parade the streets singing minstrel songs and other old songs – ‘Silver threads among the gold’ being a great favourite.  They were usually polite to girls and women with their ‘Good evenin’ Miss or Missis unless some fast piece gave them what they called ‘sass’ when the sass would be returned with interest.

On Sunday nights after church they would again march and sing all the old familiar hymns.  Some of them had girl’s or soprano voices and it was a great treat to hear them.  The voices of the Hill brothers, Steve, Will and Tom. Were easily distinguished among them.  Johnny Martin was another beautiful singer, not very long out from Cornwall.  He was a great favourite and had been married about a fortnight when he fell down a shaft, whilst at work, meeting with fatal injuries.  Tom Hill, a boy singer with a beautiful voice, also died at an early age.

A favourite meeting place for men and boys off shift was ‘Fools’ Corner’ which is now occupied by Mr E.J. Harris’s shop.  Also on the footpath and parts of the road, there they would gather for a ‘jaw’ or ‘gass’ or games of tops and marbles.  I have seen grown men playing these games with all the zest of school boys.

If a man was wanted and could not be found, the answer to enquiries would be “Did ee look for un at Fools’ Corner, him most sure be theer”.

A ‘gass’ or a ‘jaw’ meant a general talk amongst the men, a ‘pich’ was a more serious conversation between acquaintances or partners.  A pitch amongst the women meant a friendly pleasant talk.  They dearly loved ‘a pitch over a cup of tay’.  A ‘tell’ was a talk of much more serious or intimate nature.  Two women would be seen in the street in earnest conversation.  A man, the husband of one of them, passes and understanding merely nods and goes on his way.  Another man stops and salutes them.  “Be ee coming home along mother?”  “I’ss me dear”, she replies, “you go on home, we’em only having a ‘tel’”, and he, satisfied, passes on.  ‘Scat’ was a word much used.  If anything fell and was broken it was ‘scat’.  Unruly children and animals were told they would be ‘scat’ if they “deden stop et”.  When the mine ceased working, she went ‘scat’.  They had a saying about a man splitting a piece of wood – “First I hit un, then I miss un.  Then I seat un all abroad all along the plancheon road or floor”.

When the mines were in full work many families were engaged in Cornwall by the Mining Association to work there.  On their arrival no housing accommodation had been made for them.  The Government of the day sent a supply of beds and tents from Adelaide.  A spare piece of ground near the Railway Station was allotted them.  It was named Canvas Town.  They lived there for some time.  Many families eventually found work and accommodation at Wallaroo and Kadina.

Such were the Burra Miners in the ‘Brave awld days’ and many happy hours I spent with them.
