Mrs Annie Seal is the 85-year-old licensee of the 100-year-old Gasworks Hotel at Brompton.  Older residents may recall she was licensee of Opie’s Hotel, (now the home of R. Fuss at Burra North) in 1907.  For more than 44 years Mrs Seal has been serving beer, but claims still to be a teetotaller.  She began at Opie’s Hotel in 1907 and then transferred to the Globe Hotel at Naracoorte.  In 1911 she came back to be at the Royal exchange Hotel and the Kooringa Hotel.  She took her present hotel in 1926, but spent 12 years in the Manoora Hotel since then.  [Hoad disagrees with these dates.  He shows her at Opie’s in 1910, at the Royal Exchange 1912-15 and at the Kooringa 1916-20 and at the Royal Exchange again 1921-26.]
