Tar Dressing of Roads

Â½ column of detail on how the tar dressing trial was being done and of problems with the process.  The debate was whether the tar should be applied to the present road or the road given more metal and blinded first.  Eventually it was resolved to complete the rest of the 5 chains without disturbing the present road.  The Aberdeen trial will be shifted slightly to incorporate road newly made last year.
