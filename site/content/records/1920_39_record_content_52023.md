Obituary.  Eddie Bennetts died at Broken Hill 16 July aged 56.  He was born in Kooringa until a young man when he went to Broken Hill with his family.  He was the youngest son of the Late Mr & Mrs James Bennett’s.  He was practically the first person to make a move for the ‘Back to Burra’ in 1925 when he wrote a letter to The Record suggesting the movement.  It was a great success and Eddie kept the home fires burning among the many old Burraites at broken Hill.  He called in at Burra almost every year on his holidays.  He was a great sport and had been in charge of the Manchester Department at J.C. Goodhart’s in Broken Hill for over 20 years.  He was also eminent on Broken Hill’s Jubilee celebrations and leaves a widow and grown-up family of two sons and a daughter: Alf, Neil and Mabel.  [Edward Bennetts born 28 December 1877 at Kooringa.]
