Burra Mine

The newly formed local company Howe Enterprises has won a large sub-contract to fence the Burra Copper Mine.  This involves about two miles of six-foot-high chain mesh fencing.  Howe Enterprises is a consortium of Messrs O’Connor & Co., Hirschausen Bros. and Wardle & Sons.  Mr Hope, Site Manager of the Burra Mine, says work is well under way.  About 40 men are currently working on the site.
