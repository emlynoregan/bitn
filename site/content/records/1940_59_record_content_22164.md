The Burra Institute has been taken over by the Town Council.  A couple of signatures all that is needed now to finalise the transfer.  At the Red Cross Ball on Friday night the Mayor said that it was probably the last function to be held in the Burra Institute whilst the hall was owned by the Burra Institute Committee.  Discussions concerning the transfer have been going on for some years and the unravelling of the red tape involved has taken several months and is not yet quite complete.
