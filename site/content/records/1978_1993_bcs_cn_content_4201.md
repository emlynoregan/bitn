The rotunda was opened in 1911.

If The Prime Minister dined there in 1922 there is no mention of it in newspaper reports of the time – or at least a Trove search failed to discover one.

In January 1923 Mr A.L. Bence had bought the store from Miss Snell and it became then a draper’s shop.

It certainly did not have a century and a quarter career in food retailing.

Miss Snell’s father had owned the building for many years.  He had a business there as a jeweller, later ran a Temperance Hotel in the building and later still operated a labour exchange from it and was described early in the 1900s as a stationer.

It would be nice to confirm the Gaslight story, even if the building’s continuity as a café is clearly an exaggeration.]
