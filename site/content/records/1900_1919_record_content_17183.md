The Burra Mine: The Burra Burra Copper Co.

A decision has been made to get samples from various parts of the mine with the object of refloating the property, but this has been done before and is futile unless exploration gets below the old workings.

Since the water level was lowered 9 or 10ft an old drive has been exposed and found to contain some ore, but it was abandoned long before the mine closed and the presence of ore does not mean it will repay working expenses.

In the past week the pump has had several good runs, but it has stopped on several occasions, as muck is being disturbed at about 12ft.  It is a pity the level has not been lowered 50ft or even 25ft as that would make all the difference.  We believe nothing can be done until sufficient capital is found for systematic development.  We would not alter our opinion if all the unallotted shares were showered upon us.  An attempt to find sulphide ore is to be made from Allen’s Shaft as we had earlier suggested.
