Mr Dickenson, the Director of Mines for SA, and two American geologists, Dr Gustafson & Mr Benedict, visited Burra last Tuesday.  They looked at the old Burra Mine records and visited the mine and the Princess Royal Mine.  They were interested in boring at the Burra Mine in 1907.  They did not think there were future prospects for mining here.
