Redruth Camping Centre is facing an unknown future.  The complex has 90 beds and has been a destination for many school camps, but dwindling bed nights per year and losses amounting to $10,000 per annum are forcing its owners to consider whether it can continue in its present form.  In the last five years 9,500 bed nights have been spent there.  This week a school group of 90 will spend $2,000 on catering in Burra.  In recent years nearly $40,000 has been spent on fire regulation upgrades.

Options include:

Changing the management

Leasing it out

Selling part or all

Continuing

Flinders University is considering finding a site for an annexe to have students carry out research and contacts will be made with them in the near future.
