Cr Parks reported that the Waterworks engineer said the works were in a satisfactory state, but the old boiler at the Waterworks is reported to be unsafe to work.

Cr Walsh said something should be done to the boiler: the engineer had a lucky escape last week when a plug shot out from behind the boiler; if it had been in front serious consequences would have followed.

C. Grow applied for water to be laid on.

Cr Linkson complained that (as he had predicted at the time) tree guards stacked at the oval are being vandalised.  The problem is that the Council has no safe storage.  He thought it worth paying to store them as they had cost £40 to £50, but in the end it was decided to restack them at the oval.

The cemetery was reported to be in a bad state.  The curator will work there till the next meeting.  [The curator had been ordered to work elsewhere for two days out of three.]

Money was going to be very tight in the coming half-year.

Local Board of Health.

Cr Hardy drew attention to the number of conveyances being driven about in the dark.  [Presumably the complaint was that they were unlit conveyances.]

The Town Clerk reported removing T.P. Halls’s cab licence in accordance with the Act.

Cr Parks reported dead fish in the creek near the Bible Christian Church and they were smelling ‘pretty high’.

Cr Linkson reported several dead dogs and cats in the creek near Redruth.

Dead fish are to be removed from the water under the Bridge St Bridge near the Bible Christian Church.  Dead dogs and cats are to be removed from the creek near Redruth.

[This report seems to have started something of a feud, but there is nothing obvious in it to account for that.]

The problem of relief for the poor in Burra was then addressed

Cr Harris suggested that each councillor undertake to give or collect £10 to help urgent cases of need in the town.  An advertisement to be placed in the Record asking those in urgent need to apply to the Town Clerk.  Carried.

[This last item was materially corrected in the next issue.]
