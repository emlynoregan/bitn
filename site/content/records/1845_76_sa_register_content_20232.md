Burra Burra Mine

We have ascertained that it is the determination of the Directors to stop ore-raising after the end of the present take – probably about 28 March and in April they will decide how much exploratory work, if any, will proceed.

Orders have been given to continue work in the new shaft.

The Wallaroo Times reported on the contemplated stoppage, characterising it as one of the most serious items of news for some time.  It will have a depressing effect upon the mineral reputation of the colony and throwing out of work some 500 men occurs at a time when work is by no means plentiful.  Mineral exports will decline by c. £90,000 a year.  The coal trade and the Smelting Company will also suffer.  The last report of the company in October 1866 said the Mine was then generally satisfactory and raising ore at about 500 tons per month.  It was then employing 448 hands.  We fear the low price of copper must have determined the Directors to ‘knock the bal’.

We hope that before long the market will improve and the mine will again be worked.  Burra has to pay a rate of carriage which would close several of the Peninsula mines if confronted with the same expense.  A railway to Burra might see mining profitably resumed.
