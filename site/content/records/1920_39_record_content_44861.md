Walker continues – you can see how important Burra Mines were in those days when each £5 share returned £315.

He then describes the Mongolata geology.  It is situated on the edge of the pre-Cambrian formation and breaks away to the Eastern Plain.  The east edge of pre-Cambrian rocks also has the Adelaide Hills Mine, Ulooloo, Wadnaminga, Teetulpa and Olary gold deposits.  He says in America the following of stringers was found to lead to rich pockets of ore which would pinch away, but eventually open out again.  He advises all at Mongolata to follow all stringers, as they must eventually lead to gold deposits.  There must also be plenty of alluvial gold, but in such an old deposit it is hard to say where water courses were hundreds of millions of years ago.  A proper geological survey is needed to give more information concerning the lay of underlying rock beds.
