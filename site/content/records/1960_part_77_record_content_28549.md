Burra RSL.  The AGM on Friday night failed for the second time to elect an executive committee.  On the first attempt there was not a quorum present.  On Friday 12 attended, but there was no response when a call was made for nominations.  For the present the old executive will carry on and the Chairman Mr H. Cornelius and other stalwarts are making arrangements for Anzac day.  If no more interest is shown the sub-branch may close.
