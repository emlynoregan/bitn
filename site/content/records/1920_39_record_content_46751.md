16 November 1849. The 9th dividend of 100% was declared.

5 January 1850.  Copper was at £75 a ton.

22 February 1850.  The 10th dividend of 200% was declared.

8 March 1850.  Mr Challoner’s salary was increased to £180 p.a.  Challoner and Roach were now running the mine.

17 April 1850.  Copper prices improved in Europe.  The directors resolved to order powerful pumping machinery – to be the big engine for Sneider’s Shaft [sic: Schneider’s]

15 May 1850.  The 11th dividend of 200% was paid.

16 October 1850.  The Chairman said the ore raised in five years was 56,428 tons.  SAMA in 4½ years to 29 September 1849, including 4 years of the Burra Mine, earned a profit of £229,535-8-9 and of this £221,760 had been paid in 12 dividends:

16 April 1851.  At the AGM the Chairman of Directors said everything at the mine was still good, but water was starting to be a problem and the pumping engine on Sneider’s Shaft [sic: Schneider’s] was almost powerless to control it.

15 October 1851.  The Chairman reported all was going well.  The Victorian Gold Rush then started and employed men and boys fell so that by 30 September 1853 only 167 remained and water was allowed to flood the lower levels.

18 April 1854.  Men were returning and numbers rose to 191 and by the end of April 1855 to 688 and by March 1856 to 773.  It was decided to sink Morphett’s Shaft 14ft x 10ft and to erect an extra powerful engine.

30 September 1857.  Morphett’s Shaft had reached 20 fathoms and was proceeding.  Employment had reached 909.  The ordered pump was expected early in 1858.

30 September 1858.  The new pumping engine arrived at Pt Adelaide.

31 March 1859.  Morphett’s Shaft reached 55 fathoms.  Sinking was held up by the inrush of water.

31 March 1860.  Morphett’s Engine started 1 April 1860 and worked exceedingly well.  Johnny Green erected as mascot.

1861.  Copper reached £105 a ton before falling to £82-10-0.

This information, read with Treloar’s booklet of four years previously, he says, gives a ‘fairly truthful story of the Burra Burra Mine whose early discovery and working was a wonderful help to the State by giving it wealth (badly wanted at the time) and providing employment freely, not only on the mine, but also circulated it everywhere besides it being a great incentive to land settlement.’
