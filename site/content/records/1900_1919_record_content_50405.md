Win the War League.

Under the auspices of the Red Cross there were addresses on Wednesday afternoon by Dr Gertrude Halley of the Public Schools Service and Mrs Christophers, Secretary of the Women’s State Recruiting Council.  Their object was the formation of a branch of the Win the War League in Burra.  It was now up to the women to get the remaining men to enlist.  Those who answered a call of duty or were attracted by military pageantry etc., or who had nothing else to do had already gone.  Women needed to point out that the % of men killed was very small and most of the wounded recovered.  Australia was prosperous and personal needs in Australia showed little self-denial.  Children should give up their sweets and buy war stamps.  Interview the womenfolk of eligible men.  Women could take on men’s jobs.

Mrs Harcus moved a branch be formed in Burra and Mrs W. McBride 2nd.  Mrs Amy Harris was elected secretary.  The election of a President was held over, as Mr Crewes was absent on electioneering business.
