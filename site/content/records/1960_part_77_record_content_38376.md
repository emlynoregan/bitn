Burra Hospital.  Work on the new theatre building is progressing to the stage where the roof is being put on.  The building contains sixteen rooms and includes a new casualty department. When work on this section is completed the old theatre and casualty section will be demolished or converted to two domestic bedrooms and sewing room etc.  A parking area is being created across the road with 2-3,000 cubic yards of filling from the site and trees have been planted there.  Donations for the building fund have now reached $12,518.50.
