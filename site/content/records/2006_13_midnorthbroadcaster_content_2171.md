Goyder Council has nominated former Mayor, Laurie Sullivan, for the John Legoe Award for service to the Hallett and Goyder Communities.  The award honours Cr John Legoe, who died in December 2005 and who was a former President of the Local Government Association.

BCS held its Presentation Night last Thursday.  Principal Jim Low said next year staffing would be reduced.

Phil Bryant would move to Clare High School.

Mali Grossman will move to Darwin, with the right to return after twelve months.

Beth Wiley will leave the library staff.
