The Burra Fire Brigade

The chief officer of the SA Fire Brigades Board has had discussions with the Mayor Mr Baulderstone, the Councillors and the Town Clerk re the town brigade.  It was decided some facts needed to be publicised.

The Burra Fire Brigade is part of the Auxiliary Fire Service maintained by the Board to afford fire protection to certain country centres where the Fire Brigades Act Applies.

It is manned by an Auxiliary Foreman and Auxiliary Fireman, who have permanent employment in the town and who are available to answer fire calls on a 24 hour basis.

Auxiliary Firemen needed to be fit and undergo a medical examination when they join.  They are provided with uniforms and equipment and must attend drills and instruction as required.

They are expected to devote a reasonable proportion of their time to the Brigade and take their turn of duty at the station as required.

They receive an annual retainer payable monthly plus 15/- per hour or part thereof when at fires or cleaning up afterwards.  The Foreman gets £130 p.a., the Firemen £100 and the Standby £25.

The retainer is payable for the first three months of sickness.

Auxiliary Firemen are covered by Workmen’s Compensation for death or accident while on duty.

Absence due to holidays from his permanent job does not interfere with his retainer.
