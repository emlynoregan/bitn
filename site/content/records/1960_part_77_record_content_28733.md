Burra Primary School, Annual Parents’ Meeting

Last year 40 attended.  This year was closer to average with just 19, even though 129 families are represented in the school.  This is disappointing.

Elected: Chairman, Mr R. Moreland; Secretary-Treasurer, Mr D. Bannister.

In the past year the new school oval was sown and is now in an excellent condition.  Goal posts will be erected next week.  Sports Day 1965 was held on the War Memorial Oval and was a great success.  Arbor Day was held on 13 August when John Riggs was guest speaker.  The Passing Out Parade was held on 16 December, when R. Moreland and Mrs Carpenter presented the prizes.  Following discussions with ETSA and the Public Buildings Department a new power line has been laid and rewiring of the school is about to commence.  This will allow more lights and heaters.  Four fans have been purchased for the wooden rooms.  All subsidies have now been granted for the library and we can now go ahead with the final setting up of the library.  The school is to be repainted at the end of April at a cost of $11,000.  A grant of $3,000 from the Highways Department will allow all access roads to be sealed.  The grounds in front of the school are in the process of being transferred to the Education Department with the aid of the Town Council.
