Report of a Trip Around the North, from a special reporter.

Returning from Clare we set off from Auburn walking at a tangent towards the Burra Road.

[A description of the country between Auburn and Saddleworth follows.]

‘Saddleworth is embryotic’ and in the neighbourhood is still called by the original name of the public house – the Stone Hut.  There is a good store and four or five houses.

[A description of the country between Saddleworth and Marrabel follows.]

Here there is a Hotel marked by cleanliness, order and civility.  It is built of local yellowish-grey stone.  There is also a large mill to grind the wheat.

[The writer then pressed on in the moonlight towards Anlaby via Tothill’s Creek, where there was a group of German farmers who migrated from the Mt Barker area 8 to 10 years earlier.  There were also Irish farmers in the area.  From Tothill’s Creek he went to Hamilton.]

At Hamilton there was a blacksmith, a general store and a hotel.
