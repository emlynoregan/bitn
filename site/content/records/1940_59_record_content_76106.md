Burra Show Flower Pavilion

Mr R. Fuss has completed work on the improvements to the Flower Pavilion at the showgrounds.  He donated his labour (£50) and carried out improvements at a cost of £100 for which a subscription list has been opened.  Patrons at the 1956 show will recall the wonderful display, but also the rather oppressive conditions, due to the lack of ventilation.  We acknowledge the interest and energy of the man behind the flower section, Mr R. Fuss of Burra North.  In the last months he has constructed frames to hold glass louvre windows and cut sections from each end of the Flower Pavilion, installed the windows and covered the frames with bird netting.  This has greatly improved the ventilation and the frames are removable in the event of extensions to the building.  As well as donating his £50 worth of labour, he has supplied materials at cost at c. £100.  Donations are now called to meet this.
