Notice.  Valedictory Social for Mr & Mrs E.S. Blunt at Hanson Methodist Church 13 July.

Weather remains dry to the east with some light showers locally bringing 27 points in the last week.

YMCA.  Burra group is now definitely constituted with the Mayor M. Collins as President and E.J. Davey as Secretary.  130 members have enrolled; young men and women and juniors.  Physical culture classes are held Mondays at Kooringa and Tuesdays at Redruth.

Miss Elsie Daenke, daughter of the shipping representative of Elder, Smith & Co., and a friend flew up to Burra from Adelaide on Sunday to go to church at Kooringa Methodist Church and returned after lunch with friends.  Elder, Smith & Co. have become the booking agents for Australian Aerial Services Ltd. and the trip was arranged by the Company’s agents in the Bell Bird, a DH 50 machine with a Siddeley-Puma 240 h.p. engine and accommodation for four.  They departed Albert Park at 8.55 a.m. and arrived in Burra at 10.10 a.m.  This was the first passenger aeroplane to arrive at Burra and at departure time 30-40 cars had arrived to see off the visitors in high wind with cold driving rain.  Barney Rogers assisted in getting the plane airborne at 3.10 p.m.  They arrived at Albert Park, 90 miles away, at 4.30 p.m.  Aeroplane taxi work has become popular interstate, but is in its infancy in SA.  Pastoralists are making greater use of such services daily.  The cost is 2/- per mile and the plane can carry four passengers.

Arthur Richards has left Drew & Crewes after 9 years and gone to live in Adelaide.
