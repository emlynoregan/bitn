Report of the Motor Trip to Morgan.  [Details in 1⅓ columns.]

[Some of the report is in a whimsical style with references to the adventures of individual participants without using their names.  They were doubtless identifiable to many of the readers by the references to their vehicles or other hints.]

On 14 July nine motorcycles and three motor cars set out from Jack Richardson’s Garage in Commercial Street.  The cars headed for Koomooloo while the motorcycles went to ‘The Gums’ which they reached in about 1½ hours.  Here they had a sumptuous tea.  From there it was a 40 minute ride into Morgan, arriving at 5.30 p.m.  They were met by Captain Oliver and shown over the P.S. Gem.  In the evening they attended a dance.

On Saturday morning they inspected the river etc. while waiting for the cars that were due that morning from Koomooloo.  These duly arrived about 11.30.  Late in the afternoon the cars returned to Koomooloo via Florieton, which was a better road than the route they had used in the morning.  The cycles reached ‘The Gums’ about 5 p.m. where they had tea and enjoyed a good night, though the elements outside were rough.

On Monday morning they set out for Burra.  Harold Pearce went along to show them a better route to follow via the stock road, but they had not gone far when a severe dust storm struck reducing visibility virtually to zero.  They could not even hear the noise of the bikes.  Riders had to dismount and push their vehicles, which was a very hard task in the wind.  They managed to reach a fence and follow it to a gate to get their bearings again.  Mr Pearse, who had come as a guide, was lost soon after leaving the homestead and never seen again, though the telegraph confirmed that he eventually found his way home.  One rider managed to get to Burra about 12 o’clock.  Torr from Mintaro got a hole in his petrol tank that had to be plugged with a mud-pie.  He then did all right until striking a heavy hail storm at Ford’s slaughterhouse.  He then abandoned the machine and walked into Burra Station and caught a train home.
