The J150 Commemorative Dinner

Professor Geoffrey Blainey was the keynote speaker at the J150 dinner at the Burra Town Hall.  He was welcomed by Robyn Page, Chair of the J150 Committee.  Professor Blainey paid tribute to those responsible for preserving the history of Burra, specifically to Ian Auhl.  He painted a picture of Australia on the eve of the Victorian gold rush, when Burra was the seventh largest town in Australia and the only one in the top ten not to be a port.  It was then twice the size of Brisbane, with a population of 5,000.  It had the first health benefits scheme in Australia and provided housing for miners.  It was also the largest Cornish community outside of England.  The first Bible Christian Church in Australia was built here in 1850. (Now the Paxton Square Cottages booking office.)  He also placed Burra in later exploration.  In 1873 Gosse named Ayers Rock after the Secretary of Burra’s mining company, Sir Henry Ayers.  John Forrest, after an epic travel through Western Australia, was treated to a dinner at the relatively new Burra Town Hall.  Ernest Giles also was given a dinner in his return to the outskirts of civilisation.  Professor Blainey also mentioned the Lewis family and placed Burra in the wider plane of Australia’s history.
