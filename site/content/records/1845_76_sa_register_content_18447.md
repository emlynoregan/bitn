Kooringa News, 20 April

Good Friday was kept as a strict holiday with every place of business closed.  Carts were much in demand to take people to their various recreations.  One party went kangaroo hunting and killed no fewer than 48.

At the Church of England the usual services were held morning and evening, though the latter was thinly attended.

A shower of rain on Saturday night settled the dust.

Easter Monday was also a holiday.  Some amused themselves at cricket and others went to the races at Cross Roads.

The Church Sunday-school children had their abundance of fruit in the Burra Grammar School, which was filled to overflowing with children till dark.

The Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary on the same day.  After meeting at the Chapel grounds they marched with flying banners to Limestone Hill for fruit and games and in the afternoon tea and cakes at the schoolroom.  A public meeting was held in the evening.  Despite serious losses of pupils and teachers to Wallaroo, the state of the school was satisfactory.  Rev. W. North the new minister spoke, hoping parents would sometimes visit the school.

On Tuesday a vestry meeting was held at St Maryâ€™s Church to elect church officers for the coming year.
