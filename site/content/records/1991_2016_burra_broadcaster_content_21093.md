The Burra & Beyond Brochure was launched at Redruth Gaol on 10 January by the Hon. Joan Hall MP, Minister for tourism.  Maureen Wright, Chairperson of the Burra Burra National Trust, welcomed the Minister.  Dennis Keller, Chairman of the Regional Council of Goyder also attended.  Maureen gave a short history of the Redruth Gaol and told of the advent of the Burra Key, later to become the Burra Passport, which has generated the income to enable the National Trust to care for its sites.  The Minister launched the new brochure, which is the Burra Visitor Guide for 2000.  After the speeches Glynne Ryan served finger food in the Gaolâ€™s dining room area. [Photo]
