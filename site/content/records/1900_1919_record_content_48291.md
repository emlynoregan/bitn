Conscription Referendum Campaign.

The addresses by the Rt Hon. Joseph Cooke and Senator Newland to the women are reported at length in over two columns.  [But with no reference to Mrs Carew Reynell as advertised.]  The evening addresses received another column and another ½ column reports a similar meeting at Booborowie.  The meeting at Burra seems to have been for the proposal: ‘the speakers were listened to patiently and without interruption for nearly three hours.’

At Booborowie things were different in the woolshed.  The seats provided were not all filled and there was amply standing room.  There was organised opposition and Mr Hague MP was shouted down.  M-C Kane ejected four or five and Mr Hague then proceeded amongst countless interruptions and boos.  Senator Newland gave as good as he got and received a somewhat better hearing.  Two or three eggs were thrown, but to no real effect.  Mr McDonald had three of his car tyres slashed with a pen-knife.  Rocks and eggs were hurled at the cars of the speakers as they later left the homestead and a gun was fired into the air.

A meeting at Mt Bryan was similar to the Burra meeting.
