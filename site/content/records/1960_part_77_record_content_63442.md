Copper Festival

Unveiling the Peacock Chimney Plaque

Burra people were staggered by the numbers present.  Thousands of people gathered for the event.  Gusty winds whipped round the small yellow curtain covering the plaque and around the long dresses, capes and bonnets of the ladies and young girls in nineteenth century costume.  Men and boys in clothes of the miners added authenticity.  A number of veteran cars and horse drawn vehicles added to the scene and the Police Band gave a martial flavour to the procession.  After the unveiling the procession was reformed and followed the band back to Market Square where it played for the afternoon.  At the chimney Sir Mark & Lady Oliphant were met by National Trust President, Mr G. O’Connor, who welcomed than and the large crowd.  Mr O’Connor told the story of the reconstruction.  They had not at first realised the size of the task, but that had been compensated for by the degree of satisfaction at its completion.  During the resiting some of the massive stones had been broken and new ones had to be cut.  The bricks had crumbled to dust and had to be replaced.  The new brickwork had not quite the grace and charm of the old, but a century of Burra winters will mellow it.  He called on Sir Mark to perform the ceremony.

[Sir Mark’s speech is printed.]

A vote of thanks was moved by Major General G.W. Symes, Vice-President of the National Trust of SA.
