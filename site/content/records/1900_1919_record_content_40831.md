Various hotel employees gave evidence which largely corroborated the Queale version of events.  They tried to put Clark in the best possible light and said he was sober and tried to suggest at least some degree of provocation on Queale’s part.

The charge against Queale was dismissed and the costs of it awarded against Clark for £5-4-0.  On his charge Clark was fined £5 including costs.
