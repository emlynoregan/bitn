Mt Bryan School has been successful in its application to the P21 Ecologically Sustainable Development Project for a grant of $5,000 to upgrade the watering system for student seed propagation/district revegetation projects and to use less bore water.  The old system suffered breakdowns and leaks etc. leading to water wastage.  The new system of poly pipes, a timer and pop-up sprinklers etc. will greatly improve water use.  The students have long been involved in Trees for Life and Greening Australia projects.  School principal Angela Arbon wrote the application and both she and the school are delighted to have been successful.
