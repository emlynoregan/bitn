Burra Town Council, 26 November

Larrikins have destroyed some trees at Aberdeen.

£5 reward is offered for their conviction.

St Joseph’s anniversary services were held last Sunday.  Rev. Fr Peters SJ preached to large congregations.  On Monday evening there was a concert by the children of the school in the Institute, which was a decided success.

Editorial on the messy state of affairs in Parliament with the Government evidently convinced its tax proposal will not pass the Legislative Council.

Mr T. Warnes declines to stand for Mayor as he is about to leave the district.

Ratepayers’ Meeting for Middle Ward in the Institute, 23 November.

Dr Brummitt spoke on his candidature for the Mayoralty.  He had no intention of standing, but a large requisition had convinced him to do so.  He laboured under the disadvantage of lack of experience as a Councillor.  He could not promise great works, as their money was limited.  Previous loans need to be repaid.  About £800 would be available over the three wards.

The question of ward boundaries was worth consideration.  The footway from Kooringa to Aberdeen needed making, but would need to wait until the responsibility for main roads vested in the Council.

Mr Duff spoke as candidate for Middle Ward, but said little.

The Mayor’s Report for 1883.

The year began with a debit of £2-3-4 and South Ward was heavily in debt to Middle Ward.  After deducting debts North Ward had £295, Middle Ward £395 and South Ward £68.  The money in hand for the town survey was later made available for works by ratepayer permission which increased ward totals to: North £425, Middle £525, South £198.  At present the balance was: North £13, Middle £22, South debit £1-8-11.  He anticipated the new Council would start the year 1884 with a clean sheet apart from the bonded debt, of which £100 will fall due in 1884.

During the year various waterworks proposals were considered.  Ultimately the scheme decided on was the proposal of the Government to construct a waterworks and a system of mains etc. and to hand the scheme over to the Council with the latter to pay 3% on capital costs in the 1st year, 4% in the 2nd year and 5% per annum thereafter.  The Council would control the scheme and retain any profits over this annual rental and running costs.  A number of people have guaranteed to take a specified amount of water.  It is believed water could be temporarily laid on from the present works pending completion of the new reservoir.

The Recreation Ground has been planted and sown, but the grass seed has not come up.  The trees are doing well.  The place will become popular in time but as yet there is no revenue to offset the large outlay.   The present debt exclusive of the £500 in bonds is in all £163-17-10.

The Local Board of Health has continued scavenging and inspection and the town is in a good sanitary condition.

The cemetery has been maintained and improvements made so its account is in debit £66-3-2, but this will gradually decrease.

The most notable work in Middle Ward is the road through the Smelting Works from Kooringa to Redruth.  Mt Pleasant St has been made and Market Square kerbing completed and the Square raised.  In South Ward the work included new bridges and raising the road in Queen St.
