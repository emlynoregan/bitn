The Wesleyan Church was built in 1847 before which services were held in the house of John Chapman.  Rev. John Harcourt was the first minister and lived in the first parsonage built by T. Thomas.  The first choir was led by the late Captain Deeble.  The church was enlarged in the ministry of Rev. H.A. Wilson 1854-58 and when Rev. C.R. Flock came for the second term in 1858 a gallery was erected.  The present church was erected under the ministry of Rev. J.H. Nield in 1914.  The present minister is Rev. H. Hobbs.
