Weather

November was very dry and farmers were preparing to harvest grain following several centuries.  The eastern pastoral areas have been in drought.  It began to rain on Wednesday and continued through the week with falls of from 3 to 5 inches.

Until Saturday night the rain had been fairly light, but constant with only a few heavy showers.  Thundery conditions on Saturday and Sunday brought much heavier falls and run-off resulting in some washaways and damage to fencing.  Some water catchments to the east were replenished, but not to the same extend as in the inside country.  Most wheat seems to be standing the wet quite well with only a few reports of ‘shooting’. 

Some barley and oats crops have been badly affected.  Considerable sheep losses have been reported due to the sudden change in temperatures and crowding in the corners of paddocks, leading to smothering.  Losses of up to 300 and perhaps more have been mentioned.  Overall these have been the best pastoral rains for years.

During the week Booborowie reported 343 points, Hallett 362, Mt Bryan 451, Burra 384, World’s End 327 and Mt Bryan East 431.  To the east Balah got 212, Braemar 379, Woolgangi 309, Redcliffe 500, Koomooloo 290, Pine Valley, 358, Old Koomooloo 300, Glenora 359, Thistlebeds 448, Baldina 480 and Mallett 400.
