The Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel was reopened after being temporarily closed for the purpose of being ceiled, floored and plastered.    A graceful little pulpit and pew for the choir were also added.  A tea meeting was held to mark the event on Monday 12 June.  About 170 attended and a public meeting followed.  Rev. J. Harcourt gave an address.  He made reference to a charge made by some of the misappropriation of an amount received towards the building of the chapel about a year back.  He said many of the promised subscriptions of that time had never actually been made, and as to a sum said to have been left in the office, he knew nothing.  All he could say was that only £9 had been received at the time referred to.  The present improvements had cost £73, which with the original debt of c. £16 had been by voluntary donations etc. and a grant of £25 from the Contingency fund, cleared off to within the amount of £13, during the last three weeks.  Three local preachers then gave addresses.
