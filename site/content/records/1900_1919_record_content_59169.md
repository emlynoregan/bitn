Burra Bowling Club.

A meeting is called for Wednesday next to consider a possible club site.  The site below the school that was recently planted by the school children was considered, but copper in the soil has killed most of the trees.  A site near the swing bridge is considered possible for a bowling green, croquet lawn & tennis courts.  Another site suggested is in Upper Thames St on a portion of the Council Depot.  On Monday evening a deputation will put these proposals to the Council.
