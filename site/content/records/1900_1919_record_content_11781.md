The Aberdeen Ballast Quarries have been used from time to time to provide work in hard times.  Sometimes up to 35 men have been employed.  Work again started on Monday morning last and a large amount of ballast is required so it seems an extended period of employment will be available.  At present the full complement of workers is not available due to shearing, but when that is over this source of work will be appreciated.
