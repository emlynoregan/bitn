Roy G. Jeffery, as Secretary of the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee responds to the concerns of ‘Ratepayer’

I repeat for Ratepayer’s edification that the financing of the swimming pool project is entirely in the hands of the Swimming Pool Committee and the Town Council will not be required to advance, lend or give one penny to the scheme unless it desires to do so.  We hope to show him what can be done with a little co-operation and good wishes from the community.  We do not ask for financial help from ratepayers as financially burdened as ‘Ratepayer’ apparently is.  None of his rates will be used for this purpose.  The Swimming Pool Committee will have sole control over all receipts and expenditure.  The fund will not even be incorporated into the Council books of finance.  I was amazed at ‘Ratepayer’s’ statement about an address given by a Bank representative at the public meeting.  He had the welfare of the town and children at heart and is only too willing to show his interest in a practical way.

‘It is about time we all sat up and said “Burra CAN do it” and forget the old slogan – “This is Burra – it can’t be done.”’

‘Ratepayer’ responds to the Editor, accusing him of trying to induce the public to believe the Council is in control of plenty of money and therefore the acceptance of the possibility of another heavy commitment is of no importance.

He says, ‘I have it on good authority that . . .the Bank is jittery on the Council’s overdraft.’

‘Ratepayer’ says he thinks the Council is doing well under adverse conditions.  As for the £800, he thinks ratepayer apathy on that occasion allowed the debt to be incurred and he hopes to stir them to be more awake this time, whereas the Editor seems keen to lull them into a false sense of security.

The Editor again adds a comment to the effect that he was merely trying to see there was a true statement of facts in fairness to the Council.  The Council can be controlled by the ratepayers in such matters, if it is their desire.  The only role of the Council as far as the Editor can see in the swimming pool case is to seek a grant from the Government, which is made available through the SA Government Tourist Bureau.  To receive the £1,500 the Swimming Pool Committee would have to have (or the equivalent of) £1,500 in hand.
