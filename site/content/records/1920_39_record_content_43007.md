Burra Town Council, 15 August

The Members for the District have written to the Mayor saying £4,000is to be spent on the Burra water supply.

The AA seeks support in seeing that motor taxation is spent on roads – supported via letter on the same matter to local MPs.

Improvements to creek crossings are desirable to allow lambs to get to market in a clean condition.  Sales firms are to be asked to fund pipes and the Council to provide concrete and labour.
