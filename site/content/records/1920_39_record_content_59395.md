Burra Town Council, 6 January

A.T. Pearce has applied to transfer his betting shop from Moorhead St to Best Place.  Council decision was deferred.

Cr Kellaway moved a minute of appreciation be recorded for the splendid effort of the Mayor in obtaining the handsome suite of furniture for the Council Chamber, which was being used for the first time on this occasion.  It was a credit to the Mayor’s forethought and to the townspeople and was a fitting way to honour the State Centenary and the Diamond Jubilee of the Corporation.  The Mayor had obtained over £100 from citizens.

The Mayor thanked Cr Kellaway for his motion.  The furniture previously in use was a disgrace and when distinguished visitors came it had reflected credit on neither the Council nor the citizens of Burra.

The motion was carried.

The Mayor read Christmas greetings from the Lord Provost of Aberdeen, Scotland.

A.L. Bence offered prizes of 15/- and 5/- for the best two letters to Father Christmas.

First prize went to Verona Brown aged 6 of Wildildie, Mongolata.

Second prize went to Barbara Jennison of Aberdeen aged 6.

A special second prize was awarded to Mavis Shipway of Mongolata aged 6.

Joy Pascoe submitted the most humorous letter:

‘Dear Santa Claus, will you please give me a doll and a posher and a sume more things for us.  My grandmother noes a boy who set a rabbit trap to catch you but you dint come that way when you cum to our place I will show you wher mums cake is and you have sum, wake me up and show me your things and how you go up the chimley all our sox are ther.
