Burra & District Hospital Auxiliary held its AGM 2 May and elected: President, Mrs Di Beinke; Treasurer, Mrs L. Osterhage and Secretary, Mrs J. Berryman.  The guest speaker was Pam Dean who gave an interesting talk about her work as an occupational therapist.  During the year the Melbourne Cup Committee gave $1,500, which enabled the Auxiliary to purchase a sewing machine for the Day Care Centre.

[A list of items donated by the Auxiliary to the Hospital and Day Care Centre since 1980 is printed.]
