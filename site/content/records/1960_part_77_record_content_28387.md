Burra Primary School Welfare Club 1965 Report.

There were 55 financial members and an average attendance of over 30.

The year’s opening balance was £114-7-9 and is now £150-15-0.

During the year we purchased sports equipment, library books, towel racks, clocks, equipment for the oval, art materials and teachers’ aids.  The school did not go to the Inter-School Sports at Hallett this year, but held its own sports day where more students could participate.  On that occasion the Welfare Club raised £57-11-9 at a trading table, a raffle and an afternoon tea.  The main drive this year was held in conjunction with BHS School Committee, the High School Council and the Parents & Friends to reach the target of £1,000 for a reference library.  In that effort we were successful.  At present the room to house the library is being prepared.  Fans will be installed in the prefabricated rooms as soon as possible.
