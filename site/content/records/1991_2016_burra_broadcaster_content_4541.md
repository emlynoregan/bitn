Burra Burra DC will address its work practices in accordance with the heritage status of Burra so that they do not adversely affect heritage.  These practices include kerbing, bollards, stormwater, pavements, roads, street lighting, traffic islands, street furniture, landscaping and signage.

The draft street tree policy has been adopted and Council has approved the planting of trees on the travelling stock route above the oval and smelts area.

A sub-committee has been formed to deal with the Burra J150 Wheelbarrow Push.
