Letter.  Tiffany Murray writes as her term as Project Manager at Burra Cultural Centre comes to an end.  She was pleased to have seen the Town Hall gain an industrial kitchen, a state of the art Telecentre, a wonderful Mary Warnes Meeting Room and new stage lighting system and new stage curtains.  She introduced Carly Heinrich, who was located in the Community Internet & Computer Centre and had taken over Town Hall Bookings from 1 July.
