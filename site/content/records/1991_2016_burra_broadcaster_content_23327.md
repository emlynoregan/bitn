Burra Show had a damp and drizzly day, but many still made their annual pilgrimage.  There was plenty to see inside and outside the pavilions with some interesting trade sites, great food stalls, a sideshow alley and even dodgem cars.

Four popular crowd pleasers were the demonstrations by the Burra & District Obedience Dog Club, the ute competitions, the shearing and the visit from the early model Holden cars.

The popular family band ‘Strict-LEE-Us’ played outside the Flower Pavilion.  Graham Gunn MP performed the opening and was introduced by Show President Ron Shipard.  After the opening, seven people were honoured with life memberships of the Burra Burra Show Society, namely: Tom Broad, Graham Kellock, Peter Stockman, Bill Keane, Rex and Hazel Stockman and Ron Shipard.   The judging of the Prince and Princess of the Show attracted interest and the winners were: Prince, Christiaan Cunningham and Princess, Priscilla Robinson.

[A number of winners of specific prizes are then listed.]
