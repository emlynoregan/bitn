Mouse Plague?  High mouse numbers have been reported for the Mid North, Murray Mallee, Eyre Peninsula and Yorke Peninsula.  Stubble management in early autumn will reduce cover and reduce mouse numbers, but this must be balanced with the need for erosion control.  In last yearâ€™s plague between 300,000 and 400,000 hectares were treated with bait.  Losses of yield in the worst areas reached 30% and 5% in those least affected.
