Letters to the Editor.

`An old COUNCILLOR' writes complaining that Council had appointed the Inspector at £75 p.a. when a tender from an equally suitable person was received at £45.

Another letter, explaining in some detail Mr Lipsett's resignation from the church during Mr Campbell's time as pastor, gives a slightly different angle on the question. It was signed:

William Pearce Sen.	Phillip Lane	James Phillips John Jenkin	Joseph Roberts
