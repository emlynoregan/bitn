CAFHS. (Formerly the M & BHA) No report is printed concerning the special meeting on 30 March to consider the future of the clinic, but in this issue the Mrs SA Woman ’83 Fundraising Committee announces that it will conduct the annual Mothers’ Day Street Stall because the CAFHS is unable to do so, which rather suggests that the CAFHS has ceased to function in Burra, though see 7 July 1983 for notice of its AGM.
