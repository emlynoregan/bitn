Mrs W.H. Hardy, who is well over 70, had a nasty accident last week.  When dressed for bed she had a fall in the kitchen and remained there all night.  Colin Parker, who delivers milk to her, noticed the can was not out and called back later.  Getting no reply, he told M-C Armstrong who heard a faint voice and broke in, to find Mrs Hardy on the floor with a nasty cut on the face.  Some years ago she had a stroke and lost the use of her left arm.  Having fallen on her right side, she was unable to get up.  She was removed to the Hospital and is doing well.
