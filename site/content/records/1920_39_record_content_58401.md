The other Councillors thought Cr Jennings had a legitimate grievance.

Cr Jennison complained that he paid an annual licence fee of Â£1 per bowser and yet his clients could not get in.

[This debate seems to have gone nowhere very definite before a question was asked about whether the area around the Rotunda was a parking area.]

The Mayor said it was a parking area.

The Councillors generally disagreed with him.

Cr Jeffery said that when City Motors Holden Ltd parked their cars there recently all the numbers had been taken and he asked what the result of that was.

The Mayor said permission had been given.

Discussion then turned to the matter of the block on the day the Adelaide-Burra cycle race was run.

Councillors said they were all out to help sport, but the whole position needed to clarification.

The Mayor said he disliked a whole lot of by-laws.

Cr Dow queried whether Council had the power to waive by-laws.

Cr Jeffrey said he brought the question up because the poor attendance at a recent Band Concert had been put down to people fearing they would be fined for parking there.

The Mayor said their fear was ill-founded as nothing had been done in Council.

Finally Cr Jeffrey moved that on particular occasions the Town Clerk be empowered to alter regulations.  After a long argument this motion was carried.
