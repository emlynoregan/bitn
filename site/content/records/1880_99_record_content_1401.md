Midland Road Board.  Mr Rush, Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC waited on the board to have the Kooringa-Mt Bryan Road put on the schedule of main roads and was told he should have waited on the Commissioner of Public Works.

Report on the state of the Burra Leighton Road.  [Following the recent conflict over the quality of the road metal being used.]  35 yd3 of metal have been condemned, but the other charges brought by Mr Killicoat are not sustained.  The contractor, Mr Fuss, has done nothing beyond the partial delivery of 200 yd3 of bottom metal for widening the road and repairing parts of it.

[There is then discussion of whose jurisdiction the road lies in - as it runs along the boundary of the Hundreds of Ayers and Hanson and is included in the Hundred of Hanson.  Some lies within the jurisdiction of the North Midland Road Board.  Much more detail is provided.]
