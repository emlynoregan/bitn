Roaring 40s Waterloo Wind Farm was opened by Premier Mike Rann last week.  The managing director Steve Symons said they were looking to slightly extend the Waterloo farm and construct ones at Stony Gap and Robertstown.

Hundreds of people attended the companyâ€™s open day at the Waterloo farm.  (In excess of 300.)  The public had a chance to see the turbines up close and to ask questions in relation to the project and wind farms in general.  The company has two full-time staff members living in the region and Vestas who supplied and will maintain the turbines has approximately six full time staff living in the area.  The project has seen sponsorship of a number of local community groups and the improvement of local roads and infrastructure. [Phot of Mike Rann & reporters.]

A small group of protesters also turned out for the event.  [Photo of protesters.]
