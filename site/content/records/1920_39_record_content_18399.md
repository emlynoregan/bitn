Burra Hospital Board, 25 January

Dr Steele wrote approving the suggested design for an isolation ward, with a few minor alterations.

No scheme has yet been evolved to raise funds, but they had about £800 in hand and believed the Government would offer at least a 15/- in the £ subsidy.

Dr Dowling of Adelaide will be Dr Steel’s locum for a fortnight from 3 February.

Sister Carita of St Joseph’s Convent, who has been a resident for 17 years, has gone to the Brompton Convent and Sister Melita who was here some time ago has returned.
