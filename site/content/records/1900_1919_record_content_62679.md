Caterpillar Traction.

There is a report on A.J. & P.A. McBride’s 45 H.P. Caterpillar and four 5-ton wagons, which have been placed in use on their Yardea Station, under the supervision of F.C. Custance.

They left fully loaded from Torrensville at 6 a.m. 3 November loaded with 16 tons.  They made 25 miles a day to Pt Augusta.  Horrocks Pass was negotiated in top gear and the speed of 2½ m.p.h. was unvarying.  The cost was 4⅓d per ton mile or about ⅓ normal cartage costs.  After Pt Augusta they travelled via Yorky’s Crossing and soft sand and clay were no obstacles.
