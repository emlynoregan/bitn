Mr Pinch was born in the Parish of St Maybn Cornwall, near Bodmin on 2 November 1828, where he lived till 21.  He left Plymouth for Australia in the Duke of Bedford and arrived in Adelaide c. 12 November in the same year.  [This statement is not clear.  If he turned 21 before leaving, he arrived in 1850, but it may be suggesting he arrived in the same year in which he turned 21, which would be 1849.]  Mrs Pinch was born Frances Hicks in 1822 in Mevagissey and came to Australia in the same boat.  Mr Pinch proposed on the trip, but they were not married until they had settled in Burra.  Mr Pinch was engaged by G.S. Walters Esq. to bring the first team of horses to Burra for the Patent Copper Co. (Later called the English & Australian Copper Co.) He worked for the Copper Co. for 10 months and then for the Burra Mines for over 20 years.  Having made a dugout home in the Burra Creek he was married by Rev. J.C. Bagshaw in the church on Limestone Hill.  He subsequently bought a farm at Pencarrow (784 acres) and carried on farming, dairying and stockbreeding for some 18 years.  He then sold it to J. Cockrum, but subsequently repurchased it, turned it over to his son-in-law, and retired to Redruth.  He has since been Councillor for the Burra District Council for three years and for some time Chairman.  He also served two years on the Burra Town Council and is presently a member of the Hospital Board.  He has been a member of the Oddfellows MU for 48 years and is a Past Master of the Burra Lodge of Freemasons.  He used to run a night school with students at 1/- a week to learn reading and writing.  While Mr Pinch is in robust health at 71, his wife is very feeble.  He lived in the creek until a brick house was built at Redruth.  He carried every bit of timber from Kooringa to Redruth on his back and put the roof on as in those days teams were scarce and cartage costs would have exceeded the value of the timber.  The timber yard was where Bagot, shakes & Lewis office now stands.  When ¾ of the roof was on he moved in and sold his dugout for £3 to a friend who paid 30/- down – a short time later came the flood which washed out the dugouts.  Mr Pinch’s house was, except for a very temporary police station, the first house in Redruth and he was among the first to buy allotments.  One of the inmates of the lockup then got out and attended the wedding, returning probably before the warders noticed he had gone.  Celebrations were rather quiet on account of Mrs Pinch’s poor health.  Mr & Mrs Pinch are the only couple married in Burra who have lived here to celebrate their Golden Wedding.  They have two daughters, Mrs Josiah Thomas of ‘Three Trees’ and Mrs E.N. Finch of ‘Pencarrow’ and nine grandchildren.
