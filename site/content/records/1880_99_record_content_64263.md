Legislative Council Elections

Mr Pflaum (Liberal) addressed electors at the Institute on Wednesday with P. Lane in the chair.  He was for federation.  He believed that large estates in suitable country should be cut up and he favoured workingmen’s blocks near towns.  He was for the conservation of water, believed pastoral rents should be low, was for productive public works and the Outer harbour, but was against higher land tax and thought they could do with fewer MPs.  He supported an old-age pension but opposed the redistribution of seats on the basis of population.  C. Fuss moved a vote of thanks 2nd by J.C. Sandland.

Views of other Candidates:

Mr Lewis is pro-federation and water conservation.  He opposes the reducing of freehold property qualifications for electors, but would extend leasehold qualifications to those with improvements valued at £200.  He was for the development of the NT and supported government aid for mineral development where there were real prospects of a financial return.

Mr Haslam was pro-federation and favoured agricultural settlement ‘within the line of rainfall’ [Goyder’s Line].  Was for the Produce Dept.  He was an independent candidate who would widen the Legislative Council franchise to some extent.

Mr Jeffs wanted a close watch kept on finances and opposed a property tax.  He believed in fewer MPs.  He favoured the current mix of land and income taxes and supported a railway to the Queensland border, the Bundaleer and Barossa Reservoirs and more liberal mining and pastoral laws.  He was opposed to the redistribution of seats according to population as this would favour centralisation.  He favoured a division of the Legislative Council Districts.  He opposed the present police moiety and alien races.
