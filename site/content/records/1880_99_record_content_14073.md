Editorial on the SA Budget Speech.

The previous Treasurer was accused of wilfully misleading the House by submitting insufficient estimates of expenditure etc.  Without new taxation the colony would end the year down £593,000.  The Government therefore proposed a ½d in the £ land tax and an income tax of 3d in the £ on incomes over £300 and of 6d in the £ on incomes derived from investments.
