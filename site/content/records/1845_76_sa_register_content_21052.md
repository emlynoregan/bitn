The new mine found by Mr Patrick Murphy is also looking promising.

The Princess Royal Mine has recently been inspected by Captain Matthew Bryant.  Some of the ore has proved less rich than expected and this has caused dissatisfaction among the tributers.  But there is still some fine ore waiting at the Smelting Works.

A disturbance occurred recently between some men employed in building a stone wall around a portion of Dr Browneâ€™s Booborowie Run. There was a fight between a party of Irishmen and a party of Cornishmen, in which the Cornishmen were worsted.  It is likely to end up before the Local Court.
