He was born at Reawla, Gwinear, Cornwall on 12 November 1850 and migrated in the St Lawrence in 1875 to New Zealand, coming to Victoria in 1876 and to SA & Burra the following year.  He was an engineer who erected 499 windmills in the town and district.  He was in many of the various brass bands in Burra in his younger days, as a kettle-drummer.  He died from a stroke.
