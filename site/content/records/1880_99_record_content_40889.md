Burra Races are reported in2½ columns.

They took place in Dew’s Paddock 1½ miles west of Kooringa on 25 March.

By 3 p.m. the crowd was estimated at c. 1,000.  The bookmakers had a bad day, being stuck with the longest odds inmost cases.  Ladies attended en masse.

The course was rather heavy in places.  The main race was the Burra Handicap, run over 1½ miles for £40 first prize and £5 for second.  It was won by Mr J. McDonald’s ‘Fiddler’ carrying 8 st 5 lb and ridden by Brown.

Settling up was at the Commercial Hotel that night, but the gathering there was small.

Cricket.  Matches had been arranged for Easter weekend, but failed to take place.

Kapunda was expected to arrive on Saturday, but failed to appear without explanation.

Riverton was expected Monday, but only replied when a telegram was sent to them.

Polo.  On Saturday Burra played a Victorian team [Possibly Camperdown, see XII, 1032, 25 Mar. 1891, Page 3]

Burra 5 goals 11 behinds defeated Victorian Team 1 goal 5 behinds.

Maurice Ledwith writes saying he thinks his sons were taken ill from drinking too much water on a hot day and not from poisoning at the Thistlebeds Well as reported.

Redruth Primitive Methodist Sunday School picnic on Good Friday was at Mr Sandland’s paddock [Sod Hut] and was very enjoyably spent.

The Anniversary was celebrated on Sunday and Monday.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School had their usual Good Friday treat on the church grounds on Friday afternoon.

Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School held its 44th Anniversary last Sunday.  Rev. R.M. Hunter preached.  The congregations were good and the collections up on last year.  On Monday there were children’s sports at the oval and tea at the Sunday School, followed by a public tea meeting.  Mr J. Harry, who has moved to Adelaide, was given a Bible and Hymn Book in recognition of 15 years connection with the school.  Addresses were given by Rev. J.M. Rowe, Rev. R.M. Hunter & Mr W. Sleep.
