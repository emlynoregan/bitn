Unicorn Brewery

The streets were lined with more than 500 locals and visitors on Sunday morning for the Unicorn Brewery Parade, heralding the re-establishment of the historic Burra Brewery.  [Though the company actually had no brewery either in Burra or anywhere else!]  The parade was led by the SA Pipes & Drums, followed by the pair of Unicorn Brewery Clydesdales hauling a trolley.  Brewery Director Jason Watters then led a majestic white ‘unicorn’.  [Photo.]

At the Brewery Rev. Michael Hillier blessed the unicorn, the people and the brewery.  Rowan Ramsey Federal MP for Grey then declared the Unicorn Brewery open and the crowd then enjoyed the beer, food and the rest of the day’s activities.  There was a barbecue and pancakes in the adjacent picnic area.

According to Mr Watters the low carb ‘Horny Blonde’ was popular with all, but especially the ladies.  Men were somewhat more drawn to the Miners XXX Stout.  Unicorn Pale Ale, he said, was more of a favourite with drinkers from the urban area.  Sales exceeded expectations and the firm donated a carton of beer to be auctioned to raise funds for the McGuiness/McDermott Foundation for Children with Cancer.  Purchasers of the carton returned it several times and ultimately $5,000 was raised.

The SA Pipes and Drums concert in the Burra Town Hall with the Highland Dancers attracted about 80 to attend.
