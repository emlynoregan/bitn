[A Royal Tour by King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret was planned for ten weeks in 1949.  It would have included every state and the royal visitors were to have been in SA 27 May to 3 June, but on 23 November 1948 it was deferred indefinitely due to the king’s poor health – he had lost the feeling in one leg due to circulation problems.]
