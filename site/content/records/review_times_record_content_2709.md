Burra DC is considering applying for a Bicentennial Grant to replace the $210,000 grant which was re-allocated to another Jubilee 150 project.  A spokesman for the Jubilee 150 Board said a decision on which project would get the money would not be made till late October.  Council’s Planning & Administration Officer Mr John Brak said the Council would consider applying for a larger grant for the Copper Interpretive Centre, which the architect originally said would cost about $450,000.  The fulfilment of the original plan would be their first objective, but they would also consider alternative ideas.  One alternative would be the restoration of all of the mine buildings and of shafts so that tourists could go underground.  Council also had a new submission for a grant for upgrading the Burra-Morgan Road.

Market Square redevelopment has begun with the undergrounding of power lines.  This will add to the aesthetics of the area and enhance the heritage value said Mr John Brak.  It would also reduce ETSA’s maintenance costs.  The Council wanted to underground power lines where possible and in 1980 had done so along Bridge Terrace to restore the streetscape to as close to original as possible.  [Photo.]
