Burra Cheer-up Society.

Last Tuesday the Ladiesâ€™ band etc. welcomed Sgt Leslie Kellaway.

On Tuesday they welcomed Cpl J.H. Beerworth, whose mother lives in Kooringa.

On Thursday the usual crowd was reduced by influenza and only 10 of the band turned up to greet Cpl Reg. Hopcraft, Sgt W.C.F. Rule and their English brides.
