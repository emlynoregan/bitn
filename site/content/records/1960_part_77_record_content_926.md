Souvenir Supplement to the ‘Burra Record’

Official opening of the Burra & District Swimming Pool

30 January 1960 at 3 p.m. by Mr G. Stanley Hawker.  [Photos of the pool, Mr Hawker & Mr Roy G. Jeffery.]

The cost of the pool was met by numerous donations of cash, Government subsidy, donated materials and much voluntary labour.  Despite competing with other appeals that raised something like £5,000 during the same period – the Town Hall Supper Room, The Murray Flood Appeal and the War Memorial Oval.

In 1956 it was drawn to the attention of the Burra Progress Association that only 14% of Burra children could swim.  They decided it was time to make that 100%.  Several previous attempts had failed to raise the money for a pool, but they were undeterred.

Approximately 170 people attended a public meeting on 2 March 1956 in Burra Town Hall.  The Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone listed the pros and cons and said any committee elected to carry out the project would need to convince Council that it would not become a liability.

Mr H.J. Topsfield outlined the proposed scheme.  Members of the Progress Association had concluded it was too big a project for them and needed district support.  Mr C.A. Brooks as Acting Supervisor of Physical Education spoke strongly in favour and so did Messrs H.C. Cummins, I. Trigwell, R.G. Jeffery and H.J.B. Jennison.

A motion to proceed was passed unanimously and a committee was formed.  It met first on 3 March 1956.  H.J. Topsfield was Chairman and Mr B.E. Gryst of the Savings Bank in Burra was elected Treasurer with R.G. Jeffery, Headmaster of Burra High School as Secretary.  Mr D. Bednall [solicitor] undertook to draft a constitution and rules.  Discussion and public consultation moved on to site selection.  Visits were made to Mt Barker & Nuriootpa pools.  Both those pools were self-supporting.

On 22 March 1956 it was decided that the pool would be 100 feet x 30 feet with a depth ranging from 3 feet to 9 feet.  On 17 April 1956 a subscription list was opened to try to raise £1,000.

A deputation waited on the Council to see whether the Council would apply for a £1,500 Government subsidy and if they would appropriate a site for the pool.  By 15 May 1956 £246-13-6 had been raised and the Government advised that it would grant a subsidy of £1,500.  By 9 June 1956 £400 had been raised.  The army advised that the Drill Hall site would not become available and the present site was then selected.

By early August the fund stood close to £500.

The River Murray floods that year then occurred and this no doubt slowed subscriptions.  Excavation work began on 14 August 1956, but before it could be completed the equipment was needed for emergency work along the flooded river.

By 28 August the fund had reached £572, but meanwhile the Flood Appeal had reached £1,089.

The architect Keith Shaw talked with the Committee and the builders Messrs C. Parker, Bill Robinson, Len Taylor and Bert Cornelius.

By the end of 1956 £800 had been raised for the pool.

In the first three months of 1957 considerable preparatory ground work was done.  The annual meeting in March 1957 saw the fund at £817 and the principal officers were re-elected.

On 2 June 1957 sixty-five men at a working bee gave 312 man-hours of work worth £120.  The first section of the floor was laid.  The second section followed a fortnight later, having been delayed by rain.  The final section was laid on 7 July.

In August 1957 the fund reached £1,007.  A further application for a Government grant of £1,500 was made.  The walls were poured by the end of November and the setting up of the concrete surrounds began.  In February 1958 the walls and floor were sealed.  The pool was slowly filled beginning on 7 February 1958.  The pool was next fenced.  Rural Youth contributed 146 hours of labour in June 1958.  A toddlers’ pool was planned.  Retaining wall and work on planting the slopes etc. followed.  In November 1958 £500 was urgently needed for dressing sheds, kiosk etc. which were estimated to cost £900 to £1,000.  This meant £500 had to be raised to qualify for a £500 subsidy.  Quite quickly a variety of means raised about £270 and foundations were poured and bricks obtained.

[The wading pool was completed on 10 August 1959] On 7 December a working bee painted the wading pool and donations reached over £500.  At the end of the school year in 1958 Mr R.G. Jeffery was transferred to Cleve.

[Although there were no changing rooms at this time] the pool was available for the Education Department’s Learn to Swim Campaign from 5 to 16 January 1959.  154 children enrolled and 100 gained certificates. The instructors were Messrs Tom Bowden & Grenville Ireland.  Check the timeline in 1958-59.  In this report it gets rather jumbled.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WHEN 1959 HAS BEEN NOTED.

On 22 January 1959 it was decided to appoint a caretaker and to postpone the official opening till the following season when the pool would really be completed.
