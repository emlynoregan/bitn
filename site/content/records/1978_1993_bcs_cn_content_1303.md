Burra Conservation Study: A Summary

In 1977 the Burra Burra DC became increasingly aware of the importance of Burra, not only in terms of its history, but also the charm and beauty of its old stone buildings.  They recognised the need to develop an overall plan to allow development without interfering with the townâ€™s essential character.  They applied for a grant for the purpose of a conservation study.

This was published in September 1978 and has been widely acclaimed and in part has been seen as a blueprint for other State Governments to use for their historic towns.

The study was done in two parts.

Part 1 was completed by Ian Auhl and Steve Gilbert.  It identified the precincts of Burra, the important historic buildings and rated them in terms of their importance and need for preservation and made suggestions for their future.

Part 2 was completed by the firm of Lester, Firth and Murton.  They worked with a steering committee comprising local people from the District Council, National Trust, Department of Urban and Regional Affairs and the Department of the Environment.  The purpose of this part was to analyse the character of Burra and set objectives and policies to guide the future conservation and development of the town and prepare practical guidelines for specific areas of Burra itself.

Over the next few weeks we will print selected portions from the study to give some idea of the importance of the study and the importance of Burra itself.
