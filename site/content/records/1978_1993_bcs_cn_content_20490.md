Bronwyn Alcorn, a young visitor in Year 5 at school from Kangaroo Island was staying with her family in Paxton Square.  She visited St Mary’s and developed a desire to hear its pipe organ.  As a result Mum and Bronwyn got up early on Sunday for the 8 a.m. service.  Sadly both organists were away so it was one of the few services without music.  She took the disappointment well, but over the post service cuppa Joan Dare made a quick visit to Olive Oates’ home nearby, with the result that at 3 p.m. on Monday Bronwyn and family were treated to their own special organ recital with Olive at the console.
