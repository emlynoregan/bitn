Chris McCabe was the prime mover in its establishment.

The first issues were produced from typed stencils.

The last issue used computer type setting.

It has depended on co-operation in every facet of its production.

For her ‘Hear and There’ was a column that stemmed from her days of writing ‘Out and About’ for the Burra Record.

While the publication was never in direct competition with the Broadcaster the decreasing number of volunteers meant that the committee had to accept the inevitable rather than place too great a burden on too few people.

Cameron Grover writes regretting that this was the last issue of Burra School & Community News and points to its importance as a means of preserving a historical record of the town and surrounding districts during a period that a newspaper was not being published – as well as a means of communicating school news and sports results.  He thanks all associated with its success and production on behalf of the School and Community News Committee.

Chris Reed as Chairman of the Burra Community School Council adds his thanks and acknowledgement of the efforts of the group that produced the paper for the past sixteen years, echoing what has already been said and adding thanks especially to the major donors over the years: the Burra Apex Club, Burra traders, The Burra Burra District Council and the Burra Community School.
