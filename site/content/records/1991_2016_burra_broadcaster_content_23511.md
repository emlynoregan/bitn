Burra Community Library has received two old books of historic interest.  One is a ledger from the Burra Burra Mines 1865-69 detailing stores bought by the mining company.  The other is a sales ledger belonging to Bob Lottâ€™s father covering the period 1922-30.  These donations come from the Lott family.  The library has also received some old papers found in the cellar of the Burra Electric Supply Co. building.  The minute books of the recently closed Hanson Agricultural Bureau have been copied before the originals were sent to Adelaide for preservation there.
