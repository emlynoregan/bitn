In favour of good roads.

Have sunk upwards of £14,000 in mining.

Would like to see mineral lands available almost free to working men and smelting houses dotted around like flour mills so they could make good returns.

Not in favour of secular education.  The Bible must be used in schools – the Catholic version in theirs and the other sects theirs.

Was for free distillation.

Favoured the American system of payment of members’ travelling expenses.

Dr Webb proposed Mr Neales and this was carried.

[Mr Kingston’s speech is generally not reported except for his defence of some positions outlined at the Kooringa meeting.  He was proposed by Peter Brady and seconded by Mr Evans.  The motion was carried with two dissentions; those of Mr Dale and Dr Webb.]

Election Meeting at Clare.  On Friday 26 April Mr John Jonas chaired a meeting at Smith’s Hotel.

Dr Webb explained the reasons for the withdrawal of Mr Clark.

[Mr Neales speech was similar to that reported from Mintaro.]

Mr W. Dale then proposed Mr Neales and a show of hand showed in his favour by a considerable majority.
