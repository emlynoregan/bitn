Cr Linkson disputed the planting methods of both years.

Cr Parks accused Cr Linkson of disparaging the Mayor.

Cr Linkson said he would prove his remarks correct.

The Mayor observed that Cr Linkson had used the words ‘untrue statement’ and thought that was going too far and demanded to be treated with respect.

Cr Hardy then tried to move something at the indulgence of Council, but the reporter could not hear what he was saying.

Cr Linkson then asked to make a personal explanation.  He said that last meeting Cr Harris had said that it was a good thing that certain remarks of Cr Linkson’s re the quarries were not published.  Cr Linkson considered the words were only used to injure his business – he had said no more than any other Councillor.  It would have been better if the assertion of Cr Harris had not been inserted in the Record.

Cr Harris said he was unaware that the Mayor had suggested to the reporter that the quarries discussion not appear in print and he had thought it was done behind the screen.

Cr Hardy then moved they go into committee.

Passed on the casting vote of the Mayor with the support of Crs Parks, Harris & Hardy.

Crs Linkson, Walsh and West left with the public, declaring they would not transact business behind closed doors.
