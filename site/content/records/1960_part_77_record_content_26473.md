Burra National Trust continues to collect items of historical interest for its museum.  Mr R. Fuss has donated many items of historical value and has made a perfect replica of a Cornish wheelbarrow.  Mrs Jessie Rooke has given an old reaping machine and a cart.  The Trust is seeking a two furrow plough and a German wagon.
