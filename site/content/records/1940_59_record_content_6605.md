Buffalo Lodge Grand Ball was held last Wednesday evening. Proceeds will aid the comfort of fighting forces overseas.  Lodge Primo Bro. E.T. Baulderstone introduced the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott, who opened the ball.  So far the local lodge had 21 members serving in the armed services.  Decorations in the hall had been kept to a minimum to save money and a screen of massed blue gum along the platform was the only concession made apart from some Iceland poppies on the supper tables.
