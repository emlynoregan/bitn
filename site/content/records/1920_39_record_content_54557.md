Cricket.  On 19 January St Mary’s Blues and St Mary’s Reds played a good first day of a two-day game, but on 26 January St Mary’s Reds forfeited, apparently for no reason, since players were available.  On 2 February St Mary’s Reds again forfeited, this time to Aberdeen Colts.  It they do not intend carrying on they should say so.

On 2 February St Mary’s Blues 9 for 120 declared defeated Aberdeen 63 & 42.
