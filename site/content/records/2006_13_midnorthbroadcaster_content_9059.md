The Friends of Burra Parks’ Native Plant Propagation Workshop, held at Farrell Flat on 18 October is reported.

David Potter of Mid North Plant Diversity Nursery demonstrated a variety of methods for propagating native plants from seeds and cuttings.  Brian Teakle, a Karoonda share farmer, has developed specialised equipment and spoke of his experience in successfully establishing 20,000 trees (90 species) and 120,000 Old Man Saltbush in 18 years.  Bob Meyers, a native grass specialist, spoke on the benefits of establishing native grasses on farms and roadsides; an area in which he said SA was dragging its feet.
