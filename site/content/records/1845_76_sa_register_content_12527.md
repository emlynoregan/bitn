Saddleworth News, 20 July

The township better known to old colonists as the ‘Stone Hut’ is beginning to show signs of enterprise and improvement.  If the contemplated trunk railway is built along the Gilbert, a consummation devoutly to be wished by the inhabitants of the township and district, an impetus will be given to develop the resources of the beautiful agricultural country surrounding it.  Among improvements are the stores built by Messrs Sanderson and Campion.  The former is a handsome stone structure fronting the main road to the Burra.  The latter is also substantial and though not presenting so neat an appearance to the eye as Mr Sanderson’s, is equally well fitted for its purpose.
