Wagon Accident at Kooringa

Obituary/Inquest.  On 7 December an inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms before Mr Stowell JP on the death of a boy named James Rankine at Logan’s Gap, with T. Bath as foreman of the jury.

[The Register of 4 December corrected the coroner’s name to J.H. Howell JP not Stowell.]

After viewing the body, which was in an advanced state of decomposition, the following was elicited.

Stephen Sherwood:

Was driving a wagon loaded with coal last Wednesday at 5 or 6 o’clock near the Mule Camp at Logan’s Gap.  The deceased and another boy were riding on the load.  About a mile from the camp the boy Cock took up the keg for a drink and then got off behind.  When putting the keg right, I heard a screech and looking back saw the deceased getting up from the ground.  Stopped the wagon immediately, but did not know the wheel had passed over him.  Saw that his hands were wounded, but did not think him seriously hurt, as he got up without assistance and walked away with the other boy, getting through the fence into the paddock.  Cannot say whether deceased was getting down or fell from the front of the wagon.

Isaac Cock aged about 14 confirmed the above and added that the deceased was getting down from the front of the wagon when he slipped and fell.  Was unaware of the seriousness of the injury except to his hands.  Went with deceased through the paddock to within about half a mile of where his mother lives and then went to tend cattle.  The wheel went across the stomach of the deceased, but he did not then complain of any pain.

Mary Ann Williams said that about 4 a.m. on Thursday morning she and other women were crossing the paddock to Mrs Rankine’s when they found James Rankine lying apparently dead.  His mother came soon afterwards and they had asked him where it hurt and he had said his belly.  He at first denied the wheel had gone over him because his mother had forbidden him to go on the road, but afterwards said Sherwood had asked him to help with the horses and he had fallen from the wagon and the wheel passed over him.  Got some men to carry him home, where he died at 2 or 3 p.m.  His mother had heard of the accident and they had been searching for him all the evening.  The night had been very cold and dark.

[Mrs Rankine’s evidence essentially confirmed the above.  She added deceased had left home after dinner on Wednesday and she did not know where he was going, but someone had told her the Mule Camp.  A small girl had told her of the accident.]

Dr T.H. Mayne said the wheel would have caused rupture of the intestines and this would inevitably have proved fatal.  The actions described by the others were quite consistent with this.  Deceased may well have not been in immediate pain, but inflammation would have soon set in with ultimately fatal consequences.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death with no blame attached to the driver of the wagon.

[This death does not appear in SA Death Registrations CD.]
