Christmas Eve in Burra 1910 will be remembered without a doubt as one of the best.  Every business did well and afternoon and evening business was exceptionally brisk.  Purchasers in many instances showed that prosperous times had come along.  Prominent businessmen reported record receipts.  Fruit and cool drink shops did good trade and hotels were crowded.  Youngsters competed to see who could make the most noise.  Crowds were a record since the old mining days.  Good behaviour generally prevailed and ensured one of the most pleasant Christmas Eves ever in Burra.
