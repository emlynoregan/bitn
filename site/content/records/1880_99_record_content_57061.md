* This may seem to be an unexceptional comment, but probably the implication was that the North Ward Councillors were in favour of accepting a lower tender if it came from another Ward whereas North Ward ratepayers would expect the tender to go to a local man, even if it cost somewhat more.  There had been some debate over this in the past.
