Barkers of Baldina Aged Cottage Homes in Burra have installed a bore to provide water for the watering of the lawns at the Pearse Row site.  It was located after Mr Ron Smedley pointed out a suitable spot to drill.  It has appropriately been named Smedleyâ€™s Bore.  Maynard Drilling of Clare carried out the drilling and tests showed the water to be of good quality.  Further work done by M R Electrix and plumber David Nourse has allowed the bore to service all the pop-up sprinklers during the summer months.  The cost will be recovered in savings to water usage charges over the next few years.
