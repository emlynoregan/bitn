Accident.  On Wednesday at about 6.30 p.m. a 10-ton load of chaff, on a semi-trailer driven by Mr Trevor Ivan Hahl of Waterloo, overturned on the Black Springs Road, although it was only travelling at about 10 m.p.h.  The Broken Hill Council has decided to support Burra and other SA Councils in the drive to have the road improved.
