R.J. Fairchild: Looking Back

While glad to hear from Frank Treloar he thinks that Mr Treloar was wrong in believing 1898 to be a year of bad drought.  Records of rainfall from Ironmine suggest that on paper 1898 was quite a good year with 16½”.  In 1897 Norman & Co. canvassed Ironmine and Leighton for five farmers to sow 100 acres with superphosphate (20 acres each).  Those who responded were W. Langford, W.H. Field, T. Fairchild, T. Bailey & Samuel Pearce.  Fertilizers were bone dust, bone super and Thomas’s Phosphate.  The yields at harvest were c. 10 bushels per acre and Mr Bailey got about 20 bushels.  Rainfall that year was 14”.  In 1898 many farmers bought drills and sowed 100 acres or more using Thomas’s Phosphate made from steel slag equal to 13% WSP (present day superphosphate).  Super as we use it arrived in 1899-1900.  It was imported from England, very sticky and about £4-10-0 a ton.  Before super Mr Treloar mentions yields of 6-8 bushels per acre, but I remember 2 bushels per acre being nearer the mark.  The advances in recent years are a combination of better wheats, splendid machinery and dry pickling, though none seem to have placed the farmer in an enviable position.
