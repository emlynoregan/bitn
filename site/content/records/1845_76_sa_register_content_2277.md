Burra Flimsies

‘A Tradesman’ writes a long and convoluted letter in response to an attack that appeared in the South Australian on 30 May on a friend called ‘Buz’.

[It would seem that a correspondent ‘Lover of Fair Dealing’ wrote on the subject of the use of small value notes drawn on the Mining Co. and tradesmen in place of actual currency in Burra Burra.  He seems to have asserted there was danger that the mining company would or could fail to honour its notes.  ‘Tradesman’ dismisses this as nonsense given the present prosperity of the venture, the huge stockpile of ore at the mine and at port Adelaide and that the miners have as yet barely ventured below the level of the watertable.  Nevertheless a solution to the problem of small orders is not straightforward and the writer appends a few comments before a longer letter on the subject.]

[The letter of ‘A Tradesman’ sets out the problem.  SAMA pays its employees in large orders and in the absence of currency they can only be changed by the issuing of small orders by others to be used as small change.  To suggest that the Association pay its employees in cash, is to propose a process fraught with difficulties and would be inexpedient.  Another problem is that the miners have a habit of keeping their gains in private hoards and so small currency would be likely to disappear from circulation.  He considers a branch bank for so small a population in a place, as in all mining areas, with an uncertain future, would be out of the question.

He asks how they got on before the shopkeepers issued small notes.  Apparently before Mr Stocks departed he would occasionally supply the shopkeepers with 5/- orders in exchange for large orders.  The shopkeeper’s filling in the blank forms to be then signed by Mr Stocks and the Accountant.

He suggests that a solution would be for the Association to pay wages in a mixture of 5/- and 2/6 orders.  At present they were paying each set of tributers with a single large order, which then had to be divided among the group by themselves.  If this change were made the town would, after a few paydays, be well supplied with small orders that could circulate like cash.  Their unsuitability as a remittance would keep them in the district.

The danger to the Association, he suggests, is that the present system could induce the miners to go to other mines as such develop in the colony, rather than stay in Burra where ‘a portion at least of their laboriously earned gains is jeopardized by the existence of an increasingly dangerous currency which they are often compelled to make use of, in order to melt their own good Burras’.]
