The Local government Advisory Commission was last week presented with a petition signed by 190 ratepayers from the Burra Burra DC, requesting secession from that Council to the Dc of Hallett.  Minutes from a ratepayersâ€™ meeting at Hallett welcomed the secession and there was also a submission from the DC of Hallett.  Mr B. Gebhardt, who had signed the petition, said dissatisfaction with the Burra Burra DC followed from high rates and a lack of co-operation between the council and its ratepayers.  Meanwhile Jamestown has made a bid for the Hundred of Whyte to secede from the DC of Hallett.  Ratepayers at the Hallett meeting unanimously passed a motion that the Hundred of Whyte should remain in the DC of Hallett.
