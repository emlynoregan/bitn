The Easter Tennis Tournament organised by the Aberdeen Tennis Club has attracted 260 entries, compared with 150 last year.  Competitors came from Robertstown, Emu Downs, Morgan, Hallett, Booborowie, Ironmine, Terowie and Adelaide.  The weather over Easter was fair for tennis.  Good organisation saw most of the play finish in good time.  Six courts were in play throughout, with ten occasionally available.  Only four were used in 1947.  The event was a great success.
