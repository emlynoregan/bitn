£45 p.a. [The paper of 19 August says this excludes the surcharge.]

Initial costs:

Wiring for 16 lights, range & hot water	£100

A medium priced range	£100

Hot water service	£130

Conversion of existing motors	£60

£390

ETSA will complete a survey of the area.  There was no satisfactory idea of a time frame for any supply to the area.  A survey will also be done of the area around Hallett as far north as Ulooloo.  If prospective customers there accept the Trust’s offer it will take about two years to complete installation unless a second gang of workmen is employed.
