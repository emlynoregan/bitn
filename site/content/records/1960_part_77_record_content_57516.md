Absconders Apprehended in Burra

Two absconders from McNally Training Centre with two city companions were apprehended in Burra on Thursday.  They were aged 14 & 16.  They absconded on Monday and stole a utility, picked up two companions aged 14 & 15 on Wednesday and headed north.  They were seen getting petrol at Hurley’s Roadhouse and fled, leaving the car and running off on foot.  After considerable trouble they were all caught.
