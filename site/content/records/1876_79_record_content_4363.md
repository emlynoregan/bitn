‘Progress’ writes that railways need to be located to open up the country, they need to be pushed into the heart of the country & to the Barrier. Branches to be added later. The writer felt that the N-E was able to grow wheat and therefore needed the railway though squatters would oppose it as resumption of leases would follow.
