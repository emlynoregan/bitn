Obituary & Inquest.  Robert Gurney, through an incautious use of a firearm shot dead his niece, Isabella Hall, aged 12, at Mt Gipps on Sunday afternoon.  Gurney had been going to go wallaby shooting, but on getting the gun had played around pretending to shoot two little girls.  He did not know the gun was loaded and it went off.  The gun belonged to Sam Hall, uncle of the deceased.

Thomas Hall, father of the deceased, said he had tried the gun himself and found that both barrels would go off at half cock.  He believed the shooting to be accidental.
