Education.  An editorial gives support to the Education Board in its attempts to get the Government to fund a model school in Adelaide.  The Government keeps on giving in principle support, but fails to deliver the money needed.  A site was purchased in the remote past, but the Â£2,000 needed to erect the school has not been forthcoming.
