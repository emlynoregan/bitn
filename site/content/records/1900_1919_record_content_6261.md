Obituary & Inquest.  Concerning the death of John Stoddart (58), sent from Petersburg on 18 August and died the same evening.

Alfred Henry Whitters, Foot-Constable:

On August 18 at about 8 p.m. found a man lying in the Petersburg subway.  He smelled of drink and I arrested him and placed him in the cells.  At 10 p.m. he said he felt alright and wanted a cup of tea and at 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. he seemed alright and in the morning was much better and was in court and fined 5/-.  He felt weak and asked if he could lie in the cell for a couple of hours.  At 5 p.m. I drew Sgt Phelanâ€™s attention to his still being there.  He was told to leave, but 30 minutes later was found lying in the backyard of a house near the police station.  As he was not making sense he was again placed in the cells and at about 6 p.m. a doctor was sent for.  The doctor at 6.30 said his mind was temporarily deranged by drink.  On Monday [18 Aug.]  he was charged with lunacy and discharged, the magistrate ordering his removal to the Burra Hospital.  On the journey he seemed to improve.  I handed him over to the matron and returned to Petersburg.  He was not a local man and said he had no wife or relatives in Burra.  He was a rabbiter selling rabbits in Petersburg and then returning to camp.  There were no signs of blood and he made no complaints about being knocked about.

Several other witnesses then gave corroborative evidence.

Dr J.I. Sangster:

After John Stoddart was admitted on the order of Dr Stephenson, I received a message from matron that he was in a fit and I visited and gave instructions.  An hour later I visited and convulsions again occurred and I was at his bedside when he became unconscious and died about 9 p.m.

A post mortem showed various signs of abrasions etc. and a fractured skull with bleeding in the brain.  Death was due to fracture of the skull with haemorrhage on the brain and laceration of the same.  The cause may have been a fall down the steps.

The jury decided it was an accidental death through falling down the steps at the Petersburg sub-by way.
