The case against William Kelly, George Morgan & John Buckley continued.

John Stanley, cook at the Stone Hut, said he knew Morgan and Buckley and saw then at the Stone Hut on 19 May.  He saw Henderson go out and saw a man called Wallace accuse Henderson of not paying him 30s for wages.  Wallace held the bridle and dared Henderson to go without paying him.  Henderson re-entered the hotel.  Stanley took the horse to the stable and when he entered the hotel Morgan and Wallace were drinking with Henderson and Buckley.  Henderson denied Wallace ever worked for him.  They started fighting near the stables when Henderson came to order his horse.  Wallace knocked Henderson down.  Buckley urged Wallace to stop hitting Henderson.  Henderson said he would not go and so Stanley unsaddled the horse.  Back inside the hotel Henderson said he had lost his pocket book.  Henderson sometimes said the sum was £100 and at another £150 and sometimes said it was cheques and sometimes orders.  Wallace and the other two men left soon after Henderson on Monday.

[Robert Harris, publican of the Saddleworth Hotel, gave extensive evidence basically supporting what Stanley had said, but adding that Henderson had arrived intoxicated at about 4 o’clock.  On the Sunday Henderson had asked how his face came to be bruised and Wallace said he had done it, because Henderson had struck first.  Morgan and Buckley had been very quiet, and tried, especially Morgan, to make peace.  Henderson had started out on Sunday morning with Stanley to look after him, but Stanley brought him back after an hour or two.  Harris did not know Kelly.

William Spicer of the Para, knew Kelly and had seen him on Tuesday morning 22 May before 10 a.m. in Adelaide.

William Kelly mad a statement that he had been employed by William Spicer to take a dray to port Adelaide and had left Burra 14 May.  He recounts the stages of his journey.

John Buckley said he had been working for the Smelting Co.  Morgan had also been working there and they were coming to Adelaide together.  He saw a man knock Henderson down and advised him not to strike him.  The man said if he had anything to say to it, he would knock him down the same way.

His Worship discharged Morgan, admitted Kelly to his own bail to appear at the Sessions and committed Buckley for trial.
