Burra Bowling Club needs workers to complete the project for the opening in seven weeks time.  The green needs to be top dressed.  The cyclone fence was completed on 9 August.  The paling fence in Bridge Street is still to be completed.  The concrete wall under the new fence in Bridge Street needs to be poured.
