Children’s Playground.  A public meeting at Jubilee Hall on 11 October saw about 18 people gather to consider establishing a playground.  The meeting was convened by L.H. Foote.  He had called them to consider a playground on the land known as Lowe’s Park.  He wanted it to be for the whole town and it might help break down the feeling of enmity between Aberdeen and Kooringa.  He had approached Council which had granted the use, but expected him to tell them next meeting about the proposal.  So far he had received the following:
