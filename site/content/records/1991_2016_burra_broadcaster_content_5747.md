Burra Hospital

The Minister for Health, Michael Armitage opened the upgraded casualty area on Sunday morning at 10 a.m.  He said the upgrade would help the hospital gain accreditation.  The upgrade was completed on time and under the $24,000 budget.  The project was helped by a bequest of $58,000 from the estate of the late Agnes Seigert.  [Photo.]
