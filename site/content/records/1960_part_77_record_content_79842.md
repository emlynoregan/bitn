Mr Simon Newell of Newell’s Travel Agency in Falmouth, Cornwall, contacted Mr Ian Auhl recently on behalf of a client, Mr John Gill aged 72.  Mr Gill had read the Burra Sketchbook and it prompted the contact.

Mr Gill came to Australia in 1921 as a sponsored emigrant and returned to the UK in 1928.  While in Australia he drove a 1904 Sunbeam Talbot for Mr Jim Gallagher of Quondong Station and later a f-ton International truck and trailer for the Burra firm of Drew & Crewes.  On the delivery run for the firm Mr Gill took three days for the round trip and was paid £4 for a seven day week.  There were 90 gates to open and close on the route, still served by a Burra contractor.  Mr Gill claims that he and a companion brought in the first load of wool from the ‘outback’ by mechanised transport.  Soon after arriving back in the UK he set out on a round the world tour on a motor bike with sidecar. (A Vincent HRD)  This took over a year.  He married and has two daughters.  For many years he was chief engineer for the Admiralty and moved to Falmouth about 33 years ago.
