2nd Leader on the new Main Roads Act. Among others, struck off the list of main roads were Kooringa to Govt. Wells. Added to the list were Robertstown to Burra Railway Station, section 43W H. of Baldina to Government Well, Foot of Breakneck Hill to section 150 H. of Baldina, Kooringa to Diprose Creek via Nankivell's Gully, Mt Bryan Railway Station to Mongolata (what part thereof is not stated), Burra Station to Leighton. If the Mt Bryan to Mongolata road turns out to be the White Hill route we think the line inferior to the one from Breakneck to Caroona.
