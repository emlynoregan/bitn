Weather.  In the last two weeks several days in succession have been over 100°F and Sunday reached 110°F.  There were scattered thunderstorms on Friday and a terrific downpour on Mr George Tiver’s Rupara Station dropped over 3 inches and a number of places recorded falls between 42 points and 1 inch.  Newikie and Dust Hole Creeks ran bankers and Burra Creek came down, but the ground was so parched that it only got about two miles on this side of Mt Bryan.
