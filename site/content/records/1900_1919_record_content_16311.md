Rabbits are being killed in great numbers, but with no apparent impact on their population.  Mr F.T. Jones of Mongolata recently netted a dam and on the first night caught 8, on the second 1,000 and on the third 700.  For the week the total was 6,335.  Others have reported catching 10,700 in a week and tolls of 3,000 to 4,000 are common.  Rabbiters are averaging £4 a week and one £5.  On the western side of the town numbers are fairly low, but men are still employed actively poisoning and digging out burrows.
