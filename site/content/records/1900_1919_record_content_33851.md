Football.  Ramblers Football Club AGM on Friday.  A.D. McLaren in the chair.

In view of the Light Horse being likely to form a football club the Kooringa and Rambler Clubs would be left very weak.  The chair thought it might be wise for them to combine.  Mr Lackman supported this.  The Kooringa club will be asked to consider this matter.  On the same evening the Light Horse met at the Burra Hotel with S.M. Lane in the chair.  It was decided to form a football club.  Election: Hon. Sec., Mr Killicoat; Captain, L.A. Lewis; Vice-Captain, W.H. Stevenson.
