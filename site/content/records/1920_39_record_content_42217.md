Visit of Premier L.L. Hill, 16 June

The party drove up in unceasing rain arriving at c. 11 a.m. and they tramped the Mongolata diggings in wind and rain.  The Premier had lunch at W. Carpenter’s ‘restaurant’.  They returned to Burra and visited the school where he gave a speech and a half-holiday to be taken on Friday.  He met a deputation from Peterborough and attended a banquet arranged in his honour by the Mayor and Councillors [in Pearce’s Building].  He expressed his determination to see through the Premiers’ Plan and appealed to all to pull together free from party strife and political bickering.  In the evening at the Institute he announced that last month he had won a disabilities grant of £1,000,000 and that the Unemployment Relief Council had approved the expenditure of £2,500 on a battery at Mongolata.  He was impressed by the efforts at Mongolata.  The Premier made light of the bitter cold and unceasing rain and the travelling difficulties and said it was all promising and a wonderful opening to the season.

The dining hall was crowded and Mr Hill was accompanied by the District MPs Messrs Critchley & George.  The toasts and speeches are reported at some length.

After the banquet there was a move to the public meeting at the Institute.

The Mayor introduced the Premier who presented Mr Woollacott with a gold fountain pen at the request of a number of admirers in recognition of the splendid service he had rendered in most difficult times.

The Premier then outlined the history of the Government’s fight to retrieve the state’s finances.  He said it had yet to be decided where the best site for the battery was, as it relied upon the question of water supply.  Changing the rations for unemployed men working there, however desirable, would have to be the matter for an inquiry.  He pointed to some promising features of the economy with some new companies being established and an improvement in railway finances.  They looked like being £100,000 better off this year than last.  The state deficit will be less than anticipated.  The Government since 1929-30 had slashed spending where possible by 29% (on average across all areas of adjustable expenditure).  The balance of trade had improved somewhat with imports falling substantially.

M.W. Bednall moved a vote of thanks and expressed strong support for the Premier, despite having been a long-time Liberal supporter.  Cr Jennison seconded.

The local members moved a vote of thanks to the Mayor & Councillors.

At the school the children had waited beyond normal break-up time and the Premier made visits to classrooms and afternoon tea was given in the Domestic Economy Centre.
