The Annual Field Days organised by 46 studs were concluded on Friday on a satisfactory note.  The wool market has been depressed and seasonal conditions have been adverse.  Daily following this year was between 700 and 1,000, estimated to be 25% down on last year’s record.  Mr Cowell, a representative of SA Stud Breeders, said stockowners favoured a lifting of the ban on exporting Merino sheep, because the world needed to produce more good apparel wool – in India for example the average fleece was only 2 lb.  The embargo was introduced in 1929.  Mr Simpson from Queensland agreed.  Mr Toll of WA said the Wool Conference in Perth favoured lifting the ban on the export of rams, under controlled conditions.
