Letter.  Dr Roger Cross writes a long letter on galahs, in which he notes how the favourable comments on them in the nineteenth century changed, as in the twentieth century the word became slang for an idiot or had other connotations of derision or contempt.  The assertions about the bird in the recent Council newsletter that the galah ‘is causing the death of many trees’, is quite without evidence.

Has anyone actually done a count to verify that ‘many are dying’?

Has the cause of any deaths of trees been verified?  For instance could it be borers or flocks of starlings or could it be dieback?

Galahs are noisy and colourful and large and numerous – so it is easy to blame them.

He concludes by asking for a proper environmental impact study before taking any action and wonders whether people’s complaints are truly because of dead trees, or actually sparked by the noise the birds make coming to roost or on getting up.
