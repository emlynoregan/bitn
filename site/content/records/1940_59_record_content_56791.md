Burra Hospital.  The Board has £13,000 in hand towards building a new Nurses’ Home and the renovation of the bathrooms for the men’s and women’s wards.  £8,300 was raised by an appeal to the public, mostly from organisations.  The architects Messrs Dean W. Berry & Gilbert will now proceed with specifications and call tenders, when the Chief Secretary will be approached to consider the amount of Government subsidy.  The estimated cost was £16,000 and £2,000 should cover any increased costs and furnishings should be covered by a further £2,000.  Raised so far:

By appeal	£8,230

C.E. Gebhardt bequest	£5,500

Total	£13,730

Of the estimated cost of £22,000 the expected Government subsidy is £11,000 and that will leave £2,700 as a surplus nucleus for the continuation of the appeal to continue for a further 12 months towards stage two of the rebuilding.
