Waterloo Wind Farm has a new ownership arrangement.  Current operators EnergyAustralia have signed a joint partnership with Palisade Investment Partners and Northleaf Capital Partners.   The latter two entities now own 75% of the facility.  EnergyAustralia will continue to operate the plant.  The company will also continue with its plans for the development of the 123MW Stony Gap wind farm project.  They are anxious to continue building lasting relationships with the community.  EnergyAustralia will continue to be a long term off-taker for both energy and large-scale generation certificates produced by the wind farm.  As an energy retailer EnergyAustralia purchases these certificates in order to meet its obligations under the Renewable energy Target Scheme.  The sale of a part share in the wind farm will see EnergyAustralia benefit from $228 million in profits.  The Waterloo wind farm comprises 37 Vestas V90-3.0MW turbines.
