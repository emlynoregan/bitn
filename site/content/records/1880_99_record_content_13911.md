Unemployed.  The meeting of the unemployed in the town was called to ascertain their number and secondly to see if anything could be done to aid them.  It was largely attended.  Mr J.H. Chenoweth said if the Waterworks got under way it would find work for most of them.  Mr Murphy spoke at length on the Waterworks and the employment it offered.  A proposal to send a memorial to Dr Cockburn MP to urge immediate commencement of the Waterworks was passed unanimously.  40 names of bona fide unemployed men were taken.  Three quarters of them were married.
