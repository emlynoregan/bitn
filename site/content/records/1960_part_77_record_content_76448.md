Burra Burra DC.  The Council is concerned about the Burra Mine retrenchments and will seek Government aid in providing employment.

It is also concerned about the changing ratio of Government grant money to rates as the former falls.  Rates have risen 10% and Council feels any greater rise would bring considerable difficulties to the rural sector.  Roadwork grants have fallen by $11,000.  A more equitable funding formula is needed.
