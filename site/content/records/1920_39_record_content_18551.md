They are out of the way of traffic.

The idea they are unsightly is simply ridiculous.

He accuses those involved of forgetting what the capture of the guns meant and therefore their symbolic value.

He is opposed to putting them in a position where they would be almost hidden â€“ and where children could interfere with them without hindrance.

The original idea was to enclose both the rotunda and the memorial in either a fence or better with concrete or granite posts with chains and then to grass the enclosure.

He says the guns are vested in three residents of the town and he believes the Council cannot act without the approval of the trustees.

He believes the majority of returned men are opposed to moving the guns and a majority of the general public too.

The Record office window is showing a plan of the original concept for the monument.
