Letter.  Jill Harnett writes as a relatively new resident of Burra that she was astounded at the 30% rate increase.  The explanation offered by the Clare Valuer General’s Office was that her home had been under-valued for several years.  While accepting the explanation, she felt there must be a way of eliminating such human error that results in difficulties later.
