Local Board of Health.

The sanitary state of the town has been fairly satisfactory.  A few cases of typhoid occurred early in the year.  Drought led to stagnation of water in the creek and attendant foul odours.  The draining of a number of the stagnant waterholes has very much improved its condition.  The account began in debit £12-17-0 and is presently in credit £17-13-2.

The Parklands have received relatively little work this year, although some dead trees have been replaced and the oval has been improved.  This account began the year in debit £81-19-10 and is now in debit £39-1-6.

The cemetery has a credit balance of £31-4-6, which is gradually dwindling year by year.
