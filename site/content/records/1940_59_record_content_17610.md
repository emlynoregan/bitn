Wool Industry.  Mr Goddard of the School of Mines spoke at Mt Bryan on 2 May about ‘The Wool Industry After the War'.  There would be great competition from synthetics and a good soft handling wool would be needed to compete.  The Australian wool 20 years ago was 80% produced under pastoral conditions and is now 80% from farming conditions.  The farmer is not a good wool grower and often failed to take advice on the subject.  Australia has a stockpile of 8,000,000 bales of inferior wool.  Where will the market come from for this?  Fabrics combining artificial and wool fibres require even quality wool.  Other problems discussed were water supply and clearing problems in mallee lands.
