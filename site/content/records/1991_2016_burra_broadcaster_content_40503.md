Burra Hospital

Nursing staff at Burra Hospital are rallying to stop the proposed changes that would replace Nursing Staff with Care Workers at the Hospital.  This would affect the availability of acute and emergency care.  The Hospital at present provides services in aged and acute care, but Care Workers would restrict that to Aged care, thus significantly affecting the availability of health services in the community.  On Monday evening a small group met Mr Weatherill at La Pecora Nera and said later they were glad to have been heard.  He asked why the Burra Hospital was different from others and the nurses explained that many hospitals have separate Aged Care, but ours is mixed in with Acute and Emergency Care and Care Workers cannot care for Acute and Emergency patients.  The next move is to get the public aware of the threat and to have them contact the Minister for health and the local MP, expressing their concern.  [Photo.]
