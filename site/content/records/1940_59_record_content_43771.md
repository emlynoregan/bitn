Rev. F.E. Tregilgas writes congratulating the Choral Society on its recent concert and especially Mr Lindsay Thomas as conductor and Mr Davey as pianist.  The only disappointment was that the audience was small.

Note that though the masthead on page 1 announced a paper of ten pages, this issue had only 8.
