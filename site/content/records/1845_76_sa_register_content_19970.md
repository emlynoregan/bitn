Kooringa News, 22 November

Fire.  Five men were fined from £2 to £3 each for leaving a camp fire alight at Mt Bryan.  The magistrate hoped this might deter teamsters from leaving fires alight after camping: Thomas Miller, W.H. Vivian, Robert Pickford, James Pickford and Robert Cock.

Maurice O’Haren who cruelly deserted his five small children about 18 months ago was sentenced to two months’ gaol under that charge.  [This offender appears in records variously as Maurice O’Haren, Maurice O’Hern, Morish O’Hearne and Morris O’Herne.  His wife Mary died at Redruth 30 May 1865 aged 28.  He may have been the Morris O’Hern who died 20 May 1911 at Pt Pirie aged 82.]

Weather.  Since Wednesday morning we have had 24 hours of steady gentle rain – most unusual for this time of year.

The Burra Institute Committee provided a free concert on 15 November.  Mr Vale from Adelaide gave some excellent readings.  Songs were given by Messrs Moody, Vale and Belcher and Mrs Oakford accompanied on the piano.

Rev. S. Anncar [or Anpear? The print is unclear.] preached on Sunday 18 November to two large congregations in the Bible Christian Chapel.  He visited in connection with the Rechabite Rose of Sharon Tent for the purpose of advocating Temperance.  He gave lucid accounts of his travels in Africa as a missionary and on Monday & Tuesday evenings spoke eloquently on Total Abstinence.
