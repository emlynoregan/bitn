Hallett Wind Farms

The Development Assessment Panel considered the proposal for the five Hallett Wind Farm Clusters put forward by Wind Prospect Pty Ltd.

The Brown Hill Range Cluster comprising 45 wind turbine generators and 5 wind monitoring masts and ancillary work was granted Provisional Development Plan Consent by the joint committee set up by Regional Council of Goyder and the Northern Areas Council, as it spans the border of the two councils.

The Bluff Range Cluster of 25 turbine generators and 2 wind monitoring masts etc. and the Willogoleche Hill Cluster comprising 26 turbine generators and 3 wind monitoring masts etc. were both granted provisional Development Plan Consent by the Goyder DAP, as was the Hallett Hill cluster of 30 generators and 4 wind monitoring masts.  A decision on the Mt Bryan cluster of 30 generators and 4 wind monitoring masts was deferred.  It has been disclosed that $15,000 per cluster will go into a community Trust Fund on an annual basis and it is believed landowners will receive about $3,750 annually per turbine on their property.
