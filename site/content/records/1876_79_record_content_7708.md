Editorial on Municipal Affairs.

Though it has not been the practice in Burra, it is desirable for the Mayor to be voted an allowance. It should be done at a time like the present when there is no question of the Mayor asking for it, or requiring it. Firstly, such a move would open up the position to men who might not otherwise be able to afford it and secondly, the representation of the town requires considerable outlay which should not be required of one who already gives freely of his time.

The decisions on expenditure this year are generally as we had suggested last week. In North Ward footpaths are to be formed from the railway gate to the Bank of Australasia in Aberdeen. In Middle Ward the unsightly banks near the Institute and in Commercial St will be cut down. As the road by the Institute is controlled by the Midland Road Board we hope they will see the advantage in raising one half and lowering the other half of the roadway to make a road in the centre and so share with the Corporation in improving the town. In South Ward the most important work is the erection of an iron bridge in Thames St. We think that Ayers St in South Ward, which leads to the cemetery, should be a cost to the town as a whole. The other two wards have the burden of main roads removed from them to the Midland Road Board, but in South Ward no such easing of the burden is made. Another, but less desirable solution would be to charge the cost to the cemetery fund. At present the town pays £140 p.a. for the police: one foot-policeman at either end. This being the case some consider that the North Ward should pay half and the other two wards should share the other half. This is to be resolved next meeting. We hope the Middle and South Wards will concede on this. Part of Middle Ward is closer to Redruth than Kooringa anyway.
