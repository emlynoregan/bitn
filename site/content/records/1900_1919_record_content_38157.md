Burra Town Council

Bagot, Shakes and Lewis have undertaken to attend to the dangerous verandah posts.

The Deputy Post Master General says an extra light has been installed at the Kooringa post office.  Electric or coal gas light would be installed if available, but they would not entertain the idea of acetylene gas lighting.

The Hospital Board is to consider the matter of the Mayor’s membership of the Board at its next meeting.

The deputation of the Town Council to the Chief Secretary re the Mayor’s seat on the hospital board is reported in over ½ column of detail:

Councillors are trustees of the institution, but are not represented on the board.

This being pointed out in 1912, the Chief Secretary appointed the then Mayor, Mr McLaren to the Board.

When terms expired the same Board members were reappointed, but now Mr McLaren was no longer on Council.

Mr Crewes thought the Council should be represented and the Board should include businessmen (those who had a stake in the town) and at present there was only one such.

The Chief Secretary said the ex-Mayor had not been appointed as a member of council and was reappointed on the same basis – as a representative, but not ex-officio.  He had suggested rule changes to the Board to make the Mayor an ex-officio member, but it could only be a suggestion.  The Board was wrong to say it had no power to suggest new rules – they were being invited to do so.  If nothing was done he would in the coming session introduce an amendment to the Hospital Act providing for the Mayor of every municipality, in which a public hospital was situated, to be an ex-officio member of the Board.  He would not now force the matter.
