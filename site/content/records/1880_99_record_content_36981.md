The Travelling Dairy will visit Burra in a few weeks.  Lectures will be given as well as practical instruction in dairy work.  At least 100 gallons of milk a day will be made into butter and cheese.  For butter a separator will be used to extract the cream.

‘Ajax’ comments on the week.

Sports. Out-of-town coursing, racing, boxing and sculling are reported.

Football was cancelled on Saturday due to the weather.

Billiards.  On Saturday night at the Burra hotel Chorlton gave Halls 100 points in a total of 250 in a £2 aside game.  Chorlton gradually gained on Halls and caught his score before 200 was reached.

W.T. Rabbich writes to ask the editor to acknowledge that the latter’s correction of the writer’s arithmetic in his letter last issue was in fact wrong and that Rabbich was right all along.  [The editor does so.]

Salvation Army to hold a big day at the end of the week.
