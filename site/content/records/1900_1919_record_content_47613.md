E.W. Crewes writes suggesting the arrangement of a memorial service for the fallen (numbering 14 at the time of writing) of the district, to be held in the Institute on a Sunday to be fixed.  It would also be an intercession service for those still fighting.  Perhaps a monthly intercession service should be considered.
