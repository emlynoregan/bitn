The SA Railways gave a special passenger train a trial run on Friday to record times and other particulars pertaining to rail traffic.  It is rumoured that due to heavy passenger traffic on the line there is a need for an express to Burra in the morning, stopping only at Riverton for breakfast and returning in the afternoon, stopping all stations.  Thousands living in the Mid North would hail such a new departure.

Page 6 explains this further.

The idea would be to run such an express occasionally on Fridays.  It would be a boon to Burra stock markets, enabling buyers to reach Burra in time for the start of sales and by returning after the present afternoon passenger train, would mean buyers would not have to run away before the sales were over.
