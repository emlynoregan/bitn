Crs Brown and Rayner supported extending the Aberdeen scheme.  A guarantee of £120 p.a. would be needed to extend the main to the hospital.  More than £30 of it would come from Aberdeen, leaving Kooringa to pay only a little over £60.

Messrs Tiver and Preece offered £20 plus expenses for the piece of old street in Aberdeen.  Council resolved the price should be £70 plus expenses.
