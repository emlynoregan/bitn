Arrears collected	£136-5-5

Arrears at 30 June 1936	£101-15-11

The Mayor’s Report for 1936

The depression is still with us.

In the year there have been only two new buildings in the town plus some alterations to existing buildings.

Roads have been maintained to a creditable standard.

The Mine Bridge is under consideration and the Department has been approached to have it widened by about ten feet.

As it is the Corporation’s Jubilee Year it is not out of place to give you the names of all the gentlemen who have held the position of Mayor since 1876.

1876	P. Lane

1877	P. Lane
