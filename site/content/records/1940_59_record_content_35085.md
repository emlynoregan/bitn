Ratepayers’ Meeting

The Mayor had called a ratepayers’ meeting for last Wednesday for the purpose of deciding whether the Council should borrow a sum of money from the Government towards the War Memorial Project.

When only about a dozen ratepayers turned up the Mayor expressed surprise at the apathy displayed and asked for a motion that the meeting be adjourned because such a small representative group could not dictate the future policy of the Council.  Members of the Council and the Burra War Memorial Committee agreed wholeheartedly.  Is it that they are not prepared to help erect a memorial to those who laid down their lives helping to protect life and property in this country or is it that they are just bone lazy and would rather let some other fellow carry on with the job?

This is a chance that Burra cannot afford to throw away – a chance to accept a gift of £800 from State and federal Governments without the town having to dip too far into its Municipal pocket.

[The editor then goes over the proposal noted from Mr Hawke’s letter noted from the paper of 20 January 1948, page 6]

With the £200 the War Memorial Committee has raised, it would mean they would have £1,400 available for expenditure on the proposed site.  This would go a long way towards realising the plan outlined by the committee, although clearly they could not complete the scheme in one fell-swoop.

Ratepayers agreeable to the Council borrowing the money should come to the next meeting to be called soon.  If the scheme is allowed to lapse for want of public enthusiasm, it will result in an everlasting disgrace to Burra’s civic pride.

Vandalism.  Two boys of this town have inflicted hundreds of pounds worth of damage on the Burra Cemetery.  Ninety or more of the glass domes covering artificial flowers on the graves have been totally smashed.  The domes are worth anything from £1-5-0 to £5 each and some are irreplaceable.  The damage was done last Wednesday evening and we understand that two boys have been questioned.  We believe this is the second such attack on ornaments at the cemetery, though the damage was not so great on the first occasion.
