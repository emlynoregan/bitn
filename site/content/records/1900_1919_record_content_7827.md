Burra Waterworks.

Deputation to Council re the Water Concession.

A previous meeting of Council decided to do away with the concession whereby ratepayers were allowed to use water at their private residence if they did not use it at their business premises.  The deputation objected and asked for the resolution to be rescinded.

The obvious arguments were presented by Mr Crewes:

People were only asking to be allowed to use what they had already paid for – no extra water is involved.

They merely sought what was just and equitable.

The speaker thought there was a leakage somewhere, but it was not with the larger ratepayers.  Drew and Crewes were a large ratepayer, but used very little at the Kooringa store – they should be allowed to use it at the Redruth [sic] store.  [i.e. Aberdeen]  The difficulty would persist if the Council did not put on meters.

C.C. Williams echoed Mr Crewes – he paid at four places, but used water only at two.

Mr Wilkinson followed – he favoured the use of meters.

The Mayor said he would place the matter before Council, but could not hold out any hope for the deputation.  The Council had considered the matter carefully and concluded something had to be done to check the enormous leakage daily witnessed.  The Council is about to approach the Commissioner of Public Works with a view to inducing him to allow the remission of six months rent due to the cost of repairing the boiler.  He did not wish anyone to pay for what they did not receive.  The Commissioner said that unless the concession were removed and a proper system for the delivery of water inaugurated they need not approach him in the matter.  Meters would be placed at various places and if leakages could be located the cost of water would fall.  If a ratepayer has two properties he would have two meters to pay for.  The Council is paid for 15,000 gallons and is pumping 40,000 gallons daily.

The Mayor said their plan is the only way to find out who is using the water.

116 meters had been returned to the Government at less than one third their cost.

The Mayor was determined to have the Waterworks in credit in his term.  There was a leakage of 24,000 gallons a day.

Mr Jordan said Messrs Snell, Cook, Wilkinson, Urwin & Sons, Lane and himself did not use any water at their business places.  His Worship – Well, I don’t believe that.

Mr Jordan – none of them have taps on.

A certain user had recently been found by meter to have used 50,000 gallons when he thought they had used 20,000.  His Worship said they wanted to act fairly to all.  As soon as possible all old meters would be replaced and he guessed all would be surprised.  He said the Waterworks had been constructed on the guarantee principle and not on the concession.  The concession had only been available about ten years,
