The Coppertown Festival Procession went off without a hitch.  More than 1000 people took part and many dressed in period costume.  The procession took about an hour to pass.  There were four bands*, about 100 floats, and lots of children dressed as clowns on bikes.

[* Royal Caledonian Pipe Band, City of Elizabeth Pipes and Drums Band, Dick Frankel’s Jazz Band and the Tanunda Junior Brass Band.]

The Burra Yacht Club Regatta was very successful and the secretary of the club was more than pleased with the money raised, the attendance and the way the day had unfolded.  Some contestants sank or fell into the water, were hit with water bombs or failed to finish, but the event was huge fun.  The club had record returned from the souvenir and beer booths.  The crowd was estimated at 4,000 to 4,500 as most of those who watched the procession then drifted to the regatta.  The overall winner of the Dragon Boat race was ‘Matulick Maulers and the winner of the open class event was ‘The Pink Panther’ from Burra.
