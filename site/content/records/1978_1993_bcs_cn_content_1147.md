A set of the paper is held in the State Library’s Newspaper Department.  The Newspaper Librarian Mr Len Marquis has expressed concern that since 1890 it was printed on wood pulp paper that is acidic and as a result the paper is becoming brittle and will eventually disintegrate.  It is proposed to preserve it on 45 reels of microfilm and to this end an appeal is made now for funds to begin this process.
