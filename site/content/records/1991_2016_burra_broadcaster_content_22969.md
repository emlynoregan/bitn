Burra Branch of the National Trust reviewed its performance at a quarterly meeting last Thursday.  Some good news was that takings from the Bon Accord and Morphett’s Engine House Museums were up on last year.  Steve Boyes is continuing his huge job of entering all the Trust’s items and artefacts onto a database.  It is estimated some 6,000 items are in the archives.  Angus Radford has helped him recently as part of work experience.  Malowen Loweth items are on the database with the Market Square Museum to be tackled next.
