Burra Town Council, 18 August

The Town Clerk reported that the Ranger had impounded 13 head of cattle last Friday and 2 a fortnight ago.

The Town Hall Committee had ordered work on the Institute cottage to overcome dampness.

Permission was granted for an Air Force Assoc. service in Market Square 14 September with 15 September to be Air Force Day.  Service in the Town Hall if weather inclement.

Northern E & WS Dept. has sent estimates for a water main from Paxton Square to Victoria Park to headquarters.

The Mayor will arrange a meeting of ladies to assist with afternoon tea at the Football Carnival on Eight Hours Day.

Permission granted for the District War Memorial Committee to remove further trees at Victoria Park to allow a grandstand where the main gate is now and for a car track part way round the enlarged oval.  Further ornamental trees will be planted.

Department of Civil Defence advises arrangements have been made for Fire Fighting teams to visit Adelaide and compete with auxiliary pumps.

A.C. Bourman give specifications and plans for the erection of a building of cement blocks with galvanised iron roof on the corner of Eyre [sic] & Kingston Streets.  Permission granted.  [This is somewhat odd, since Ayers Street and Kingston Street do not meet.]

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Lee following his accident.
