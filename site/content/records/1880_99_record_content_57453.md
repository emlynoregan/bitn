Burra Town Council.  Another confused meeting was held last night.

As soon as the minutes had been read Crs Rabbich and Hardy again asked the Mayor to clear the room and ratepayers again made a slow, but loud march to the door.

A discontented group of ratepayers surrounded the reporter near the keyhole.

Cr Sampson castigated Crs Rabbich and Hardy for using mere personal spite in clearing the room.  All ratepayers could go to Council and listen, but W.J. Davey must stay away.  He also accused Cr Hardy of false reporting and Cr West told Cr Harris he should practice what he preached.

At 7.40 a deputation of Messrs P.L. Killicoat, W.G. Hawkes & T. Sandland sent a message into the Mayor and a few minutes later the public were admitted.  Mr Killicoat admirably advocated the needs of the Show Society and then there was again a call to clear the room of strangers.

Through the door it appeared that the highest tender for a shed to cover the night cart was £4 and the lowest 14/- and it was finally awarded to Mr Morrison for £2-10-0.  A tender for painting woodwork along the roads went to Mr W. Geake for £3-15-0.

After much acrimonious discussion it was decided to call tenders for a new assessment.  Council adjourned at 10.20.
