Storm. There was a wild storm across the colony last Monday. It damaged many buildings and newly cut hay. Several roofs in Burra were damaged. Messrs Drew & Co.'s storefront was so shaken that it has since been taken down. Rain fell in sheets and the display of thunder and lightning frightened many.
