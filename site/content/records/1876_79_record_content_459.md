Obituary. Francken Robson was brought into Burra on Monday night at about 12 o’clock, in a dying state.  He had been staying at Aberdeen for two or three weeks and then went to Mr Dare’s at Piltimitiappa, where he was laid up with a severe cold for almost a fortnight. Dr Dashwood said there was nothing he could do, as the man had been dying for hours.  The final cause of death was bronchitis.  The deceased was an old colonist, having arrived on the Canton in 1838.  Mr Dobney of Kooringa came in the same vessel and says the deceased was the son of Captain R.M. Robson, formerly of the East India Co. and he had previously resided at the Reedbeds [Adelaide] where he worked for the Government; he believed in the Customs service.  It is though Robson had at one time been a sailor.  He was discharged from the steamer Moolgewanke at Goolwa 18 September 1858.  He was carrying a newspaper clipping from a Melbourne paper, supposedly from 1864, saying: ‘On 14th inst. at Sandhurst Eliza Anne, wife of Robert Moss Robson late of the East India Co. and mother of Mrs S.A. Crawford.'

The deceased was aged 42.  [SA Deaths CD says Frank Robson died 18 July 1876 Kooringa, residence near Kooringa aged 40.]
