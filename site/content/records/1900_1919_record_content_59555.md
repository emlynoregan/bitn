Burra Town Council.

Cr Bartholomaeus was welcomed as the replacement for the late H.H. Thomas.

There is c. £294 as a gift to the municipality to create work for returned soldiers who are unable to find employment.  It must be new work that would otherwise not be done.  Cr Radford said he thought it might be used for Hangman’s Bridge – sorry he meant Deadman’s Bridge, but it will be further considered.

The Burra Bowling Club has accepted the land offered to them at 15/- per foot.

H.A. Harrop [sic – presumably T.A. Harrap] applied for a licence for a pie-cart stand in Market Square.  Cr Dane said Mr Halls used the place for that purpose – request allowed at the Council’s pleasure.

Chairman (Radford) thought the fire brigade needed to be put in order.  Mr Sedgman will be asked to organise and run it as he has a perfect knowledge of the mains, plugs etc.  The Hydraulic Engineer will be asked to have the telephone laid on to the Waterworks.
