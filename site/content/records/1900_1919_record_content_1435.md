North Ward Ratepayer writes complaining that the Council doesn’t spend money on making Victoria Park usable; that the sporting bodies have spent over £30 in the last nine months, but the Council has now refused the cyclists use of it for £2-2-0 on condition that the £2-2-0 be used on the park.  This will force the Cycling Club to charge 1/- admission rather than 3d or 6d because they will need to spend their money on the park.  They will ultimately turn to making their own track somewhere.
