The Council’s second request was for a second tank at the town’s reservoir.  The present tank held only 8,000 gallons, whereas the reserve there ought to be 150-200,000 gallons.  The Mayor linked this request to the first by asking that local men get the work of building it.  The present limited supply of water was insufficient in the event of fires.  In summer the daily consumption was often 20,000 gallons and pumping had to go on day and night.  At present after 4.30 p.m. pressures dropped in all parts of the town and in some places virtually to zero.  A small town like Booleroo Centre had a reserve of 250,000 gallons and so he thought Burra equally entitled.

Other Councillors spoke in support of these requests.  They said expenditure was needed on the roads and stressed the way that local expenditure on helping the unemployed had been significant.  Cr Bevan also took up the cudgels for the men at Mongolata, acknowledging the benefits gained from the battery, but decrying the water supply, which was the colour of weak tea and tasted of rubberoid and tar and said that recent so-called improvements had merely meant new rubberoid and the water remained tainted.  He also thought it wasteful that ballast was being brought in from afar when only one man was at the Aberdeen Quarry and its plant was lying idle when it could easily supply excellent quality ballast (and offer employment).

Cr Jeffery added his voice to the need for expenditure on roads and Cr Sampson agreed and also supported the need to assist Mongolata and the Aberdeen Quarry.

The Premier responded.  He felt unemployment would have fallen this year, but for the drought.  He said the Department was considering giving sums for unemployment relief and Burra had every chance of getting the £300 asked for.  He asked that their requests be placed in writing and undertook to look into the Ballast Quarry question.

(Concluded on page 4.)

He would seek a report from the hydraulic engineer about the reservoir issue.  He had expectations of a better year to come.
