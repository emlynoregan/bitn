Burra Defence Rifle Club AGM was held on Wednesday 1 April at the Burra Hotel with the President, J.A. Pearce in the chair.  He reported a less successful year with falling membership due to decreasing prosperity in the town and a general feeling of malaise in Australia.  Still the club was well supported by several gentlemen with prizes and fired 24 local matches with an average of over 15 competitors.  Five matches were fired with other clubs of which Burra won two and lost three.  [Details given.]  There was a credit balance of Â£8-18-4.  After the visit to Semaphore we adopted Bisley Targets, having been told these would replace the old military ones, but few clubs have done this and good results with them have not been obtained with the Martini Rifles.  The club will revert to military targets and conditions.

Shooting match for clock, cup and rifle on 8 & 12 April: G. Scott 95 from H.E. Riggs 88.
