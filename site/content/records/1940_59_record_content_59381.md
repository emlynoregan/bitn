Burra Schools

It has been rumoured that if BHS co-operated with the Primary School it would be possible for periods to be arranged so that the Primary School could use the assembly room at times and St Mary’s Parish Hall would not have to be used.  The Primary School Committee has been complaining.  The High School is governed by a Council of Citizens and the Primary School is assisted by a Committee of people from the town and district.  The two schools are both small, with about 60 in the High School and 250 in the Primary School.  The High School now wants a movie projector, but surely it would be better to share the Primary School’s recently acquired £300 projector.

Recently the two schools ran celebrations separately for the Coronation, at the same time on the same day.  Surely combining would allow parents and friends to attend without having to choose between them.  The two committees if united would surely have more influence when approaching the Department with requests etc.
