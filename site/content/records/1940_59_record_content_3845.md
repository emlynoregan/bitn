Weather.  Last Friday the east endured the worst dust storm imaginable.  Even with lights on travel was impossible.  A person a few feet away was invisible.  Many travellers were forced to wait hours for the wind to drop before continuing their journey.  Rain fell in Burra in gusty driving showers in the afternoon and evening and 61 points were registered by 9 a.m. Saturday, but it did not extend much beyond Thistlebeds, where 24 points fell.  Dust was again endured on Sunday.  A few more points of rain fell in Burra yesterday to bring the weekâ€™s total to 69.
