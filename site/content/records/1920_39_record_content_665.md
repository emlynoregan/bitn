A.J. McBride writes on the same topic.  At the start of the year Mr Wilks was discharged as inspector of cattle and the appointment of Mr Davey as combined Town Clerk and Inspector of Cattle has been refused by the Central Board, as he has not the qualifications.  It is time the ratepayers petitioned the Central Board to enforce the appointment of an Inspector.
