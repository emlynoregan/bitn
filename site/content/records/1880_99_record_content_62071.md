Larrikinism.  A group of small boys has been making a nuisance of themselves by throwing stones onto roofs and at doors and windows.  Last Wednesday they broke windows at the rear of Drew & Crewe’s shops and stole what they could lay their hands on.  A large window at the rear of the Record office was broken.  We offer £1 reward for information leading to a conviction.
