The Town Crier

Wearing a buff (khaki) long-tailed coat, tall hat and a red woollen comforter around his neck, he presented a quaint appearance.  He usually started in Market Square, ringing a large hand-bell vigorously.  He would next march up the middle of Commercial Street – stopping at intervals to make his announcements.

“Oyez (Oyez) Oh Yez.  This to give notice, a sale of furniture will be held in Market Square on Saturday next.  Roll up! Roll up! Roll up! Oh Yes! Oh Yes! “God save the Queen.”  Another vigorous ringing of his bell then off he would go, followed by a crowd of sassy boys, who when he had finished making his announcement, would proceed to give their own.  He took little notice of them, however, and would march of followed by the crowd at his heels.
