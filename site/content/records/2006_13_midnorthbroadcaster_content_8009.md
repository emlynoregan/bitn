Local Heritage Boost

Five heritage sites in Burra will receive $400,000 federal funding for crucial conservation and restoration work through the Governmentâ€™s Jobs Fund.  The Redruth Gaol, the old Courthouse, Police Station and Lock-up, the Bon Accord Mine and the Market Square Museum will all benefit.  The Minister for the environment and Heritage, Peter Garrett, said work would include conserving stonework, salt damp treatment and repairs to joinery, flooring, roofing and drainage.  Water collection facilities would be improved, electrical services upgraded and painting of interiors and exteriors would be carried out.  Senator Annette Hurley said the projects would result in jobs for local people.  The sites are on the local Passport trail and their impact would boost tourism and the local economy.  National Trust Burra President, Paul Marsson said it was fantastic news.
