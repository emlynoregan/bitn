Steve Boyes writes to complain about the numbers of council jobs around the town that produce star droppers and flagging or plastic cones that then remain for weeks or months.  It is time jobs were finished in a more timely manner.  The line of star droppers (now, through the passage of time, without flags) from the Kingston Street Bridge to the Bowling Green along the cycle path is a prime example.
