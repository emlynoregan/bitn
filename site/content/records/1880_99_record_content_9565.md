Inquest.  An inquest was held before P. Lane in the Pig and Whistle Fire.

Elizabeth Calloway: Late on 27 Feb. got up on a box to take down the bar lamp.  It was hot and the box slipped.  The lamp fell from my hand and broke as I fell from the box.  Fire ran all over the place, I couldn’t put it out and called my husband.  He threw buckets of water on the fire about 2 a.m. and I tried to beat it out with a bag.  It must have been 20 minutes before he called Mr Benny.  Part of my son’s clothes was saved, but all mine and Mr Calloway’s were lost.  There had been a slight disagreement between Mr Calloway and my daughter and she had gone to spend the night at a friends and ordered a cab to get to the train in the morning as she was going to stay at her sister’s at Rhynie.  She took all her clothes with her.  There were no threats made when Mr Calloway ordered my daughter out of the house.  The cause of the fire was my falling over with the lamp.

Edward Benny: I was roused early in the morning of the 28 Feb. by someone running by the side of my house and calling ‘Benny, my house is on fire.’  I raised the alarm and turned on Mr Henderson’s whistle and roused Constable Johnson and returned to the fire.  By this time I saw it one or two persons would have been of little use.  People were doing little, but some of the little rooms were cleared out.  About 3.00 a.m. the roof of the large room fell in.  The roof of the other part had fallen before I got back about 2.45 a.m.

John Calloway: Corroborated his wife’s evidence, but suggested he threw three buckets of water before rousing Mr Benny.  He could not say he was perfectly sober.  Was never pushed by any creditors.  Insured for £500 in the Felix office for furniture, fixtures, stock and clothing.  Have been offered £500 for the business.  Premises are rented from Catchlove & Co. [Unicorn Brewery] and are not insured by me, but I think they are insured.  Owe them one month’s rent and one month’s beer.  I value my stock and goodwill at £600.  Lost £31-4-0 in the fire - kept in a barrel in the cellar.

Emma Freeman (Mrs Calloway’s daughter) corroborated her mother’s story.

John W. Johnson’s evidence suggests men would not help when asked to get some furniture out.  The kitchen and back bedroom furniture was saved.  When I asked Calloway if he knew how it started he said ‘no I don’t know anything about it.  I did not wake up until the smoke woke me up; sometime after that Mrs Calloway came and told me . . .’ [the story then conforms with Mrs Calloway’s]

Verdict: ‘ . . . fire caused by the accidental upsetting of a kerosene lamp . . . Had Mr Calloway been more energetic in saving the property the public would have assisted more freely.’
