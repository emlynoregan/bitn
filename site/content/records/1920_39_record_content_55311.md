Burra Golf Club meeting of 3 April.  E.W. Edmonds, Secretary, read his report for 1934.

The season opened on 12 May.  Mr Haese drove off the first ball.  The length of the course was increased by approximately 300 yards [though the figure is indistinct] with the creation of three new greens and the abandonment of the old 15th and 18th holes.  A new set of local rules has been drawn up for approval tonight.

In the open tournament the Championship was retained for the second time by Dr Steven.  Mr M.W. Bednall was Club Champion for this year.  The club became incorporated during the year.  And thanks are tendered to Mr M.W. Bednall for attending to the legal work without charge.

1933 closed with the club in credit £11-17-0, but 1934 saw the construction of a clubhouse for £70 leaving an overdraft now of £45-5-9 to which must be added bank interest of £1-3-0 and incorporation fees of £4-11-3.  The ball and open meeting generated £13-12-7 & £6-6-0 respectively, but the Club Championship produced a loss of £1.  Membership fell from 40 to 32, but Associates increased from 27 to 35 and junior members rose from 2 to 4.  There is a real need to cultivate younger player and to maintain membership numbers.  Match results for the year were poor.

Mr Edmonds went on to admonish members for apathy, too little practice and for failing even to return cards from games so that handicappers had data to work from.  He felt there was little club spirit in the past year.  Elected were: President, Dr D.M. Steele; Vice-Presidents, Messrs J.R. Barker & M.W. Bednall; Secretary & Treasurer, E.W. Edmonds & his assistant, J. Pederson.
