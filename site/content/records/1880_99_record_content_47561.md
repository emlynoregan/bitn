Council Officers

Special thanks go to W. Davey for discharging the arduous duties of Town Clerk with diligence, punctuality and integrity.

Mr John Jenkin as Overseer is also a valuable and faithful officer.

For private reasons I cannot allow myself to be nominated for a third term as Mayor for 1893.

W. West
