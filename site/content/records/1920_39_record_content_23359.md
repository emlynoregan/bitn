Burra High School Parents & Friends met at the school on 8 June to consider fund raising for equipment etc.  The school needed 50 students to qualify for another teacher.  It needed boarding places for out-of-town students.  The building needed to be better lit and other changed to improve the study environment.  A gramophone and wireless would be great assets.  They needed better sports facilities and shelter sheds.  The students would stage a concert and dance.  Mr Radford suggested a target to raise of £70 p.a. and Rev. W.O. Harris thought much could be done if each person present set a target of £2 for themselves to raise.
