Local Board of Health

A resolution at the last meeting called upon the Burra Institute to provide better urinal and closet accommodation.  On Friday the Institute Committee resolved to refuse to comply as they do not consider the proposed accommodation necessary.  How they can say this when there is no accommodation of the sort referred to for the general public is amazing.  The board of Health has a right to demand such provision and on behalf of the general public we hope the right will be demanded.
