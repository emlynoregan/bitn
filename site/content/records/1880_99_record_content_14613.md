W.H. Hardy writes again re the water troughs.  He reiterates his charge of meanness against the guarantors.  You say the Aberdeen water system has shown a loss every year due to free water at the troughs and that the beneficiaries are those whose stock received free water, but it has been those who had water laid on who also used the troughs, not only those without water.  So they were not paying for all they used either.  As to the new system, I have been told (from one I took to be an authority) that the three wards will become the guarantors, not individuals.  If I am mistaken in that I must pull in my horns a little.  I still think having free water troughs in the town will do more good for the town than all the squabbling by two or three men who have signed guarantor forms and are now sorry for it.
