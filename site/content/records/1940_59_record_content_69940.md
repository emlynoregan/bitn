The Eastern Districts Firefighting Organisation held its AGM at Koomooloo on 26 September.  The attendance of about 40 was excellent.  The organisation covers a huge area.  The northern edge is the southern boundary of Mutooroo and the southern is the northern boundary of the Morgan DC and it runs from the edge of the District Councils in the west to the state border in the east.  Among the visitors welcomed by Chairman, Rex C. Warnes, were Messrs P. Malpas and King of the EFS in Adelaide and G. Stanley Hawker MP.  P. Malpas gave an interesting talk on general tactics and hints of control of fire fighting.

The Chairmanâ€™s 5th annual report said widespread rains had caused feed growth in this and adjoining areas, creating a very real danger this coming fire season.  In the year Messrs A.M. Simpson & Sons donated 100 knapsack sprays and four have come to this organisation.
