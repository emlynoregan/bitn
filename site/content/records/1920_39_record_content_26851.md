Cr Woollacott did not believe it right that the Inspector should be breaking the very by-law he was handing out fines for violating.  He had been parked 14’6” from the corner and it should have been 25’.  The Town Clerk said the law refers to the near side wheel and not the offside as Cr Woollacott had measured and his position was legal.

The argument continued for some time.

The Mayor said at the sale he had heard a dozen men laughing about the matter, which makes a laughing stock of the by-laws.

Cr Pearce regretted that people had reflected on the Council as a whole, when the matter was between one Councillor and the Inspector.

Cr Harris said he was under his verandah when it occurred and the Inspector’s car seemed from there to be incorrectly parked and several ratepayers there had that impression.  He saw Cr Woollacott go across, but did not see what followed.

The Inspector’s report was finally adopted except for the phrase which reflected on the Council as a whole.
