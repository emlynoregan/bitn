Lieut. Roach’s death removes another of the original 10th Battalion.  Nine Burra boys were in it at the landing on Gallipoli.  One, Pte Harry Skinner, died that day and Pte Jack Camp a few days later.  Seven left for France in April 1915 [sic, error for 1916].  Then Lieut. Essen Rule was killed 3 August 1917, Staff Sgt George Thomson was k.i.a. 24 April 1918 and now Lieut. Eric Roach on 10 August 1918.  Four survive: Sgt Fred Harvey (returned), Pte Arthur Stewart (twice wounded), Cpl Hartley Harris & Pte Fred Wheatley.  The last two were OK on 29 September 1918 [A remarkable observation for a paper dated 28 August 1918!]
