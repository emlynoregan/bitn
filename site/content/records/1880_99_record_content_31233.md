Fire Inquest.  Redruth Court House: Thursday.

W.R. Ridgway JP conducted an inquest into a fire, which occurred on the property of W. McBride (Sections 37, 43, 47, & 57) along the railway line on Christmas Day.  H. Pinch was foreman of the jury.

William McBride said he lost 140-150 acres of grass in the fire which started very soon after a train passed and he was sure that was the origin of it.  He valued his loss at 12/- per acre.

Mr McNeil corroborated.

Richard Austin, owner of section 118 adjoining said the fire extended to his paddock of 50 acres valued at 12/- per acre.  He had no idea of its origin.

Elizabeth Mills said she resided on pt section 117 and lost c. 18 acres of grass and lucerne valued at £1 per acre.  She believed the train to be the cause as there was no sign of fire immediately before the train.

Josiah Thomas owned section 42 adjoining McBride’s and lost 22 acres of grass worth c. 2/6 per acre and a sheep-proof fence worth £2-10-0.

John Fitzgerald was a drover and a passenger in the train and his evidence supported the above.

Samuel Harvey, ganger for the railways, tried to put out the fire, but failed.  He did not know its origin.  The fire could not have started on the line as the grass there is burnt off.

Thomas W. Oates, labourer, supported the idea of the train as the probable origin of the fire.

Henry Edwards, engine driver, felt that the engine could not be the origin as the fire had been banked and spark catchers were fitted.

The jury decided the engine had been the origin of the fire.
