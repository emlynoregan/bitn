Koonoona Field Day was held last Thursday.  Studmaster Glen Hawkes and Manager Len Boothby must have been delighted with their success.  Black Springs CWA ladies provided lunch.  Some 400 people attended and 200 cars were accommodated.  At least one buyer from WA paid 600 guineas for a ram and others sold for 300, 250 and 100 guineas.  Stud ewes and flock hoggets were also on show.  In recent years demand from New Zealand has been quite strong, particularly from areas on the east side of the South Island with a climate similar to Burraâ€™s.
