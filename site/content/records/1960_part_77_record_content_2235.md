Burra Primary School Committee AGM

Mr M.G. Stockman was elected Chairman with Mr D.H. Field as Secretary-Treasurer.

Report for 1959

The staffing position was satisfactory with seven teachers for seven grades.

The highlight of the year was the visit of the Governor Sir Robert George and Lady George.

A sports day was held on the oval in lieu of a picnic.

Visiting Day was held in conjunction with the High School.

Negotiations are under way to acquire the land between the school and the Drill Hall to allow an extension of the playing area and these should be concluded shortly.

We missed out on Arbor Day due to the dry conditions.

The lunch room has been nicely furnished and the free milk system is working well.

There is still a move afoot to have an extension library in the main building, a new classroom in the yard and a new block of lavatories for Primary School use on the east side.

The latest advice from the Department is that the main school roof is to be renovated to do away with the roofing well and the box guttering â€“ rendering many pigeons homeless and helping to keep drinking water clean.
