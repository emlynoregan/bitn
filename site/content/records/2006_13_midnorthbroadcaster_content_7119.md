Recycled Water for Burra.  As part of the Federal Governmentâ€™s fiscal funding program the Regional Council of Goyder has $100,000 for its Infrastructure Program.  At its February meeting it discussed where to spend this.  In view of the extensive work it has done at Eudunda in the recycling and re-use of treated waste water from the sewage treatment plant onto the oval, gardens and in the future onto the golf course, it was agreed to the introduction of a similar project for Burra.  Council asset manager Trevor Wood says Burra has about 15 megalitres available annually from its treatment system.   Designs are being prepared for a filter and chlorination system so the water can then be pumped through a pipeline to irrigate the oval, caravan park gardens, Market Square lawns and gardens and other areas as they become available.  As an interim measure bore water will be piped to Market Square next week to enable lawns to be better watered and better managed.  This will be replaced with recycled water when it becomes available.
