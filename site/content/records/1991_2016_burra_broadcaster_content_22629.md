Perlite.  Ed James of Chillagoe Perlite has been critical of the delays to the project caused by the EPA.  His concerns have been echoed by the CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board, Craig Wilson.  The EPA says there has been a 50% increase in applications to it over the past three years, but no increase in staff to handle them.  Regional Development SA has agreed to take these concerns to the Minister for the Environment, the Hon. Iain Evans MP.
