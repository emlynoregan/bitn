Burra School & Community News

At present 1,000 copies are printed each week.  The average cost is $90 to $95 per week in materials. 
Many volunteers make it possible:

5 editors – 1 per week

7 typists – 3 per week

2 proof-readers – 1 per week

9 in layout – 2 per week

8 collators – 4 to 5 per week

4 on delivery – 2 per week

The Apex Club has been a major supporter and with its closure even more will depend on the generosity of the general public.
