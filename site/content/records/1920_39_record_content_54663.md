Mongolata Goldfield: ‘Phenominal Returns’ [sic]

The Mining Review for the six months ending 30 June 1934 reports very interesting returns, but although Mongolata produces the bulk of gold in SA it is not even mentioned in the preface.  The following returns are from the record of ore treated at the Mongolata Battery.

From The News 7 February 1935

In Parliament Mr Lacey, the Leader of the Opposition, said unemployment had improved less in SA than in any other state and he again placed the claims of Mongolata before the House.

While in SA recently Mr R.H. Jeffery, a director of Exploration Co. Ltd, London, a major investor in mineral developments, visited Mongolata.  As a result the possibility of English capital being injected into this neglected field is being discussed on the Stock Exchange.  He specifically inspected Byles’ Mongolata and spoke in complimentary terms of the work being done there and expressed the view that the field should be tested by diamond drill.

The Chief Inspector of Mines Mr L.J. Winton is presently at Mongolata inspecting operations on the field.

Mr Lacey, Leader of the Opposition, referred to the Government’s neglect of gold mining in SA and predicted big developments in the near future, while speaking in the Address-in-Reply debate.  Today he said he was referring to the English capital to be invested in the Byles’ Co.

The Mongolata Goldfield is 6 miles long and about 120 men are working it, mostly in small groups, all of which are getting gold.  If the Mines Department would test the field there is no reason why more men would not be employed.  The Government battery is presently operating 12 hours a day, but there is no reason it couldn’t be working 24 hours a day.
