Obituary.  William Read [Reed] Wilson died on Saturday 19 July aged 88.  He was born at St Albans in Hertfordshire on 10 May 1831 and educated at the Blue Coat School.  On 1 November 1848 he enlisted in the 49th Foot Regiment aged 17½ and served 6 years & 83 days, seeing service in the Crimean War at Alma, Sebastopol and Inkerman and was wounded the day before the Charge of the Light Brigade.  In 1863 he married and migrated to Australia in the Duchess of Northumberland, arriving in 1864.  He got a Government job in Adelaide before coming to Burra in 1874, where he has lived ever since except for brief stays at Pt Wakefield and Whit Hut.  His funeral on Sunday 20 July was accorded full military honours and almost every returned soldier attended.  A gun carriage was improvised with a guard accompanying, then the mourning coach and further soldiers in a slow march.  The Ladies’ band attended and three volleys were fired over the coffin and ‘Last Post’ sounded.  He is survived by a widow, a son and three daughters: A. Wilson of Perth WA, Misses A. & M. Wilson and Mrs F.H. Pledge of Kooringa.  There are three granddaughters.
