Kooringa Wesleyan Anniversary on Easter Sunday and Monday.  Rev. R.W. Campbell preached.  Congregations were large and the Service of Song was ‘Nothing to Nobody’.

The Sunday School had 266 children and 24 teachers.  There had been 63 children added in the year, but after taking removals into account the number was up only 18.  The proceeds amounted to £44.
