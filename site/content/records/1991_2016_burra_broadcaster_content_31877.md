Weather.  A storm on 23-24 August resulted in some minor flooding, a blackout in some areas of the district and an uprooted tree in Queen Street.  The Burra Creek flowed for the first time in five or six years and it was added to by flows from Springbank Creek and Firewood Creek.  Over 50 mm fell in four to five days.

Some areas of the town were blacked out by an electrical storm in the early hours of Saturday.
