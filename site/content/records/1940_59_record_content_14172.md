Burra Town Council, 5 July

The new Councillors were welcomed.

The Mayor’s allowance was set at same sum as last year.

Highways & Local Govt Dept advises that signposts can be replaced and costs debited to the Main Roads Grant.

Thomas & Co. reply that the old mill site is now owned by R.G. Howard & Co.

Council will get in touch with the owners to see it made safe.

Simpson & Sons quote £9 plus sales tax + 1% for a 19” x 14” plaque for HMAS Burra-Bra.

R.J. Fairchild writes complaining that grazing sheep in the reserve near the Burra Saleyards had eaten and damaged certain trees and as secretary of the Burra Tree Planting Committee he considered it a discourtesy of Council to allow sheep there at all.

The Mayor said the sheep owners had suggested the sheep would reduce the threat of fire and flood.  He had looked at the damage and some trees might recover, but 12 to 15 were eaten down short.  The owners of the sheep will be requested to replace the trees.

Cr Bevan said no tenders were received for the repair of the Victoria Park Wall.  Posts and wire around the playing area had not been replaced and the general appearance was a disgrace and a slur on the Council.

Cr Kellaway said there was so much work on the books that it was impossible to repair Victoria Park.

A Red Cross Concert at Mt Bryan netted £26 in the continuing Miss Red Cross drive.

Football at Hallett on Saturday resulted in a win for the visiting Military Team (playing Hallett) by 3 points.  The game and following dance produced £52-11-0 for Miss Red Cross contender Miss I. Weber.
