Accident.  A truck overturned at Hanson on Friday night.  It was owned by G.H. Adams, carrier of Camden Gardens and driven by James G. Beckett of Thebarton and was heading for Broken Hill.  The driver was dazzled by on-coming lights at the sharp turn and in avoiding the approaching car, rolled his vehicle.  The driver and passenger, A.S. Jones of Thebarton, escaped with minor injuries, but damage to the truck and its load is estimated at Â£1,000.
