Letter from R.J. Woollacott, Rouen, France, 30 April.

He talks of his convalescence and of hearing of the Dardanelles exploits.

‘I quite understand the political necessity of having much glory attached to their exploits.’  The papers and censors will see to it.  [Perhaps the first sign of some cynicism in his letters.]

On 9 May he writes detailing just where the Battalion is: 6 miles towards the Belgian border from Givenchy, though he was then at base camp near Le Havre.

Reg. Woollacott is now reported killed (the first day in action).  He talks of other battalions and of paper reports of Australians in action.

‘dead men are no good to any army (though I know places where the French have used them in building a sand-bag barricade, thus saving the trouble of burying a dead man and of filling about three sand bags.)’
