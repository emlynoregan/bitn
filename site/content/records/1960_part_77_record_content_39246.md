Weather.  Light patchy rain has been general.  For the week the agricultural areas have reported 25-40 points. To the east the falls have been more varied, from 34 at Woolgangi to 110 at Quondong and 150 at Faraway.

Rev. John Stephenson will be inducted as Rector of St Mary’s tomorrow.

Accident.  A car driven by Mr C. Stannard of Burra North overturned at Steelton, and was extensively damaged without injuring the driver.

Anzac Service.  The Port Pirie Pipe Band led the march at Burra on Sunday.  After the wreath laying at the Memorial the service was conducted in the RSL Hall.  In the evening a combined service was held in the Redruth Methodist Church, conducted by Rev. Milton Edwards with Rev. Geoff Sibly (Anglican) giving the address and reading the lesson, as his last official function as Rector of Burra.

[Services at Spalding, Saddleworth, Hallett and Booborowie are also reported.]

Football begins next Saturday.  The Football Commissioners of the Mid North and the North Eastern League have met for the first time in many years to discuss some difficulties, mainly in respect to granting clearances and issuing permits.  One of the issues was the matter of players between Aberdeen and Burra and this was resolved with a number of automatic clearances between the clubs to close a matter running for a long period of years.

Burra Primary School Sports were held 19 April in poor conditions, with rain, wind and dust at times.  Despite all this it was a good day’s sport.  Aberdeen House was eventually victorious.  [Details in 1⅓ columns.]
