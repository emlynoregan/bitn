Friendly Societies Meeting.

Representatives of the Foresters, Oddfellows and Rechabites met on Monday to arrange a program to put to the Institute Committee re certain repairs to the Institute.

John Sampson said first was a porch or anteroom to provide privacy for meetings.

2nd was the need for privy and urinal accommodation: the present arrangements being insufficient.

John Jenkin supported the above and concluded the outside accommodation indecent when both sexes were congregated for entertainment lasting almost the whole night.

T.W. Pearce agreed and said the lodge room was most uncomfortable in winter, being cold with wind coming under the door.

Also supported by F. Carey & W.H. Linkson for the Foresters, who thought they should have access to the Council room which also had a fireplace.

Mr J. Jones supported the same on behalf of the Rechabites.

Mr W.J. Davey also endorsed this as did G. Parks.

They would wait upon the Institute Committee which was meeting in another room.
