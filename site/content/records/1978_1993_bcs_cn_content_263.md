Sheep’s Back to Garment Competition

A team of six went from Burra to Peterborough on 21 October to compete with three other teams in a race to get wool from the sheep to a garment.  A crossbred sheep was shorn and teams selected their part of the fleece.  Two spinners went to work while another stood by to ply the thread.  Next it was wound into a skein, washed, dried and handed to the knitter.  The winning team produced a cap complete with a pompom in 1 hour 20 minutes.  Burra’s team came in ten minutes later.

Burra team: Mr & Mrs Nettleton, Mr & Mrs Briggs, Mrs Betty Thamm and Mrs Carpenter.
