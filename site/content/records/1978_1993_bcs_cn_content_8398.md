Helen R. Stockman

Just completed eleven months as one of Burra Town Ward Councillors.  There was much to learn and I have enjoyed it.

Have developed a special interest in the Hospital, planning, finance, provision of services for the elderly and further development of tourism.

Have a firm belief that sound decision making is what the electorate wanted.
