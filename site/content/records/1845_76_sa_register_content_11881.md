Kooringa News, 24 August

The Empire Minstrels have been performing for some nights in the large room at the Burra Hotel to larger audiences than were expected from the quality of the entertainment.

The Nelson family of entertainers are expected in a few days.

Dr Mayneâ€™s son has a much admired Shetland pony, recently imported.

Storekeepers in Kooringa have been suffering pilfering from goods on display.

The Mining Company has nothing to do with the ford at Aberdeen and Redruth; it was made by the Copper Company for their convenience.  The Mining Co. has a good substantial bridge connecting the two parts of the town on their property, although it might have been better placed at the end of [Commercial Street] and been of considerable service to the drays and passengers having business on the other side.

[Presumably a reference to the Bridge Street Bridge.]
