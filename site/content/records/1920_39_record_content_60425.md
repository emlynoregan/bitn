Mongolata

The usual Anglican service was conducted by Rev. D. Redding last Wednesday and was followed by a concert compered by Guy Dollman and put on by the visitors.

A cement cricket pitch has been laid behind J.R. Barker’s woolshed.  Last weekend Aberdeen Colts visited and scored 174 and 0 for 21 to defeated Mongolata 108 & 81.

Weather.  Severe electrical storms were widely experienced on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday last.  On Wednesday two very heavy downpours delivered 38 points locally.  116 points were reported from ‘The Gum’s’.  Falls in the east were very erratic: Balah 110, Bendigo 80 in less than half an hour, Redcliffe 40, Mallett 14, Collinsville 8, Koomooloo 52, Woolgangi 34, Braemar 4 and Pine valley 43.  At Baldina E. Rooke recorded 58, but Mongolata missed out.  Many creeks flowed, so there must have been heavy falls in many catchments.
