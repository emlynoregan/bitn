Cr Sampson expressed concern about the possible reopening of the mine and urged a deferral of any decision.

W. Geake moved an amendment to set up a committee including ratepayers and Councillors.  2nd by Mr Rayner.

The Chairman felt the Council should have a chance before such a committee or it would look like a want of confidence in them.

Mr Lane’s motion was carried.

The meeting then turned to consider the Mayoralty.

Holder said he had no ambitions of being Mayor and had signed a requisition calling on W.R. Ridgway to stand.  When he was approached to stand he had understood that Mr Ridgway was not coming out and so agreed to stand in the absence of any experienced candidate.  When he heard that Mr Ridgway was coming out he asked his proposers to allow him to withdraw, but they declined.  The one thing that had persuaded him to remain in the running was the extraordinary proceedings with the assessment appeals.

He felt that ‘it was not expedient at this crisis that one who had been associated in the matter should be placed at the head of municipal affairs, and that Mr Ridgway had thus forfeited his claim.’  (Cheers)

Cr Ridgway said that he was there as the result of a requisition signed by 81 ratepayers.  ‘He had seen many hanky-panky tricks, but this was the first time he had been opposed by a man who had signed his requisition. (Uproar)  It was quite unique’

Had Holder agreed to stand before Monday last he (Ridgway) would not be on the platform.  But he wanted now conciliation and construction ‘If elected he would get the business of the town done instead of indulging in outside twaddle.’

With respect to the assessments: ‘nothing could have been fairer. (Hisses and uproar)’.   The council had plenty of time to defend themselves and it was wise for them to have done as they did.  (Cries of no and uproar)

Mr Lane asked if Mr Ridgway were aware the assessment was illegal before he appealed to the Local Court.

He said he was not.  He thought a reduction was necessary all round.  Mr Holder did not think so, but only that some alteration should be made.

Ridgway said he had never made any threat with reference to the assessment.

‘Mr Lane proposed that Mr Holder was a fit and proper person to be Mayor of the town.  He had served the town well, he had never been a party to any clique, nor had he ever entered into any round robbinism or put the town to any expense . . . he remembered a time when a few ratepayers had joined together and put the town to a lot of expense through the same thing, he would ask any commonsense ratepayer was it fair.  He held that no other man had attempted to put the town to such expense as the man aspiring at present to the position of Mayor.’

Ridgway objected to Mr Lane going on in such a way.

Mr T. Edward 2nd Mr Lane’s proposal.

Mr Geake supported it and declared he was sorry to have supported Ridgway’s requisition and ‘after the proceedings which had taken place in the court last week, he would rather be branded a traitor than mix up with or support a man who had been a party to such proceedings.  (Loud cheers)  And one who had attempted to take such an advantage of the ratepayers.  (Cheers)’

Mr Lane’s motion in favour of Mr Holder was carried without dissent.

Cr Rabbich moved that Mr Ridgway was a fit and proper person to represent the town as Mayor.  (Dissent)

Mr Packard 2nd.

When the motion was put there were only 4 votes in support.
