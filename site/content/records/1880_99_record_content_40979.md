Burra Town Council, 6 April.

Many ratepayers attended and Mr Rabbich, whose seat was declared vacant last meeting, took his usual place.

Minutes of the last and of the adjourned special meetings were read and confirmed.

Cr Sampson asked if, as Cr Rabbich had been removed from office, he was present as a Councillor or ratepayer.

The Mayor asked Cr Rabbich, who replied that he was elected by north Ward and was present as a Councillor to watch their interests.

Cr Sampson asked that these words be noted before drawing the Mayor’s attention to Schedule 6, page 82 in which penalties for offences are set out.  For sitting as Councillor after having been disqualified the penalty was £50 and as Cr Rabbich persisted in sitting he would move ‘That as Cr Rabbich had unlawfully taken his seat that he be fined £50.’  Cr Watt 2nd and Crs O’Leary and Parks concurred.

The mayor said that the matter could have been amicably settled, but Cr Rabbich wouldn’t do it and now his persistence had made him liable to a fine of £50.

Cr Rabbich: ‘That is questionable.’

The Mayor was surprised any representative would put his ward to the expense of litigation.

Cr Butterworth would vote against the motion.

Cr Rabbich protested against its being put at all as it was, he said, ultra viris.

[He, or perhaps the paper, meant ultra vires: beyond one’s legal powers.]

Motion carried with all but Cr Butterworth supporting.

Cr Rabbich kept his seat.

The Engineer-in-Chief wrote offering to supply larger pipes for the school connection and to take the others back.  Agreed.

Levels have been taken in the watercourse at Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s and there was a fall of over 6’ inside the brewery walls and about 10’ from where the obstruction was.  There was no occasion to lower the ford.

Cr Butterworth said the road to the mill needed doing badly, but it depended on the North Ward finances and he would move it be left for a fortnight.

Various public works issues were then discussed and resolved.

Cr Sampson then brought up the Bagot, Shakes & Lewis watercourse issue.  In fairness to Mr Lockyer, who had cleared out the course through the brewery yard and to other ratepayers, the obstruction should be removed.  A letter from the firm asking that the ford be lowered was monstrous given the fall to and from the ford.  He moved that ‘Bagot, Shakes & Lewis be served with a notice, in accordance with the act, to remove the obstruction to the water-course, and that particulars of the fall from the obstruction to ford as per levels taken be given them.’  Cr Butterworth 2nd.

There was a brief altercation between Crs Watt and Rabbich before it was put and carried.

Cr Sampson reported on the deputation that had waited on the Institute about the urinal accommodation and it had been suggested one be placed in the Avenue between the P.O. and the Institute with the Institute Committee to pay one-third the cost.  Cr Sampson moved that the Institute Committee be conferred with and plans for same be drawn up.

A further altercation involving Cr Rabbich and the Mayor and Cr Sampson followed.

Minor Waterworks Committee matters were attended to.

The mayor was appointed returning officer for the extraordinary vacancy in North Ward.

‘Reminder’ writes complaining that no action has been taken to assert the Council’s rights in the Bagot, Shakes & Lewis obstruction case, or towards getting the Bon Accord Bridge.
