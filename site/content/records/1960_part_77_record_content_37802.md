For much of the year this was the familiar mixture of a few large advertisements with public notices, advertising for land sales and for district events.  This changed late in the year (from 24 October) when editorials reappeared for the first time in many years.  The page was then typically: Editorial, Cash Column, some larger advertisements and local news and sports, with the previous page two material moved on to page 3.
