Mining Shares, 11 April

Burra Burra 		£5 shares were priced at £140

Princess Royal		£50 shares (80% paid) were selling for £40.

Why Don’t They Smelt?

The question arises after viewing the heaps of ore at Port Adelaide.

What would be the advantages of smelting?

The ore is difficult to export in its crude state.

It would save greatly on freight. (The freight on 5,000 tons at £4-10-0 per ton is £22,500; two thirds of which could be saved.  Or if we consider the cost of ore at £10 per ton then £50,000 of capital is locked up while it sits on a wharf waiting to be shipped.  The interest at 10% for three months amounts to £1,250.)

The main mine presently working is the Burra Burra, but how much more ore will be locked up like this when Kapunda is fully operational and the crosscuts at Kanmantoo and Tungkillo have struck lode?

The present system limits ores to 20% or better.  How much more might be raised if ores of 10 or 12% were viable [due to local smelting]?

Smelting was toyed with earlier, but now the mines are flourishing what has happened to the idea?

[The writer refers to the experiments with smelting at the Burra Burra Mines and thinks a smelting company should be floated.  The conclusion is that smelting must come and in more than one site and in more than one of the colonies.]

Princess Royal Mining Co.  A general meeting of the proprietors is being held today.
