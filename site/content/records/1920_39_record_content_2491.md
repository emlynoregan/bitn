Burra Sports Syndicate re the Position of Burra Shows

Frank Treloar, Burra Sports Trust Secretary writes to clarify the situation.

The grounds were purchased in June 1908 by the present members of the Trust with the intent of securing a ground for sports purposes.

Shortly after this exchanges and additions were made to make the grounds more suitable.

Fencing and planting was undertaken and a grandstand with enclosures was erected.  Steps were taken to incorporate the Trust so it could go on forever.

Nothing has been paid back to the original donors.  Small profits are spent in upkeep.

In April 1909 the Burra Show Soc. held a meeting to decide the site of shows.  P.L. Killicoat was President and Mr McLaren was secretary.  Mr Thomas Sandland attended in the interests of the Trust and promised five years use free of charge and to have the grandstand with enclosure ready for the 1909 show in September.  The offer was accepted and confirmed the same day by the Trust.

Mr John Melrose met the cost of moving and erecting all the cattle and sheep yards.

The free use was extended by the Trust to 8 years.

June 1917 Mr Warnes as President of the Agricultural Soc. [Show Soc.] with Mr Winnall waited on the Trust to ask on what terms the Show Soc. could have a lease as they were placing improvements on the ground.  The Trust explained it aimed to encourage all kinds of legitimate sport and hoped any improvements made by any body could be used by all.

The Trust carried a resolution granting the Show the right to hold their exhibitions on the ground for 21 years at a fee of £3-3-0 per year.

I believe a Show Soc. resolution accepted this offer.

14 April 1920 Mr M.A. Radford wrote to say a determined effort would be made in the following summer to restart polo and it would greatly strengthen the promoters’ position if the Trust could assure them they would be permitted to use the grounds previously played on.  He regretted it was too early for a formal application, but was confident something definite would be done in summer.

The Trust then informed the Show Society that the present ring with jumps etc. was encroaching on the grounds originally allotted to the Polo Club and as they wish to re-start playing this season the Trust wish the Society to remove the ring and jumps to their original position.
