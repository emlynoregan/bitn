Obituary.  August Brandt died on Monday after a long illness. He was the youngest son of Mr & Mrs Albert Brandt and was born in August 1889 and spent his whole life in Burra except for his long war service.  He enlisted with the 3rd Light Horse in 1914.  He had a very honourable record of service in Egypt and Palestine.  He worked until weakness forced him to stop a few months ago.  In 1924 he married Miss Beryl Goldsworthy who is now left with three children.

[August Amos Robert Brandt was born at Kooringa 9 August 1889 and died there 18 November 1929.]
