Rains and Floods.  On 26 February no rain fell in the town, but in a strip from Black springs to near Booborowie a downpour dropped from 75 points to 2 inches in about an hour.  A great flow of water came down the [Springbank] Creek which enters Burra Creek behind the Bon Accord.  Much low-lying country was flooded.  Floods stripped much country of dry feed.  At Leighton falls were about 75 points and it petered out before Booborowie.  A fall the same day at Mt Cone filled some dams.
