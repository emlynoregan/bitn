Kooringa, 8 June.

Bible Christian Sunday School Anniversary Services were preached on Whit-Sunday by Rev. J.A. Burns and Mr R. Dale.  The congregations exceeded the capacity of the chapel.  Monday was a holiday and the children marched around the town, headed by the band and then had tea and cake.  The public meeting was well attended and the effort raised Â£50-11-8.

The Benson Troupe appeared at the Institute on Wednesday and this evening before good audiences.
