Kooringa News, 7 January

Obituary.  Mrs G. Hiles, wife of a sheep farmer in the north came down here for medical advice, but died before any assistance could be rendered.

[Born Charlotte Ann Cole 26 January 1821, Lindfield, Sussex, England (from BISA): died 1 January 1863, Redruth, residence Mungibbie [a.k.a. Munjibbie].  Age then stated as 40.]

Accident.  A loud report on Tuesday, followed by a piercing scream, was the result of an explosion of gun powder that blew the thumb completely off a young boy named Brown. It is not clear whether it was a powder flask which exploded or a pistol he had loaded and fired.  Immediate medical attention was rendered, but the boy remains in a precarious state.

Messrs Poussard, Douay, Wilkinson and Beaumont gave concerts on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Monday.

Westbury Wesleyan Chapel held anniversary services on Sunday with a tea and public meeting on Monday.

Rev. C. Colwell delivered a lecture in the Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel on The Wonders of Geology.
