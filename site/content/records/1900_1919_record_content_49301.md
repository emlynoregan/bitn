Elections: President, Mr Winnall; Vice-president, Mr Harcus; Treasurer T.H. Wilkinson [T.H.?]; Secretary, J. Drew.

Messrs Drew and Crewes were elected to fill trustee vacancies caused by the deaths of Mr A. Bartholomaeus and Mr C.C. Williams.

Mr Crewes moved the billiard room be considered as since 6 o’clock closing young men had no place to enjoy themselves except the hotel billiard rooms.

Mr Dane felt a new piano was a higher priority.

Mr McLaren felt enlarging the hall was the highest priority.

Mr Crewes’ motion to consider the Billiard Room was lost.
