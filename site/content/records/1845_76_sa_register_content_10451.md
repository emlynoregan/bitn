17,688 males arrived and 5,537 departed.

10,399 females arrived and 2,949 departed.

But note that records of departures are defective.  Recorded figures suggest the SA population is now 105,322, but it is thought to be in the range 90,000 to 92,000.  One reason (among several) is that in the first two quarters of 1856 some 5,000 Chinese arrived on their way to Victoria, but their departures have not been recorded.

[The lengthy report then goes on to detail the demographic and social characteristics of the immigrants; their origins, literacy, occupations, etc.  Details of the Government migrant ships are given.  Of some interest is the length of the voyages, which ranged from 79 days to 132 days, with an average of 98Â½.  The costs of getting these people to the colony are also discussed.]
