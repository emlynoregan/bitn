The New Year

Unseasonable weather has now given way to typical summer and though the recent rough weather has lost some grain the yield will be higher than in recent years.

The price of wool is very low, but the season has been good.

The Broken Hill Mines are again in full swing.

The SA Treasury is well supplied and should be able to complete the year in surplus.

No labour troubles presently threaten and a prosperous year seems in prospect.

General elections are due in April.  We will have the Leader of the Opposition declare his policy in Burra.  Federation will be a prominent question.
