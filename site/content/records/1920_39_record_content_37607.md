Shooting incident.  A young man mowing the lawn at Millippa Station the home of Mr Glen G. Hawkes says a bullet whistled past him last week, fired from a white Dodge car that was passing.  Later he found a dead calf shot through the head.  Perhaps this was a thoughtless act, but it may well have had more serious consequences.
