Council Amalgamation.

Hallett DC will be collating a survey on Friday night that was recently sent to residents, seeking the number wishing to merge west or south.  The result will guide the Council in its final decision.  The Structural Reform Working Party will meet on Wednesday 13 November to consider any changes to the draft merger proposal.  The final proposal is due to be lodged with the Reform Board after approval on 20 November.  The proposal is expected to ask for a regional council to be formed in February 1997.
