Mongolata Goldfield

There is talk there may be platinum on the field.

On the alluvial site Mr Kirkham the manager reports they were down 80ft when he noticed some solder-like pellets.  Mr Hack of Byles claim said this is exactly like platinum.  The specimens will be tested.

Block 8 driving at the bottom of the top shaft has reached 20ft and the east crosscut off the tunnel is at 14ft with some traces of gold.
