The SA Labour Market

The agents in Britain choosing migrants have of late been selecting carefully and the arrangements made for their voyages have been much improved, if not perfect.  The provisions have generally been of good quality and sufficient in quantity.  The berths have been conveniently arranged and bedding supplied.  Ventilation has been adequate and medical comforts provided.  Arrangements for general comfort and cleanliness have resulted in remarkably few deaths on the voyages.  More than 650 persons have recently arrived.  When a ship is known to be about to arrive those in need of servants or employees strive to be first on board.  When the Abberton arrived recently many went down the harbour several miles to meet her, only to find she had anchored outside the Light-vessel, so they went further and boarded her there.  Decent female servants are much in demand and liberal wages are being paid.  Examples of wages:

Blacksmiths	30/- to 35/- per week

Bricklayers	6/- to 6/6 a day

Carpenters	6/- to 7/- a day

Masons	6/- to 7/- a day

Labourers	15/- to 25/- a week

Shoe & bootmakers	30/- to 45/- per week

Shepherds	10/- to 12/- per week plus rations*

Hutkeepers	6/- to 8/- per week plus rations

Farm labourers	10/- to 14/- per week plus rations

Domestic servants	£14 to £18 per year or 5/- to 7/- per week plus board and lodging

Cooks	£18 to £25 per year plus board and lodging

Miners	25/- to 30/- a week, but skilled miners are often engaged on tribute

[* The standard rations supplied are 10 lb flour, 10 lb fresh meat, 2 lb sugar and ¼ lb of tea.]

With all this labour arriving it would be nice to see more men with capital amongst them.
