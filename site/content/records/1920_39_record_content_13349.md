Burra Town Council 5 May

Over 1 column of report, but the main thrust was that works approved were not being done in the order in which they were approved and some approved over a year earlier had still not been done.

Cr Kellaway moved that any of the old acetylene lamps worth keeping be stored in the depot house and the others taken to the dump.

Employeeâ€™s wages were increased by 5d a day in line with a basic wage increase.
