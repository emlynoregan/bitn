Cr Wicklein said Mr Grow had offered to exchange a bit of land to straighten out the road.

Mr Treloar favoured a lighting rate, as at present Â£100 p.a. went from the general rate and this deprived the back streets of attention.

The Mayor favoured this if rates could be kept reasonable overall.

Mr Crewes would favour it if one of the other rates could be reduced.

Radford, Wicklein & Lane were also in favour of it.
