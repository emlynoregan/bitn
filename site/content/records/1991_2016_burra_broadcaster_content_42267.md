The sites occupied by the Burra Record and its predecessors are very difficult, if not impossible to pin down.  The business appears to have begun on allotment 72 in 1876.  (In 2017 this was opposite the Mobil Roadhouse).  In 1878 there was a move to the site adjacent to the Visitor Information Centre of 2017 on part allotment 79 – where the chemist shop was located in 2017.  Its next move is hard to fathom.  In 1880 it was said to move next door in June and in September into one of the new shops built immediately north.  A fire destroyed this group of four shops in 1883, but they were quickly rebuilt and the paper seems to have moved back into its site.  In 1897 the premises of the paper were bought by Walkers, who incorporated it into their large shop and the paper moved two doors north.  We have not precisely dated the next and final move, which saw the paper occupy the two shops immediately east of Pascoe’s (the two storey building on Commercial Street), but Council assessment records place E.F. Marston on part allotment 70 in 1922.]
