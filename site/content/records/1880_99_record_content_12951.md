Burra Town Council.

The Public Works Committee could not recommend any work on the Queen St Bridge due to the present state of finances.  They held that the recent floods had more to do with the narrowness of the Commercial St Bridge and the narrowing of channel by the walls of Mr Pearce’s property.

The facts relating to the Aberdeen Reserve will be submitted to the Municipal Assoc.’s lawyers.
