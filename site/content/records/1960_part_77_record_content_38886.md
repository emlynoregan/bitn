Accident.  A semi-trailer loaded with cattle overturned at Hanson on Friday night.  The driver suffered broken ribs.  Two transports owned by Whittam Transport Pty Ltd of Strathalbyn were taking cattle from Strathalbyn to Broken Hill.  The second vehicle overturned at the Hanson corner.  The driver was Mr Darrell Malcolm Wray of Meadows.  Most of the 68 cows and calves were roaming around.  One calf was killed and another three cows had to be destroyed.  The lost animals were valued at $500.  Damage to the vehicle was estimated at $3,800.  Mr Tom Rogers and others helped round up the cattle.  The district Council grader and bulldozer were used to right the vehicle on Saturday morning.  Another prime-mover was brought in and the damaged one returned to Strathalbyn.
