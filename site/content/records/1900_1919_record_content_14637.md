Yesterday Thomas Whelan was charged with attempting to take his own life.  He had been found out east three weeks ago with his throat cut.  He is a young man of about 24 ‘of foreign decent’ [sic].  He did not know why he did it.  He seems to have gradually grown depressed through unemployment, a rough bush life and growing weakness.  He was fined £1 and bound to keep the peace for three months.  He was also charged with unlawful possession of some cooking utensils of a man named Hill in the Hundred of King.  For that he was fined 10/- (or 14 days).  He said he wanted to get work.  The bench was anxious to help as much as possible and suggested the Salvation Army in Adelaide would assist, though Whelan was reluctant to accept help.  [It is not clear whether the fines were paid or he ended up in jail.  See also VX, 688, 9 Aug. 1905, Page 4-5 where his age is given as 34.]
