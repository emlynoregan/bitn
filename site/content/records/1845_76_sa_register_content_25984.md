A Trip Through the Northern Areas

Georgetown and Gulnare.  Narridy to Georgetown is an area of splendid wheat crops.  Locally Georgetown is regarded as the capital of the north.  The town itself is not exciting.  The main street boasts one hotel, four or five general stores, saddlers, shoemakers, blacksmiths etc.  One establishment that places the town a cut above the average is the Italian Warehouse.  [In a meandering comment of a dozen lines the writer reveals this to be a pharmacist; of some importance in an area without medical practitioners.  He does not know why it is called by the title mentioned.]

Accommodation for travellers is at present atrocious, but will be remedied by a public house now under construction.  Georgetown is unusual in SA in not having a Wesleyan, Bible Christian, Primitive Methodist or Methodist New Connexion Chapel.  The biggest church is Roman Catholic and there is a resident priest.  The Baptists have regular services in a large galvanized iron wheat store lent by Messrs Mitchell, Fox & Co., but are building a chapel.  This is unusually shaped as an octagon, looking something like a cross between a summer-house and a tea-garden rotunda.  But what is carried on inside is of more importance than the external appearance.  Anglicans are not numerous, but lay readers hold regular services in a private house.

I have so far avoided reference to Georgetown’s mud, but it is not possible to convey the quality and quantity of that commodity.  One young man told me that it was more than a month since he has been able to cross a chain and a half street there ‘to procure the mild solace of a glass of ale!’  Despite money being voted for improvements and a visit by an emissary from the Central Road Board, nothing has actually been done.  The area is very prosperous with returns of 12-18 bushels to the acre and last year the colony’s average was under 8.  The year before that the Georgetown area managed 25 to 30 bushels per acre.  As a change from crops I was driven south to the well-known Bundaleer Station.  Crops now come almost to the door of the self-contained and well-appointed head station.  The place was busy with shearers.  In addition to the sheep breeding, the owner seems intent upon making Bundaleer a centre for horse breeding.

Gulnare is the home mainly of Scots and Irish with a few English.
