Fire.  The Eastern Fire

Exhausted men could be found sleeping almost anywhere a little shelter was offered around the house in the sheds or on the wood-heap and even on trucks in the blazing sun, as they moved from place to place.  Stan Irlam’s truck did fine work carting 1,200 gallons at a time in two tanks.  He is said to have done over 2,000 miles in the weekend.  Another praised worker was Mrs David Radford, formerly Sister Lowe of the Burra Hospital, who dressed many burns and abrasions.  One night the ‘army canteen’ served about 400 with stew, apricots and custard – very welcome after several days of sandwiches.  Marj. Escott worked for three days and nights preparing and serving food, without a break.  Wildlife has suffered greatly and fleeing emus with their feathers alight were seen, as were quail.  Kangaroos died along fences, too exhausted to leap them.
