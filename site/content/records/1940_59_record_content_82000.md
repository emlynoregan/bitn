Burra Swimming Pool

The next job is to clear the site of debris and erect a retaining wall so that filling for lawns and shrubs may be spread and grass planted.  Plans for the erection of dressing sheds, kiosk, wading pool etc. have been drawn up and will be submitted to the Government Tourist Bureau for inspection.  It is hoped to get a further Â£750 subsidy, but this means the committee must raise an equivalent amount.
