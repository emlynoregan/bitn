Goyder Council has released a draft plan for dealing with climate change and natural resource management developed by Natasha Davis from Sustainable Focus.  The plan seeks to achieve the following outcomes:

Improved Council capacity to manage NRM and climate change issues.

Council minimising its use of water and energy.

Council activities protecting and enhancing natural resources.

Sustainable management of water resources and environmental assets.

Communities actively involved in NRM and climatic change mitigations and adaptation.

CEO John Brak said communities that are stronger and better prepared will be better equipped to deal with threats and embrace opportunities presented by a changing climate.  Copies of the plan are available from Council and on its website.  Comment is invited by 11 March.
