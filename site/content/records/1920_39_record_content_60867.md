Trip to Sturt Vale

Last Monday a large party assembled to make the trip to Sturt Vale at the invitation of Messrs I.J. Warnes & Sons to view shearing operations.  On the way we saw few sheep and only a couple of emus, while kangaroos were notable only by their absence.  At Murkaby we were greeted by Mr A.B. Riggs who has been experimenting with placing 10 oz cotton duck rugs on selected ewes to keep the wool cleaner and evaluate the effect on wool growth.  The rugs were put in place in November last.  As expected uncovered ewes had dirt down to their skin, but the wool on covered ewes was very clean and with a longer staple.

At Sturt Vale we were greeted by I.J. Warnes and his sons Rex, Tom and Jim.  We went immediately to the woolshed where the men were hard at work removing the sheep’s winter clothing.  Mr Cope, manager of Goldsbrough Mort & Co.’s Skin Department said he had been coming to spend his holidays here for 15 years.  He reported seeing vast improvements in the time Mr Warnes had owned the property.

There were about 60 men on the place and it looked like a small village.  One shearer was Josiah Rosewall [1868-1955].  He had been at every shearing for 50 years, but was still doing his 100 a day with his ‘boy’ working alongside of him.  J. Mitchell has shorn every year for 33 years and a number of other shearers were originally wool-pickers on the board.  Mr Warnes says he insists on employing local men as far as possible.  He controls about 1,000 square miles of country and shears 32,000 sheep.

Joe Parks provided an excellent lunch at which Mr S.H. Robinson moved a vote of thanks.  Mr Codrington gave an address similar to that we reported last year.  Mr Spencer Williams expressed his thanks for the invitation.  Rex Warnes and his father also spoke.  I.J. Warnes said the trips had grown from an argument he had had some years earlier about the difference in classing wool, which ended in his saying to Mr Tiver, ‘You’d better come out to Sturt Vale and have a look.’

He thought too many farmers did their own classing and that this was a mistake.
