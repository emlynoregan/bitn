Baldina Plains School.  On Thursday last the head teacher Mr Dowd received instructions from the Educational Department requesting him to close the school.  No reason is given for the step taken, and naturally enough the parents are surprised, and anxious to know how their children are to receive a fair education if the school is not reopened.  About 15 children attend this place.  We believe a memorial is already being signed by the parents to be forwarded to the authorities, asking that the matter be reconsidered.
