Burra Town Council, 16 April

Council granted the portion of ground requested as a croquet green at Aberdeen on Cr Riggs’ motion.

The Town Clerk said he did not like the piece of ground asked for and believed that a portion behind the site of the old White Hart Hotel was better.  He believed another site – that of the old German Church was also being considered.

The number of stray dogs in the town was becoming a problem.

The Mayor said he had recently lost three stud sheep to dogs.

A petition from several residents in Redruth about the closing of streets was ruled out of order, as was one on trees to be removed from Victoria Park.

Various road questions took a good deal of discussion.

A light is to be placed at the entrance to the railway yard.

Burra High School Fete was held 19 April in the Institute to raise money for new equipment when the renovations are completed.  It was opened by Mrs Steele, wife of the President of the High School Council, Dr Steele.  Total proceeds were £78-10-8.

Burra Rifle Club.  Best scores in the 18th stage of the Abberton Park Trophy came from J. Terry and A.B. Riggs.
