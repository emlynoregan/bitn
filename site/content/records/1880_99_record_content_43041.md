Benjamin Watts, a sheep farmer of Bundey, has murdered Mr John Lort, a settler of the same location in a brutal attack last Saturday.  Watts threw two bottles at Lort inflicting severe head injuries and then beat him with a broom handle and kicked him to death.  Lort was aged 70.  Watts is well known in Burra as the brother of the late Mark Watts and is aged 49.  The pair had been on amicable terms and the deceased lived on Wattsâ€™ land rent free for ten years.  [Thomas Lort aged 70 died at Bundey 14 November 1891!]
