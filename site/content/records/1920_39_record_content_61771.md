The Sixtieth Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held on Thursday in the Institute and drew a fairly good attendance.  A.B. Riggs was elected chairman.  He said the Mayor had been in office for 5½ years and at the end of his present term on 30 June 1937 his term of 6½ years would be a record.  Mr M. Collins had the previous longest term of six years in succession. [But see also E.W. Crewes below.]  Before being Mayor, Mr Woollacott had been North Ward Councillor for eight years.  Cr Kellaway had been Councillor for more years than Mr Riggs could remember.  Mr Riggs said despite many promises the State Government had not overcome the problem of unemployment, particularly for youths leaving school.  The Federal Government was now interfering in the wheat and wool industries.

For 1935-36 the assessment had been:	£14,435

Rates due 	£1,623-18-9

Rates collected	£1,558-12-8

Arrears at 1 July 1935	£172-13-3
