SA Mining Association held its AGM yesterday at its Adelaide Office.  The Directors report that the Victorian Gold discoveries had induced two thirds of their miners to leave.  Nevertheless 5,709 tons of ore had been raised in the past six months, equal to 11,418 tons in a full year.  The average profit is stated to be £5-2-1 per ton, so that the present and prospective profit for the year is £58,000.  The return of so many of the miners from Victoria and their settling down at Burra is doubly satisfactory and vouches for the goodness of the employment.  The Copper Company has issued assurances that it has a stock of fuel and other appliances sufficient to guarantee continued operations through the winter.

The conveyance to the mine of those ponderous iron castings, which are to compose the Monster Pumping Engine, have been accomplished and the engine will be in operation next August.  This will allow productive operations at the deeper levels.  The Directors expect a large immigration.  We are told that the payment of dividends will shortly be resumed and there is no reason to fear another suspension of them.  The last 18 months operations have swelled the estimated total of undivided profits to £167,612-17-9, of which £89,834-6-3 is available for dividends.
