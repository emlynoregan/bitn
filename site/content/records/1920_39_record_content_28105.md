Weather.  After a trying week ending in a very severe dust storm on Friday, rain began falling on Saturday morning and was light till after 7 p.m. when it rained heavily briefly and again about 10 p.m.  25 points fell in the first downpour and 22 in the second.  This will greatly help crops as it was general and in the east falls were mostly from 40-75 points, though Chalk Cliffs got only 25, Thistlebeds 20 and Sturt Vale 34.  Good rain fell at Terowie and heavy floodwaters passed through W. Roach’s Roachdale Estate.  Boisterous conditions continued on Monday and at Burra a further 1 inch has fallen bringing the total to 1¾ inches.  Phone lines to the east are down.
