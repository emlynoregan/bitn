Burra CWA held its AGM.  Mrs Jennison in her report said the CWA was not just a social club, but an organisation pledged to give service to the country and comfort to the sick and needy.

The Secretary, Mrs Ford, reported on the year’s activities.  Membership was 63 with average attendance at meetings of only 22.  The chief money-raising event was the luncheons and afternoon teas at the Burra Racing Club’s October and March meetings.  Trading tables were also important in going towards helping the CWA stall at the Burra Hospital Fete, which resulted in a profit of c. £150.  The chief ‘Neighbourhood Action’ involved making and care of the hospital linen and other support for that institution.  International day had celebrated New Guinea and our 28th birthday.  Rev. H.K. Bartlett was the guest speaker.  [Other activities are detailed in a 1½ column report.]
