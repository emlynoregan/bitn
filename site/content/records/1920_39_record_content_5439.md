Burra Town Council, 19 September

Application to build the Bowling Clubhouse was granted as was one for additions to Sara & Co. Aberdeen.

About 500 trees had been planted this year, but many had died.

Cr Kellaway said Lane Garden was in a bad state.

F. Highett, lamplighter, had been hurt at football and couldnâ€™t do his job.

Despite having no obligation the Council decided to pay him half his salary while injured.
