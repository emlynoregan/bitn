Apex Club Annual Report by President David Thamm.

The number of members has been fairly stable, with six losses and four new members and three Prospexians waiting for induction.  The first stage of upgrading the Burra North Playground has been completed.  We have run the local pictures and it is pleasing that we are now also being consulted on the choice of films and this has probably reduced some of the behaviour problems encountered in the past.  We sent one boy to a YMCA camp in September.

The incoming President is Dick Cuttle.

Burra Rural Youth has been busy renovating the Burra Show Hall.
