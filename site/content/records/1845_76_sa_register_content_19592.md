Obituary.  Mr Edmund Bowman JP, one of the directors of the Union Bank, drowned last Tuesday night in a creek near his Pt Wakefield Station.  He was seen to fall from a log bridge and it is presumed he struck his head so as to have been unable to save himself from the water, which was only four feet deep.  A woman saw him fall and no assistance reached him in time to save his life.  The deceased was esteemed for his sterling qualities.  He had been extensively engaged in pastoral pursuits and will be remembered in connection with Crystal Brook, Wakefield and Mintaro Runs.  He was a married man and leaves a young family.  The body was recovered about sixty yards from the crossing.  [Born 1818 Askham, Wessex and died 14 August Port Wakefield, residence Crystal Brook.  There were seven children with birth dates between 1855 and 1865.]
