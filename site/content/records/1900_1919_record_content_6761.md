Redruth Court.

A few hours after the McWaters v. Kubale case had been heard about three yards of the court house ceiling fell down.  The building needs urgent repairs.  Large cracks in the wall admit water and make the wall damp for yards.  The windows are unworkable, the furniture needs attention and the general interior condition is disagreeable.
