Burra Community & Christmas Fair was enjoyed by many, with a colourful procession of 14 creative floats as the highlight.  The littlies enjoyed two bouncy castles.  230 bags and ten baby gifts from Father Christmas meant the fair catered for about 240 children.  The event was organised by BRTBA and the main contributors were AGL and the Youth Advisory Council.

Des & Ali Nicholls won the Christmas Light Competition.

Burra Recycling Depot won Best Float.
