Obituary – Fatal Accident.

On Friday last William Hawker aged c. 12 and a boy friend were out at Oakbank and on the return journey with Mr T. Newland they were doing some shooting.  In the process of shooting a parrot William Hawker accidentally discharged his pea rifle and the shot passed through part of the seat of the car, entered Mr Newland’s back and penetrated his heart.  He died within seconds.  Mr Claridge was driving and the deceased died in his arms.  [Matthew Totham Newland born 5 January 1881 Grange: died 28 January 1917 Oakbank Station, residence Bungaree East.]
