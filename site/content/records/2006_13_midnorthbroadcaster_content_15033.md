The Burra Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) held its first official meeting on 18 July at the Council Chambers.  There are 15 young people on the committee along with Rhiannon Phillips as an older youth member and three members from Eudunda YAC.  Officers elected were: Chair, Hannah Farrelly; Secretary, Christie Sims; Treasurer, Cody Pederson-Snewin; Social Media Liaison Officers, Emma Stockman & Cameron Lindner and Burra YAC Co-ordinator, Heidi Thompson.  Goyder YAC will run with two sub-committees; Burra & Eudunda, due to distance and the lack of available transport.  The executive of both groups will meet quarterly.  The group has ordered engineerâ€™s drawings to be completed for the Burra Skate Park.  This will be located where the present half pipe is placed, opposite the caravan park.
