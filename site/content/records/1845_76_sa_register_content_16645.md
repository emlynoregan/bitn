Kooringa News, 28 May

The town celebrated the royal marriage with closed shops and the sacrifice of ‘a respectable amount of gunpowder.’  [The marriage of Prince Edward, (later Edward VII), and Princess Alexandra of Denmark.]

The Bible Christian Sunday School celebrated its anniversary on Sunday and Monday last.  Preachers were Rev. T. Best, lately arrived from England, and Rev. J. Hancock.  On Monday the usual procession through the town was cut short by a heavy downpour of rain, but the scholars appreciated the cakes and tea to follow.  About 300 attended the public tea, followed by the usual public meeting.

Following the dismissal of our telegraph and postmaster the management of the post office is in rather an unsatisfactory state at present, but I understand that Mr Belcher from the Clare office will soon take command here.
