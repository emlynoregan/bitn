Obituary.  Mrs James Boneham, nee Miss Annie Phillips of Burra, died in New Zealand on 1 April.  She was born in Kooringa in 1872, the youngest daughter of Mr & Mrs James Phillips of Kooringa.  Her father was a well-known building contractor.  She was educated at Burra Public School and later joined the Education department and after training returned to Burra as one of the most popular teachers ever on the staff.  She was later transferred to Penola where she met and married Mr James Boneham in 1902.  They went to WA and about 8 years ago to New Zealand.  She has long had heart trouble which finally caused her death.  She is survived by a husband and three sons.  Mary & Nell Phillips of Wodonga, Victoria, are sisters and Mr Joseph Phillips of Rose Park Adelaide [is a brother.]

[Born Annie Alice Phillips 5 July 1872 at Kooringa.]
