He expressed concerns about the increasing cost of the Waterworks in the future.

Cr Sampson also congratulated the Mayor on his report.  He believed all the councillors acted according to their consciences.  He strove to be fair to all.  He had not thought a new assessment to be necessary.  Though the Waterworks was being operated efficiently he feared there would be problems ahead.

Dr Brummitt said he would stand again for Mayor and though he was willing to devote as much time as possible to the job, he would not be able to preside at so many outside meetings.  Until the town debt had been paid off he could not see a way to reduce the rates.  They had to have a Town Clerk and an Inspector.  He thought the Waterworks needed a sinking fund to meet emergencies from time to time.

Cr Sampson said he would stand again.
