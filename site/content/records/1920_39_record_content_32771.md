Burra Full Court, 4 December dealt with 8 debt cases.

H.J. Button v. G. Hann.  This was a claim for £100 allegedly lent without interest in 1925 to the defendant.

Originally the defence was a denial of the debt and if any such did exist it should have been taken into consideration only when partnership accounts were settled, but this was amended to say the plaintiff had promised the defendant £200 if he went into partnership and the £100 claimed was part of that promise.  The defendant counter-claimed £100 allegedly due on the agreement.

Harold Button, Commission Agent, said that in 1925 he was manager of Bennett & Fisher in Kooringa and in September started as a commission agent and was engaged to the defendant’s daughter, a typist in their office.  He then explained lending Hann £100 so that Hann could leave the employ of Bright & Bright and they went into partnership.  Nothing was said of £200, though Hann wanted to borrow another £100 in April 1926.  The partnership was dissolved on 7 January 1929.  He had married Hann’s daughter in July 1926.

George Hann said he was an auctioneer and commission agent and had been eleven years, but for one month, clerk for Bright & Bright solicitors.  He had spoken to Mr Button often about a partnership for some weeks before leaving Bright & Bright.  Hann said Bright & Bright paid him £7 a week and other positions brought it up to £10-10-0.  Hann said Bright & Bright had also promised that his son would get his law articles.  When the question of leaving Bright & Bright arose Hann said Button had offered him £200 and had told him that if the partnership warranted it he could get from it what he had been getting from Bright & Bright.  Button had given him £100 and said the other would come later: he could draw on the partnership account.  Han then gave Bright & Bright notice.  The partnership did not begin until the notice had expired.  Button was not at that time a prospective son-in-law.  The £100 was not a loan.

In 1926-27 actual work done was £800 by Hann and £400 by Button. (Gross).  In the next year it was £1,100 by Hann and £350 by Button.  [He then gave details of income which seem to be confused in the report.]

Hann admitted he had drawn amounts that were not recorded in the cash book – to a total of c. £235 over 18 months.  He did this he said in accordance with Button’s undertaking that he could top up his income to what Bright & Bright had paid him.  He had never claimed the second £100 and did not consider any of the £235 to be part of that £100.

The verdict was for the plaintiff in the amount claimed and the counter-claim was disallowed.
