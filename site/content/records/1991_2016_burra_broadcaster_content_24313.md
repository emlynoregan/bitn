Australia Day in Burra.  This year the venue was the Burra Community Sports Complex.

[The article doesn’t say why this last minute change of venue occurred, but given that c. 25 mm of rain fell in half an hour the previous day, that may have had a bearing on the decision.]

Approximately 250-300 gathered for the breakfast and to honour the award winners.

Burra Senior Citizens received a Burra Community Award.

Bob Greet received a Burra Community Award and a KESAB Award.

Ben Kotz received a Burra Community Award for his war service, and subsequent service to the RSL and the town.

The Community Event of the Year was ‘2000 Boobs Alive’.

Citizen of the Year award went to Bev Kellock who also received the Australia Post Award.

[A long list of her community involvements is printed.]
