Burra Hospital Board met 22 March

This was a special meeting to consider reducing the size of the Board from 12 to 7; eliminating those directly elected by the ratepayers.

Mr Warnes moved the necessary motion.  It was seconded by Mr Riggs.

The Chairman then ruled that if the motion as worded were passed the Board would immediately ceased to exist and no further business could follow.  He suggested an amendment.

Mr Davey said that if there were an amendment the Board could not simply allow it: Mr Warnes would have to give notice again, but the Chairman permitted an amendment by Mr Warnes to avoid the perceived danger.

Mr Davey spoke against eliminating ratepayers’ representatives.  He held that the move was improper, not legal and that ratepayers should be consulted.  He was prepared to resign and go to the ratepayers.  The hospital had never been better managed and was never on a better footing.  None of the Councils had a minute on their books supporting the change.

W.G. Hawkes, the Chairman, was in favour of a reduction, though he could not see any damage had been done by having a Board of 12.  He was not in favour of the methods used by Mr Warnes, saying they were a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise the ratepayers – a point which he elaborated at some length.  He accused Mr Warnes of seeking to attain his ends be ‘deliberate cajolery, coercion and intimidation . . . he made a most unwarranted and unscrupulous visit to my district, and there attempted to cast derision and ridicule on me as chairman of the district and odium on this Board’.

He accused us of dismissing ‘a most competent matron with the result that we had to pay another £60 a year extra; that we paid £20 to repair a septic tank and that the work should have been done for 25/’. 

Mr Riggs derided Mr Davey for quoting the 1922 election figures – since that year the ratepayers have been ‘so little interested that they did not take the trouble to nominate candidates in time to fill the position’.  As for Mr Warnes’ methods, he had not even let Mr Warnes know he was going to second the motion and Mr Warnes had not even asked his opinion.  No ratepayer had suggested that his action in seconding the motion was wrong.
