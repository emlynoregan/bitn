A Meeting of the Unemployed was held in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 19 August to receive the report of the deputation that had waited upon the Government on Monday.  Some 800 to 1,000 were present.

Mr W. Collings was elected to preside.

The Government had assured them it was doing its best to push forward public works.  The Chief Secretary had said that about the end of the week there would be contractors ready to give them work.  The deputation had tried to impress upon the Chief Secretary the necessity of the contractors giving a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.  He had intimated that the men could not live for less than 6/- per day.  The Chief Secretary denied any responsibility for the price of labour ‘the men must make the best bargain they can with them’. 

‘He believed that gentleman [Mr Ayers] had said to them that the Burra Mine would not have been stopped if the men could have worked for 4/- a day; but he did not say also that he had the conscience to offer it, because he knew they could not live upon it.  It was their duty to meet the men half way – do with half their dividends and pay them more for their labour.’

The papers reported that the miners at Moonta had passed a resolution which in effect prevented them from making known their grievances and shut their mouths.  He considered that a disgrace to them.
