The Annual Burra Yacht Club Regatta will be held this year on 13 October.  Again there will be Juniors, Seniors, Ladies and Open Classes.  There will also be a ‘Copperman’ competition.  [Parallel to surfing club’s Ironman competitions!]  The usual bands, stalls and cabaret will be included.  The finish of the 1st Clare to Burra Barrow Push is scheduled for about 1.30 to 2 p.m. – a great preparation for the Broken Hill to Burra Big Push in January 1986.
