Thorogood’s Farmhouse Cider was officially launched on Tuesday 13 July.  Tony & Susan Thorogood have just over 60 varieties of apples among their 700 apple trees.  They will market three or four varieties of cider, including a sparkling cider, a sweet cider and scrumpy.  The full capacity of the plant will be 20,000 litres when the trees mature, though output will begin at 3,000 litres and their aim is to produce 10,000 litres in due course.  A cellar-door tasting and sales area is attached to the cider cellar.  [Photo.]
