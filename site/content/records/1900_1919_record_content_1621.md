Burra Show, Friday 21 September.

This was a cold windy day with rain on Thursday and threatening on Friday, though none fell.  The crowd was smaller than previously, but in general it was a success.  The weather prevented some entries from getting to the ground.  Cattle numbers compared well with last year and the Hon. J. Lewis secured the largest number of prizes.  Sheep were the special attraction and the Champion Merino Ram went to E. Bowman and the Merino prize ewe to Gebhardt Bros.

There were few pigs.  Flowers were better than last year.

The Burra Band played throughout the day.

The evening concert in the Institute was a success.

The gate took £51 which was down £27 on last year.  The concert took £20.

Prize money amounted to £192 and the society will have a good balance for 1901.
