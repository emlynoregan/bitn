Australian Federation

John Bannon, former Premier of SA spoke at Burra Town Hall on Thursday evening 17 May on the subject of Federation.  He is currently working on a PhD on the subject and so had plenty of information to pass on.  Australians are not well informed on the subject.  The decision to federate passed only narrowly and followed great deal of argument and compromise.  In SA between 1891 and 1900 most of the argument was focused on the benefits SA would get through its central location in trade and telecommunications and benefits derived from the lifting of tariffs on wine and on the through traffic to Broken Hill.  There were also concerns over the River Murray.  For Burra it was of interest that Sir Frederick Holder played an important part and became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives.  He had once been a teacher in Burra, then owner of the Burra Record and eventually Treasurer/Premier of SA.  The vote in favour of federation in Burra was 79%.  Mr Bannon presented the Centenary of Federation Medallions to BCS students at a ceremony in Market Square.
