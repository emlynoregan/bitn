Burra Creek Huts.  By Rev. W.F. James.  [c. ¾ column of Burra’s earliest years.]

Rev. James remembers the remains of several creek huts from his time in the town 1884-87.  The first two huts were dug by Messrs John and Robert Collins.  The huts once extended nearly two miles and over 2,000 people lived there.  They were cut into clay banks about 10’ high.  The roofs were pierced and stones or a barrel placed on top to form chimneys.  Rooms varied from 2 or 3 to 5 and 6 and one person wrote to England that he had ‘an eight-roomed house with a river frontage.’  Large gum trees adorned the creek.  Lime was freely used and some were papered and carpeted.  Furnishings started out crudely, but became comfortable and even luxurious.

An account then follows of a witness to the flood of 12 May 1851.

James Blatchford’s experiences follow and Daniel Llewellyn’s.  Blatchford had a hut in the cross creek near the Smelting Works.  The flood of 1859 so damaged any remaining huts that very few lived there afterwards.
