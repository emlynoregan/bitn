Accident.  A utility driven by Ilario Tuccio of Findon rolled over on the Black Springs Road about 16 miles from Burra, between Lawn’s and Gilbert’s last Wednesday.  A Dodge car rolled over at almost the same place two weeks earlier and yet another car a couple of weeks before that.  While there have been no serious injuries, the damages to each car would average about £100.  There have been five or six accidents on this road in a few months.  Before this series of accidents there was one serious one where Mr Grant of Broken Hill received serious head injuries.  This twisting section of road appears to heve been constructed with the wrong camber and also has not been graded well, with looses gravel in the centre of it.  The road is under the control of the Robertstown DC and is graded for it by the Burra Burra DC.
