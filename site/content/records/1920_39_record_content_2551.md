The tender of T.H. Woollacott for a cricket pitch in Victoria Park for £27-15-0 was accepted including 168 ft of timber and £25 without.  Councillors thought the timber not required.

Council inspection has found the block offered for the depot by Mr Warnes was better than the existing depot.  It was more valuable, had better stables and implements could be housed.  The depot street (Thames St) was being improved and the depot marred it.  Cr Lawn reckoned the town would be £50 p.a. better off.  Cr Kellaway thought Warnes’ block too small and asked whether Mr Harris’s block would not be better (the woodyard block in Kingston St).  Cr Radford said not to quibble – one block was on offer, the other was not.

Cr Radford’s motion to accept the Bowling Club’s offer was passed.
