He considers the keeping of an overseer to supervise one man, one horse and a dray is not warranted.  For the next 12 to 18 months all work could be done by contract – probably going to the present employees for the most part.  The Town Clerk who will probably receive over award rates could easily supervise the little work being done.  Cr Bevan says the income of Council has only fallen 5% which is a problem since the ratepayers’ incomes have fallen by anything from 25 to 75% and some have none at all.  Why do local government bodies not acknowledge that the result of the Premiers’ Plan is to reduce all property values by 22½%?  Most of the Council are made up of men who appealed against their land tax for a reduction of probably 50% so they know from their own experience that assessments are too high.  Rates and taxes should be reduced to cut production costs.  Cars are made tough so let the roads remain rough.  Savings could be made by amalgamating Burra Corporation, Burra DC and Hanson DC.  Likewise Booborowie DC, Mt Bryan Dc & Hallett DC could be amalgamated.  The road east from the railway station to Diprose Creek should be a main road: it carries all the produce from the east to the railway.  Instead money is spent on the Adelaide Road which competes with the railway.  Broken Hill lorry owners should not be allowed to pass Burra, but terminate at the railway station.  Rates could rise when primary producers are receiving more.  Remitting fines on overdue rates disadvantages those who pay on time who should receive a discount of 10% to even it up.
