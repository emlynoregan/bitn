Burra Community Sports Club held its AGM.

President Graham Kellock reported on the 1983-84 year:

They had been granted a liquor licence.

The Ladiesâ€™ Auxiliary had proved a great success, catering for dinners, weddings, clearing sales, Council teas, etc.

The catering ventures meant it was necessary to purchase a stove and fryer for $8,000, tables and chairs for $2,800 and crockery and cutlery etc. for $4,800.  The ladies borrowed $7,000 to fund this, which had proved a good investment.

A sub-committee was formed to run the bar.  Profits of $5,000 had been earned from a turnover of $12,000.  $4,500 had been borrowed from the Copper Festival for two years to purchase the necessary equipment.

Visiting caravaners had used the grounds when the caravan park was full.

A rainwater tank and booster pump had been put in to help water supply to the building.

Council helped with earthworks to try to prevent floodwaters from entering the building or crossing the oval.

The contract for the town rubbish collection had been gained for another year.

Income from the cropping project had been c. $3,000.

This year 140 acres of barley has been sown on Koonoona property - thanks to Mr Gary Radford for the use of the land and to those who sowed the crop.

Fencing of Redbanks Reserve is almost completed and stock should be able to be placed there soon.
