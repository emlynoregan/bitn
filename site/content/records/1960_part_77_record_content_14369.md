Characteristics of the paper in 1962.

Generally there was a fair coverage of Burra and District.  The areas beyond Farrell Flat and Booborowie have generally not been noted.  Type-setting seems to have been rather better, with fewer inaccuracies.

Photographs became much more common, bur blocks were not prepared locally and so they are often a week or even more later than the story.

Page 1.

News – Local, but ranging from Riverton to Spalding.

Page 2.

Smaller advertisements especially sales, local government notices and local entertainment and social events.

Page 3.

A mixture of larger advertisements and overflow of page 2 type of material.  Sometimes room for a little news.

Pages 4-6.

Dominated by sports news mixed with a little other stuff.  More than half the page is large advertisements.

Page 7.

‘Cash Column’ advertisements – though this can wander to other pages.  Large advertisements and a little news.

Page 8.

Large advertisements and perhaps two columns of sport news or news of local clubs and associations.  The schools get considerable coverage, including those of Riverton and Spalding.

Sometimes there is an extra page or even two.
