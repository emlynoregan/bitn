Sacred Relics of St Therese of Lisiex will arrive in Australia in February to visit selected locations.  They will pass through Burra on Sunday 17 February between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. at the Burra Catholic Church.  Bishop Hurley has strongly supported the pilgrimage and invites all who have an association with St Thereseâ€™s patronage to take this unique opportunity to honour her memory.  The relics so far have visited Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Vietnam, USA, Mexico, Ireland and Lebanon.
