Unemployment in Burra

The Mayor A.B. Riggs called a public meeting at the Council Chamber on Thursday evening to devise a scheme to aid our unemployed.  It was poorly attended.  About 20 unemployed men were present.  The Mayor said he had been approached by a number of men drawing rations, but who wanted to give a return in work.  The Council had no funds available.  J. Carpenter & Mr Lawn agreed there was no point in forming a committee given the level of interest shown.

Cr Kellaway suggested a joint committee of the unemployed and others to work with the Benevolent Society.

The Mayor said the Benevolent Society had an income from Â£500 capital, which was largely expended in supplying old age pensioners with firewood.  There were c. 20 subscribers.

Mr Lawn moved the formation of a committee of two representatives from each end of town with power to add and with the Mayor as chair.  Carried.

The particular aim was to watch how the money to be collected by a Bill now going through to tax salaries to benefit the unemployed, was dispersed.  It might otherwise all go to the city.

Elected: Crs Kellaway & Woollacott with C.R. Bevan & G. Lewis.  Various means of raising both interest and money were discussed.  The committee met on 18 August and decided on a button day on 5 September and a gala day to be held in September.
