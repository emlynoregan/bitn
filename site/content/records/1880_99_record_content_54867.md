Editorial on the Fiasco of the Special Council Meeting, Tuesday 25 September.

At a previous meeting Cr Harris stated with assurance that he was told the engineer was in a certain blacksmith’s shop drinking for four hours.  This resulted in the motion ‘that the engineer receive one month’s notice’ being passed.  The engineer of course demanded an investigation.  When Harris was called on by the Mayor to introduce the charge he went away from the point and tried to introduce three new charges of being negligent, extravagant and incapable.  The Mayor insisted on his addressing the specific charge whereupon Harris had to admit it was all hearsay.  Even had the Mayor allowed the three new charges to be discussed Harris would have got no further.  He complains that the engineer uses too much grease and candles etc.  What Councillor is qualified to say how much is too much grease?  And candles are used at 1½d per day!  The engineer has to work at night to supply the town with water and can hardly do so in the dark!  The other charges are equally laughable.  After half an hour the Council adjourned.
