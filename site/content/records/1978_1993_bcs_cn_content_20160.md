BCS.  A call for expressions of interest in salvaging the cyclone backstops from the courts behind the Kindergarten.  The job includes replacing them with a post and wire fence on the Agricultural area boundary and using some of the cyclone fencing to provide a cricket bay adjacent to the Smelts Road courts and a cricket pitch.  Also placing a post and rail barrier on the caravan park road boundary.
