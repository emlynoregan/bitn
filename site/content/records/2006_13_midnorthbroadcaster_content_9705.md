Burra Railway Station

Last Thursday the Government announced a $200,000 grant to begin conservation and restoration work at the station.  The announcement was made by the Minister for Conservation and Environment, Jay Weatherill in front of a number of community members including members of the ‘Save Burra Railway Station Action Group’, Regional Council of Goyder CEO, John Brak and the Labor candidate for Stuart, Sean Holden.  If re-elected the government would immediately transfer the funds to the Goyder Council to help the Action Group to conduct the restoration.  Mr Weatherill visited the site last year.  It is intended that the restored building will be redeveloped as a palaeontology and archaeology museum and would showcase remains of mega fauna discovered at the nearby Redbanks Conservation Park.  A research and educational centre there would also promote local Ngadjuri culture.  The Burra Railway Station is a State Heritage place on the SA Heritage Register, situated within the Burra State Heritage Area.  It was built in 1883 to replace an earlier wooden structure.  The railway line dates from 1870.  The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988.

[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect.  Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986.  The last grain trains ran for the 1998-99 harvest in January 1999.  The last passenger train was an ARHS special steam train on 19 September 1992.  The line does not seem to have been officially closed.  ARG ran the last movement on the line when it sent a light engine to Burra 12 March 2004.  The line beyond Burra was taken up 1992-93.  In 2010 the rails were still in place, though not serviceable, as far as Burra Station.]
