BCS.  Members of the SRC have been redesigning the school uniform.  They have suggested a ‘more dressy’ alternative uniform for off-campus activities such as debating competitions and even school trips.  The ideas have been submitted to senior staff.  The traditional brown windcheater with gold school logo has been substituted by a brown jumper with an embossed monogram.  Girls have been given the option of substituting the usual brown trousers with a box pleated skirt with checks in the school colours.  A display of the clothes has been set up in the school foyer to stimulate comment from staff, students and parents.  A decision will be made soon.
