Railways in SA

The Adelaide Times has made some calculations to show that railways in this colony would necessarily be an unremunerative investment.  We insert their calculations as a matter of fairness, as we have been an advocate of railways.

Let us assume the Register’s assertion (though we believe it wrong) that a railway can be constructed for £5,000 per mile and that a single line of track will serve.  On this basis a line to Kooringa will cost £500,000.  Let us grant the impossible, that half the colony’s exports come down the line and that the return traffic is of equal volume.  What would the profit be?  Assuming exports of 25,000 tons.  Half would then be 12,500 tons and with back traffic the line would carry 25,000 tons.  The present rate of cartage is £4 per ton up and £2-10-0 per ton for ore down.  Even allowing for the cartage on wool to be higher, we would still be high in our estimates to take it at £4 per ton both ways.  The gross income would be £100,000.  But good would not travel all the way, much traffic being received at intermediate points.  A fair average would be half or £50,000.  In England the cost of working a line at best is reckoned at 60%, which leaves as profit 40% or £20,000.  This would yield 4% on the outlay and we know that all these figures are ridiculously against ourselves.  We know that a single line could not do this work, that a Burra line would not bring half our exports, that Port Wakefield would be the export port for copper, much of the copper ore and much of the wool, etc.

We respond by saying

At present half the exports do not come down the North Road, but if there were a railway an amount equivalent to half the present exports would come by that route, so that the 25,000 tons p.a. estimated is not extravagant.

The land alongside the railway would be cultivated.  Victoria can consume more than four times the flour we have to spare and also much hay, bran, oats, barley and potatoes.

At the very least assuming land for two miles either side is cultivated 64,000 tons of grain could be generated and if half this figure is carried the whole distance it gives 32,000 tons.

Rest assured the copper would not be transported to Port Wakefield in so primitive a manner as on the backs of mules if a railway could get it to Port Adelaide and wool now sent by dray would certainly come by rail.

The cost of operation a railway in England is not 60%, but rather 48% according to the London Times.
