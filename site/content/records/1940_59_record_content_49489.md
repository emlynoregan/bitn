Burra Rifle Club.  A.G. Heinrich won the Championship, although he did not win any of the four stages.  His consistent good results gave him more points than anyone else.  He also came first in the handicap event, but since he cannot win both, he could not accept that trophy.  Winners of the stages of the Championship were:

Stage 1	M. Stockman

Stage 2	W. Hempel

Stage 3	E.C. Hopkins

Stage 4	W. Edwards
