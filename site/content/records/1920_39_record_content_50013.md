Local Board of Health

Cr Bevan moved that the Medical Officer & Inspector visit Burra State School and inspect the tanks and facilities for drinking water.  He had been told the water in the tanks was undrinkable and that lately the tap water was too hot to drink.  Children had been taking their own supplies in bottles, but the headmaster had put a stop to this.

Cr Kellaway as a member of the School Board took exception to Cr Bevan’s remarks.  The pump in the girls’ yard had recently been mended and the tank cleaned out.  It was not fair to say the headmaster had forbidden children from bringing their own supplies.  He had not heard any complaints.  Motion carried.
