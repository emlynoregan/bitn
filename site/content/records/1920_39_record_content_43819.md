H.J. Button writes objecting to comments in RSL Notes about the decision of G. Dow & W. Dixon Thompson to stand for Council.  He considers the comments that they would give welcome support to Cr Jennison in matters affecting returned soldiers casts unwarranted reflections on present members of Council who he says have always given such matters support and the Council as a whole has ever been sympathetic.  Button says that the comments have created an exceedingly undesirable atmosphere among ratepayers.  If Mr Dow is elected he trusts he will not be absorbed with RSL interests, but will see all sections of the community get consideration.
