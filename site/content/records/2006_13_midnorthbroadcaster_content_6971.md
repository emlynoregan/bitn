Market Square Museum and Lolly Shop has been given a facelift. It is expected to be reopened by the end of the month.  The building is being repainted and sections of the walls are being repaired and re-pointed.  The interior is being rearranged.  There is a great need for volunteers to work in the various National Trust buildings said Branch Chairman Paul Marsson.  The Trust would like to have a register of volunteers with a variety of skills, who could be called on when heritage buildings needed maintenance.
