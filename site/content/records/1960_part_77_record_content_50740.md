Princess Royal

Last Sunday the Princess Royal homestead was open for inspection.  Mr Tom Downer of Woodside took a full load of passengers out on his drag drawn by five black horses.  On the day Mr Downer made c. $140 for the Horse Drawn Vehicles Exhibition at Magill.  Many people picnicked in Burra or at Princess Royal or along the road.  A highly appreciative crowd streamed into the house from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. to appreciate the historic building, exquisite furnishings and carefully tended garden.  For the day over 1,100 people visited the property.  Many of the visitors also toured Burra itself.  Over $900 was raised for the dugouts restoration project.  A contract has been let to a local tradesman for the rebuilding.  The Woods and Forests Department is advising what trees and shrubs grew in the area so they can be replaced.
