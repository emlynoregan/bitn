‘A Wanderer’ also comes in with a sarcastic evaluation of loafers suggesting that a definition of such would send us looking to absentee landowners, modern gentlemen, and various other of like types.

With reference to the recent political meeting:

‘I heard it remarked outside that if His worship the Mayor had not been about the thing would have fallen through, but I scarcely think Burra is as bad as that . . . and if there was only a few practical expounders of politics, there was a good representative number of electors.’

[Also W.H. Hardy]
