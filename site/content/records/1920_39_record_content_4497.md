Local Board of Health

[It would appear that on 21 April the Board resolved it would only be responsible financially to the Burra Hospital for such infectious cases as were recommended for admission by their Health Officer.]

Dr Steele responded in a lengthy letter, essentially arguing that since economy was presumably the motive it would be just as effective to advise the local doctors to treat and isolate infectious cases at home whenever possible and to admit only those demanding expert nursing or where home isolation was not possible.  The absolute insistence on the Health Board decision could lead to dangerous delays in treatment â€“ Laryngeal Diphtheria cases are an example where even a brief delay could be fatal.  He developed his point quite cogently.  Consideration was deferred till the next meeting.
