Obituary.  Mr Tom Scovell of Burra died on Thursday at a private hospital in Glenelg.  He was widely known in the Northern and Mid-Northern parts of SA.  As the owner of the Commercial Hotel in Burra, he proved himself to be both popular and generous.  He was born at Auburn on 1 July 1884 and was educated at Watervale.  Later he was first employed as a grocer’s assistant in various businesses, before entering the employ of the old Saddleworth firm of Bee & Hill, for whom he worked for about 18 years.  He then acquired the Exmouth Hotel at Saddleworth, now known as the Hotel Saddleworth.  He successfully manage that hotel for more than 19 years and in that time took a keen interest in the sporting life of the community.  He was President of the Saddleworth Football Club for a number of years, but his special interest was in coursing, a sport in which he achieved great success, winning many trophies.  He was particularly proud of winning the Burra Coursing Club’s 1927 Cup with ‘Just Bell’.    Another of his dogs was runner-up in the famous Waterloo Cup.  He purchased the Commercial Hotel in Burra seven years ago and accompanied by his sister, came to live in this town.  He took an interest in the sporting life here also, but in recent years failing health left him unable to play an active role.  He never married and is survived by his sisters, including Miss E.A. Scovell of Burra and two brothers.  [Thomas Edward Scovell, born 5 July 1882, District of Upper Wakefield; died 2 August 1945, Glenelg, residence Burra.]
