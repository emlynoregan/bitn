Ruth Norris, local RSPCA volunteer, has nursed back to health a small Gould’s Wattle Bat found in a distressed state on the footpath in the Burra shopping area.  It seems to have been disturbed from its hibernation during renovations to the store next to the Visitor Centre.  These small bats are insectivores who eat up to 500 insects an hour when active.  After a week of care the bat was ready to be released into its natural environment.
