Mid North Football Association

The proposal canvassed at the earlier meeting for a revision of the composition of teams was put and lost 8 to 10.  Two subsequent proposals were also lost and finally a motion was carried that the teams for 1966 be:

‘A’ Grade	‘A2’ Grade	‘B’ Grade	Colts

Robertstown		Robertstown	Robertstown

Manoora

Riverton		Riverton	Riverton

Auburn				Auburn

S/M United		S/M/ United	S/M United

Farrell Flat

Watervale

Aberdeen		Aberdeen	Aberdeen

Mintaro

Sevenhill Football Club was granted permission to go into recess for 12 months.

No Inter-Association games are to be played this year, but the Association will play in the Central Districts Zone Carnival.

The Association’s Accident Fund is to be wound up and the money returned to affiliated clubs, who will in future run their own accident funds.
