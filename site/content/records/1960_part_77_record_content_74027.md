Fire.  A large area of grazing and scrub country was burnt in the Hallett-Whyte-Yarcowie area at the weekend.  Hundreds of men fought the blaze, which at one time threatened the township of Whyte-Yarcowie.  Sight-seers hindered water tankers and other vehicles.   The police stopped as many sight-seers as possible, but others got through.  So far no stock losses have been reported.
