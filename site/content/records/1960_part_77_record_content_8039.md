Burra Racing Club held its AGM and discussed the need for more members when only two members other than the committee attended.  Elected: Patron, Andrew Tennant; President, Mr G. Gask.  [Photo printed.]

Many district residents have been circularised and issued with membership tickets and the committee hopes for greater district support.  The President said he was concerned about the deficit of £205, but hoped with fewer expenses this year the situation would improve. The smaller clubs generally were finding it hard to carry on and Burra is unfortunate in being too far away to draw horses from either the northern areas or from the Upper Murray.  The situation for Burra is not the best.   It is hoped to have the Northern Racing Association’s mobile starting gates at the March meeting.  There are 96 nominations for the September meeting.
