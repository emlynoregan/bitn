On Thursday the children, headed by a band and carrying suitably inscribed banners, marched through the town.  They ended at the chapel for the customary tea and cakes.  The public tea meeting drew a large crowd and interesting addresses were delivered.  During the year the school has increased from 40 to 100 and can be considered to be flourishing.
