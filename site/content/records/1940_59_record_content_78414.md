Accident/Obituary.  A truck rolled over near Hanson about two miles south of the town on the new Adelaide road at about 12.30 p.m. yesterday.  Emil Soder aged about 30, a Dutch migrant with a wife and two children was killed.  The 5-ton truck was driven by Adrianus Maria Huntelmann and was going to Yunta with three tons of cement and steel cement moulding plates.  The left hand bonnet blew up and against advice Soder climbed out to fix it.  While doing so the wind caught the whole bonnet and threw it against the windscreen.  Momentarily blinding the driver.  The truck ran down a six foot embankment, turned over and crushed the victim.  Police attended.  The whole load had to be moved to recover the body.  The truck was not badly damaged and was later driven into Burra North Police Station by Hantelmann.  The driver and another passenger, Jacob Sudmeyer, were not injured.

[Emil Soder died 29 July 1957 near Hanson, residence St Marys West aged 31.]
