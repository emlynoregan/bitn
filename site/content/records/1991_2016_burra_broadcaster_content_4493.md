Burra Art Gallery.  A meeting was held last week to push for the establishment of a gallery in the old Post & Telegraph Office.

Guest speakers were Ken Lloyd, Chairman of the SA Country Arts Trust and Mr David O’Connor, Director of Touring Exhibitions.

The major hurdle is getting enough volunteers to become involved in running the gallery.
