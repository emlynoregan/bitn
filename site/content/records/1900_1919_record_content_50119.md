Visit of the Premier and Senator Senior.

At the Burra Institute last Thursday evening there was a small attendance to hear the speakers explain the object of the National Party.  [Actually it was the Nationalist Party.]  This was the union of the Liberal and Labour Party on the one platform.  The Premier, the Hon. Crawford Vaughan, spoke.  The election had been brought about by the actions of certain senators.  He made scarcely veiled suggestions impugning the loyalty of his opposition.

[This election followed the split in the Labor Party between Billy Hughes and his followers and the anti-conscription part of the party.]

The Premier’s speech is reported in 1⅔ columns and Senator Storey’s comes in the next issue.

[Why is he called Senator Senior in the heading and Senator Storey here?  In the advertising he was Senator Storey, but he is Senator Senior in the report in the next issue.  Was he perhaps the senior senator for SA?]
