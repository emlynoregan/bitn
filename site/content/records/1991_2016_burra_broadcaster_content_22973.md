The NSW 2000 Variety Bash roared into town on Sunday and headed for the town oval where Burra Community School parents had prepared lunch for them.  With 120 cars and their crews expected the workers had prepared for up to 500 meals.  312 ‘bashers were fed and the excitement was increased by the arrival of two helicopters.  The variety Club donated $1,500 towards the cost of an internet server as well as sporting and computer equipment.  The proceeds from the catering are expected to exceed $2,000.  In the early afternoon the Bash moved on towards the finishing line at Tanunda.  The Bash had travelled some 3,500 km in Eight days from Port Macquarie and had raised about $750,000.  ‘Effie’ was present along with two of her four women crew.  The SA Bash sets out on 19 August.
