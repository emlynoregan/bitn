Burra Buffalo Lodge Annual Ball was held at the Burra Town Hall last Friday.  The Mayor, Mr Carpenter, was introduced by Mr Sylvester Preiss, the Sitting Primo, and he declared the evening open.  About Â£50 was taken at the door.

Burra Homing Club held a second open race from Marree on 29 July.  It was won by P.J. Byrne.  The transfer of Fred Brandt to Kapunda removes a good flyer from the club.

Last week a strong head wind prevented the birds from homing in the qualifying time.
