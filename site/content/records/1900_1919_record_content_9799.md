Redruth Reformatory.  Two girls escaped from the reformatory and the police were called in, but no trace was discovered.  Both are red-headed.  One named Dyke has escaped before, but was then recaptured by the fleet-of-foot Cpl Noble.  Her brother escaped from the Adelaide Gaol in February.  Some time ago two brothers and her mother were in gaol.
