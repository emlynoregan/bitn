Burra Hospital Gala Day celebrating 120 years of the Burra Hospital was held last Sunday.  Special visitors were brothers Bob & Peter Brunnitt [sic] descendants of one of Burraâ€™s first doctors.  The event was a great success.  [Dr Robert Brummitt arrived in Burra in 1877.  He stayed for 23 years and was very active in civic affairs, being Mayor December 1883-November 1884 and again December 1894- November 1897, but given that the mine opened in 1845, he can hardly be said to be one of the first doctors in the town.]
