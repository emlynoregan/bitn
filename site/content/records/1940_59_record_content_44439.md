Burra Town Council, 6 February

M. Pritchard gives permission for Council to skim or burn on his property at any time.

Council resolved it was not in favour of changes to the Noxious Weed Board.

K.R. O’Brien resigned from Council employment on buying a milk round and applied for three weeks holiday pay that was due.  The resignation was accepted and the pay approved.

The Inspector of Places of Public Entertainment reports that the Burra Institute did not comply with the Act.  Two flues with dimensions as specified under the Act need to be erected over the projectors and a two gallons fire extinguisher installed in the hall.

Tenders are to be called for the work and a fire extinguisher bought.
