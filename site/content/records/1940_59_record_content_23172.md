Burra Town Council, 17 September

The Burra Electric Supply Co. Secretary said it was hard to give an estimated cost for floodlighting Market Square without knowing how many lights were desired.  He undertook to meet with Councillors and demonstrate with one floodlight.

Mr A.E. Smith MHR wrote to say he was taking up the matter of Sgt E.R. Davey’s release with the Minister of Labour and National Service.

State Bank advised that a payment of £31-12-5 was due on the Institute loan on 30 September.

The [SA] National Gallery forwarded an enlarged photograph of Ex-Mayor, the late Dr Brummitt.
