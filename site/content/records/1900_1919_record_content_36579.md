Burra Town Council, Monday.

Expected to raise

The rates were set at:	General	1/-	£440-0-0

Park Lands	6d	£220-18-0

Health 	6d	£220-18-0

The increase in general rate is to provide for £150 for the Creek and £40 is owing on the depot.

There are complaints from some outskirts of the town that the water supply fails in the evening.  The present reservoir of 30,000 gallons and there is room to enlarge it to 130,000 gallons.  The Hydraulic Engineer is to be written to.  Cr Lane believed there was a sum on the estimates for this already.

Cr Radford said pressure was poor in North Ward all day.

Mr Sedgman had told the Mayor there was an intention to increase the height of the reservoir by 12’.  A letter might hurry things.

Council discussed the eating arrangements at Burra School and a need for a Post Office at Aberdeen.

Cr Walker moved the authorities be written to.  Carried.

Cr Radford and Cr Walker will get a petition signed.

The Mayor said the bridge at the Pig and Whistle needed attention.  The Public Works Committee has it in hand.  The footway on the Kingston St Bridge should be asphalted.

Cr Lane said he understood that some people had moved into Paxton Square without permission.
