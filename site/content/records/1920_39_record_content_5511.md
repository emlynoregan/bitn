Soldiers’ Aid Society, 6th AGM at Jubilee Hall 22 September was well attended with Mr M.A. Radford in the chair.  The question to be answered was should the Society continue.  Mr Radford thought it should, as there were many calls on the Society.  The Secretary, Miss Clara Bartholomaeus read the report.

Meetings fortnightly had attracted 14-20 members.  On 2 December 1920 41 present and past members were present to receive certificates from the Red Cross for three or more years’ service.  There are still a number of cases in the Military Hospitals requiring help.  On 13 August we provided the annual dinner for returned men and on 6 April provided lunch and afternoon tea at the laying of the foundation stone for the Soldiers’ Memorial.  Members have also formed an Auxiliary Committee to aid the Blind Institution.  At the end of June the funds in the bank were £29-16-6 and cash in hand was £3-10-9.  Mr Crewes moved the adoption of the report and hoped the society would keep on.  Rev. G.K. Haslam echoed Mr Crewes’ remarks and said this was one of the few wartime societies to continue its work now.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells was sure they would continue.  Miss Bubb was elected to fill the vacancy in the President’s position caused by the removal from the town of Mrs E. Bertram.  Other officers were re-elected.
