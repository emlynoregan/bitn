‘Eagle Eye’ submits a column on preparations for the Draught Horse Race. F. Spencer, owner and trainer of Silver King, has presented a cup for the last to finish.

‘Great consternation was caused in local racing circles when one of the stewards caught Hunt plaiting a battery at one end of a whip, but the matter was cleared up by the explanation that S. Sara (rider of My Pick) had ordered the invention to use as a tail light when returning from the course late at night.  The explanation was accepted.’

‘Cec. Opie has been leaving Astern out in the frost unrugged with the hopes of the horse contracting rheumatism to run last for the Spencer Cup, but [R.] Hill is confident that his horse [Paydirt] only needs to do its best to run an easy last.’

The suggestion is that the winner will come from Tom Kallio’s stable.
