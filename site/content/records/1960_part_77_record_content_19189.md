Gate takings were £190 and £30 came from a dance organised by Rural Youth in the Show Hall.  The show was opened by Brigadier W.W. Wearne OBE, Commander of Central Command and the Central Command Band also attended.  Membership has increased slightly.  The financial position is sound, but needs watching.  It was decided to increase admission charges by 1/-.  Secretary Mr Perry resigned during the year and we thank Mr & Mrs Barry Taylor for taking over that role.  There were 2,610 entries for the 1963 Show.
