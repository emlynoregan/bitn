St Mary’s Annual Strawberry Fete has been abandoned in favour of ‘The Golden Offering’ on Sunday 12 December.  The average from past fetes has been c. £100 and it expected the Golden Offering will match this.  The first call on the money will be the installation of gas lighting in St Mary’s and in the rectory and then will aid the cost of appointing an assistant curate last year.
