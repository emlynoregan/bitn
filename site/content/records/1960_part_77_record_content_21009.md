Obituary.  The sale by Elders – GM of Part Allotments 45 & 126 Kooringa of 1 rood 27 perches with frontage 89 ft 1 inch to Kangaroo Street and 90 ft 5 inches to Vineyard Street and a depth of 210 ft 11 inches, on which is erected a stone house of four rooms etc. reveals the deaths of Mrs E. and Mr William Michael Miller.

[William Michael Miller was born 8 May 1903 Farrell Flat and died 11 June 1964 Oakvale Station, residence Burra.  He was single, so it is not clear who Mrs E. Miller was.  A Notice to Creditors, 87, 34 (2), 25 Aug. 1964, page 2, reveals that he was a tractor driver.]
