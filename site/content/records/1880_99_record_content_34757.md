The new brick offices are compact and imposing.  The engine-house is below the tower and has a perpendicular engine of 5 h.p.  The boiler is 22’ long and 5’ diameter and uses wood.  Unicorn bottled stout and XXX ales are becoming popular.  The water used is obtained from deep wells on the property and is pure and cool.  Sales are made all over the country between Adelaide and Broken Hill.  There are three brews a week and six hands are employed.  Most beer is forwarded by train though not so long ago much went on drays.  The firm is registered as Messrs Catchlove & Co.  Managing director is E.C. Lockyer JP.  Mr W.J. Jacka, late of Laura, has the general managing and brewing.  The building on the eastern bank of the creek is imposing seen from the main street.
