Burra CWA Restroom at the Burra Town Hall was opened on Friday afternoon.  About 100 ladies were present.  The branch approached the Town Council about 12 months ago to see if it was willing to give them a long lease on the Lodge Room and passage in the Town Hall.  The Council agreed to do so for a small annual rent.  The Council agreed to make certain alterations to the rooms and the ladies agreed to carry out certain painting work etc.  The room now has walls painted cream and the furniture has been similarly treated.  There is a green mottled linoleum on the floor.  There is a small room to be used as an annex and an efficient kitchenette contains a stainless steel sink and plenty of cupboard room.  The branch has invested in a handsome set of crockery.  On Friday visitors came from Robertstown, Mt Bryan, Hanson and Black Springs Branches.  As President of the Burra Branch, Miss Minnie Rogers asked Mrs P.J. Pickering of Henley Beach to declare the rooms open.  Mrs Pickering was the foundation Treasurer of the Burra Branch.  Mrs Pickering said that since leaving Burra many years ago, she had continued to take a keen interest in CWA activities.  She had joined an active branch at Albury on the NSW-Victorian border and had been President of one of the branches in Hobart.

After the opening ceremony the ladies adjourned to the main hall for ‘International Day’.
