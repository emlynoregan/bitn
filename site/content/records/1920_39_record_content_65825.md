Burra Town Council, 15 February

The Mayor said there was more in the swimming pool plans than met the ey and experienced man would be needed.  He was prepared to go on with and supervise the work within one month as previously arranged.

Cr Dow said the promise had been made that the Centenary money would be spent on a pool – so where had it been put?

The Mayor said it was disgraceful, but only three members had attended the meeting to decide what body to give the money to.

Cr Dow asked if that meant that the pool had to be built from materials promised and the money borrowed.  The Mayor said yes.

After some sparring over who was to blame the Mayor said if there was a motion withdrawing the tenders he would supervise the work for Council.

Cr Jennison refused to withdraw the motion.

The Mayor said it was not possible to get a layman to do the work – the labour was only 10% of the cost.

Cr Jennison said it was not possible to get anything definite out of the Mayor.

Council then went on to consider other minor works.

It was resolved to continue tarring the road towards the racecourse.
