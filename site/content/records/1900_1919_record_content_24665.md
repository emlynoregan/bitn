Editorial on Cemetery Finances.

Previously the curator had a commission on blocks sold and grave fees, but no fixed salary.  He got about £1 a week – not enough to keep a man able to do heavy work.  When Mr Thomas gave up the job an alternative was needed.  The first applicants wanted £2-2-0 a week and suggested they work 3 out of six days on Corporation duties, but the dayman can do all that is required.  There are not the finances to pay £2-2-0 a week, besides more land will soon be needed and there will then be the expense of enclosing it.  We suggest appointing the dayman as curator and employing extra labour to dig graves and do other work when required.
