Dedication of the Eichler Headstone at Burra Cemetery

Lutheran Pastor Graham Simmonds will dedicate a headstone at Burra Cemetery this week end to Carl Eichler who arrived in Burra in the mining era and was buried in an unmarked grave in 1889.  The family reunion is expected to attract descendants from across Australia and New Zealand.
