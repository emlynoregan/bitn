Burra School.  Wednesday 23 April, the new Domestic Economy School was opened at Burra High School with Miss Forss in charge and prizes and certificates from the University exams were distributed.  Mt Carthew, headmaster, reported.  1923 opened with 38 students and a staff of 3.  (Miss Mawby, Miss Davis and the Principal)  Miss Mawby subsequently went to Adelaide due to the low student numbers.  Elsie Tiver and Dora Rosewall gained Leaving Certificates and Intermediate Certificates went to Cliff Pearce, 8/6 subjects [sic!]; Mary Morrison, 7/7; & Madge Tiver, 7/7.  [Note that later in the report, when certificates were handed out, it is said they went to Dora Rosewall, Mary Morrison, Rita Tiver & Cliff Pearce.]
