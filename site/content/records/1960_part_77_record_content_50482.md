The Tourist Promotion Committee is active and will approach the Tourist Bureau re publicity for the town.  The question of a large scale street directory to help tourists find sites was raised.  A letter from the Railway Historical Society said they intend to run a vintage train to Burra on 29 August to mark the centenary of the opening of the line.  If the Governor can make the journey the SAR has approved the addition of the Vice-Regal carriage.  Only three steam locomotives are operational and they are maintained by the society for their exclusive use.  Two are Rx class locomotives, which is fortunate as they can be turned on the small turntable at Burra.  SAR has approved a double headed steam train for this occasion.  500 people are expected to travel by this train and about 200 of them could be expected to be interested in a town tour.
