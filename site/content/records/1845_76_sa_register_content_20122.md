Kooringa News, 16 January

The  intense heat of the last  week has led to many having pulmonary complaints, but there have been very few deaths so far.

Bushfires have been rife.  At Booborowie on Sunday during a thunderstorm, lightning started a fire, but fortunately it was extinguished by a deluge soon after.  At Mt Bryan Flat a fire near the hotel seems to have been started by some matches, but no one was around at the time.  Grass adjacent to Captain Killicoat’s sections caught alight on Thursday evening 10 January.  It was soon put out after hard work by neighbours.  An incendiary is suspected, but there is no proof to hand.

A burglary occurred in Mr Parks’ shop on the night of the 14 January.  They appear to have entered using skeleton keys and stole £1 in coppers, two pipes and a piece of bacon.

Mr Leyshon Jones of North Adelaide will build a furnace near the Mine Store to smelt creek ore by his new process.  It will receive a fair trial, though already some say there is no chance of success.
