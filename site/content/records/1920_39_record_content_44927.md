The Battery

Last week we heard the battery was ready for work and were surprised therefore when the Chief Secretary recently said it would be about a month.  Rumour now says about a fortnight to allow for a grand opening and banquet in the Burra Institute â€“ for reasons not apparent to those at the mine, though it is assumed it will aid the aspirations of some politicians.  Some companies have decided not to participate.
