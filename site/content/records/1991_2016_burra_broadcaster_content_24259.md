Mal & Lorraine Leyland of ‘Leyland Brothers’ fame were in Burra last week preparing for an upcoming series on Channel 10 – with their daughter and son-in-law.  They stayed at the Caravan Park, while filming a 20 minute segment for ‘Leylands Australia’.  Mal & Mike’s last film special was in 1990, since when Mal has been involved with a tourist park north of Newcastle.
