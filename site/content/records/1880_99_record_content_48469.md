Burra Hospital Board.

The Chairman reported that the proposed alterations for the porter’s family have not yet been carried out, but the skillion was in course of erection.  A conversation with Mr West showed that the 20’ strip of land given by SAMA subsequent to the original grant was within the walls, but had not been conveyed and should the proposed grant of a further 66’ at the western end for purpose of erecting a new porter’s cottage be granted, the two lots could be conveyed at the same time for the one cost.

In 1892 the average daily number of patients was 32.

At present a small sanitary room is being erected at the eastern end of the main ward for a cost not to exceed £30.  In June 1892 Miss Wincey was appointed Matron in place of Miss Lyford who resigned.
