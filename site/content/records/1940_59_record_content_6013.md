ACS Bob Morton RAAF was tendered a social in Burra Institute on Tuesday evening.  Entertainment was provided by Mr Guy Dollman, Mr P.L. Rosman, Miss M. Fairchild and Mrs Claude White.  Speakers included the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott and Dr Steele.  In the midst of Dr Steele’s speech the Mayor interrupted with the news that ‘The Bismarck has been sunk’.  Spontaneously the crowd stood and sang Rule Britannia.  Ensign Winfield then spoke, though he said he felt more like going into the street and doing something silly.  Mr S. Hawker also spoke.  Mrs A. Coverdale presented the FFCF parcel, Mr Woollacott strapped on the usual wristwatch and Bob Morton responded. The evening ended with a vote of thanks moved by H.E. Fuss and seconded by F.T. Sara and the singing of Auld Lang Syne.
