Municipal Elections: a humorous article using nicknames.

‘Agent’	William West	Mayor

Won the Mayoral stakes in 1896.  A short time after this event he met with a misfortune of some kind, but whether that will interfere with his running this year remains to be seen.  He recovered with the aid of legal advice and has been doing good work ever since.

‘I am sure it will be run in a friendly spirit.’

‘Old Grey’	Henry Pinch	Mayor

Described as ‘aged, but possessed of good metal’ etc.

‘Storekeeper’	William Henry Linkson	North Ward

‘Is a colt full of fire – perhaps too much, but that will be taken out of him at the proper time.’

‘Teetotaller’	Thomas Kitchen	West Ward

‘There is no doubt he will come off victorious this time.’

‘Blacksmith’	presume August Miller	West Ward

‘Stands about 19½ hands high, and possess [sic] good muscular power, but the trainer left him till the last moment and it is hardly likely he will win.’

‘Auctioneer’	John Sampson	East Ward

Is well and favourably known and this ‘promises to be a warm contest’.

‘Auctioneer has won several times and should do so again.’

‘Commission’	William Harrison Hardy	East Ward

Has been training very hard, and is equally confident of success.  ‘since his defeat last year he has not gained many friends, but if the speed is there what does it matter?  I would not be surprised if he pulls off the coveted prize.’

‘Consistent’	Daniel James O’Leary	retiring from West Ward
