The Crown Lands Ranger will cease to have a job after the end of the year as a result of recent action in the Legislature.  This will be good news for the wood carters, many of whom did not bother to get a licence before a local ranger was appointed.  They would risk a fine as so rarely did a ranger visit the area.  The fees and fines pay for the Ranger many times over.  With no local ranger less money will be collected in the dog tax and grazing on Crown Lands will be carried on with impunity.  The police cannot take over this work.  It requires the sort of local knowledge that can only be acquired in 12 months or so and police rarely remain longer in one place.  This action will result in loss of revenue and local graziers will be greatly annoyed through travelling sheep trespassing on their properties.
