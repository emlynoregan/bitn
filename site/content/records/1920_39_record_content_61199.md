Arthur P. Harris, second son of Mr Frank Harris, the popular ‘Pincher’ Harris, has obtained a position elsewhere and has left the town.  He will be a loss to the Burra District Band, where he was one of their best euphonium players.  His loss follows closely on that of the leading cornet player, Mr Andrews.
