Burra’s Future Direction will be discussed at a Public Meeting called for 9 May at 8 p.m. at BCS.

The Australian Heritage Commission has funded a conservation study of the Burra area and will give local residents an opportunity to present their opinions on how the unique character of Burra should be preserved and how the economic future of the town can be assured by further development of local businesses.  A representative from the consultant group conducting the study, Mr Harry Dowling, Tourist Officer from Yorke Peninsula, will address the meeting.
