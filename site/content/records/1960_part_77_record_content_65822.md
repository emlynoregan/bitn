Booborowie Water.  The Department of Mines has been monitoring levels and salinity in 53 bores since May 1971 in the Booborowie Valley. 1972 levels are about one metre lower than 1971 levels, as a consequence of reduced winter rains.  No drastic depletion of the aquifer is evident.  It is expected further boring this year will determine more precisely the hydrological limits, rate of recharge and the capacity of the valley.
