Elizabeth G. Barratt of the Royal Exchange Hotel writes to support the betting shop, not because she has any personal interest in betting, but because men in the country should have the same rights as those in the city, rather than being led into illegal activity by the absence of a legal facility.  She also denies that all the young people who enter hotels do so to consume intoxicating liquors: girls delivering groceries do not and neither do young fellows who find accommodation there.  Her own son was brought up in a hotel and after five years of service in the AIF enjoys his ale in moderation like his mates, his father, and his two grandfathers (both broad minded Methodists) before him.
