Burra Town Council.

All ex-Mayors are to be communicated with in order to ask them to favour the Council with a photo for hanging in the Council Chamber.

The United friendly Societies will be allowed a rebate of Â£3-3-0 for the hire of Victoria Park on Boxing Day if they spend a like sum in improvements to the ground to the satisfaction of the Council.
