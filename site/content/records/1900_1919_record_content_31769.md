Redruth Reformatory.  Naomi Paull escaped from the institution again on Thursday with Teresa Symmons.  They changed their clothes in Firewood Creek and then went to Kooringa and enjoyed themselves.  They posted letters at the Post Office in Aberdeen and stayed the night at Opie’s Hotel.  Then Naomi and her husband (or the man she is supposed to have married on her previous escape) went south.  Symmons was picked up in Burra by M-C Dow.  Naomi Paull is still at large.
