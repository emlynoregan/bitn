‘Let’s Not Forget’

A six year long project by the Burra Community Library to compile an obituary index from the Burra Record has been finished.  It is called Let’s Not Forget and covers obituaries for Burra and District from 1848 to 1976.  Twelve volunteers have helped to compile the index as part of the Burra Jubilee celebrations and the Australian Bicentennial.  President of the Burra Community Library Board, Mr Colin Fidock said that Ian Auhl had motivated him to start the project.  The board was especially grateful to the late Anne Perry and to Shirley Thamm who spent many hours reading 102 years of newspapers.  The book will be of great value for any public library, Australian historian or genealogist.  The index will cost $25 and all profits will be reinvested in local history research at the Community Library.
