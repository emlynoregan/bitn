Stan Batten, Australian Independent Alliance Candidate writes to carefully avoid stating a position on the ‘Naked Review Show’. 

He says he is pleased to see that people are concerned about ‘community values’.  He considers it was not the community, but Parliament reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18 in 1971, extended liquor trading hours in 1967, extended hotel trading to midnight on Friday and Saturday and approved nude bathing at Maslins Beach.  He goes on to list a number of places where we could see representations of the nude body; at the art gallery, as statues in parks, at a beach and he says it is merely a question of where we draw the line.

‘We are part of the community that have elected governments that have changed “community” standards.’
