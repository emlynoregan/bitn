The Group of Concerned Burra & District Residents met with the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing in Adelaide last week.  This meeting was discussing the registration process and support available for overseas trained doctors.  Ways to improve pathways and remove impediments without imperilling standards were discussed.  The Burra group spoke to supplement its written submission and arose from the ongoing situation which prevents Dr Dissanayake from attending emergencies at Burra Hospital.  They explained the progress of the case.  Helen Szuty said that during a recent planned review of Dr Dissanayakeâ€™s credentials and scope of clinical practice at Burra Hospital, she had her attending rights to accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital reinstated after 16 months.  Due to the recent arrival of Dr Evinta Royce, Dr Dharma Dissanayake, Dr Lakman Fernando and Dr Royce expect to commence emergency services at Burra Hospital from the first week in October 2011.  The Group understands that Drs Dissanayake and Fernando intend to proceed with an Application for Judicial Review in the Supreme Court, over what has happened.  The group considered that the policies on credentialing etc. require legislative action.  They thanked the Clare Doctors for treating accidents and emergencies over the last 16 months.  The standing Committee on Health and Ageing recommended the group meet with the Federal Member for grey to find out more about federal grants for regional hospitals and health services and the group intends to follow this up.
