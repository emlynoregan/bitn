Mr Foster’s speech was strong on patriotism and on the evils of the anarchic socialism of the IWW, which had captured the Labor Party.  He also attacked the Senate as undermining the war effort and preventing Australia from sending delegates to the Imperial Conference.  Australia is not doing enough for the war effort.
