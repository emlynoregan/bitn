The Adelaide Road.  A dangerous section of the road to Black Springs lies between Messrs Gilbert’s and Lawn’s.  It is a notorious accident site under the control of the Saddleworth Council.  The road needs to be re-engineered and properly graded to reduce the risk of skidding.  City drivers, unused to loose surfaces on curves are especially at risk.
