Hampton Village has now become part of the Burra Heritage Trail and Passport System.  The Council obtained a substantial grant to enable a gate, interpretive signs and consolidation of walls. Etc.  Weed eradication is the final job.  A community working bee has been called to this end on Saturday 6 August from 1 p.m. with a barbecue for workers at 4 p.m.
