Burra, Farrell Flat & Eudunda were the round one recipients of new town signage this week.  Signs for Terowie, Whyte Yarcowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett have been ordered, with Robertstown, Sutherlands and Bower to come.  The signs celebrate the work of Surveyor General George M. Goyder and include a theodolite and a line symbolising Goyder’s Line.  [The article concludes with an outline of the origin and history of Goyder’s Line.]
