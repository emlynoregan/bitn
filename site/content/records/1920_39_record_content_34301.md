Cr Woollacott said he believed Mr Radford held the position as a Councillor and that therefore he had succeeded to that position and similarly E.W. Crewes had been succeeded by the Mayor and the Town Clerk continued in that capacity.

The Mayor held that the trustees had been permanently appointed.

Cr Pearce moved an amendment that the letter lie on the table for a fortnight.  Carried.
