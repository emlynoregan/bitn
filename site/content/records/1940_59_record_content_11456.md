Burra Town Council, 21 September

Cr Kellaway apologised for his absence in a letter and stated that he and Cr Marston had discussed the matter with the Burra Institute Committee and recommended the Council purchase the Institute under the scheme to be outlined by Cr Marston.

Mr A.B. Riggs wrote saying negotiations for the sale of the Institute would be started as soon as the Council obtained permission to buy it.

Council is to take full responsibility for the amount owing on the building on the day it takes over and to pay all transfer fees.

L.P. Davis wrote advising that in the school scrap drive Norman Wilson had collected 43 lb of rubber and John Carpenter 29 lb and they were entitled to the first and second prizes respectively.

Council agreed to pay prizes of 10/- and 5/- respectively.

Cr Samuel, who has joined the RAAF, attended the meeting and tendered his resignation as Councillor for West Ward.  It was accepted with regret and a minute of appreciation was recorded.  An election will be held to fill the vacancy so created.

Cr Marston reported on the discussions with the Institute Committee.  The Committee would recommend the sale if the purchase price was the amount of the bank overdraft on the day of taking over, with Council to pay the transfer costs.  There would be quite a lot of red tape to negotiate and Council would have little to do with the Library management, where subscribers would have the balance of power on the Library Committee.

The statement of receipts and expenditures showed the present committee was holding its own:

Rents for the Hall	£327-0-1

Expenses	£160

On the scheme of repayments agreed with the State Bank for interest and capital they needed to repay £204 p.a.  This meant the Council would only have to find about £37 p.a. to repay the £204.

The Committee was allowing a discount of 33⅓% for patriotic functions at the hall.  If Council discontinued that they could increase the income by £50 and so end up with a small profit.

The Mayor disagreed with the scheme entirely and said he was not prepared to allow the ratepayers to become milking cows.  The war position was too serious to allow the Council to enter any such arrangement at present and he did not see why the State Bank could not reduce the debt and did not think the building worth the amount of debt.  If the Council hung out the Bank would eventually be forced to reduce the debt.  Besides which there might be inflation.

Cr Martin pointed out there could be cheaper money for the scheme from the State Bank, but the Mayor said his own recent experience did not suggest that.

Cr Marston wondered why the Mayor was so opposed now when last year he was so anxious to take over the building on behalf of the Council.

After further discussion it was resolved that the Town Clerk ascertain if permission would be granted to the Council to borrow the money.
