Hanson-Booborowie Railway.  The local MPs Messrs Jenkins, Hawke & Dickson waited on the Minister of Railways, the Hon. W. Hague on 16 June urging the construction of a railway from Hanson rather than a spur from the Clare line.  The work was recommended in 1915 and again in 1918, since when the area has progressed and would do so to an even greater extnt with a railway.  The Minister said costs had prevented work in 1915 and 1918, since when material costs had fallen, but labour costs had not.  He would get new estimates and then review the matter and submit it to cabinet.
