Goyder Heritage Plaques

A small group gathered at the offices of the Regional Council of Goyder in Burra last Thursday morning for the unveiling of the Goyder Heritage Plaques.  History groups from across the Council area were represented.  Greg Drew, geologist and member of the SA Mining History Association unveiled the plaque on the Goyder Council Chamber:  the first of 25 plaques, which are to be placed at sites of historic and heritage significance across the Council area.  The move coincides with the 175th Anniversary of the foundation of SA.  The oval plaques are in green vitreous enamel with clear lettering.  The information has been researched by the [Goyder] Heritage Advisory Committee and the Burra History Group.  The Goyder Tourism Working Party has committed to ten plaques annually across the Council area.

The first sites selected are:

At Burra:

Former Elder, Smith & Co. Offices (Burra Visitor Information Centre)

Burra War Memorial

Former SA Farmers’ Union Store (Goyder Council Chambers)

Kingston Street Bridge

Bridge Street Bridge
