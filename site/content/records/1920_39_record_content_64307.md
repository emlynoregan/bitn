Booborowie Memorial Hall

A meeting of about 50 residents, called by the Hall Committee, considered the financial position of the building and whether it was advisable to close it due to lack of finance and public interest.  Mr Woodgate was chairman.  There were only 14 full-time subscribers.  The hall was built in 1922 for £2,500 (excluding free labour).  Liabilities at present are about £580 and for the year ending 30 June 1936 expenditure of £137 exceeded revenue by £20.  Suggestions included increasing the hire charges, extending the period of the loan, dispensing with the services of a paid caretaker and holding a continental.  The Hall Committee was criticised for not holding a Centenary Sports event and a centenary Ball, but Mr Nettle, the Vice-President, said an organisation of 14 members could not be expected to hold successful functions.  As a result of the meeting 33 new members were obtained.  The district will be canvassed for separate positions of Caretaker and Secretary and a voluntary committee was formed to arrange a function to raise funds.
