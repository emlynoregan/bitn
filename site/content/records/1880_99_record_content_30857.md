The dayman was reappointed at 6/6 a day.

The curator of the cemetery was reappointed at the old salary.

The scavenger also received the same terms as before.

There was discussion on the action of the Town Clerk re the reduced assessments, but after some heated exchanges the matter was allowed to drop pending a new mayoral appointment.
