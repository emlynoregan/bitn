Burra Community & Sports Club Ladies’ Auxiliary

Report for the last year:

The initial cost of crockery, cutlery, tables and table cloths was $3,800, for which the Football Club advanced a sum of $3,000.

In March we obtained an overdraft loan from the State Bank to purchase a double oven range, a double deep fryer and 50 chairs.

In all we have spent $15,000 on equipping the complex this year and have given the main committee $4,000 to meet their commitments.

Catering profits have enabled all this expenditure, with five weddings and six dinners with from 50 to 180 guests.  Also six Saturday night teas serving 140 to 220 meals and catering as well for sales, conferences, Council teas and receptions.

1983-84 office bearers: President, Mrs Marg. Lloyd; Vice-President, Mrs Chris Oswald; Secretary, Mrs Barb Secomb, Treasurer, Mrs Elaine Eberhard and Head Caterer, Mrs Bev. Kellock.
