Editorial on The Old Year

In 1880 we endured the worst ministry the colony has had.

1880 began with an average harvest and ended with a below average one.

Mineral interests are at a low edge.

Wool interests have been prosperous, but cattle prices are low.

Locally the Corporation has been quiet and permanent improvements have moved along.

A large traffic bridge has been constructed in Thames St.

A strong, neatly designed footbridge has been built near the Courthouse.

There is a better entrance to the town from the north with the formation of footpaths in Aberdeen.

Important watertabling and footpath work has been undertaken in Commercial St.

A number of roads have been remetalled.

In the private sphere: -

S. Drew & Co. have two splendid new shops for themselves and four smaller ones for other tenants - erected by John Pearce of Aberdeen.

John Pearce has also erected a new house for J. Lewis JP.

Mr Ridgway has built a new hotel in Aberdeen to replace the Aberdeen Hotel, which was destroyed by fire.

The ruins of the old Aberdeen Hotel have been converted to a good row of neat cottages.

Sara & Dunstan have had many contracts, including the Gladstone Gaol and various railway stations, but have not been doing much in Burra except the additions and alterations to the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church.

Terowie Sports & Concert were successful.

Burra Mine. The search for the lode near St Mary’s has been abandoned for the present.

Catholic Concert.  The concert in aid of the new convent at Kooringa was not well attended due to the holidays, but the performances were very good.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday school Anniversary on 19 & 25 December.  Rev. J. Moody preached and the church was uncomfortably crowded in the heat.  There was a blessedly short sermon of 20 minutes.  Proceeds were a satisfactory £21.

Kooringa Wesleyan Special Services were well attended.  Mr Chester preached.
