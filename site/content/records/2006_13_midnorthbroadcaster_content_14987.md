Burra’s Queens of the Mountain Donna Kelly and Rosemary Seaford climbed Mt Bryan for the 100th time on a recent cold, wet and blustery afternoon.  They were joined by family and fellow trekkers.  The treks have provided training for trips up Mt Kilimanjaro in 2008 and Mt Everest Base Camp in 2010.  After the climb the group enjoyed a great meal at the Mt Bryan Hotel.
