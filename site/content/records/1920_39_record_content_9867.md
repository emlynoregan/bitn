West Australian Boys’ Visit.  The 40 boys performed at the Institute on 2 January.  They arrived by train in the afternoon and paraded to Kooringa where they received a civic reception.  They represented the Young Australia League of WA.  They were raising money to build a Memorial Hall to former members who died in the Great War.  It was estimated the Hall would cost £25,000.  £10,000 had been raised in WA and they were pledged to raise £1,000 p.a. by travelling.  The League had been founded by J.J. Symons, a native of Clare SA.  They played to a good audience.
