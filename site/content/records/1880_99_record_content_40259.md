Wood Carters met in large numbers at the Commercial Hotel on Saturday evening to consider forming a union.

Mr T. Woollacott pointed out the disadvantage of the extreme competition as to the price of carting wood into the town.

J.A.S. Williams supported all that had been said by Mr Woollacott.

W.H. Hardy, who was present by invitation was sorry to see the cut-throat nature of the present competition and was in favour of a move to see the worker get fair returns for his toil. The present prices were continually juggled to the disadvantage of both supplier and consumer.  They would need the co-operation of local retailers to do away with itinerancy.

T. Davis, carter and retailer was pleased to see the matter taken up - they would have to consider farmers who occasionally brought in odd loads to dispose of for a song.

W. Linkson was also supportive.

Several others spoke in sympathy with the movement.

W.H. Linkson was appointed secretary pro tem.
