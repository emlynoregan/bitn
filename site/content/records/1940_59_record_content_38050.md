Burra Show Society: Prize List for the 1948 Show is printed.

Show Society President’s Report for 1947

Early in the year Mr K.R. Crewes tendered his resignation as Secretary and the vacancy was filled by Mr H.M. Scott.

Extensive repairs carried out in 1946 meant that little maintenance work was required in 1947.  Facilities were however, provided for indoor trade exhibits and ringside seating was improved.

Arrangements were made for finance from the Bank of Australasia.

The sale of a portion of the iron fencing raised £104.

Most sections of the 1947 show were well supported and exhibits were of a high standard.  Good weather on the day resulted in a good attendance and the profit on the day amounted to £158, which was exactly the same as for 1946.

A committee has been investigating the desirability of transferring the show to the Burra Sports Syndicate’s Grounds and has met the Secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society and representatives of the SA Jockey Club to obtain their views on this matter.  Their reports on this matter will be received by the sub-committee and dealt with in due course.

A.B. Riggs.
