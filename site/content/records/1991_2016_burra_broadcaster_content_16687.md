Burra National Trust took part earlier this year in trials leading to the development of a business improvement model for cultural heritage organisations.  The workshop focused on self-assessment of the business.  Now Burra has been chosen to be a national pilot for the project.  Commonwealth funding from the Department of arts funded the project.
