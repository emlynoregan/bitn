Annual Seaside Trip to Semaphore

Over 800 made the trip this year: about two-thirds from Burra.  The train was drawn by a powerful mountain type locomotive.  The train was on time at Burra where three carriages were added.  A smaller engine took the train from Dry Creek across to Semaphore.  The weather was ideal and at Semaphore many headed for the beach and lawns.  Scores caught buses or trains to the city and others went to Glenelg to enjoy Luna Park.  There was the usual Burra Reunion at the Botanical Gardens and other family reunions took place at Semaphore.  A special picnic train to Gawler left Semaphore at 7.05 and officials had to get scores of Burra passengers off it.  They had mistaken it for their train, which arrived at 7.55.  The train was so long that at least four coaches were beyond the end of the lengthy Semaphore platform and ladders had to be employed to board passengers.  Burra was reached at 12.15 a.m.
