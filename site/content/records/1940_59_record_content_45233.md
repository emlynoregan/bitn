Burra School.  The yard remains dangerous, despite pretty plans to improve it and even despite a tender for work having been let.  Is the Government guilty of neglect and so responsible for the costs of medical attention as a consequence of such neglect?  [The article concludes with a tally sheet of 15 accidents so far in 1950.  Most of them were skinned knees or abrasions to other parts of the body, but included Richard Tiver’s broken arm, Russell Harris’s dislocated shoulder and Allen Day’s slight concussion.]
