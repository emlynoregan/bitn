Characteristics of the 1931 paper.

Page 1

Moderately large local advertisements are mixed with news items in about equal proportions.

Page 2

There are large advertisements for Drew & Crewes' and Bence's with smaller advertisements for sales, public notices and local government as well as classified items.  News begins towards the end of the page, but sometimes not till page 3.

Page 3

Dominated by news, but with a couple of columns of large advertisements.

Page 4

News dominates, but there is also a mixture of large and small advertisements.  A cartoon from the Bulletin is sometimes here and occasionally on page 3.  Articles here are often reprints from other papers rather than local news.

The paper provided quite a good coverage of local news with details of sport and Council activities being well represented.  Mongolata Goldfield activities were well reported.  Not surprisingly the depression was covered at length with a lot of space devoted to a range of views on causes and cures as well as on the acute political crisis that dominated Federal politics in the year.  Much of this material was reprinted from other sources.  Considerable coverage was also given to the emergence of the new political parties and forces opposed to the Scullin-Theodore Federal Government.  The paperâ€™s editorial stance was clearly aligned with the Emergency Committee and the emerging force of the United Australia Party under J.A. Lyons.
