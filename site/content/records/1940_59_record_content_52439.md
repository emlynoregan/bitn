The Burra Show Finance Committee was shocked on Friday when it learned of the cost of the new sheep pavilion.  The anticipated cost was £630 plus the cost of an extra 200 ft of gating at about £70, for a total of about £700.  To pay for this £850 was collected, but the bills now to hand total £934.
