Ross Hayes, who was wounded twice and contracted typhoid, writes from Epsom Hospital in England on 24 August.  His brother has also gone to the front and his father is about to leave.  He writes of terrible episodes in Gallipoli â€“ of one attack where the roll call found only 232 of the 850 who had advanced.  After he was wounded he was sent to England and describes the journey on the Aquitania.  He reports very favourably on his medical treatment and conditions.
