Obituary.  Samuel Burns JP died 3 June aged 58.  Until 5½ years ago he was noted for his strength.  He then suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered.  He had another 5 weeks ago and a final one on Thursday night from which he did not regain consciousness.  For 30 years he had been a local preacher.  He was strictly honest in his business and very kind-hearted.  He was born in Burra on 23 June 1858 and established a blacksmiths and wheelwright’s business about 30 years ago.  He was a member of the Town Council for some years and Mayor for one.  During his second year had to resign on account of ill health.  [He was West Ward Councillor Dec. 1905-Nov. 1909 and Mayor Dec. 1909-Nov.1910.  Through ill health he did not contest the mayoralty for 1911.]

He was chairman of the trustees of the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF and a trustee of the Rechabite Lodge.  He was a prominent Freemason and Superintendent of the Methodist Sunday School.  He leaves a widow, six sons and three daughters: Norman, Gladstone & Charles in Kooringa, and Garfield in Egypt with the Light Horse.  Robert enlisted in Fiji and is with the King’s Royal Rifles in France.  Jack is in Melbourne.  The daughters are Mrs Alan Murrie of Pt Pirie and Misses Lydia & Melva of Kooringa.  There are three grandchildren.  Rev. J.A. Burns of Mildura is his brother.

[Death registered as 4 June 1916 aged 57.]
