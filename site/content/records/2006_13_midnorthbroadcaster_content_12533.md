Census Film shot in Burra

A film production company, Roboti Australia from Sydney filmed sequences for a Leo Burnett commissioned television advertisement for the Census 2011 campaign.  The crew set up in front of the Post Office to catch a time-lapse image of Commercial Street.  The crew of about 10 stayed at Paxton Square cottages and ate at the Kooringa Hotel.  One of the crew had a birthday and it was arranged that the Sing Australia Choir in Burra sing Happy Birthday for them.
