The Burra Show on 7 & 8 October was a great success in glorious weather.  Two changes were successful.  The show was almost a month earlier and moved to the end of the week.  Friday attendance was greatly up on last year’s first day.  Saturday was very busy from before 9 a.m.  This year the hillside has been terraced to allow cars to be parked behind one another without obstructing the view.

Sideshows were more numerous that ever.

The special trains from Adelaide and Terowie were well patronised and it is estimated that nearly 1,000 cars were parked.

Catering was in the hands of Mrs J.B. Rowe of Kooringa with an army of assistants.

The Point Pass Band under Mr J. Goedecke provided excellent music.

Agricultural produce made an excellent display.

Dairy produce was the largest for many years.

Poultry was creditable, but entries were down.

Draught horse entries were fewer, but quality was high.

Horses-in-Action drew entries that were well up to standard and good competition was seen.

Cattle numbers were very small.

Dogs were exceptionally good this year with 30 greyhounds and good competition in other classes.

The sheep show is fully realising its potential now with good entries in sections aimed at all sizes of producers.  (< 250, 250-500, not >1,000 and not >2,000)

The Fleece Wool section was bigger than ever and entries have grown from 2 or 3 to 30.

There was a wide variety of agricultural implements on display.

General Motors brought along a whole convoy of their cars and trucks.

W.R. Lee showed the latest in Ford vehicles.

W.E.D. Young showed six of the latest in Chrysler models.

Horton Jennison displayed several wireless models.

Vegetables were excellent, but dominated by Bert Opperman and Mr W. Moxham and in Fruit Mr R. Hunter of Clare won all except for lemons when the prize went to A.J. McBride.

Flowers were hit by this year’s heavy frosts, but a good display was still evident.

Cooking entries were numerous and arts & Industries were commendable too.

Photography and Art was a small section.
