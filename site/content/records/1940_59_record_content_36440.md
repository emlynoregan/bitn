Burra Racing Club held its first meeting for 1948 on Thursday.  With two exceptions the fields were not good, but this was probably due to cancellation of the special train from Adelaide, due to coal shortages.  Twenty-four horses had been booked to travel by the train and cancellation was at short notice, making it difficult to arrange transportation by horse float.  The weather was bad in the morning, with a strong north wind and raised dust.  Conditions improved towards midday.  A number of improvements had been made at the course and jockeys appreciated their new room by the Saddling Paddock and CWA ladies, who provided the luncheon were pleased with having practically all of the pavilion under the grandstand set aside for their use.

The track was in excellent condition.  History was made when the Club announced there were no starters for the first race.    There were only four runners for the Burra Handicap.  Attendance was quite good and it was pleasing to see the support of many local people, which had not been the case in other recent meetings.  Seventeen bookmakers attended, but betting was not as heavy as in recent meetings.  [Details of the six races run were printed on page 8.]
