Rev. R.M. Hunter & T. Kitchen were farewelled by a large gathering at the Wesleyan Church on Tuesday 11 April.  Tea in the schoolroom was followed by a meeting in the church.  Dr Brummitt presided.  Mr Hunter was thanked especially for his care of the country places like World’s End and for his work with the Sunday school.

Mr Kitchen had put in a wonderful effort over 16 years in most aspects of the church’s life as teacher, Superintendent of the Sunday School, local preacher, and in many other positions.
