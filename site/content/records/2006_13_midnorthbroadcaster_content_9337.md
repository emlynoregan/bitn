Adchem has announced a project to reduce its environmental footprint in 2010.  The company has received a $550,000 Federal Government Grant and will put this towards a $2.45 million project to install a two stage reverse osmosis waste-water treatment plant.  This will allow reduction of CO2 emissions by 10% from the recycling of waste process water with a 55% reduction in the use of mains water and improvements in the efficiency of steam generation.  The higher quality water will allow improved efficiency in boiler operation and steam production.  In 2008 a trial of a reverse osmosis plant was run for about $100,000 and the process was proved feasible.  Once fully operational the plant will generate up to 500,000 litres of high quality water per day for use in boilers, cooling towers and general process needs.   The amount of mine pool water used will also be reduced by about 70%.  The project will see the construction of two 160 x 120 m lined evaporation ponds with a total area of 3.84 ha.

The Adchem plant was originally built in 1969 and was then designed to process copper ore from the Burra Mine.  Since 1993 the business has been owned by Ausminco Pty Ltd.  It currently employs 49 people and operates a hydro-metallurgical process to convert copper raw materials to high purity chemical products.  Today it operates the worldâ€™s largest single production facility for cupric oxide and basic cupric carbonate; producing annually 6,000 to 9,000 tonnes of cupric oxide and 1,000 to 3,000 tonnes of basic copper carbonate.  The project is not expected to see a change in employment or production levels.
