Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute last Wednesday.  Attendance was small with about 20 at the start and a few more as time went by.  Mr Crewes took the chair.

The Mayor’s Report for 1906

The Council did good work with the funds available.  During the year it adopted model by-laws prepared by the Municipal Association.

One Councillor Mr Launder died during the year.  He served a little over two years as Councillor for East Ward and his loss was greatly regretted.  He was replaced by Cr Bennetts.

At this time last year the general account was in credit £47-19-2 and tonight it is in credit £42-18-8, but this will largely be gone after the next pay sheet.

North Ward is in credit £3-0-4, East Ward is in debit £5-12-1 and West Ward is in debit £3-17-7.

This year we have paid £31-10-0 for anew assessment and as a result there is a reduction in the aggregate of c. £594, which will on the present rate mean less income in 1907.

Lighting cost £44-15-10.  We purchased two acetylene gas lamps for £12 leaving £32-15-0 for running costs.  The new lamps have been economic and give a good light.  Lack of funds prevents the extension of gas lighting for the time being.

Park Lands.  Regrettably vandalism to young trees continues.  The account is in credit £7-11-0.

The main road grant was £273 and this has been expended.

The Cemetery has received much attention and has been improved.  The account is in credit £57-5-8.

The Local Board of Health has had no significant outbreaks of infectious disease to deal with this year with only a few cases of scarlatina reported.  The sanitary condition of the town has been maintained.  The account is in credit £79-0-8.

The Council has worked very harmoniously this year and thanks are extended to Councillors, the Town Clerk and other Council workers.

C.A. Fuss moved the adoption of the report.

Cr W.C.L. West said he had decided to retire as a Councillor after 14 years on the Corporation.

The retiring Mayor Mr J. Drew said the town could do with 10 or 12 more acetylene lamps.  He was disappointed with the destruction of young trees by lads.  Tar paving of paths was cheaper than gravelling and almost as good as asphalt.  He could not see his way clear to nominating for Mayor again.

Mr Davis tried to move a vote of thanks to Cr Roach, but when he turned it into an attack on Council for black-balling him over the scavenging tender he was ruled out of order.

R. Ockenden then moved a vote of thanks to the retiring Mayor and Councillors and was seconded by C.A. Fuss.

Mr Davis then got in his complaint about not getting the scavenging contract when it was awarded to the highest tender.  He thanked Cr Roach for trying to be fair, even though he was overruled.

Cr Roach said he didn’t appreciate Mr Davis’s remarks at all and in retrospect thought he deserved censure for revealing what had gone on in the Council Chamber and now endorsed the actions of his colleagues who had done the proper thing in accepting the highest tender.

Candidates were then invited to speak.

Cr West said his experience in Council over 14 years made him well qualified to become Mayor.  He favoured the planting of trees and tar dressing and was against any increase in rates.

J. Walker thought he was well known and if elected would do his best for town and ward.

R. Ockenden said it was only that day that he had decided to stand, but he would strive to do justice to all and side with no party.
