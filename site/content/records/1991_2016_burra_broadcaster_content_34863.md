Letter.  [Because Leo Sturman’s letter provoked such a response, it is printed below in full.]

Dear Madam,

As a member of the organizing committee for the Wheal Burra Burra Festival, taking place in November, it is sad to have to admit that despite our approaches to the local churches for their support, by becoming involved in some way in the festival, not one answered our letter, or contacted us in any way, with any positive response.

We can only assume that the church organizations are so far removed from the community, that they feel they have no part in it anymore, or that they have become so close to their god (s) as to not need to bother.

We are saddened by this total lack of interest, and can only reflect that with churches closing down, and being sold off all over the state, and indeed, the country, that Christianity is indeed dying, and that it will not be long before a more active religious force takes over. The future of Christianity begins here, in our local churches, and in every community that calls itself Christian, and that to be active within that community, is the only way to full resurrection.

Yours sincerely,

Leo Sturman.

P.S. Information has been received by the Broadcaster that the Uniting Church does plan to have its church open from 10 a.m. until 4.00 p.m. on 13th November. Ed.
