Burra Hospital Christmas Festival was held on 18 December 1934 and the promoters were lucky to have a good night for it considering the weather about that time.  Mr G.E. Dane arranged the concert program.  Mr G.H. Dow attended to the out-door seating arrangements and with Allan Dane also attended to the powerful lighting.  The verandahs were decorated with lights and the Institute Orchestral & Choral Classes provided a good program.  The Burra District Band under J.H. Murison chose a position on the eastern drive and was heard to good advantage by both patients and audience.  The Chairman of the Board Mr I.J. Warnes presided and attendance was splendid.  In introducing the evening Mr Warnes took the opportunity to thank the CWA Younger Set & the Red Cross Circle for donations that enabled the hospital to buy a wireless set.  The much-appreciated program is listed in c. Â¼ column.
