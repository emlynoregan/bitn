The Mayor’s Report for 1916.

Last season the harvest was very good.  The Government commandeered the whole crop and at present farmers received 2/11¾ per bushel, but perhaps more may come due to the high prices prevailing in home markets.  A good harvest this year also seems assured.  The pastoral industry has also been prosperous with feed abundant and wool prices good.

The war continues, but the tide seems to have turned.  The effort to support the war has continued very successfully here.
