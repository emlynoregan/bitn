Burra Town Council, 4 November

Mr N. Villis of the Burra Rifle Club sought permission to cross the road from the range to Mr Gare’s paddock for long range shooting and the telephone.  Granted on conditions all precautions were taken for the safety of the travelling public.

Cr Jennison said the cemetery was in a deplorable state.

The Mayor hoped the Christmas grant would enable work to be done.  The usual process was to burn off the grass.

The Overseer thought it would be dry enough to burn in about a fortnight.

Cleaning of watertables was also waiting upon the Christmas grant.

The bridge near Kakoschke’s at Aberdeen had been broken by one of Kakoschke’s drivers who said it was not wide enough, but they could not alter bridges just to suit all sizes of truck.

There was a discussion then on the placement of silent cops.

Cr Jennison then objected to people parking in front of his business, blocking access to his bowsers and to free air.

[The Mayor’s response seems to have been most unsympathetic.]

The Mayor said parking had to be allowed or it would drive business away.

The other Councillors thought Cr Jennings had a legitimate grievance.

Cr Jennison complained that he paid an annual licence fee of £1 per bowser and yet his clients could not get in.

[This debate seems to have gone nowhere very definite before a question was asked about whether the area around the Rotunda was a parking area.]

The Mayor said it was a parking area.

The Councillors generally disagreed with him.

Cr Jeffery said that when City Motors Holden Ltd parked their cars there recently all the numbers had been taken and he asked what the result of that was.

The Mayor said permission had been given.

Discussion then turned to the matter of the block on the day the Adelaide-Burra cycle race was run.

Councillors said they were all out to help sport, but the whole position needed to clarification.

The Mayor said he disliked a whole lot of by-laws.

Cr Dow queried whether Council had the power to waive by-laws.

Cr Jeffrey said he brought the question up because the poor attendance at a recent Band Concert had been put down to people fearing they would be fined for parking there.

The Mayor said their fear was ill-founded as nothing had been done in Council.

Finally Cr Jeffrey moved that on particular occasions the Town Clerk be empowered to alter regulations.  After a long argument this motion was carried.

It was resolved that the bridge damaged by Kakoschke’s driver will be repaired and the account sent to Kakoschke.
