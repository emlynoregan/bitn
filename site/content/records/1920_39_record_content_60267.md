Burra Reunion Social League met at Charles Moore & Co.’s last Friday.  Over 100 attended to hear three old Burra boys speak:

Mr Victor Ryan – State Organiser for the Centenary.

Mr Sam Townsend – an ex-Mayor of Broken Hill.

Mr Joe Tonkin – who knew who whitewashed a live pig, recalled bullock roasts and the great fire on Bunce’s Hill when the Duke came to SA & Burra celebrated the visit.

Sam Baker was elected a life member.  Presiding were the joint presidents, Sol Williams (90) and William James (91).

Sol Williams was born at sea and went to Burra as an infant.  He was schooled there and learnt his trade at Jones’ and Builder’s tinsmiths.  He later established a business at Clare and now lives at Glenelg.

Bill James and Sam Stephens were fellow apprentices at Phil Lane’s saddler’s shop.  Bill went to Clare and Pt Pirie and later to Adelaide.  Sam went to New Zealand and recently returned to live in Norwood.

[Solomon Williams 1846-1948, William James 1845-1940 and Samuel Stephens 1851-1937.]
