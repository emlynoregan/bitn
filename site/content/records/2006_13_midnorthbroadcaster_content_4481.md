Girl Guides Hall

The Girl Guides Hall was advertised for sale by auction on 28 November 2007, but was sold two weeks earlier to an unknown buyer.  Burra District Guides Leader, Sharyn O’Connor said this marked the end of Guides in Burra; there were no more options.  Girl Guides SA see it differently.  Business Manager Tanya Sexton said every effort was made to revitalise the Burra Group before deciding to sell the hall.  The hall was in a dilapidated state and a large amount of money would have had to be spent on it to rectify the problems.  She said Guides still could be re-opened in Burra.  A similar thing happened to the Scouts, but they continued.  Mrs O’Connor said that she had looked forward to resuming local Guides in 2008, but with the sale of the hall, they would not be re-instated in Burra.  [Photo.]
