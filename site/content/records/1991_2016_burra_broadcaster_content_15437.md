BCS.  The 1998 Swimming Carnival was held last Wednesday.  In the house competition Jennison won for the fourth year in succession.  [Results are listed.]

Strangely the results for the SA Secondary Schools Interschool Program next Monday are also printed.  [Presumable the Monday following the carnival.]

In competition with Clare, Balaklava and Riverton, Burra came third in Division 1, won the Improversâ€™ Shield and came second in the Handicap Shield.
