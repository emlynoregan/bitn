R.J. Needham, the Chief Inspector of Stock, who has been promoted and transferred to Adelaide with his family, was given a presentation at the Burra Institute on Friday afternoon.  There was a fairly large attendance.  The presentation was a cabinet of cutlery and a silver tea and coffee set and tray.  The Mayor made the presentation.  The Hon. J. Lewis MLC endorsed all the good things said by the Mayor as he had a long association with Mr Needham.  Mr Needham had been 32 years in the department and 17 in Burra.  P.L. Killicoat JP also spoke in support as did Mr Flower on behalf of the Agricultural Bureau.  Mr Needham made an appropriate response.
