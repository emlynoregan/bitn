Numbering of issues in 1947

The year began with a broadsheet paper of four pages:

Starting with Volume 70 Number 1, 7 January, and running through to

Volume 70, Number 4 on 28 January.

The paper then changed to an eight-paged tabloid format, with

Volume 70, Number 5, 4 February.

The series then ran through to

Volume 70, Number 51, 23 December.

There were thee anomalies to note:

Number 19-24 had been used before in 1946 and so they appear as Number 19 (2) etc.

Number 10 was used twice; for 11 and 18 March.

Number 12 was not used in this sequence.
