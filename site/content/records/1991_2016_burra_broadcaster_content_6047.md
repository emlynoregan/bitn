Burra Lions Club has struggled along for some years with only seven members.  In the last 12 months this has grown to 14.  The clubâ€™s main project at present is landscaping the old swimming pool area and establishing picnic areas.  The club is also currently sponsoring a 13-year-old Sri Lankan girl through World Vision.
