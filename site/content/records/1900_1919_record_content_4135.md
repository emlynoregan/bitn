The museum stall, held in a separate room featured over 40 striking curios from the Boer War by Trooper C. Treloar and over 100 people paid another 3d to see the display.  Over £71 was raised towards the annual instalments on the debts of the Redruth Church and the circuit manse and leaves about £20 towards the scheme to raise £120 to renovate the manse, provide a new fence for the circuit paddock and the arrears of interest and repairs to the late Primitive Methodist Church etc.
