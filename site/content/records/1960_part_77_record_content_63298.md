Public Meeting at Booborowie Memorial Hall 25 September.  The meeting discussed the Burra Burra DCâ€™s decision to declare a rate of 1.4c in the dollar.  63 ratepayers attended.  The District Council was represented by its Chairman, six Councillors, the District Clerk and the Overseer.

Mr D. Wedding was elected Chairman of the meeting.  After discussion the meeting resolved:

The meeting requests the Council to organise its affairs this year to enable a reduction in rates next year.

This meeting appoints a deputation through our local MP to the Minister of Roads and our local Federal Member in an effort to achieve an increase in grants to the Burra Burra DC.

Legal advice was that nothing could be done about the increase in the rate from 0.9 to 1.4 cents in the dollar.
