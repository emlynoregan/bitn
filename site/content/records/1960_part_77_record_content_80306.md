BCS

The Burra Community Entertainment Group is made up of students, staff and community members and after much work and great enthusiasm they will produce a lively and fun-filled production of Salad Days on Thursday 30 September and Friday 1 October.

The Youth Club ZOB, which existed in Burra a few years ago still held over $300 in funds when it ceased activities.  Now that there is a youth group active in the town again, those funds have been handed over to them.

School has continued with little interruption despite the fact that all the prefab. Classrooms have been lifted and transported from the rear of the main building to the front, where they have been re-sited on what was the car park.  Burra Burra DC will carry out the site works.  The Public Buildings Department will begin laying out the new Resource Centre, which is to be attached to the rear of the present stone building â€“ and the erection of the secondary teaching block.

A meeting is called for 23 September to arrange for the opening of the swimming season and to form a swimming club for the benefit of the enthusiastic young people who could gain so much from its existence.

The Great Gatsby will be screened on Thursday 23 September in the Town Hall at 9.30 a.m.  Adults as well as students are invited.  Cost $0.50.
