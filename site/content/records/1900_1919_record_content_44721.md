Soldiers’ Aid Soc. fund stands at £160-16-9.

Burra Sporting and Athletic Club Annual Sports was held on 27 December at Aberdeen Oval.

The very hot weather and the exodus of people to other parts reduced the attendance.  The gate took £14 – about £11 down on the last meeting.  The results are printed.

There was a picture show in the Institute in the evening to bring further revenue to the fund.

The Wounded Soldiers’ Fund will benefit by about £20.
