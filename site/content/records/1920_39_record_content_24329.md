Obituary.  Mr Will G.F. Batchelor died at West Hindmarsh 29 September.  He was once well known in Burra, being born in Kooringa in 1866 as the second son of the late Mr & Mrs W.H. Batchelor and educated at Burra Public School.  He then went to Adelaide and worked for H.L. Vosz painter and decorator before joining the public service in 1888.  He served for 37 years in the Customs Department, retiring in 1926 due to ill health.  He visited Burra often and attended the annual reunions in Adelaide and was fond of sport.  In 1887 he married Emily Jenkin, daughter of the late John Jenkin of Kooringa, who survives with one daughter and three sons.  There are two grandsons.  Mr H. Batchelor is a brother and Florence (Mrs R.L. Giles of Pt Augusta) & Maud (Mrs C.H. Hague of Kensington Gardens) are sisters.  Mrs William Geake of Kooringa is a sister to Mrs Batchelor.

[William George Frederick Batchelor born 21 February 1866 in Kooringa.]
