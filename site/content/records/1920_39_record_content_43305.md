Sir Charles Kingsford Smith’s visit on Wednesday was marred by steady rain.  Very few were prepared to walk out and drivers of cars had a slippery time of it.  Cr Jennison welcomed the aviator in the absence from town of the Mayor.  About 50 people took advantage of the opportunity to fly with Sir Charles.  Many were children.  The children and teacher from Copperhouse School came across to see the plane and businesses in Burra closed for two hours in honour of the visit.
