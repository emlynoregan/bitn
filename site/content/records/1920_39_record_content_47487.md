The Mayor said the field had been practically worked by prospectors and at present 1,000 tons was being treated.  2,500oz had been won worth £17,500 (at £6-18-6 per oz).  The quality of Mongolata gold was generally bringing 6/- to 8/- an oz more than any other gold in Australia.  He said some of the men on the field were on rations supplied by the Government and some were on rations supplied by local townsmen.  Burra people had done their bit investing in the mines.  The men were seeking a subsidy of 5/- per foot for driving the first 50ft and 2/6 thereafter and for sinking 7/6 per ft for the first 50ft and 2/6 thereafter.  There were 20-25 prospectors and the subsidy would amount to about £1,000.  If the men returned to town they were labelled loafers, but if they remained on the field they lost any chance of work from the Town or District Councils.  The wanted a case of fracture so they could buy a plug when needed.  They wanted a tap on the main from the bore to the battery so they could get water and for water to be laid on to W. Carpenter’s, as he was willing to install a bath for them.
