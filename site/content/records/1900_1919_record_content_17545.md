A Bolt.  On Saturday afternoon Billy Barkleyâ€™s horse bolted just as Joe Woollacott was about to get into the cart and drive off.  Joe stuck to the runaway from the shop until it was perilously close to the pump where he had to let go.  The vehicle caught the guard enclosing the pump and turned over, taking the horse with it.  No great damage was done to either.
