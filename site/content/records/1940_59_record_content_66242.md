Earthquake.  On Thursday 16 December about 2 p.m. Spalding was shaken by an earthquake.  Residences and the hotel were damaged.  About Â£350 damage was done to the hotel where plaster fell from the walls.  The Bank of Adelaide also suffered considerably and the roof and ceilings seem to have moved slightly.  Many houses suffered cracks to walls.  Lumpers at the wheat stack at Andrews leapt for safety as it quivered from the shock.  At the Spalding quarry workers thought at first it was a premature blast from lately inserted explosives.  The tremor was also felt at Jamestown, Gulnare, Booborowie, Andrews and Clare, but no record was noted at the seismograph in Adelaide.
