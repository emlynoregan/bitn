A deputation from Revs Cowle, Barrett, Hobbs and Captain Cox to protest against the opening of a betting shop in Burra was heard.

They claimed a betting shop would:

Be detrimental to sporting activity by keeping people away from playing areas and events.

Be detrimental to national efficiency.

Lead young fellows to place their bets and then go to the hotels to drink and listen to the race because no wirelesses were to be allowed in the betting shop.

Refusal would safeguard the moral and spiritual welfare of the coming generation.

[The report on the deputation and some subsequent debate extends for 1Â¼ columns.]
