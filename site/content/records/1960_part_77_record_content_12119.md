Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1939

The staff were W.E. Richards Headmaster, Marjorie E. Koehne, Lloyd Draysey, Clive Taylor and Hilda Simmonds.  Enrolment was 65.  The Premier Hon. T. Playford visited with W.T. Martin the Superintendent of Primary Schools and A.D. McDonald MP.  The visitors were impressed by the buildings, but concerned about the rugged playgrounds, which had not improved much in 70 years.  The Premier attended to open the Assembly Room.

Burra Bowling Club held its AGM and elected: Patron, Guy H. Dollman; President, D.T. Jacka; Vice-Presidents, J.B. Topsfield & C.L. Phillips and Assistant Secretary & Treasurer, B.A. Riggs.

Mrs Alice Rost’s Naturalization Ceremony is reported in 1⅓ columns – most of the report comprises the speeches of the two MPs present: C.R. Kelly & Mr Quirke.  The CWA ladies provided supper.
