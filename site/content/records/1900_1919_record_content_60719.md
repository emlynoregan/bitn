Violet Day was celebrated in Burra on Friday 4 July in perfect weather.  A large number of wreaths and emblems were hung on the Rotunda.  A memorial service was held at 3 p.m. when a large crowd had gathered at the Rotunda.  A returned soldiers’ procession was headed by Lieutenants R. Cock & V. A. Riggs with the Cheer-up Ladies’ band.  The mayor’s address is reported.  A bunch of violets was auctioned on the bugler system and raised nearly £200.  Total proceeds of the day to date are about £250.
