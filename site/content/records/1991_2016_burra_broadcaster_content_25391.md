Diprotodon Find

Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University is excited about the latest find of Diprotodon bones east of Burra.  There are seven known fossil locations in the region, making this significant in the field of Australian natural history.  Discoveries include giant wombats, giant kangaroos, big herbivores the size of bison and a marsupial lion.  There is a question why all these animals became extinct.  Was it climatic change or the introduction of human activities?  These sites are part of a much bigger jigsaw puzzle.  Professor Wells said preservation could best be done with the co-operation of the community, which would leave it open for a local display of natural history.  Burra Visitor Centre manager Janelle Cousins saw this as an opportunity to develop natural history as a tourist attraction to go hand in hand with Ecotours, Burra Trail Rides and the Dare’s Hill Drive.
