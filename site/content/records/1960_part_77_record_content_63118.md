Accidents.  A car rolled over on the Copperhouse Road at 3.10 p.m. Wednesday.  A second car rolled over at almost the same place an hour later.  The first was owned and driven by Mr Norman Mitchell of Richmond, who sustained some minor lacerations and bruising as did his passenger Alfred Roberts, also from Richmond.  Both were treated at Burra Hospital.  The car was a write-off.
