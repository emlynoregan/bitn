Burra Town Council, 21 August

The Unemployment Department outlines a scheme whereby men would work for rations.  The Council would pay 25% of the value of work done and the Department would supply the rations.  No permanent employee is to be affected by this work.

The main road grant for the year will be £320 with the Council’s contribution to be £150.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. asks permission to close Essex & Devon Streets near the Recreation Ground in order to fence a paddock.

The Town Clerk said the streets were unlikely to be needed for 100 years.

The matter was left in the hands of the Town Clerk after consultation with the solicitor.

A large number of trees are to be obtained for Kangaroo, Chapel, Thames, Quarry & Bridge Streets and Paxton Square and other places.

Council resolved to see if an offer of two horses on loan for the cost of feed still stood and if not to buy one from Mr Thomas for £11.

No action was taken on the Unemployment Department’s offer.

£1-1-0 was donated to the Mothers’ and Babies’ Association.
