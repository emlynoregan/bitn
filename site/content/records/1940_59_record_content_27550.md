Obituary.  George Parker died in his home ‘Wynlea’ Booborowie on 20 July.  He was the second son of the late James & Caroline Parker of Robertstown and was born there on 21 January 1870. He subsequently married Rebecca Flower of Stony Gap, who survives.  His early life was spent as a contractor fencing roads, making dams etc.  He was also well known as a shearer in NSW and local stations, but ill health followed and he later lived at Copperhouse, where he undertook share farming with the late M.J.C. Sandland of Flagstaff.  After that he moved to Leighton and share farmed with Mr I.J. Warnes for 25 years.  He was also a noted teamster and his well-known horse team carted wool from Burra 100 miles or more.  He bought an unimproved block from Mr A.D. McDonald, known then as Dog Kennels Blocks at Booborowie, where he carried on a successful mixed farm combined with share farming.  Of later years ill health forced him to leave a quieter life.  He is survived by a widow, four daughters (Vida, Milly, Cass & Lilly) and one son, Cecil.  Another son, Joe is deceased.  There are also 12 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

[The birth is registered 25 January 1870 at Burra Creek and the death as 20 July 1946 at Leighton.]
