Merino Field Week saw an exhibition of stud rams and wool products at the Burra Sports Complex on 16 March.  A huge marquee housed displays and food and drink stalls catered for about 1,000 visitors.  Elders and the State Bank were the chief sponsors for the event, which was organised by the Merino Wool Breeders’ Association.

At 8 p.m. a guest speaker from the Wool Association gave a talk on wool and wool products and a great fashion parade followed.  Toffs Fashions of Adelaide and R.M. Williams were overshadowed by local firms Saltbush and Drew & Crewes.  Woollen garments supplied by Drew & Crewes proved to be the highlight.
