Peter Cochrane Ambulance Officer is profiled.

Peter moved to Burra with his wife Sue some ten years ago.  He started working for Adchem eight years ago.  They have two children Anthony and Danika.  Peter joined the Ambulance Service five years ago after completing a First Aid Course.  He has found it a great move, learning life saving skills and working in a team.  Adchem has been very supportive of his involvement, as has his wife, without whose support and understanding he would not be able to go off at all hours of the day or night.
