Drew & Crewes ceased to exist in Burra on Saturday 1 October ending 91 years of operation in the town.  It began at Drew & Young (or perhaps Young & Drew) – a partnership between Samuel Drew and Mr Young the father of Mrs W.P. Barker late of Baldina Station.  It later became Samuel Drew & Co. when the firm comprised four brothers, Samuel, Charles, John & Thomas Drew.  When Samuel died the other three carried on for some years.  At the time the firm had a large trade consigning goods by teamster and rail to stations in the far north as far as Newcastle Waters and to NSW.  Mr Charles Drew built ‘Heathmont’ now the home of W.H. Sandland.  About 48 years ago the three brothers retired and John Drew, eldest son of the late Thomas Drew took over.  He received his business training with Prest Bros. of Port Pirie.  He formed a partnership with Ernest W. Crewes who had been an employee.  This firm later became a limited company.  Recently the business went into liquidation and last week Messrs Sara & Co. of Aberdeen purchased the stock.  The premises are presently closed for stocktaking and will reopen on Monday next when stock will be sold at bargain rates.
