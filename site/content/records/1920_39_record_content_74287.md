Obituary.  Thomas W. Byrne who died on 11 March was a well-known Burra identity.  On leaving school he worked at the Burra Smelting Works, but afterwards spent most of his life in the outback.  Before the railway reached Broken Hill he carted goods with bullock teams to Broken Hill and to White Cliffs opal field.  He sank many dams on Canegrass and other stations in the north and was employed on the Bundaleer Waterworks.  For many years he worked for I.J. Warnes & Sons.  More recently he had great faith in Mongolata Goldfield and worked there for 4Â½ years.  In 1889 he married Miss Catherine A. Morrison and two of six children survive: Alice Mrs Fred Williams & Mary Mrs Norman Pens.  There are 21 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
