Burra Town Council

Council approved the price of £200 for Pt Section 14 required by G.R. O’Connor.

Building approval was granted for a House for O.A. & D.F. Tattersall.

A subsidy is to be sought from the Tourist Bureau for a shed to protect the old jinker.

A letter will be sent to the Department of Highways & Local Government complaining that the by-pass road to the Bon Accord Bridge is used extensively by heavy traffic and this is unsatisfactory.

Burra Marching Girls were granted the use of Burra Memorial Oval on Sunday afternoons.

The sale of land to ETSA was approved for £100.
