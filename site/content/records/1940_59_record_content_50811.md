Cr H. Jennison was farewelled as a Town Councillor at a social gathering on Monday night.  He has been connected with the Council for 19 years and prior to the War was in office as Councillor and Mayor for 17 consecutive years.*  He entered Council 5 January 1931 aged 33 and was believed to be the youngest member ever received.†  Mr W. Carpenter arranged the social and in his speech regretted that Mr Jennison would not be a member of Council for the Jubilee celebrations.

Mr Jennison responded to the speech and endorsements by other Councillors with memories of welcoming to the town such famous gentlemen as Hon. J.B. Chifley, the late Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and the late Hon. J. Lyons.

[*This makes no sense.  His service was much more broken than this and he was Mayor after WWII, not before it.  In fact his record may be summarised: filled the extraordinary vacancy for North Ward created when T.H. Woollacott was elected Mayor, December 1930-November 1933, defeated candidate for Mayor December 1933, North Ward Councillor December 1934-June 1937, North Ward Councillor July 1945-June 1946, Mayor July 1946-June 1948, North Ward Councillor July 1949-June 1951.

†This is also quite wrong.  Two members of Council were probably elected when in their 20s:

Edward Lipsett’s birth date is not certain, but he may have been only 28 or 29 when he joined the first Council in 1876 and he was Mayor two years later.  An article in the Burra Record, XV, 274, 13 Dec. 1893, page 3 also says William Henry Linkson was born 9 July 1865, which would have made him only 26 when he joined the Council in December 1891, but his birth cannot be traced in SA registrations.  There is more certainty about Dr Robert Brummitt’s case.  He was 32 years 4 months when elected as Mayor and Mr Jennison was 32 years 11 months when first elected to Council.]
