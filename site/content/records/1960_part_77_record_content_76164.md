The Centenary of Parnaroo Hall will be celebrates by a ball there on 16 August, sponsored by the Hall Committee and the Parents & Friends’ Association of Peterborough’s St Joseph’s Convent School.  The hall is a section of the previous Parnaroo Wool Shed, erected in 1875 of stone from the surrounding hills.  It is on a section of Paratoo Station and Pandappa Station, leased by Thomas Elder – 719 square miles with 40,000 sheep.  A portion of the homestead still stands about 400 yards northwest of the Hall.  Local residents bought the Hall from the SA Government in 1904 for £400, since when it has been used for wedding receptions and dances.  It was originally the wool room of the Parnaroo Station Shearing Shed, where 60 stands once operated.  Shearers then started at 6 a.m. with breakfast at 8.30 a.m. by which time 1,000 sheep were shorn.  The pay in 1875 was 20/- or £1 for 100 sheep.  In 1880 the land was subdivided and sold for £1 per acre, but the land proved difficult for farming and finally the Government auctioned off 23 farms in 1893 and the 15,000 acres brought up to 2/4½ per acre.  Descendants of early settlers who remained in the area are the late William Just, August Hennig, William Neil, John O’Toole, Sam Saunders, Albert Gericke, Gustav Gruel, Martin O’Dea and Roland Betty.  Two large families of old were Albert Gericke’s 13 children and John O’Toole’s 12 children.  Early farmers reaped up to 40 bushels per acre and carted it to Ucolta to the train.  In the early 1900s it is said up to 30,000 bags of wheat could be stacked there.  Now there are just two remaining families; Mr & Mrs Roland Betty of Blue Hills Station and Mr & Mrs Flank Polomka of Parnaroo Pastoral Company.  Government grants have enabled the installation of toilets in the hall and an annex on the front.  The Centenary Ball will also feature entertainers from Peterborough and District, and will include the well known country singer Allen Graham of Terowie.
