Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society elected for 1956-57: President, Rev. R. Lenthall; Secretary, Mrs A.B. Riggs and Treasurer, Mr E.R. Davey.

The main source of income is interest on invested funds, which is not large.  This year little has been done except for the distribution of clothing. Last year circulars were sent out and it was decided there were no bad cases of hardship needing attention.  Two lots of wood were delivered in July 1955, but none this year.  We have received some very nice parcels of clothing.
