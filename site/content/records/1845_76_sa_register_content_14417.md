Kooringa News, 24 April

Professor Kohler’s performances at the Burra Hotel drew large audiences and he managed to delude their faculties into accepting things utterly antagonistic to the laws of nature.  His tricks were executed remarkably well.  The music of Mons. Linden added greatly to the enjoyment of the performances, despite being provided with a very indifferent instrument.

A week ago Police Trooper O’Brien found the body of a man on the North Eastern Plains.  The death occurred some time ago, as the body had been baked by the heat of the sun to a mummy.  Hanging on a nearby tree was a glass bottle, on which was scratched the message: ‘No friend – lost in the bush – dying for want of water – November – met dogs ate – Pat Duguller – no more.’

Thus is added one more to those who have perished from time to time in the inhospitable wilds of the interior.

[This death does not appear in SA Deaths CD.]

Two accidents have occurred at the Burra Mine; last week a youth’s arm was broken by a fall of earth and yesterday a man’s leg was fractured when a large stone fell against it.
