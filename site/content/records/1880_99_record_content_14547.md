W.H. Hardy writes re ‘A Guarantor’.   He agrees with the comments about the meanness of the Councillors with respect to the trees.  But he thinks the ‘Guarantor’ is about as mean as the Council he attacks.  He says guarantors will be compelled to pay for all the water they use - and why not?  No one could get water free from the troughs unless they cart it out in buckets after cattle have had their noses in it.  If anyone took the water for other purposes the Inspector has a remedy, as it is clear this water is only for the use of cattle and horses.  As for the Kooringa well, it was expected a profit would be made with water to be charged for except for that in the horse troughs.
