William Barkley was charged with embezzling certain sums of money from William Edgar Jordan, to wit 7/-, 6/5 and 15/6.  Mr P. Nesbit KC and J. Winnall appeared for Jordan and J.R. Anderson for the accused.

Mr Nesbit began by suggesting that local feeling was such that the case would more satisfactorily be heard by Mr Hinde SM alone.  Mr Hinde said that Mr Wilkinson had expressed his desire to leave the bench, but Mr Hinde prevailed upon him to remain.  He said he would do so essentially as an observer.  Mr Hinde said he had received communications that a similar case had been heard by the local JPs and they had dismissed it.  He considered that for him to hear a parallel case would be very wrong, as it would be seen as a reflection on the local JPs, but he had to attend to hear the Klaffus v. Klaffus case.  Mr Anderson thought the insult to the local JPs was without parallel.

Mr Nesbit said the defendant had control of the informant’s business for six months and it was no surprise that he was able now to start in business for himself.

The case ran along very similar lines to the previous one mentioned.

Jordan said Barkley had been in his employ for two years, buying produce, collecting accounts and selling groceries in the Hanson Farrell’s Flat area.  He reluctantly admitted Barkley had built up the round.  The buying and selling prices were fixed by Jordan.  It was alleged that Barkley had sold below the stipulated price and purchased above it.  There were discrepancies in the sets of books kept.

Evidence was also given that Jordan had agreed not to proceed further in the matter if Barkley would agree not to set up in business in Burra.  Barkley had set up business in Burra.

Nesbit denied saying that Barkley had started his business with money obtained from Jordan.  [Though he clearly implied as much.]

After hearing the evidence SM Hinde dismissed the case.

Another charge of falsifying the books was adjourned till 18 October.
