Boxing last Wednesday at the Institute

The house was not packed.  Two of the contenders in the preliminaries failed to appear and substitutes had to be found.

In the first bout of T. Halls v. Les Pavy, Peter Borowski acted as referee and Halls won.

The second bout between H. Bevan and J. Hill ended in a tie.

The main contest between Jack Murray and Tom Seal was very even and was eventually won by Seal in the 13th.

A.G. Williams writes saying that after expenses there was only 18/6 over for Seal, Murray & himself as promoter of the boxing.  It is being donated to the Burra Hospital.  The house takings were only Â£36.
