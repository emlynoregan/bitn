Obituary.  Mr W. Harcus JP, the editor of the Advertiser, Express & Chronicle died on 10 August.  He was an acknowledged leader of the free press in SA, fearlessly exposing falsehood, cant and hypocrisy, while seldom being bitter.  He wrote boldly and impartially.  In the past fourteen years he has raised the tone of colonial journalism.  He first joined the Register and in 1867became associated with the late Mr J.H. Barrow in the Advertiser.  He wrote as ‘Onkaparinga’ in the English Field newspaper in answer to Mr Kingsley’s misrepresentations of the colony under the name ‘Post and Rail’.  He prepared the last two handbooks on SA.

He was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne and was educated for the Independent Ministry at Cotton-End College Bedfordshire and subsequently had a series of positions in charge of churches in the north of England.  In 1860 he came to SA to take charge of Clayton Church, Kensington and in 1865 left that role to join the Register.  He occasionally continued to preach when his services were required.  He is survived by a widow, three sons, three daughters and three grandchildren.

[William Harcus died 10 August 1976 Hackney SA aged 53.]
