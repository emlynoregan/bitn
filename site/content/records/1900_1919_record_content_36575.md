Burra Institute.  A report on the showing of Quo Vadis says: ‘The Committee of the Institute arranged a place for the lantern on the roof of the library, and this is a most decided improvement.  All the glare from the lantern is now above the heads of the people, the noise of its working is hardly noticeable, and the danger of an accident is entirely done away with.  The change makes the pictures much more enjoyable in every way and the Committee should have the thanks of every local patron of the biograph.’
