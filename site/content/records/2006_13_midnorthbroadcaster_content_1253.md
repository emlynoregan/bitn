Burra Creek Wines & Thorogood Cider are both finding niche markets quite successfully.  Tony & Susan Thorogood moved to Burra eight years ago and have developed a unique product through careful management.  They make cider, apple wine, liqueurs and beers.  In about a month they will release a new liqueur punch made from apples, apricots and oranges and also some new single variety ciders.

Burra Creek wines also target specific markets, with a small output of 5,000 cases, aiming at premium high quality products, according to Miss Jody Rowe, marketing director.
