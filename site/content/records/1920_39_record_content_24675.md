Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club AGM was held at Farrell’s Flat Institute 25 October and was largely attended.  There is a credit balance of £65.  Advice from the Commissioner of Crown Lands is that if the land is vested in the Hanson DC then a long lease could be obtained from that body.  This will be acted upon.  Elected were President, H.C. Atkins; Vice-Presidents, W. Carter, E.B. I’Anson, H.P. Monaghan & S. Elliott; Hon. Sec. & Treasurer, George Pattullo.  It was resolved to hold a sports day on 26 January 1928 and to erect swings at the site.  The boats will be on the water by Saturday 29 October.  Two lifebuoys are to be attached to each boat.  Tenders are to be called for the sale of cool drinks, sweets and refreshments.  The committee will inspect the site and decide on a jetty.  120 trees have been planted.  Mr Pattullo has since said he is unable to act as Secretary/Treasurer and Mr E.G. Pratt is acting pro tem.
