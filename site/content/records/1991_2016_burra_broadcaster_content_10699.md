Letter.  Louise Miksza of Craigmore writes expressing shock and dismay at the degradation of the Burra Mine site:

The ore dressing floor was overrun by weeds.

Route signs were missing or illegible.

Pepper tree growth threatened the ore dressing tower.

Footpaths were eroded and hazardous.

The condition of the composting toilets was disgusting.

Councilâ€™s plan to leave the place unstaffed would be dangerous.

[The last point is elaborated upon.]
