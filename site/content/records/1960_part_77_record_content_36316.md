Florence Scroop writes explaining the ownership of items at the Racecourse Pavilion.  The two coppers were donated to the Aberdeen Football Club by two supporters and may be used by anyone holding a function there.  The two wood stoves belong to the Aberdeen Football Club Ladies Auxiliary and can be used on written application to Mrs R. Gill or Mrs F. Scroop.  The Auxiliary has conditions of cleanliness of oven slides to be adhered to.
