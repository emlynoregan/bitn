‘Shareholder’ writes that as the Record’s estimate of only 20’ of water in the open cut has now been proved correct, the best place for a shaft is in the southeast corner where there is known to be an ore body and a shaft of at least 60ft would allow for its exploitation as well as draining the mine.
