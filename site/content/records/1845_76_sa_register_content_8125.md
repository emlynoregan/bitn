Arrival of the Gold Escort

The second Gold Escort arrived safely in Adelaide yesterday with 1,620 lb weight of gold worth £70,000 and 1,530 letters.  Many people went out to greet the arrival.  About 3 p.m. those waiting at vantage points on East and South Terraces with telescopes saw a dark animated mass emerge from the Glen.  The first Escort had turned off west of St John’s Church and then entered the city via Pulteney and Rundle Streets.   This time Mr Chambers took a direct course to and through Victoria Square and thence down King William Street to the Treasury.  The strong, but compact vehicle holding the treasure was drawn by five horses.  It took about 15 minutes to unload the gold and during this Mr Paxton mounted the cart and proposed three cheers for the Escort.  Cheers were also accorded Mr Commissioner Tolmer, Mr J. Chambers, Mr J. Fisher, the policemen and the Gold Diggers.  The procession then went to the Bank of Australasia and gave three groans; then to the Bank of SA and the Union Bank, each of which received three cheers in accordance to the respective responses of the banks to the Bullion Act.  The next stop was Government House where more than three cheers were given and the band played God Save the Queen.

The Governor addressed the Escort within the grounds of Government House.  The procession then escorted Mr Chambers home.  [But the Register’s reported did not accompany them.  He had noticed a lurking devil under Jemmy Chamber’s cap and also his revolver, conspicuously displayed in his belt, and fearing that it might somehow go off, he stayed away; ‘nobody knows who may be shot in a crowd, even though he should happen to be a Special Reporter.]
