The mortgage to the State Bank will be paid off.  Crs Kellaway & Woollacott moved the mortgage with the State bank be paid off and arrangements be made with the Bank of Australasia.  Cr Carpenter supported this, but Cr Baulderstone was opposed, saying the State bank had been a loyal supporter through the depression and now deserved their loyalty.  The saving was relatively small.  The Mayor said the Council had only recently acquired the building and was therefore under no obligation to the State Bank.  Cr Kellaway said the State bank had not been a benevolent society to the Institute and its interest had been under discussion for years.  The motion was carried.
