The Ian Auhl Burra History Collection

The Burra Burra DC has recently acquired this collection, which will be housed and administered by the Burra Community Library Board of Management, led by Chief Librarian Colin Fidock.  The collection includes:

An indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships 1845-77.

A biographical index of names of people mentioned in those references.

A collection of maps related to Burra & District.

Collection of photographs relating to same.

Collection of books relating to Burra.

Other miscellaneous resources and indexes to Burra Burra Mine and its townships.

The collection began when Mr Auhl published the Burra Sketchbook in 1969.  It grew with the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and with each of the various histories Mr Auhl has written and the submissions for the District Council, information for tourist publications and for the heritage listing of Burra buildings.  Especially it grew with the research for Mr Auhl’s major work The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77, to be published later this year.

It had originally been intended to deposit the collection at the State Copper Museum-Interpretation Centre, funding for which was granted from Jubilee 150.  When it became apparent that this funding is now uncertain arrangements were made for it to be deposited in the Burra Community Library in the care of the Library Board.
