The Farmers’ & Producers’ Union formed a Burra Branch at the Burra Institute on Friday.  It is expected the union will be a powerful one and will have an influence on the next election when they will bring out direct farmers’ advocates.  They favour compulsory repurchase of land and closer settlement.  The cry for more land is urgent as large families grow up.
