The Burra Races were held at Copperhouse in a paddock lent by the SAMA on 1 & 2 January.  There were many spectators considering the time of year, which is busy for farmers.  The grandstand was packed.  Mr A. Stewart catered.  The Town Plate carried the largest prize, but was contested by only two horses.  It was won by Mr J.J. Swinden’s b.m. Sunbeam, aged 5 years and carrying 9 st 11 lb and ridden by Jenkins.

[The prize is not mentioned here, but on 22 November 1873 the paper indicates that the plum race would carry a prize of 75 sovereigns.  The result of each race is printed.]

The settling took place at Mr Opie’s Smelter’s Home Hotel, Redruth after the second day’s racing.
