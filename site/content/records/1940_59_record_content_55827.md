Burra Bowling Club President’s Report by J.T. Pascoe

The membership was down slightly due to removals from the district and the Ladies’ Bowling Club did not continue.  There were 50 full-paying members, 2 life members and 6 night members.  Mr C.D. Wilkinson was made a life member.  He is one of the club’s original members.  Another of our oldest members, Mr George Herbert, is soon moving to Gawler.  We lost through death another valued member in the year: Mr Stan Kellaway.  We had two teams in the Mid-North Association, where Green came third and Gold came fifth.  Thanks are due to the croquet Ladies for preparing afternoon teas and for handing the club £40.  Financially the club was sound with £92-2-3 in hand.

Mr H.J.B. Jennison had won the Championship and Mr C. Radford had won both the Consistency and Handicap events.  [Mr Pascoe went on to thank various others, including the Greenkeeper and Greens Manager as well as the Secretary, Mr H. Pederick.]
