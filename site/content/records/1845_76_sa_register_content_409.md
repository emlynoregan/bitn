‘Spectator’ writes in a highly critical tone of the way bidding was run up to exorbitant figures in the recent auction of blocks of land north and south of the Burra Special Survey.

640 acres of copper ore land at the south end of the Burra Burra Survey and 367 acres [sic: for 347] at the northern end have been sold for £7-15-0 and £15 per acre respectively.  It is said an agent for a London Company with a capital of £400,000 ran the prices this high.

The proprietors of the southern half of the Special Survey bought the 640 acres adjacent to their property to include a certain spring of water.  The northern proprietors apparently thought it gentlemanly to allow the southern proprietors a claim to this area.  It is a pity the London Company had not ‘the same delicacy of perception’.  The only effect of the bidding on the northern area on offer was unnecessarily to run up the price to the benefit of the Government.
