Burra Telecentre

A small working party is considering the possibility of establishing a telecentre in Burra that could provide a whole range of services to farmers, rural industries and small businesses.  The idea has been pioneered in a number of rural centres across Australia, though only one is operational in SA and that is on Eyre Peninsula.  It could provide the use of word processing programs, spreadsheets, farm management programs and other computer software with tutors available to teach their use.  It cloud extend existing educational services, for example in conjunction with TAFE.  Through the internet it could start to promote Burra internationally as the Merino Capital of the world and promote Burraâ€™s heritage and tourist attractions.  It is possible that Federal funds may become available to help with the cost of financing such a centre.
