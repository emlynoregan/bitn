Burra Burra Police Court, 9 October

George Bull, surgeon, charged Abraham Wren, landlord of the Burra Burra Hotel, with assault.

He asked that Wren be bound over to keep the peace.

Bull said he had been lodged at the hotel for the last three months and last Thursday evening he had entered the travellers’ room with Mr S. Marks and had called for two glasses of liquor.  On calling for two more, he had complained that his glass was excessively dirty and requested it be changed.  The waiter said it was after hours and no other would be given.  Then Wren entered in a violent passion and after much abuse, blew out the candle and said Bull could go to bed.  Bull said he would please himself about that and Wren then seized Bull’s chair from under him, continued the abuse, and put him in bodily fear.

S. Marks corroborated the above.

Wren’s rambling statement did not substantially alter the evidence already heard.

To our astonishment Mr Lang, the Resident Magistrate, dismissed the case with a reprimand to Wren and charged the defendant with the costs of the hearing.
