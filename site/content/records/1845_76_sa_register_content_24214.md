Bushranger Baker is still confined in the Redruth Gaol, but rebels much against it.  Also there is a man called Dolson who is also charged with horse-stealing.  The latter feigned illness, doubtless to be placed near and to have an interview with Baker.  One evening, suspecting something was wrong the gaoler, Mr Perry, listened outside the cell where the two men were kept.  He overheard them discussing an escape plan.  They aimed to break the form of the mess table and use it to force a hole in the lath and plaster ceiling.  Entering the ceiling space they would then remove a sheet of roofing iron and so gain access to the wall and drop down outside.  Soon afterwards Perry found they had wrested the form from its mortice and replaced it after wetting the wood to make it swell and so appear to be firmly fixed.  The next day he placed the two in irons.  On Monday at locking-up time Dolson was found to have concealed a strong hammer in his boot.  Baker has asserted his intention to escape and will certainly try to do so on his overland journey to NSW.  He is charged with stealing four horses from Mount Murchison, sticking up under arms at Cobham’s Station 200 miles beyond Wilcannia and stealing a revolver, gun and four or five horses.  A man named Edwards and Mr Curtis of the Pig and Whistle Inn at Kooringa were there at the time.  Bertram, who has since been hanged was with him and was the foremost.  Baker merely kept guard.  The horses on which he came down to Burra were stolen from O’Leary [Olary] in the Northeast – the owner living at Pallammicca.  On his way down from the Barrier he has two revolvers conspicuously in his belt and had £3 given him by a hawker and others, seeing his threatening appearance, are also said to have given him money.  He is well known in various parts of the colony, especially on the Murray and about the Tiers near Gumeracha.  On the way to Kooringa he proposed to a person well known in Kooringa to join him in bushranging and they would soon make £200 to £300 each.  The man prudently refused the offer.
