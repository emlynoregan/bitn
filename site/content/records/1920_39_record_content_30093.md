Frank Treloar writes a 1-column article looking back to the 1890s and earlier.

He recalls going to Penwortham Mill which was built in 1856 with his father, to have wheat ground there from property that is now the Springvale Vineyard at Watervale, which his father selected in 1852.  It had been reaped with a sickle, threshed with a flail and cleaned with a sieve.  His father bought the district’s first stripper and winnower in 1857.  After a short time Mr Roach bought Berry’s and later Mr Medcalf’s interest in the Penwortham Mill and it worked until it burnt down in the 1870s.  He then built the Burra Mill and worked till his death, when his family kept on for some time.    Then leased by Messrs Norman & Co. in bad times for farmers.  Many farms went to mortgagees.

[Treloar cites one example in some detail.]

Drill and manures were introduced in Norman & Co.’s time and they arranged a practical test on 20 acres of each of five farms with 40lb of seed and 100lb of manure to the acre and with a practical farmer Thomas H. Bailey to do the work.  (Chosen farmers were T.H. Bailey, W.J. Langsford, Samuel Pearce, William H. Fields and Tom Fairchild, of whom only T.H. Bailey survives.)  The results were very good and encouraged the new mode of farming.  Bailey got c. 25b/acre.  Treloar said he took advantage of the drill to sow 20 acres of lucerne on Gum Creek where he was manager.  It was the first tried on it and was very successful.  Land worth only 50/- an acre before the drill and manure now sells for £12 an acre, but good times encourage expensive habits and many are little better off and the pernicious credit system undermines farming.
