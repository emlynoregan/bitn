Back-to-World’s End

Many carloads of visitors descended on World’s End Creek by 10 a.m. on 9 October and assembled near the old gum tree by the tennis courts. A.G. Heinrich welcomed visitors.  Tennis, cricket and other sports were played before luncheon at 1 p.m.  Further social activities followed till afternoon tea.  A banquet was arranged for 8 p.m. at E.T. Phillips’ woolshed, which had been decorated in the Centenary colours of green and yellow.  Rather more than 200 guests attended with Mr W.H. McWaters presiding.  [Toasts are reported and some of those attending are listed.]
