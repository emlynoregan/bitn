Burra Mines.  The Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan says Mines Exploration Pty Ltd is continuing its detailed exploration of the Mine area and the northerly and southerly extensions.  Much drilling and sampling has been done and continues.  The existence of a substantial quantity of low grade oxidised ore has been established.  Metallurgical investigations into recovery methods are meeting with some difficulties because of the nature of the accompanying waste rock.  This work is also continuing.
