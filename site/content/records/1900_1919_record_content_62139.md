Harold Escott, who was acquitted in May 1915 of murdering his father at Black Springs, has been charged at Tenterfield NSW with cattle theft.  He gave evidence that he enlisted in 1915 and saw service at Gallipoli and in France.  He was badly wounded in arms, legs and stomach, underwent seven operations and was shell-shocked, being discharged in April 1918.  He became an auctioneer at Tenterfield.  He had bought 30 cattle at £6 each, but owing to financial problems couldn’t pay for them.  Unable to decide what to do he told Heffernan to take some of Mr Munsie’s cattle and he would fix it up with the latter, but he failed to raise the money when arrested.  Dr R.B. North attested to Escott’s shell-shock and that he had a useless arm, which he thought, should be amputated.  A 12-month sentence was suspended under the First Offender’s Act, provided restitution of £330-12-6 was made.
