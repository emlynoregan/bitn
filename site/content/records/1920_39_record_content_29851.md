Weather.  Rain has come at last with 88 points in 40 minutes at Kooringa, but it was very localised.  Aberdeen got 40 points more, but at W. Finch’s near the cemetery only 65 points was recorded.  The creek behind Mr Riggs ran a banker and that past the cemetery gates also filled, flooding Mr Kuchenmeister’s garden.  At Leighton, Ironmine and Booborowie it was dry, but to the east some patchy heavy falls raged from zero to 2 inches.
