Golf.  Report on the past season, which began with the opening of the new course.  Over the year it played well.  Problems arose in finding a greens keeper and in the breaking down of the mower.  Also frost killed many of the young trees, but most of those planted in springtime have survived.  Plans for a new clubhouse have been drawn up and finance is being investigated.  Open day was successful with 99 competitors.
