Burra Primary School Committee

After 14 years on the committee and 11 as chairman, Mr Stockman felt he should hand on to someone else.  Elected: Chairman D.H. Field and Secretary-Treasurer, D.F. Bannister.

Retiring Chairman, M.G. Stockman, presented the 88th report.

The staff position changed with the transfer of Mr King.  Two replacement teachers, Mr Pope and Miss Ronan gave us the full staff for a Class III school and allowed the Head Teacher Mr Horsnell the freedom to do his administrative duties.  The highlight of the year was the Vice-Regal visit of Sir Edric and Lady Bastyan.  The sports day at the oval was very successful.  Visiting Day drew many parents and friends.  Arbor Day was held at the beginning of winter and a variety of trees were planted.  We have not been able to get a school crossing sign or flashing lights, as the Highways Department will not sanction these when the school is not adjacent to the road.  The most they will sanction is the NSC sign and red flags and these were duly erected by the Town Council.  We are keeping the matter in mind if the Road Traffic Act is changed.  Tenders should soon be called for a new block of lavatories for Primary School use, for the asphalting of the balance of the yard on the eastern side, the fencing of the new Drill Hall block, which has been added to the playing area and a retaining wall and backstop for the tennis courts.  [Thanks to various people are also expressed.]
