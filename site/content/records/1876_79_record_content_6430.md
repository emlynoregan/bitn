Burra Amateur Dramatic Society entertainment in aid of the Burra Hospital was a great success last night. There was a large house. [Performers included Misses Fuss, E. Fuss & Mr Fuss. This was probably Bertha and Elvine, though the latter would have been just under 12 years old. His later activities suggest the Mr Fuss was probably Charles August.]
