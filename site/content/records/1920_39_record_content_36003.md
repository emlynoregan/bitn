Burra Local Court, 10 November

Herbert Frank Sutcliff was fined £10 reduced to £5 + 25/- fees (without a conviction) for riding a motor cycle at a dangerous speed.  The defendant had sped past Sgt McDonald in Best Place and then turned without a signal, causing the sergeant to have to brake sharply and skid to avoid a collision.

John Thomas Harvey, Leslie Ryan, Patrick Henry McCann & Frank Lexham were sentenced to 2 months in jail for having no lawful means of support.  Warrant to be with-held.

They were also charged with entering the premises of Drew & Crewes on the night of 7 November and stealing a fibre case, an attaché case, six watches, a suit, hats, shirts, socks, boots, tobacco, pocket knives, two cardigans etc. and 12/6 in cash.

Hurtle N. Potter, manager, gave evidence of finding the cellar door forced and goods thrown about and of unsuccessful attempts to force the strongroom door and the office door.  He identified many of the recovered goods from the firm’s private marks upon them.  The estimated value of the stolen goods was £43.

Albert Sellars labourer who resides in the Burra Mine with permission saw the defendants there until c. 10.30 p.m. on Friday night.

M-C Provis gave evidence of the scene of the crime and of a footprint near the cellar door.  He went to the mine and found the accused and questioned them.  Later, on the Hanson Road he found footprints to match the one at the scene of the crime.  No strangers had passed that way that morning.  At 1 p.m. he arrested the accused.  Ryan’s shoes matched the print.  The stolen property was recovered from Bunt’s Shaft in the hills about a mile south of the mine.  The place is about a mile north of the footprint on the turn of the road to Hanson.  Other evidence fitted together.  Sgt McDonald with blacksmithing experience recognised the work on the iron bars etc. found at the scene of the crime had come from the mine.  A piece of broken comb with the loot fitted exactly with a piece in Ryan’s pocket.  Harvey, Ryan & McCann pleaded guilty.  Lexham reserved his defence and was committed for trial.
