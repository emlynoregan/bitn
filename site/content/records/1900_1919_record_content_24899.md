The Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs Patrick Lally was celebrated last Friday at their residence in Queen St Kooringa.  Mr Lally was born at Wair and Mrs Lally at Clarenbridge about one and a half miles away.  They married aged 21 & 23 respectively and came to SA on the Airlie from Clarenbridge County Galway in Ireland in 1877 with six children.  They came straight to Burra where Mr Lally worked on the large cutting to the northeast of the station on the line to Hallett.  He then worked for Overend & Rob at Northwest Bend and on returning to Burra worked for Sara & Dunstan for 7 years as a masonâ€™s labourer.  After that he worked on the Hallett-Terowie railway and has since done contracting and casual work.  He is now 71 and his wife 72 and both are hale and hearty.  Three sons and three daughters are living: Michael, James & Aloysius (WA), Mrs Doolan & Mrs Turner (WA) and Mrs Miller (Clare).
