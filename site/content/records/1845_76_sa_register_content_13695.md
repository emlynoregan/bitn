Kooringa News, 26 September

On Sunday afternoon the police received news that a man had been stabbed at the Smelters’ Home Hotel at Aberdeen.  William Andrews and Benjamin Hill had been drinking together when a quarrel broke out.  Andrews wounded Hill with a knife in the side and an arm.  Andrews was arrested, but Hill subsequently refused to press charges and so the case was dismissed.
