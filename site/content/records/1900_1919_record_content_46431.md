Burra Hospital Board.

They discussed the communication problems between the isolation ward and the rest of the hospital.

The telephones in the hospital were questioned.  There were two – were two still needed?  [While not spelled out, this appears to refer to two direct lines to the town’s two doctors, which were installed before the town exchange became a continuous service – and possibly before there was a local service.]

The Matron appeared to have appointed a probationer nurse without reference to the Board, which provoked considerable discussion.  The Chairman went to the Matron.  On returning he reported that she said they had needed a nurse urgently and on consulting Mr Bartholomaeus and Mr A.J. McBride they had told to write and tell the young lady to come.  But this was a misunderstanding: they had intended only that she be sent an application form.  There was then much debate about what sort of nurse was required – a charge nurse or a probationer.  Mr McBride said that the doctors had worked on the staff and made them feel that the Matron and seven nurses were insufficient.  After further discussion about the new probationer nurse it was decided to ask her to put in her application along with others to be considered next Thursday.

The Chief Secretary wrote to say a new isolation ward, scullery and cellar accommodation was being considered.  A letter of explanation was received from Drs Thomas B. Ashton & A. Evan Williams.

In Riece’s case a delirious typhoid patient died suddenly after sitting up in bed.  The probationer nurse explained she had to leave the patient alone because she had patients to see in another ward.  This was reported with recommendation that further nursing strength be made available.  The Board had misconstrued this as an attack on the nursing staff and passed a resolution ‘That Dr Ashton had been grossly unfair to nursing staff.’

We submit that cases are recommended by us as fit cases for treatment in the hospital in a medical sense, in our capacity as private medical practitioners and that the Board has no power to dictate the conduct of our private practice, but can refuse patients admission to the hospital at their own discretion; hence our terse acknowledgement of the Board’s effort.

The Board must make its own arrangements with the Local Board of Health for responsibilities for payment for infectious cases.

The lack of a definite understanding concerning the admission of infectious cases complicates the conduct of private work in the town and district.

The resolution of the Board placing obstacles to the admission of ‘children of tender years’ is especially prejudicial to the interests of children suffering from diphtheria and other acute diseases.  There are only two fully qualified nurses, including the Matron and the probationer nurses, mostly in the early part of their courses, if worked excessively, have no time for the study to fit them for their future profession.

Consideration of the letter was postponed and the medical officers will be asked again to meet the Board.
