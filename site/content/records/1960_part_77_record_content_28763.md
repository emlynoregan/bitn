Burra RSL President (H. Cornelius) Annual Report

The Anzac Parade and Service were held as usual.  Attendance was somewhat marred due to the parade the following day in Adelaide.  Rev. G.D. Sibly conducted the service.  The Marananga Band led the march and supplied the music for the service.  The evening service was held in St Mary’s and was conducted by Revs Sibly and Lind.  Rev. Sibly also conducted the Remembrance Day Service on 11 November.  David Marshall’s Band from Morgan supplied music for our annual ball.  This was successful despite heavy rain with thunder and lightning and a power failure during the preceding cocktail party.  Badges were sold for Anzac, Legacy, Myrtle Bank and Poppy Day.  On each occasion $40 to $50 was taken.  We continue to support two Legacy wards.  Two of our members left the town during the year: Herb. Riggs, a WWI digger and W. (Bill) Kotz, A WWII digger.  Two diggers died during the period: Les. Hirschausen and Les. James.

[The usual thanks were extended to the committee members, the Ladies’ Auxiliary etc.]
