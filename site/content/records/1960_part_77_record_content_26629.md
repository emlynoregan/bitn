The new Tally-Hi Shearing Technique triumphed when an Australian Wool Board shearing instructor Kevin Sarre achieved a world record 346 sheep in a day, using the technique at ‘Batesworth’, Penshurst, Victoria.  (In 7 hours 48 minutes.)  This is a world record for Merino sheep using narrow combs.  A team of three shearers managed 824 sheep.  The previous record for Merinos was 329 sheep in 7 hours 4 minutes.
