Entertainment: Report on Philharmonic Society Concert.

Successful but not as well attended as it might have been. Violin solo dropped. Opened by W. West (Worshipful Master)

Reviewer thought it was good but a couple of the opera pieces might better have been replaced by 'well-selected songs and duets'
