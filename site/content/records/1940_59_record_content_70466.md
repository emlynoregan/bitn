Cricket

[In a strange report that fails to give total runs scored we are told that Farrell Flat batted and lost 3 wickets for no runs in the first over, to John Riggs, who took 4 wickets for 5 runs.  Then L. Kewell took 4 wickets for no runs.

When Koonoona batted L. Simpson took 5 wickets for 15 runs before Peter Whimpress made 25 with sundries the next best score at 21.

‘Without these Koonoona’s position would have been desperate.’

This seems a strange conclusion given the Farrell Flat position as outlined, but then we don’t know what the remaining Farrell Flat batsmen scored!]
