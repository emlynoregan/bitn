Adelaide Exhibition.

The children enjoyed a day at the Chamber of Manufacturers’ Exhibition on Friday.  122 went from Burra, 28 from Copperhouse, 17 from Booborowie and 8 from Leighton.  The children marched into the carriages in good order to the strains of the School Brass Band.  Many had never travelled by train before.  They were met at Adelaide Station by Dr Cockburn, minister of Education.  They marched to the zoo where they were given a bag of grapes and a period of freedom before a bugle call assembled them for their visit to the Exhibition.  There was a period of free visiting before an assembly for lunch, followed by further time at the Exhibition before assembling for the return to the station.  Here there was some trouble as some children were staying on in Adelaide and the tickets had been issued as whole tickets for two children instead of half tickets for each.  These then had to be split and a large official document attached to each half.  In future care should be taken to issue each child a ticket to avoid this tiresome task.  After all expenses have been paid it will be possible to refund 2d to each child.
