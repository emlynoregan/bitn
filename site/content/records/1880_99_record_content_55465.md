Editorial on the fiasco of the first meeting of the new Town Council.

There are mysteries already in the new Council – why the move to Tuesday meetings?  Why Cr Rabbich was allowed to carry a motion to reduce the Inspector/Ranger’s salary to £50 – a mere 3/3 a day when previous meetings of Council agreed Mr Gray was a man of unusual ability doing a great job?  Why was it not offered to Mr Gray rather than being advertised?  No one is better equipped for the job.  There is also inconsistency in Mr Rabbich’s proposal to save £10 from Mr Gray’s position, but immediately to lose most of it by raising Mr J. Jenkin’s pay from 6/- to 6/6 a day.  6/- is a fair wage and Mr Rabbich would have retained some credibility if he had left things at that.  The curator is also to lose grave fees: 6/6 a day + 2/6 a grave in the past.  Also the position of the Engineer calls for further concern.  The editor also raised the question of the legality of the Council’s actions, citing clauses for appointment and removal of officers.  Generally the editor holds grave fears for the running of the Council in 1895.
