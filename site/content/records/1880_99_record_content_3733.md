Mr Rees’s Meeting at the Institute, 4 April.

He denied he was foisting a water supply scheme on them and said it was entirely up to the town whether to accept one or not.

He favoured including Crown Lands in the Rabbit Act, but the Govt. opposed him.

He had got the rainfall line abolished and the lands east of Burra opened up.

He favoured repayments for freehold over 20 years at 1/20 of the capital per annum.

He also approved of peppercorn leases.

Tariffs needed revision.

All the railways should be broad gauge.

He wanted a transcontinental line.

Was for an outer harbour for Adelaide.

Was in favour of Chinese labour for the Northern Territory and noted that SA had only 83 Chinese engaged in gardening and other pursuits.

He was in favour of compulsory education and believed it gave value for money.  It was, he believed, a case of spending money on schools or on gaols.

Also favoured high schools.

He saw no need for taxation.  The civil service could easily save the £100,000 needed from its budget of £892,000 and so avoid taxation.

If a tax were to be imposed then he favoured an income tax and a Stamp Act.

He favoured Sunday Closing, but was satisfied to leave it to local option.
