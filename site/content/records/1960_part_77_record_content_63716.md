Decentralisation of the Post Office Telecommunications Management Authority

Burra is one place being considered as a possible headquarters for this move.  Unfortunately its geographical position counts against it.  As 150 persons would be employed, it would mean the influx of 400-500 people.  Mr R.T. Prior, an old Burra boy has been appointed to the position of Area Manager Telecommunications for the Mid North, Upper North, Far North and Eyre Peninsula of SA.  Mr Prior (Ray) called on the Chairman of the District Council, Mr R.J. Jeffery, and the District Clerk, Mr T.G. Perry, on 25 October to discuss the proposal as part of his familiarisation with the vast area concerned.

[The article runs in all for some 3½ columns, but as nothing eventuated and most of it is about changes in general in telecommunications, it is of no great consequence.]

Ray Prior was born on his father’s farm in the Springbank-Hanson area and educated at Copperhouse School and Burra High School, where he was a House Leader and Prefect.  He has 36 years experience with the department.  For some years he was in charge of the Planning & Development of Telecommunications across SA and later was Superintendent of the Service Branch – a branch he entered some 25 years earlier as a trainee telephonist.  His most recent post was Metropolitan Manager of Telecommunications Division.  He served at sea in the RANVR in WWII, but was a telegraphist at Darwin in 1942 when the Post Office was bombed.  A more enjoyable experience was serving as Communications Officer on the State Royal Visit Committee for a number of Royal Visits to SA and the NT.  As a result he and his wife (nee Miss Maisie Peters of Riverton) have been presented to royalty on a number of occasions.  He has also for many years been associated with the Postal Institute, of which he is a Life Member.
