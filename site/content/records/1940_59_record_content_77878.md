Hallett Church of England

On 2 June the foundation stone of St Catherine’s Anglican Church was laid by Mrs Owen-Smyth and over 200 people attended.  The sermon was preached by Archdeacon Bulbeck of Adelaide and the service was conducted by Rev. L. Rossiter of Burra.  Clem Davey led the choir and played the organ.  There was a tea for 130 guests in the RSL Hall afterwards.  £195-10-0 was taken in offerings and donations.
