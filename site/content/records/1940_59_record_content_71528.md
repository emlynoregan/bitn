Burra Swimming Pool

A public meeting will be held in the Town Hall on 2 March to decide on a swimming pool.  The Progress Association believes it is beyond the handful of men in the Association and is calling on the public. If the decision is in favour no doubt a committee will be formed.  Parents with children are particularly urged to attend.
