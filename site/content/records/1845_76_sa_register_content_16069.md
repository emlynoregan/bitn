Tothill’s Creek News

The teacher who some time ago was induced to re-open the school here has been unable to persuade the local parents to provide so much as a writing desk or a blackboard.  Considering that there are 40 pupils and more expected after the harvest, it is hard to understand how parents can expect the teacher to bring on their children when they refuse to raise a few pounds for the most necessary articles of school furniture and materials.  In other areas many hundreds of pounds have been raised to erect and furnish schools.  Here there is a good building made available for nothing.  The teacher has written and is circulating a final paper explaining his grievances.  If this is greeted with indifference or contempt the peoples of Tothill’s Creek should not be surprised if the schoolmaster should seek a more rewarding field for his endeavours.  It would be very difficult to attract another gentleman of respectability and learning if the school is abandoned for such reasons.
