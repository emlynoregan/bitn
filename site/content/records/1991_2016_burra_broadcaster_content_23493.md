Mokota Conservation Park has recently been opened.  Camping in the park is discouraged, but day visitors are encouraged.  It is expected that Caroona Creek Conservation Park will be formally dedicated in the near future.  It is a park of mallee shrubland and water courses with rocky ridges.  It is likely in the future to provide interesting camping and hiking experiences.
