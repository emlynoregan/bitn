Burra Traders’ Association held its AGM at the Royal Exchange Hotel on Monday 19 July.  Elected: President, Jenny Field; Vice-President, Barry Wright; and secretary-Treasurer, Bev Adams.  Thanks were expressed to Colleen Spackman who had been with the Association for 13½ years and secretary for the past two.  The Association has nearly 70 members.  Among matters discussed was the obvious need for an ATM in Burra.  This has become a necessity, especially with the continuing influx of tourists.
