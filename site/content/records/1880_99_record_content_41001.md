[He, or perhaps the paper, meant ultra vires: beyond one’s legal powers.]

Motion carried with all but Cr Butterworth supporting.

Cr Rabbich kept his seat.

The Engineer-in-Chief wrote offering to supply larger pipes for the school connection and to take the others back.  Agreed.

Levels have been taken in the watercourse at Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s and there was a fall of over 6’ inside the brewery walls and about 10’ from where the obstruction was.  There was no occasion to lower the ford.

Cr Butterworth said the road to the mill needed doing badly, but it depended on the North Ward finances and he would move it be left for a fortnight.

Various public works issues were then discussed and resolved.

Cr Sampson then brought up the Bagot, Shakes & Lewis watercourse issue.  In fairness to Mr Lockyer, who had cleared out the course through the brewery yard and to other ratepayers, the obstruction should be removed.  A letter from the firm asking that the ford be lowered was monstrous given the fall to and from the ford.  He moved that ‘Bagot, Shakes & Lewis be served with a notice, in accordance with the act, to remove the obstruction to the water-course, and that particulars of the fall from the obstruction to ford as per levels taken be given them.’  Cr Butterworth 2nd.

There was a brief altercation between Crs Watt and Rabbich before it was put and carried.

Cr Sampson reported on the deputation that had waited on the Institute about the urinal accommodation and it had been suggested one be placed in the Avenue between the P.O. and the Institute with the Institute Committee to pay one-third the cost.  Cr Sampson moved that the Institute Committee be conferred with and plans for same be drawn up.

A further altercation involving Cr Rabbich and the Mayor and Cr Sampson followed.

Minor Waterworks Committee matters were attended to.

The mayor was appointed returning officer for the extraordinary vacancy in North Ward.

‘Reminder’ writes complaining that no action has been taken to assert the Council’s rights in the Bagot, Shakes & Lewis obstruction case, or towards getting the Bon Accord Bridge.

[The editor refers the writer to the report on the Council in this issue.]

Cricket.  A call for clubs to keep arrangements.  The local club should keep its agreements to play Belalie at Jamestown before the season ends and Mintaro is also owed a game.  So far only four games have been played this season for two wins a loss and a draw.

Lacrosse.  An effort is being made to form a club.

Burra Coursing Club plans a big meeting on 29 April at Mr Duncan’s property: Gum Creek.

Burra Institute new work will be finished next week.
