Burra Uniting Church Op Shop began as a response to Lyn Klembtâ€™s dream of supplying cheap clean clothing to the needy.  A special celebratory service in Burra Uniting Church on 22 November marked 15 years of the service and on the occasion Mrs Laurel Neill, Chairperson to the Op Shop Committee, handed a cheque of $2,200 to Mrs Hazel Newcombe, President of the Burra Hospital Auxiliary.  The money will be used to purchase a special bed for the hospital.
