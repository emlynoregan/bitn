Roger Dunn of Koo-Owie lost more than 1,000 recently moved in from Koomooloo, where drought conditions had already weakened them.  Bruce and Celine Stockman lost more than 600 in Fridayâ€™s chill and many others report losses up to 100.

Stations report full dams and late cropping areas will benefit from the rain, but in areas where hay had been cut, ready for baling, many will have it lost or downgraded and unfit for export.

The local SES crew were kept busy assisting farmers recovering and burying dead sheep and with wind damage.  They also secured flapping ridge-capping on the Uniting Church roof.
