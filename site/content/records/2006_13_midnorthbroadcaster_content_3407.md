The Lower North Health CEO says Country health SA will be developing a plan regarding future service provisions in country areas over the next six months.  In the mean time many country doctors are considering their options.  Dr Tim Simpson has indicated his intention to leave at the end of the calendar year.  The fear is that the emergence of centralised hospitals and the downgrading of other hospitals and services will bring job cuts.

Sally Shepley has been nominated for the Australian Training Award and is in the running to win the National Title along with twelve other nominees.  She has completed her Certificate Two in Retail (fashion) and is on her way to completing her Certificate Three, which offers management qualifications.  Founder and designer of ‘Saltbush’ Elspeth Radford said she was keen to keep Sally involved with ‘Saltbush’.  [Photo.]
