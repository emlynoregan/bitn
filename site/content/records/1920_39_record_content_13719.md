Soldiers’ Aid Society AGM on Thursday afternoon last.  Some consider the time for this is past, but the Society believes that they have a role to play while so many remain in hospitals and other institutions.  President, Miss E. Bubb gave her report and Mrs W. H. Gare gave the secretary’s report.  Meetings drew an average of 14 and during the year £15 was sent to Red Cross and on 18 July the society provided the Annual Dinner for Returned Soldiers – over 40 attending this year.  There was a social on 20 September and on 14 November the annual effort for the Blind Institute raised £142-3-9. (The society has raised £452-15-7 for them over 5 years.)
