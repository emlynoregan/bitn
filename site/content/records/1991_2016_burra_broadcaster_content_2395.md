Police News

There was a break-in at the Burra Bazaar on Monday morning, but the amount of goods and money taken was small and later found at the rear of the premises.

A car-carrying semi-trailer bottomed out in Market Street on Wednesday morning and had to be freed with the aid of the Council grader.

Vandalism at Hampton saw about $350 damage to signage.

The night prowler(s) continue to be reported.
