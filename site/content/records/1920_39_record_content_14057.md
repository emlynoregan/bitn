Ironmine Church Organ opened by Mrs H. H. Thomas.  Some £23 had yet to be raised and at the supper about £17 was taken.  Soloists on the organ were Miss Morgan & Mr F. T. Sara.  The Redruth choir, conducted by Mr R. Fuss, rendered three anthems and there were songs, a trio and a quartet as well as recitations.
