Accident.  Last Sunday week Alf Lawn, while talking to his wife at Studholm, Baldina, suddenly dropped out of sight.  Apparently he had been standing on an old well which had been filled with manure and capped with three feet of clay.  The manure had rotted and subsided and the clay plug gave way dropping Mr Lawn some 21 feet.  He survived with shock and strain as he landed in soft decomposed manure.  He was with some considerable danger and difficulty extracted by Mr P. J. Scroop and his brother.
