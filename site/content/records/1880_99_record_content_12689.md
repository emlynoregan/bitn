Burra Town Council

A deputation waited on Council to urge the widening of the Queen St Bridge.  [i.e. a widening of the waterway not the roadway.]  It recently formed a barrier, which held back water and increased the floodwater flow down Commercial St.

W.D. Scott protested on behalf of the Yorke’s Peninsula Mining Association over the Council’s seizing control of the Aberdeen Reserve.

Cr Sampson moved that the division into Middle and South Wards be replaced by one into East and West Wards with the division in the centre of the main road from Aberdeen to Kooringa as far as the National Bank corner, then the centre of Mt Pleasant St, Drew Lane and Chapel St to the centre of Burra Creek and then the centre of the creek to the southern border of the corporation.  Carried unanimously.
