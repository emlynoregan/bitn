Bishop Short formally announced his resignation from the see last Tuesday after 34 years in office.

The Midland Road Board has decided to require the Town Council to give them 200 yards of 2½” metal for the maintenance of Market St.

British & Foreign Bible Society annual meeting, last Monday in the Institute.  Attendance was miserable small.  The Mayor took the chair and Rev. T.B. Tress from Sydney gave the address.  Elections: P. Lane, President & Treasurer; Dr Stephens, Vice-President; T. Edwards, Secretary.

State Aid.  Catholic parents have petitioned Parliament against the present system of education.

Burra Social Club.  Their concert was good and had a very fair attendance.

Redruth Sunday School Anniversary went off well, but the public tea was only fairly attended.  The school is increasing in spite of many removals.  Hope was expressed that a schoolroom might be built.

Notice.  I will not be answerable for any debts my wife, Johannah Kemp, may contract from this date.  Frederick Kemp, Hampton Nov. 10.

[See next issue for response.]
