An election supplement re the coming Legislative Council election.

William Milne MLC gives his views of current issues.

There should be more MLCs

The electorate should be divided into 3 or 4 districts.

The present 12 year terms are OK, though in practice deaths and resignations make them more often about 8 years.  He would not oppose shorter terms.

He was against the Govt policy of being able to declare half the LC seats vacant if they were to reject a bill in two consecutive sessions if the bill had been twice passed by the House of Assembly.  This would reduce the ability of the Council to serve as an independent house.

He was against a wealth tax, preferring an income tax.

Would consider a reduction in tariffs provided cautions were taken with the consequences, but a wealth tax as proposed would negate the benefits.

He could not support either a property tax or an income tax if they were to be concurrent with import duties.  He would in fact delay any changes as long as land sales were bringing in enough revenue.

He favoured extending the northern railways, but was not in favour of a transcontinental one.  [i.e. to Darwin]

Favoured the reform of the civil service.

He had no view on the construction of an outer harbour for Adelaide.

He approved of Chinese immigration for the northern Territory only and did not think that migration from the UK should be free under the prevailing economic conditions.

Candidate Alexander Hay’s views: -

For land law reform to expand pastoral and farming use.

Believed in larger areas for farms since farmers cannot rely solely on wheat, but need to raise livestock and dairy cattle.

Was for free trade between the colonies and with overseas countries.

Against direct taxes on local producers of goods.
