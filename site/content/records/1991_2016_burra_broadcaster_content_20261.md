Fireworks.  CFS Brigades, Police and Councillors attended a meeting in Burra Town Hall on Thursday re fireworks legislation.  Everyone now needs a permit to buy fireworks and in the fire season also a permit from Janice Baker (Goyder’s Fire Prevention Officer).  There are now three categories of fireworks:

‘Shop goods’ – suitable for backyards – requiring a 3 m clearing all around.

‘Ground effects’ – suitable for an oval – requiring a 40 m break and purchasers must first study a manual and watch a video.

‘Display’ – restricted to certified pyro-technicians.
