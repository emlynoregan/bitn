Murder/Obituary.  Last Monday Mr Weis found a skull on his property some three miles from Eudunda while digging out rabbits.  Subsequent investigations suggest it might be that of Fred or Frank Hanlin who disappeared about 57 years ago.  A man named Wilmot was charged with murder by hitting him on the head with the loaded handle of a stockwhip.  Wilmot was acquitted for lack of a body.  The skull found suggests death from a blow by a blunt instrument.
