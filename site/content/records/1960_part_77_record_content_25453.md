Football.  Commissioners of the Mid North Football Association have suspended two Aberdeen ‘B’ Grade players for disputing an umpire’s decision and for using threatening and abusive language.  One was suspended for ‘one match each on both charges’ and the other for 4 matches for an incident in the dressing rooms at the recent match.
