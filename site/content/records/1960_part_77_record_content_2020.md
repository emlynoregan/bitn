Telephone Facilities in Burra were disrupted on the Thursday before Easter when Council employees washed out water tables while unaware that the PMG cable pits were open.  Water entered the pit in front of Elders and ran through the conduit to the pit in front of the District Council Offices.  About 150 telephones were placed out of service until the pits could be pumped out and approximately 1,200 joins were made.  Communications were restored by Friday morning.
