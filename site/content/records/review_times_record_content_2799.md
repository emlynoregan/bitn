The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push left Broken Hill yesterday.  Artist Pro Hart flagged off the teams.  The push is in five sections.  Yesterday the teams pushed their barrows 48.3 km to Cockburn.  Today the run is to Olary and tomorrow from there to Yunta.  Saturday will see their arrival at Terowie and they will reach Burra on Sunday, where they are expected to arrive at about 12.15 p.m.  The barrows will carry a message from NSW Premier Neville Wran to SA Premier John Bannon to be received by Phil Tyler the new MLC for the seat of Fisher.  The barrows must contain a 30 kg load including a pick, a shovel, an axe, a bar of lead and miner’s provisions such as two blankets, two billies, water, flour, salt, tea, sugar and the essential two bottles of beer.  Their arrival in Burra will start the town’s Australia Day celebrations.  Paul O’Bryan’s country rock band will play in Market Square.  There will be a Tae-Kwon Do demonstration at 5.30 p.m. and then a barbecue by the creek.  Neil Andrew MP for Wakefield will present the Australia Day Awards.
