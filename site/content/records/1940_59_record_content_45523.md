Burra Hospital

Following the Doctors’ report last week, Dr McQueen of the Department of Health and Mr D. Wilson, Inspector of Health, inspected the Hospital.

While they cannot recommend or otherwise that an entirely new hospital be built, they can comment on what would be needed to make the present hospital maintain a state of hygiene required of a modern facility.  The Burra Hospital is very old and with additions at various times it lacks the streamlined appearance and functioning of a modern hospital.

[There were several letters to the editor on this subject.]

Eileen M. Richardson writes saying the Matron and Nurses deserve acknowledgement for their work in keeping the Hospital operating in the face of very trying conditions and handicaps.

‘Ex-Board Member’ writes to complain about the degree of exposure of dirty linen in the matter.  [Under the circumstances, this was perhaps a poor choice of words.]  While it would be nice to have a new hospital he says ‘the old one is not that bad’ and the need for 20-35 houses in the town is a higher priority.

John G. Sara writes of a recent service he and his wife received at the Burra Hospital, which he regarded as quite satisfactory.  He says he believes in doing what you can with what you’ve got.   [He also adds somewhat ambivalently that Burra could find the men and money to build a new hospital.

‘Interested Citizen’ writes to support a new hospital to which ‘doubtless many of our wealthy graziers could and would give substantial financial aid’.
