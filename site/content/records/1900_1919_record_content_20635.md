Court.

Walter T. Truscott was fined £2 plus £3-9-0 costs for dressing a pig at the rear of his shop in Market Square.  He claimed it was killed at the licensed slaughterhouse at Diprose Creek and because the copper there was broken was brought to his shop to be scraped before returning to the slaughterhouse to be dressed.  The bench found scraping to be sufficiently part of dressing to inflict the punishment.  Packard, for the defendant, warned of an appeal.
