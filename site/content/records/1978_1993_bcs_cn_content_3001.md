A Day with Wool was organised by the Burra National Trust and the Australian Wool Corporation.  The function was very successful and featured elegant fashion and fun competitions such as fast knitting, best hand-knitted item, best machine knitted item, best tapestry and best home spun woollen article.  Mrs Ruth Bateman won the ‘best dressed woman in wool’ and Mrs Gillian Dewhirst of Booborowie won the ‘best dressed woman in a home manufactured woollen outfit’.
