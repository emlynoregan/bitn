H.E. Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce Governor of SA visited Burra on Monday.  He was on his way to Broken Hill and stayed overnight in Burra before travelling on to Peterborough and Yunta.  He had an early morning walk around Burra, including the Mine Hill.  He later visited the Men’s Shed where Mrs Scarce was presented with wooden whistles made by Rob Christie.  Mr Christie also made a beautiful wooden bowl for the couple, from a railway sleeper.  H.E. and Mrs Scarce also showed great interest in the various machines and projects, including a doll house and rocking horse made by Steve Boyse.  The Governor then visited the Burra Community School and AdChem before having a luncheon at the Burra Town Hall with members of the Town Hall Committee, the Goyder Mayor Peter Mattey and Council CEO John Brak.
