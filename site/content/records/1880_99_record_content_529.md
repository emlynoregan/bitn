Burra Town Council 1 March

Ayers St Bridge needs attention as do the foundations of the Queen St Bridge.

Having received advice that the council could at its discretion remit the payment of rates the Council did so in the case of J.W. Trellegan, Mrs Hart, Mrs Martin, and Mrs Brown.

A petition was received asking for a water main to be laid across the Redruth Bridge to the eastern end of Ludgvan St with a branch along Tregoning [sic] [i.e. Tregony] Street to Mr Dunstan’s.  The reasons were:

A trough at the end of Ludgvan St would save cattle from being driven down the main thoroughfare.

Trees could then be planted along this line.

Water would be an incentive for building along this route.

It would serve the Police Station, Courthouse, The Wesleyan & Primitive Methodist Sunday-schools as well as dwellings and business places.

The petition was signed by eleven memorialists.

At the present time only four people obtained water from the main and the loss last year to the government was only £8.  The memorialists, four in Aberdeen and eleven in Redruth, would engage to take water and so boost the number of consumers to 19 which would allow the scheme to turn a profit.  The Council decided to support the move.
