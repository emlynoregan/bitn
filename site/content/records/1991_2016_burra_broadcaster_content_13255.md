The Agricultural Societies’ Council of SA will discontinue the State Final Level of the Show Girl Competition after this year.  A Young Achievers/Citizenship Award will replace it.  The Burra Showgirl Competition will continue, but in a slightly changed format, due to difficulties in getting entries for the junior and senior sections.  It will now be:

Princess of Show for girls 3-7

Princess of Show for girls 8-14

Prince of Show for Boys 3-10.
