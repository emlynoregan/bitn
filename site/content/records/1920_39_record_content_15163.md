Giles Miller of Hallett was 83 on 7 March.  He was born in Hutt St Adelaide, but the family soon moved to Barossa and when he was 12 to Mintaro where his father carted ore from Burra Mines to Pt Wakefield.  At c. 20 he was carting ore from the Blinman Mine.  He later took land at Leighton and farmed there for nearly 30 years before retiring to live with his son W. G. Miller at Hallett.  His wife died two years ago.
