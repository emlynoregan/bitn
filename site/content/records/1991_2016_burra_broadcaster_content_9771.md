Accident/Obituary.  An accident occurred two kilometres south of Burra on the highway.  It appears a car driven by Geoff March (35) of Clare veered across the road and struck the diesel tanks of a semi-trailer.  The Ford Falcon then spun across the road to rest on the fence-line, where it burst into flames.  Mr March was thrown clear of the wreckage, but died at the scene.  [Photos.]
