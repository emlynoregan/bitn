The Burra Mine.  Since last week the manager of the mine, Mr Pryor, has been seeing to the best way of hauling up rocks from the recent discovery to the surface, through an old shaft.  The men have been following the lode in a northwest direction and it is looking even better than it did last week.  Blasting has been introduced and there is every indication that the lode will continue much further.  A portion of the underground workings is now blocked by ore and hauling operations to clear it have seen a second shift of men put on today.  The directors visited last Friday and were well pleased and they wish to put suitable machinery in place, but this will demand careful consideration.  [The capital available was very limited.]  The milling stuff available would appear likely to exceed expectations when it is put through the concentrating plant.
