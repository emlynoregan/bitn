Burra Hospital Christmas Tree Festival was held 22 December.  As for a number of years this took the form of an outdoor concert.  There was a large attendance.  Unfortunately for patients the night was bitterly cold for the first time in history.  G.E. Dane, the Institute Orchestral & Choral Classes and the Burra Brass Band presented a fine program.  Again arrangements were handled by Mrs J.H. Barker and Mrs G.H. Dow.  Supper followed and presents for the patients.

The Mayor & Mayoressâ€™s Christmas Tree was on 23 December in the Institute.

An open invitation was sent to children from 3 to 9 though many both younger and older attended.  Even though extras were anticipated the number whose names had not been sent in caused a few disappointments.  The Mayor gave a short speech and Mrs James Thomas President of the Burra Benevolent Society did also.  The mayoress then opened the evening.  There were several items and some community singing to fill in for the late arrival of Father Christmas, but soon gifts were being handed out along with an ice cream and bag of fruit.  Surprisingly the event closed without a vote of thanks to the Mayoress & mayor for all their trouble and generosity and that of the other helpers.
