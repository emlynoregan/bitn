St John Ambulance volunteers staged a mock accident as an exercise on 15 December.  A utility had careered off Bridge Street and come to rest on the bank of the creek under the Kingston Street Bridge.  The three occupants were severely injured.  As well as an exercise for the St John volunteers the accident was designed to focus attention on the ‘Friends don’t let friends drink and drive’ campaign running state wide at the time.
