[*This is not strictly true.  The shop was run by his wife and two of his unmarried daughters.  John Griffiths was older than his wife by some 27 years and by the 1930s the couple had retired to Glenelg, leaving the running of the shop to two daughters.  One of them married in 1934 and the shop was then taken over by a third daughter, Katie and her husband, Hilary Fuss.  Katie Fuss died in 1936.  Hilary carried on the business until 1941.]
