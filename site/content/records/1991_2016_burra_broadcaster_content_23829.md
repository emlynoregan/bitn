Locust Update

Eight teams have continued spraying in the past week.  There is concern over a swarm 1 km x 4 km situated on the western side of Hallett, which cannot at present be sprayed because of the 8 km buffer zone which must be maintained between it and some bee hives.  Apiarists are being asked to move hives.
