Burra Football Assoc. Special Meeting 20 July.

Mr McDonald presided.  The meeting was called to consider Mt Bryan’s decision to withdraw – a decision taken on 9 July and reconfirmed on 16 July at a second meeting of the club – on the grounds that the Association had failed to provide proper umpires.  The Chairman was in favour of rejecting the resignation and referring it to the arbitrator, but after discussion the resignation was accepted.  Each team opposed to Mt Bryan in the final round will be awarded two points.
