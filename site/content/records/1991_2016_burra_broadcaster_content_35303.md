Letter.  Dick Cleland writes to say he began with an initial antipathy to ‘reality TV’ and decided to shun all the events.  The correspondents alerted him to the loss of dignity to contestants and the desecration of heritage monuments etc. so he decided to see for himself.  He found the elimination nights not undignified at all – happy pensioners relaxed in deck chairs, excited school children, poised, eloquent and well-dressed contestants and a crowd much more dignified than at a football match.  So ‘…have a bit of fun while it lasts; acknowledge the financial benefit to the town, but please do not take yourselves too seriously’.
