Burra Town Council.

The time allowed [for E.W. Crewes] to remove wood in Hardy St has been extended.

The footpath in front of Bagot, Shakes and Lewis’s office is to be tar-dressed.

Corporation employees will get a half-holiday on Wednesday.  [In recognition of the Relief of Mafeking.]

Water in the Waterworks well has risen a little since the last meeting.
