A Recipe for Rabbit Pudding in a time of rationed meat.

Suet Crust: 8 oz flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 oz grated raw potato, 2 oz suet or fat, salt.

Mix into a dry dough with very little water and roll thinly.  Line a pudding dish with two thirds, reserving the rest for the lid.

Contents: 1 rabbit, 1 chopped onion or leek, 2 diced large potatoes, 1 tsp of sage or 3 cloves, salt and pepper.

Joint and if possible bone a rabbit and place in the pudding dish in layers with the potatoes, leek, sage and seasoning.  Add a little stock or water, cover with the suet crust and steam for about 2 hours.
