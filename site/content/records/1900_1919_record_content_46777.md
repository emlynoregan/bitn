Obituary.  Mrs William Blott died in Adelaide aged 95.  She was a colonist of 62 years.  She was born 4 December 1820 in West Wratting, Cambridgeshire.  She was one of seven children of whom the eldest three have now died in order of their birth and all in the neighbourhood of 96 years of age.  The youngest is James aged 86, who lives on the King’s Sandringham Estate.  He was for many years head gamekeeper to the Duke of Cambridge.  Mrs Blott came to SA in 1854 in the Octavia.  She and her husband settled first at Clarendon, but soon came north and spent several years on northern stations before settling in Burra over 50 years ago.  Mr Blott died at Burra 23 years ago and Mrs Blott went to live with her eldest daughter, Mrs Frank Smith.  She was blind for the last 17 years and bedridden for the last four, but her memory remained wonderfully bright.  She died on 25 May and has been buried at Kooringa.  [Born Mary Tilbrook.]
