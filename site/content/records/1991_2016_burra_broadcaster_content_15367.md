Letter.  Vincent Burke writes re a tourism Association.

The attempt to achieve an expanded and unified organisation via the Burra Traders’ Association has failed, which is a great pity.  Tourism is a vital part of the town’s economy and it is important to have an organisation that is separate from the National Trust.  A public meeting is therefore called for Thursday 26 February to proceed with the establishment of a Burra Business & Tourism Association.  We are keen to include the ‘Unique Accommodation’ group, hotels, motel, caravan park, antique shops and any business with a link with tourism or that provides a service to those directly involved.
