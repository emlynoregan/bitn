Harold Rice (11), son of H. Rice the postmaster at Gum Creek, was seriously injured on Saturday evening when a horse in a dray started kicking.  Harold was sitting on the shaft and received a compound fracture of the skull.  He was operated on at Burra hospital, but there was little hope of his survival.  Since then there has been a slight improvement.
