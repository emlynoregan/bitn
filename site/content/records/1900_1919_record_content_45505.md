John Hipper had an accident at the railway crossing near ‘Lucernedale’ Mt Bryan, when he rode through the barbed wire fence, breaking five wires and being horribly cut and entangled in them.  He somehow left the top wire intact and was extricated by Mr Foote, an Inspector for the Adelaide Fire Office Ltd.  He is recovering.
