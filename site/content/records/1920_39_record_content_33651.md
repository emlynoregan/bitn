The Mayor said they would not be so asked.

The Sergeantâ€™s problem was not knowing who to hand rations to unless there was some scheme devised.

Other Councillors saw it as a way of cleaning up the town.

The Mayor undertook that they would get 15/- worth of rations for 15/- worth of work and a motion in favour of the scheme was passed.

The Mayor proposed to set in motion the process for selling about 30 unclaimed lots in North Ward so they would generate rates.
