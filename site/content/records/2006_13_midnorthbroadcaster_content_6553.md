Unicorn Brewery

[There are further details on the opening day plans and a claim that the company would soon be brewing for itself â€“ probably in Adelaide and that it was going to be larger than a boutique or micro-brewery.  Details are unimportant since this business enterprise withered rapidly and within a few months was only a fading sign outside the office next to the old brewery cellars.]
