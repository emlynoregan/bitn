Mr R. Snell, recently sent to labour as a missionary to the railway men between Quorn and Farina gave an interesting report of his work in the Kooringa Wesleyan Lecture Hall last Wednesday.  He visits each camp for a week, teaching the children four hours a day and Bible reading each evening for the elders.  On Sundays he visits Farina and distributes tracts house-to-house, holds Sunday school twice and has in prospect an evening service too.  He has been very well received.
