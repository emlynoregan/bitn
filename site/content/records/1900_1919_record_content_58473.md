Burra Institute Annual Report: 1⅔ columns of details.

Rev. Bloyd left the committee due to his transfer to Clare.  He had joined in 1917 on the departure of Mr Harcus to Broken Hill and became Vice President in 1918 to June of that year.  Mr Horner also left during the year.  £21-16-9 worth of free hall use was granted for patriotic purposes.

There are 4,728 books in the library and a new up-to-date catalogue has been started.

Membership for 1917:	Double	22	1918	Double	20

Financial position:	December 31 1917	£205-15-9	December 31 1918	£14-6-2

Commercial classes continued for three quarters, but had to be discontinued due to falling attendance.

Orchestral and Choral Classes have been active, but restricted due to the demands of patriotic work.

Improvements: electric lighting has been installed at a cost of £270-6-11, a move made necessary by the high cost of carbide.  Parson and Robertson installed a Delco lighting plant, which has worked very well.  An engine-house at the back of the building cost £16-7-0.

Steps at the side gate were altered and a rail fence erected from the ramp to the gate and a path made to the escape door.

A new piano was purchased for £130.

From January to July carbide cost £28-18-0.

From August to December kerosene, oil etc cost £5-1-2.  The cost of kerosene works out at 6d per night.

This expenditure has prevented the enlargement of the hall and the erection of a verandah at the main entrance, until funds are available.
