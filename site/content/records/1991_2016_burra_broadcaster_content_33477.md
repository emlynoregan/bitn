The Kingston Street Bridge is to be strengthened.  The Council has appointed a contractor to begin work on the 1879 bridge.  Concrete work will begin on 19 April and is due to be completed by 17 May.  The steel work will follow.  The creek is to be drained between the weir and the causeway downstream.  Pumping has already begun.  The bike track has been closed for the duration of the work and the Senior Citizensâ€™ Garden will also be closed.  It is expected the bridge itself will only have to be closed for one day, when the steel beams are placed beneath it.  There will then be a detour via Ayers, George and Thames Streets.  [Photo]
