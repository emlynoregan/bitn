Australia’s Open Garden Scheme will feature three Mid North gardens this year.

Old North Bungaree (Louise & Phillip Jacka)

A long drive lined with gnarled olives leads to a garden set out in the 1920s and recently revived in sympathy with the original concept.  A grand oak stands in the midst of formal beds planted with roses, irises, lavender and old fashioned perennials.  There is a lawn terrace and wisteria draped verandahs.

Princess Royal Station (Simon & Andrea Row)

The garden surrounds the magnificent 1860s stone house with a sweeping driveway, croquet lawn, herbaceous borders and mature trees.  There are massed plantings of late bulbs, roses and perennials.  The banks of the creek have been terraced with dry stone walls with paths to [the remains of] a swing bridge designed by Edmund Wright and built in the 1870s.

Ashrose (Robert & Susan Ashby)

The long driveway leads through a plantation of gums and saltbush.  The homestead garden shelters behind a tall hedge of carobs.  There are claret and golden ashes to give shade to the mixed beds and borders where there are shrubs, bulbs and perennials.  There is a long pergola covered with banksia roses.
