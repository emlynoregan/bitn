Grand Rechabite Demonstration at the Institute last Thursday welcomed a high official from England: the High Chief Ruler Cr. Bro. A. Tomlinson.  The Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes, welcomed the visitor.  Revs Smith & Ingamells spoke of the inevitability now of prohibition.  The visitor was given a gold-mounted malachite pendant made by L.L. Wicklein, jeweller of Burra.  The address of Mr Tomlinson gives an outline of the history of the order.  His visit was occasioned by the order’s jubilee in New Zealand and Queensland.  Details occupy almost 1½ columns.
