Supreme Court of SA, Adelaide, Wednesday 13 March.

Carl Gottlieb Keirnall, labourer of Kooringa, was indicted with the crime of wilful murder on the person of John Smith on 25 December at Kooringa.  The offender was German and an interpreter was sworn.

Charles Augustus, a sailor, saw the deceased between 6 & 7 p.m. at his own house.  He was then in good health and sober.  Saw his body at Wren’s Hotel at 11 p.m. There was a mark on the forehead, as if he had been struck.

Louisa Phillips said on Christmas Eve she was in the prisoner’s house.  At about 10 p.m. a man came and asked for a light for his pipe.  Witness gave him a light, but instead of lighting his pipe, he held it up to the roof.  He had been drinking, but did not appear drunk.  Witness asked him for the light and when he refused, she snatched at it and it rolled on the floor and went out.  She bolted the door.  A few minutes later there was a rap on the door and the man asked for a light, saying he would pay her for it.  Witness refused.  The man then burst open the door and threw a long stool, which struck the witness.  He then flung a water bucket in pieces and some stones, one of which stuck the witness causing her to fall.  Prisoner asked the man to leave, but the deceased said he would tear the liver out of him before he would go.  He said he would pay some mischief with the house in five minutes.  Prisoner asked her to find him a stick, but she could not do so.  The man stood there aggravating for half an hour.  The prisoner went out for about half a minute and then returned.  She did not know he had done any harm.  On his return he had an axe in his hand which had been used for cutting meat or wood.  The axe was produced.

Cross-examined by Mr Parker, the witness said she had co-habited with the prisoner for two years.  He resided in Light Square before he lived with her.  She had lived in Kooringa with him for 10 months.  The prisoner’s house had twice been broken into.  On the night in question the prisoner was in bed and she had been about to retire, being undressed.  Prisoner did not get out of bed until he had been threatened with mischief to the house.  When he got up he told the man to go away and bolted the door.  When she was struck she was pregnant.  She believed the man was a total stranger to the prisoner.  They lived in fear of annoyance, at the time.

His Honour sought clarification.  Witness said a bundle of lime had been thrown through the window six weeks previously and a new house, the property of the prisoner, had been nearly pulled down.

[See SA Register 17 October 1849, page 3 where the reference is to Gottlieb Kearnall.]

Witness was about to be married to the prisoner.

Brierley Bailey aged 14, a miner’s son, said he saw the deceased ask for a light and then hold the candle up to the roof.  Prisoner hit the man on the head with a stool and the deceased then threw the stool at the prisoner, followed by a cask and some stones.  Prisoner again shut the door and the deceased burst it open again.  Prisoner then came out with an axe and struck the deceased on the head.  Deceased fell and never rose again.  Witness told some men who sent for a doctor and one arrived in ten minutes.  The fight lasted about half an hour and after the last blow the prisoner went in and closed the door.

Walter Bailey aged 12, brother of the previous witness, corroborated Brierley’s evidence.

William White, labourer, went to see the disturbance and the deceased came over to him, bleeding down his face.  He picked up a cask, which had fallen to pieces, and threw it into the cottage.  The prisoner went into the cottage and emerged after a couple of minutes with an axe.  He struck the deceased on the forehead with the side of the axe and then gave a second violent blow to the head, after which the man fell dead.  Ran for a doctor.

Daniel O’Leary, labourer, went to see what the row was about.  Met deceased, who was more than half drunk, and who cried out ‘Are there any Englishmen amongst you?’  Deceased was bleeding from the face.  Told him he had better go home.  Deceased returned to the cottage and called out ‘Come out you cowardly vagabond, you’ve nearly murdered me already.’  Deceased then threw into the cottage an old bucket and some loose clay or stones.  Prisoner came out, picked up a piece of wood, threw it down and went indoors, returning in about a minute and a half with an axe.  Rhe deceased had his back to the prisoner, who first struck him with the pole of the axe, stunning him, and then felled him with the blade.  Sent for a doctor and went into the house.  Told the prisoner that he had killed the man.  Prisoner said ‘No, but he’d hit him.’  Witness found the axe behind the door, stained with blood three inches deep.  Told prisoner the man was dead.  Witness took the axe home with him and placed it in a cask.  Later he returned it and stuck it against the wall of the prisoner’s house.  The police then took possession of it.

George Bull, surgeon, said he was called to the scene and found the deceased lying with his feet five or six feet from the cottage door.  It was too dark to see much, but the deceased was pulseless and speechless.  After a slight delay a light was obtained and deceased was sent to Wren’s Hotel.  He was not quite dead, but died on the stretcher.  He had slight wounds on the face and a wound on the crown of the head, which caused death.  It must have been caused by a heavy cutting instrument such as the axe produced.  The skull and the brain were completely separated.  The other wounds might well have been caused by a stool flung at the deceased.  If there had been a serious blow by the pole of the axe, he may not have discovered it.

Police sergeant Reed’s evidence was corroborative.  He had not found the prisoner when he had searched for him that night.

The judge in summing up said that the jury should not be carried away by their feelings against the prisoner.  It was the felonious, wilful and malicious character of the act that constituted the crime of murder.  They might, on the evidence, return a verdict of murder, manslaughter, or even of common assault.

The jury retired for twenty minutes and returned a verdict of manslaughter.

Sentencing was deferred.
