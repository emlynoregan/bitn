SA Mines

The mining interests in SA are in a most flourishing state.  The SA Mining Association held its half-yearly meeting on 21 October, when most encouraging statement were laid before shareholders.  During the half year in that report 5,724 tons of ore were raised; an increase of 364 tons on the preceding six months.  The ore in this period averaged 24%.  The property of the Association was listed as: 11,738 acres of the Burra Special Survey.

[Since the Special Survey was 10,000 acres, this figure presumably includes additions to it such as sections purchased just north of Section 4.]

Also: 1,740 acres known as the Sod Hut Estate, the Pompurne Estate of 798 acres and the Karkulto Mine comprising 320 acres.  The total is 14,596 acres.

At the time of the last half-yearly report the Burra Burra Mines employed more than 900 people and the number has since increased.  This supports a population of more than 4,000.

The Kapunda Mine was discovered in 1843 and the first ore was raised 9 January 1844.  On 13 January the road to the Sheoak was marked out by a plough track and the first five dray-loads of ore set out for Port Adelaide 23 January 1844.  On 4 March 1845 the first whim was erected.  Eight others are now in use.  1 July 1848 the 30 inch steam engine began work.  Smelting began in May 1849.  On 17 March 1852 smelting was suspended due to the exodus to the goldfields.  1 March 1855 smelting resumed.

The deepest level now being worked is the 50 fathom.  There are two steam engines at work.  The 36 inch direct action engine is employed in pumping only.  The 30 inch is employed in pumping, drawing, hauling, turning and crushing.  .  There is a brass foundry and a blast furnace and a 50 inch engine is on site, ready to be put up when required.  There is also a water wheel and saw mill and a 10 horse-power portable engine for drawing and sawing.  All ore is smelted into fine copper on the spot.  There are five reducing furnaces, one copper furnace and one refinery in constant use.  At present the employees number 238 men and 27 boys.

About 20 other mines are at work in various parts of the colony.

Captain Rodda says prospects at Crinnis’s Mine are good and a good amount of malachite has been found, but the heavy fall of water and inadequate machinery has meant little progress as yet.

Wheal Ellen silver-lead mine has been only operating a year, but prospects are good.  More than 1,500 tons of ore have been raised and it has yielded 90,000 oz of silver and 600 tons of lead.  About 100 men have been employed for some months.
