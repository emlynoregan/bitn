POWs.  Old Burraites are among those members of the AIF repatriated after two years from an Italian POW camp.  Among them are Staff Sgt Ray L. Jones who worked for many years for T.W. Wilkinson as a chemist and Cpl Max Jarvis, elder son of the late Rev. Stanley Jarvis & Mrs Dunn of St Peters.  Both are looking well.
