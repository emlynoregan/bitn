Election Meeting in Institute, Thursday night last.

F.W. Holder, Leader of the Opposition, was received with deafening cheers.

He understood that his Government had fallen for not making sufficient allowance for losses due to the Broken Hill strike.  All would have been OK if the strike had ended in August when he made his budget speech, but it went on.  What was needed now was enterprise and energy.  He thanked the NDL for stirring up voters to do their duty.  Of their 10 planks he could support 2 or 3 and the Trades and Labor Council’s policies were hardly suitable.  The Government policy was one of negation and indecision.  There were no new policies.  The depression was not due to lack of confidence, but to world-wide low prices of produce.  To make the same as 15 years ago we have to sell twice as much wool, wheat and copper.  He thought prices would soon rise.  We should not come to rely on Broken Hill traffic too much.  Too much was spent on naval and military defence; he did not mean volunteers, who earned what little they got.  Last year the income tax increased 50% and the Government meant this to be permanent.  He agreed with this.  A progressive tax fell on those who could afford to pay a higher %.  Those with incomes under £200 should be exempt.  Those between £200 and £500 should pay 3d in the £, those between £500 and £1,000 should pay 4d in the £ and above should pay more.  He still advocated a progressive land tax and progressive succession duties.  Qualifications for the Legislative Council should be lowered.  He supported female franchise.  Free trade between the colonies would almost certainly have to await federation.  He opposed Bible reading in State Schools: he didn’t think it enough to put a religious test on State School teachers.
