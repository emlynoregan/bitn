Burra Town Council, 19 October

No nominations had been received for the position of Councillor for West Ward in the Extraordinary Election.  It was decided to call again.

There has as yet been no reply from the Minister re permission to buy the Burra Institute.

Cr Kellaway pointed out that Council was losing money on the cemetery because fees had not changed since wages were 8/- per day.  A grave dug on Sunday cost them £3-3-0 and the ordinary fee received was £1-5-0.  He moved that all fees be increased by 10/-.

It was decided to have a special meeting of the finance committee on 26 October to consider the matter.
