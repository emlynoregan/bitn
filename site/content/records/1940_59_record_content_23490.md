Children’s Fancy Dress Frolic & Sports

This was held at Victoria Park and was attended by a huge crowd.  The weather was ideal and the committee had catered for all ages from 5 upwards.  Even though the committee had only arranged a day for the children, the event proved to be a big financial success.  Many of the children were dressed ready for the Maypole Dances and that reduced the number in fancy dress, but it is hoped to see them all in fancy dress at the Thursday evening Frolic.

[Results of the Fancy Dress Competition and of the children’s races are printed.]

Four groups competed in dancing of the Maypole.  First Prize went to the High School Girls and second place to Redruth Methodist Sunday School Girls.

The other two groups were Burra Red Cross and Sporting Girls of 1945.

Mrs S. Scroop convened a very popular stall dispensing a wonderful collection of home-made sweets, jellies, peaches, ice-cream and soft drinks.

Mrs H.J.B. Jennison, Mrs N. Pearce, Mrs A. Clode and Mrs Jeffery convened the afternoon tea, served in the pavilion with many varieties of savouries and cakes.

The Mayor, Mr T.H. Woollacott introduced The Chief Secretary, Hon. A.L. McEwin, who declared the first day’s events open.  He also welcomed Mr W.F. Johns, Superintendent of the SA Police and the Police Band.

The Mayor and Hon. A.L. McEwin in their speeches both recounted events from Burra’s past, including the mining period and Burra’s later efforts in two great wars.

Superintendent John also spoke, recalling that his youngest son, now a Lieutenant on HMAS Hawkesbury at Singapore, had been born at the old Redruth Police Station and his own memories of the town were very pleasant.
