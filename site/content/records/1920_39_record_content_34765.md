Fire.  At 12.45 a.m. on Sunday fire broke out in G.C. Kuchenmeister’s refreshment rooms (owned by Charles Parks of Semaphore and late of Burra) on the corner of Chapel and Commercial Streets.  R. Brinkworth of Elder, Smith & Co. raised the alarm and the brigade soon had the fire under control.  Damage was c. £500.  The cause seems to have been the fusing of an electric wire.
