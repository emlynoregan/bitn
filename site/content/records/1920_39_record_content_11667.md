A.J. Cousins’ Funeral was a most unenviable experience due to the appalling weather.  On Sunday when the hearse arrived at Booborowie snow was falling heavily.  The cortege left for Burra, twenty miles away, at 9.30 a.m. and had to endure snow and then fiercely driving hail and rain.  22 buggies and 11 motor cars took part.  Twice the horses stopped and refused to face the elements.  In all, the journey took five hours.  Amazingly to the east of Burra the country is still enveloped in dust with no rain of significance having fallen.  The undertakers with this difficult job were C.J. Pearce & Son.
