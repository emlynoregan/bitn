Burra & District Ambulance Association has decided to apply to the St John Council for a subsidy on a new ambulance.  The present ambulance is considered inadequate.  It would be retained as a mobile first aid room as its trade in value is negligible.  It has completed c. 25,000 miles.  The Association also feels it is time for the erection of a worthy building.  A membership drive will also be held.
