Burra Air Force Association

The State President of the Association Mr D. Orchard officially opened the Burra Branch Club Rooms on Saturday night.  It is the first SA Branch to have its own club rooms.  Representatives from around the state attended as well as from the district.  The room has been beautifully furnished and redecorated, though weather has prevented the painting of the outside as yet.  Ross Humphrys, Branch President, welcomed guests.  Vice-President John Mc bride introduced Mr Orchard.  Mr Orchard was accompanied by the Assistant State Secretary Mr Gordon Warhurst, the IPP of Port Adelaide Mr Sid. Jay and Mr Cyril Glasson, Secretary of the Prospect Branch.  During the evening four members of the RAF arrived from Edinburgh Airfield.
