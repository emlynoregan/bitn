Burra War Memorial Committee had to postpone its AGM on 24 September for want of a quorum.  Another attempt will be made on 22 October and without more interest being shown this project could ‘go under’.  In the past year the oval has been sown to grass and good coverage achieved for a large area.  The Football Club has installed lights for night play.  The courts have been resurfaced and wire mesh surrounds installed and a shelter shed erected. The division was has been removed.
