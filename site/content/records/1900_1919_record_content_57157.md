Burra Cheer-up Soc.

A cheque for £27-10-0 has been sent to the Men’s Tobacco Auxiliary Fund for ‘smokes’ for sailors in the Australian Navy.

£20 has gone to the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide towards entertaining Anzacs returning on furlough.

Parcels have been sent to departing soldiers Pte Dixon, Pte Dixon, Pte Turner and Pte Glen Finch.

[The Dixons were possibly the brothers J.A. & A.G. Dixon, but it is not certain.  The Turner has not been identified.]
