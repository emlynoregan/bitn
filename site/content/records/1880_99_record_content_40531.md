Cr Watt also wanted the motion put.

The mayor said they ought to go into committee.

Cr Rabbich rose to make his explanation.

Cr Sampson asked the motion be put.

Cr O’Leary suggested the mover and seconder would withdraw the motion.

Cr Sampson said he would if Cr Rabbich would confine himself to a personal explanation, although he was not afraid of the press or anyone else.

Cr Rabbich then said: ‘As a representative of the ratepayers intrusted [sic] with the rest of Council in spending public money I left the Council on evening of Feb. 20 with the idea that the business transacted re accepting tenders for road metal was not consistent with honorable and independent action consequently I would not have anything further to do with such.’

The Mayor said such remarks were an insult to the whole of Council and he would not sit and have such things said.

Cr Sampson agreed and moved the Council go into committee to consider the matter.  Cr Watt 2nd.

Cr O’Leary thought such an explanation scandalous and he would support the motion.
