Paxton Square

The Lewis Trust which owns historic Paxton Square has recently been expanded to include local trustees as well as two trustees from the Lewis family.  Mr Robert Lewis, former Master of St Mark’s College, Adelaide, resigned as Public Officer and Chairman of the Lewis Trust earlier this year when he went to become Master of Menzies College at Latrobe University, Melbourne.  He is a son of the late Essington Lewis.  Rev. G.D. Sibly was elected in his place as Chairman and Public Officer and five other prominent leading citizens were elected to the Board of Management.  Some tidying up has followed and the trustees now intend to evaluate the whole position of the buildings forming the square.  Paxton Square is unique in Australia, not only as a well-preserved example of Cornish architecture, but because it marks the first attempt by an employer to provide mass housing for its employees.  The employer was the SA Mining Assoc., which had established Kooringa as their private town on Section 1, which they had bought for $20,000.  Until the Mine closed in September 1877 all houses and shops in Burra were leased from the Mining Association.

[This is incorrect.  Initially SAMA granted only leasehold in Kooringa, but from 1868 freehold was granted and was encouraged through the 1870s, though SAMA remained a significant landlord well into the 20th century, with a final attempt to sell off remaining properties in 1912 in its winding up operations.]

Early in 1852 the bulk of the men employed in the Mine left for the Victorian gold-diggings and it was well into 1853 before they returned and work could be resumed at the Mine.  In the meantime the Association had taken steps to bring out miners from England and it was to provide homes for these underground workers that Paxton Square was built.

[This is also incorrect.  See Ian Auhl, Paxton Square Burra South Australia, Investigator Press, n.d. in which he cites the evidence for the construction of the cottages earlier than this.  A painting of 1850 by S.T. Gill shows 11 cottages on the western side and some on the southern side.  They are also marked on the 1849 plan of Kooringa.  There construction was a response to flooding of dugouts in the creek banks.  Of course, some of the miners mentioned above could well have been housed there.]

The 33 cottages were built by Cornishmen for Cornish miners.  In later years [1913] when the Mining Association was selling its properties in Kooringa, the Hon. John Lewis, father of Essington Lewis, purchased the Square and at his death [1923] the houses were left in trust to house the needy and poor of Burra.

[This had been his intention in 1913 and he had hoped to see nominal ownership vested in the Town Council.  They declined because they feared being saddled with the maintenance costs.]

In 1845 William Paxton was a young chemist living behind his shop in Rundle Street, Adelaide, when Burra copper was discovered.  Paxton with Bunce and other Rundle [& Hindley] Street shop-keepers subscribed the necessary capital.  Paxton invested $240.  Within a year the $10 shares were worth $200 and the dividend was 600%.  Paxton bought more shares and became a Mine Director and a wealthy man.  He acquired large properties in Kooringa, owning the two hotels and Paxton Square, where the cottages were later built.  He later ran for Parliament for Port Adelaide, but his interests in politics gave way to pastoral pursuits.  The cottages originally had dirt floors and no verandahs.  There have been few changes to them over the years.
