3rd Leader on the dangers at the Bon Accord crossing.  The authorities promised a gong and then, having done nothing, promised gates, but have failed to deliver them as well.  A few weeks ago a cow was killed and now another incident in which Providence alone can tell how a man and horses were not cut to pieces.  The incline makes it impossible for a train to pull up even if tis driver sees an obstruction on the line in good time.
