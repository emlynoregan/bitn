Without this seed wheat much of the drier country must have gone out of cultivation to the disadvantage of the landlords of whom the Government is the largest.

A Bill to repurchase land for closer settlement has been passed and this has seen land at Mt Browne, near Farrell’s Flat, and at Penton Vale on Yorke Peninsula acquired.  Other purchases will follow as opportunity occurs.

The Bundaleer and Barossa Reservoirs have been improved and other smaller schemes are contemplated.

Juvenile gambling has been dealt with under the Gaming Suppression Bill.

Federation has occupied much time and thought.  I believe the new referendum to coincide with this election will approve the amendments made by the Premiers’ Conference.  The new provisions give greater power to the larger colonies and less to the smaller than in the previous Bill, but it is still no less worthy of acceptance by SA.  In the hands of Mr Reid we can expect that NSW will follow SA in approving the Bill and then nothing will be left but for the British Parliament to pass the Bill.  I have no agreement with those who would abolish the local Parliament, but the numbers of MPs should be reduced when Federation occurs.

Holder thought that the MLCs in the past had represented their constituents well, but he had no objection to the proposed adult suffrage which would enfranchise another 80,000 – in any case it would be decided by a referendum on 29 April.

There was a proposal to increase the income tax exemption level and to allow the State Bank to accept deposits in the same way as the Savings Bank.  The Export Department has done well at promoting the sale of produce that private enterprise showed no signs of moving: 60,000 sheep carcases worth £30,000, 400,000 rabbits worth £13,000, £5,000 worth of wine and over £70,000 worth of butter.

Holder spoke for two hours.
