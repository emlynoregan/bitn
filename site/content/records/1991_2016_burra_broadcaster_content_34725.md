Letter.  Helen Jensen writes about past exhibitions at the Burra Regional Art Gallery and hopes people will come forward to see that it continues.  Specifically she mentioned:

The first exhibition in what was then still known as the Old Post & Telegraph Office – ‘Windows’ on 1 May 1994.

The Gallery’s opening exhibition ‘Family Collections and Connections’ 5 October 1996.

A grant that allowed the opening of the northern section in 1997.

The Leonard Bence Retrospective in 1998.
