N. Hiles Pearse writes re the Mt Bryan meeting about the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  He was struck by the undercurrent of selfishness permeating the meeting.  He protests (as a brother of a fallen soldier) at the callous and unfriendly tone towards the Mayor and citizens of Burra.  That there were broadminded and unbiased people present is shown by the 21 abstentions.  It is time to cease eternal wranglings and bickerings and get down to commonsense.  If Mr Warnes has announced all connection with Burra and their Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial ‘he will, to be consistent (and consistency is most essential to one basking in the rays of the public lime-light) withdraw from the various positions which he holds in connection with the town; for, if the Burra dead are unworthy of consideration, the living, many of whom are flesh and blood with the boys who have “gone West”, must, in his opinion, be ignoble and beneath contempt.  This is of course merely a surmise.  Mr Warnes jeers at Mr Crewes for “what Burra has done”.  The writer may, of course, be of lower mental calibre than Mr Warnes, for he (the writer) feels proud to be associated with a man of Mr Crewes’ ability and organising acumen, and with a town like Burra . . . All honour to Mr Crewes and the Burra people, their record is probably unsurpassed in the Commonwealth.’

Burra and district must in a case like this be synonymous.  Anyone with horse sense will admit that the big central memorial should be at Burra.  If the outside districts each desire their own memorial well and good, let them have them, but surely they will be public spirited enough to support a central one too.  [The writer then calls on all to forego petty differences and meanness and take a broader outlook.]  One cannot but pay tribute to the Mayor, the wonderful girls of the Cheer-up Society, the Burra Athletic & Sporting Club and all the other organisations, district and otherwise, for their true patriotism.  We can only succeed in taking a wider, more charitable view of things ‘by eliminating the hydra-headed demon of selfishness; and not by shouting gaily from the housetops about scattering largess disinterestedly, while all the time our little “axe to grind” is very obviously protruding from our pocket.’
