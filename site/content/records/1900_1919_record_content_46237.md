Ambulance Day Results.  Ambulance Day produced one ambulance from J.M. McBride and one from Messrs A.J & P. McBride and raised in cash nearly £900 despite the fact that the highest donor gave £25.  This is a magnificent effort from those in moderate circumstances.  It is well known that some of the wealthiest have given practically nothing to the war effort.  They are prepared to stand by and let another man be smashed up in their place and then refuse to help even to carry him to hospital.  And they have the enormous audacity to point the finger of scorn at young men who haven’t the courage to plunge into the maelstrom of war itself.

At a meeting of the committee it was decided the Mayor should hand over the ambulance already bought, to the Military authorities as soon as possible.  The other three will be presented as soon as they are ready and it was decided to do this at a ceremony.  Clem Sampson, H.L. Pearce and Clarence Humphrys are to be recommended as drivers.

After all expenses are paid some £20-£30 will still be needed to pay for the two ambulances.
