W.H. Hardy writes an article of c. ¾ column on Women’s Suffrage, which he opposed.

Women have more suitable work to do: looking after their household and children.

Where are the women, had they the vote tomorrow, who understand or would care to study the single tax, political economy or the progressive land tax?

If such women [i.e. those who have no interest in the matters mentioned.] had the vote they would use it to no purpose at all.

The majority of women are talker, not thinkers or actors.

‘If women are to vote at elections for members of Parliament why should they not be permitted to vote for one of themselves, which if done, and women are to become members of Parliament, why should they not be permitted to form a Ministry and soon?  Once pass the line that custom has laid down and where will you stop?’

Such would be ‘inconsistent with their works as wives and mothers’.
