Burra Burra DC

The Clerk, Mr T.G. Perry, says work will soon start on the Hanson-Black Springs Road. While recently in Burra, the Minister of Local Government, Mr Jude, outlined plans for improving main road 45 from Marrabel to Peterborough.  The new section will run from Hanson direct to Black springs.  Grants received by Council are up several thousand pounds on those received last year.
