Mongolata Goldfield

Tuesday on J. Pexton’s ‘Takati’ claim 96oz of gold were obtained in an afternoon as the result of a ‘shot’.  The parcel was of almost pure gold: one piece was just over 3lb and another nearly 2lb with other ‘trifles’.  John and Don Pexton found another parcel on Saturday of 56oz.  These finds come from a winze at 80ft in a fissure 3ft wide.

Wilton Hack of Byles’ Mongolata Gold Mining Co. says some of the samples are of rare crystalline gold probably of 24 carats and is very encouraging.

On Monday other splendid examples were obtained.

The claim of C. Schwier, Bert Morgan, L. Motherall & T. Villis is also reputed to be doing well averaging 96oz per week for the last 8 weeks.

Several other claims are said to be producing well.

The battery is expected to be completed in about a fortnight.
