Booborowie Hall

For some years now a community effort has been under way to complete the hall, begun in 1921.  To raise the large sum of money it was thought the usual means of sports meetings, entertainments etc. would be inadequate and borrowing would have placed an unfair burden on future generations and the hard-working ladies of the district.  The solution was to get land made available for cropping.  Mr M.S. Hawker of Anama Pastoral Co., through his manager P.C. Brook, made 33 acres available for 1952 and 120 for 1953, with the proviso that the equivalent of 10 acres in 1953 go to the Burra Hospital.  Mr J.C. Hawker also gave 120 acres in 1955 and in 1956 repeated this on an equal share basis with the company.  Results:

1951-52	33 acres barley	281 bags	nett £37

1952-53	133 acres barley	1272 bags	nett £2,306

1953-54	120 acres barley	928 bags	nett £992	(plus £57-8-0 for Burra Hospital)

1954-55	no project

1955-56	120 acres barley	1084 bags	nett £1186
