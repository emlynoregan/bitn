Goyder Council

Launched its Visitor Information Pack on 19 August.  It contains information for all of the Goyder Council area and the material is held in a brightly illustrated presentation folder.

Council will continue to be represented in ongoing discussions with other stakeholders re the Farrell Flat Airstrip.

Council will write to Transport SA expressing concern of the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee about the deteriorating state of the Burra Railway Station.

Councillors agreed to consider providing a disabled parking space outside the Burra Pharmacy.
