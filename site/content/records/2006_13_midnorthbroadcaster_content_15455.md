Fire.  The southern end of Burra was blanketed by smoke just after 2 p.m. last Tuesday when dry reeds along Burra Creek caught fire.  The Burra CFS unit responded as the flames moved towards Cook O'Burra snack bar and the Burra Hotel.  The historic jinker was also located just above the creek line where great heat could be felt.  Other fire units also responded and no property damage resulted.
