An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms before Mr Marshall MacDermott SM on the fire at W.H. Stanbury’s store on 26 January with J. Winnall as foreman of the jury.

Charles Drew, storekeeper.  Was returning from Black Springs at c. 3.45 a.m. Tuesday morning in the company of Mr Drake and Howard.  We passed up the hill between the Bank and Mr Chappell’s.  Did not see the fire until we reached the gate into our yard.  As Mr Drake opened the gate I observed fire issue from Stanbury’s skylight and went to raise the alarm at Stanbury’s house. Mr Stanbury came out as I arrived.  I flung a bucket or two of water on the roof next to Stanbury’s house and then noticed the varnish and paint oozing out of the Bank’s windows.  In a moment or two they were ablaze.  Went round to the Bank and entered by the back door and was going upstairs when I met Mr Wilkinson.  Got a bucket of water and threw it on one of the windows.  The powder exploded while I was throwing water on the roof – not much of it judging from the explosion.

Henry Drake.  Saw the flames coming out of the building in one sheet.  Gave the alarm and ran to the Bank.  I also called Mr Chappell, Mr Dyer and the policeman.  Then went up the street giving the alarm as far as Mr Robert’s.  On returning I went up the hill by which time the roof was a mass of flames.  Went to the Bank and helped carry water upstairs.  Saw no sign of the fire until I was getting out of the cart about 100 yards away.  About 20 persons were present on my return.  The wind was blowing towards the creek and Dr Maurau’s.  The flame was six feet above the skylight.  The powder exploded while I was coming back – perhaps six minutes after I saw the fire.
