Serious Accident.  On Boxing Day at Fingerpost Mr R. Sharpe was dragged out of his trap when his horse turned short and broke a shaft.  The horse then bolted and eventually Mrs Sharpe was thrown out, fracturing a thigh.  The couple endured a 10-hour ordeal in the sun in getting into Burra and the hospital, only reaching W. Baynesâ€™s place Baldina at 8 p.m. and the hospital about 11 p.m.
