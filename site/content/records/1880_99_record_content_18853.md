Burra Waterworks.  At the deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works, W.B. Rounsevell said that the Burra Council had arranged with the Government to construct a water supply equal to 30,000 gallons a day, with the locomotive department as a consumer, but the latter had failed to fulfil the promise.  Works were partly completed pending the arrival of an engine from England.  The Corporation had asked for an account, but before paying had asked for particulars.  These were refused and they were referred to a clause in the agreement, which they thought did not apply.  They paid, but also sought particulars once more.  Mr Mestayer claimed to be understaffed, but supplied some information, which led them to believe they were grossly overcharged.  They found they were charged 4d for ½” pipe when the cost was 2½d and for ¾” pipe they were charged 6d when the cost was 3⅛d.  He asked the matter be investigated, as it would be highly undesirable for the whole to be thrown on the hands of the Government.  They were also charged £900 for the old works - they were not obliged to take over these works according to the agreement, but in any case they ought not to pay the first cost of such after 8 years of use.  It would also be desirable to buy a piece of land on which to erect necessary buildings.

Mr Ridgway said a large part of the expenditure of the [old] works was on behalf of the Railways Department and they were not, as they stood now, worth a farthing over £250.

Mr Mestayer claimed the £960 included only the money expended by the Department for the Aberdeen works and not for the Railway works at all.  The Commissioner will reply in due course.
