The Booborowie Hotel has new owners Alf Muscat and Wilma Sulzer.  They will renovate the hotel and apply for extended trading hours.  Wilma has twenty years experience running two high profile hotels in inner Melbourne and moved to Whyalla in 2003 to become a full-time carer for her mother, who died just four months short of her 100th birthday.  They will improve the outside areas and renovate two residential rooms.
