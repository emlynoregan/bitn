Henry C. Mais, Engineer-in-Chief and Manager of SAR produced a copy of the rules and regulations.

[He also described the scene.  He believed one reason for the collapse of the embankment was the nature of the material, but that was inevitable; it was necessary to use what was available.  In other places the water had flowed over the rails, depositing debris on the top, but not causing damage to the permanent way.  Had the culvert not been blocked up he believed it would have been capable of carrying away all ordinary storm waters.

The last body had not been removed till 7 p.m.  The body of the driver was in an almost vertical position among a lot of wheat and debris, but did not appear much bruised.  Homes was leaning out as if he had been looking ahead and thus doing his duty.  The fireman had hold of the steam-regulator.  The appearance of ballast above the chasm no doubt led them to believe the line was all right.

The duty of walking the line was performed at the lower end and he had not been aware until yesterday that it was not done up to the present time.

[Mais then outlined the regulations requiring the walking of the line.]

Branford was the Inspector of the Permanent Way and responsible for keeping this section of line in good order.

Mais had never received any report casting doubts on the safety of the embankment.  It was not Home’s duty to walk the line, but that of the men under him.  He had no idea the embankment was unsound.  The watermark on the telegraph poles was 12 ft high.

William Navin, ganger, said he was aware of the regulations re walking the line.  On the morning of the accident Mr Holmes had asked who was to walk the line. He said it was Thomas Roach’s turn; each man of the gang walking it in turn.  It was the custom to walk the line after the first goods train had passed.  This was because of instructions from Mr Branford in the previous September who said that the goods train driver and stoker had sufficient light to see any danger.  After that the line had always been inspected after the first goods had passed.  He had worked the line since its construction and had never known the culvert unable to carry away water, though he had observed the watermark above the line after heavy rains, but it had done no harm.

Patrick Roach said he recalled Navin reading out the instruction from Mr Branford.

He had received 7/6 a month for walking the line when it was in operation.

Henry Branford produced the instruction re ceasing to walk the line as requested by himself  and endorsed by R.C. Patterson, Chief Assistant Engineer.

The change was because the driver and fireman had sufficient light; it was not about saving money.

He considered it possible the accident could have been averted if men had walked the line, but it was not a certainty.  The breach would have been discovered, but the men might not have been able to stop the train.

[Much more detail around this matter is printed.]

He did not consider the embankment unsafe.  Never knew the water high enough to endanger it.  Several reports had said the bank was settling, but Mr Homes had never reported it unsafe.  Gitsham had similarly reported settling without saying it was unsafe.

John Peak, licensed victualler, said he had lived near the crossing for 15 years.  He had seen similar floods before the railway was constructed and since the culvert was in place, but had never seen the culvert obstructed.

John McKenzie, ganger, gave further corroborative evidence on walking the line and further details on the slip on his section of the line.

William Navin on being recalled said he had never received any instruction on walking the line after bad weather.

Constable Francis Bennett gave evidence of proceeding to the scene and of taking charge of the bodies when they had been extricated.

Christopher Provis, corporal of police at Clare arrived at the scene at about 5.30 p.m. and gave evidence of the removal of Wright’s body.

The coroner in summing up said he had no doubt that the accident was caused through the want of care of attention on the part of someone and a failure to follow the printed rules and regulations.  It appeared that Mr Mais was under the impression that they were being enforced.  It seemed clear that if the line had been walked on that morning the accident would have been avoided and three lives and a valuable amount of property would have been saved.  The question then was who had infringed the rules and by whose authority?  The jury had heard the evidence of Navin that Mr Branford had given written instructions to discontinue walking the line.  The evidence showed that the practice was discontinued and Mr Branford did not deny giving the order.

In the coroner’s view Mr Branford’s instructions were the primary cause of the accident.  The guard had given clear evidence and had used every caution and carried out his instructions to the letter.

His opinion was that Mr Branford’s instructions were the cause of the accident.  He could not compliment Mr Branford on his evidence; he had fenced questions whenever he could.

It was for the jury to say whether Branford had so acted as to lay himself open to the charge of manslaughter.  If they acquitted him of that charge, he thought they would be of the opinion he was greatly responsible for the terrible catastrophe which had occurred.

The jury retired for 40 minutes and then returned.

They found that the deaths were caused by the train falling into a chasm caused by the flood and that the breach of the line had not been observed by any officials of the line because the patrol of the line was ordered discontinued by direction of the Inspector of the Permanent Way, Mr Henry Branford, without authority or cognizance of the Manager of Railways, as head of his department; and that the action of Mr Branford in that respect is highly censurable, and is the direct cause of the accident.

The coroner also thanked Corporal Provis on behalf of the jury for the excellent way in which he had conducted proceedings and examined the witnesses.  The jury also expressed their commendations to the guard George Gitsham for his conduct during the accident.  His quickness of mind and prompt action not only saved his own life, but also a quantity of valuable merchandise.  His following adherence to the rules of the railways was deserving of very great praise.
