[Mr Virgo began his speech with the usual thank yous for the invitation and to the ladies providing the dinner.  He moved on to make the usual references to Burra’s past role as a mining centre which had saved SA’s economy in the mid 19th century.  He said the re-opened mine is expected to run for 15 to 20 years and to generate some $119-$120 million.  He then went on to consider the role of tourism.]
