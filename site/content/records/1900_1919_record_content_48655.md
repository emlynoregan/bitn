Ambulance Day

The enthusiasm for this cause saw four ambulances handed over to the military authorities.  One came from J.M. McBride, one from A.J. & P. McBride and two from money raised locally.  The handover took place in September in front of the South African War Memorial in Adelaide, the Governor making the presentation on our behalf.
