Archibald Thompson corroborated his wife’s version of supper, but said he had put his arm about his wife when Skinner came across and threw her off the footpath onto the road and put his foot on her chest saying, ‘I’ve got you.’  When she asked if he would allow her to get her hat, Skinner had replied ‘I’m damned if I will.’  He drew his baton and held it over his wife, saying ‘If you move I’ll drop you.’  Thompson said his wife did not throw herself down.
