1874 & 1875

1874 was a year of progress and prosperity in SA.  The year began with a rather scanty wheat harvest.  Despite that the exports for the year declined only a little; from £4,250,173 to £3,814,218.  Despite low taxation the revenue is flourishing.  The settlement of agricultural land and the occupancy of pastoral areas continue with encouraging rapidity.  Squatters are extending to the very heart of the continent.  In the last year some 450,000 acres have been added to the lands alienated from the crown.  Railway extension is underway, albeit all too slowly, due mainly to the piecemeal approach to this development.  This has also been hindered by a shortage of labour; a factor in many sectors of the economy.  The population has grown by about 7,000 in twelve months, to about 205,000.  Significant Acts of Parliament in 1874 included the University Act, schools have been improved, a step forward saw the abolition of Goyder’s Line of Rainfall and the management of main roads has been more localised.  Much remains to be done on reforming land law and financial reform.  Through the efforts of Warburton, Forrest, Gosse and Giles the unknown areas of the northwest have been almost eliminated.  The overland telegraph to Port Darwin has been overhauled and is in splendid working order and every month the benefits of this undertaking become more apparent.  Telegraph lines have been extended within SA.  Moves are afoot to extend lines to Eucla on the West Australian coast and Cape Borda [on Kangaroo Island].  The Northern Territory remains a problem.  Moves towards an Australian federation are very slow.  1875 begins with great prospects except that the mining sector is not as thriving as we would like.
