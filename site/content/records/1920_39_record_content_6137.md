Burra Town Council, Mayor’s Report 1921

This was delivered at the ratepayers’ meeting Tuesday last week.  About 50 ratepayers including three ladies were present.

The Season

The year was good for rain and a good harvest was expected until the arrival of the grasshoppers.  Now, at least for some the outcome is in doubt.  Wool prices dropped in the year, but have recovered somewhat and are more in keeping with tis true value again.

This year the offices of Town Clerk and Inspector were combined under Mr E.J. Davey and the change has proved beneficial.

Mr I.J. Warnes has donated enough pipes to drain the crossing at Gully’s Wharf, which was a much appreciated gift.

The town assessment last year was £9,847 and rates therefrom were £1,353.  This year the figures are £10,454 & £1,438 respectively.
