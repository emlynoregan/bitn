‘Ajax’ writes on ‘Our Monetary System’.  He puts the view that the depression is producing a mass of unemployed youths who are being kept fit by sport so that with three months intensive training they can be the finest soldiers in the world.  Later we will introduce compulsory military training because apart from soldiers we have absolutely no use for them.
