Weather.  January was the wettest on record with 179.6 mm or 7 inches of rain in a week.  Four days of heavy rain brought floods, but not havoc.  It began late on Saturday night or early Sunday morning and continued to Wednesday evening.  A dry spell on Thursday morning was followed by more rain Thursday afternoon and night and on Friday.  The creeks all flowed strongly.  The whole area of the stockyards and beyond turned into a lake of brown water.  Part of the Copperhouse Road Bridge gave way and became unsafe.  At Gully’s Wharf in Young Street the water came within a foot or so of the top. [Top of what?]  The water roared over the Pig and Whistle crossing, creating a foaming whirlpool.  Fencing was damaged along watercourses throughout the district.  Damage to culverts is extensive, with Springbank Road particularly herd hit.  The Burra Creek crossing at World’s End has also been badly damaged.  The flow down the creek from Springbank to the Bon accord was perhaps the greatest ever.  The total rainfall for January in Burra was 192.4 mm and for the year has reached 224.4 mm or 881 points.
