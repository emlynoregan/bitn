Railway Accident at Burra Station.

On Friday evening the Broken Hill Express was accidentally run onto the wrong line and into a rake of cattle trucks.  The sound of the collision was heard for two miles.  Luckily the driver applied the brakes promptly and the cattle train locomotive was not attached.  There were no serious injuries, though some passengers were bruised and one lady was cut on the head.  The engine passed halfway through a combination passenger and luggage van, smashed two cattle trucks and more or less damaged a score of others.  The roof of the van enclosed the engine up to the cabin and the smoke stack of the locomotive was lying some distance back along the line.  Some of the buffers on passenger carriages were also damaged.  It was fortunate that the cattle train was able to move somewhat and so absorb part of the force of the collision.  It seems the points were set right by one official and another, unaware of that changed them back.  The system in use is said to be absolutely out of date and considering the lineâ€™s traffic it is time a more modern one was in place.
