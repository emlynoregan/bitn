Election Meeting.  At the Burra Institute on Wednesday c. 500 attended a meeting with John Dunstan Jun. in the chair.

Dr Cockburn spoke first in favour of payment of members and a property tax.  The wealthy were opposed.  It would tax unused assets as much as used: jewellery and other idle wealth would be taxed.  He believed in decentralisation of education.  The Government proposed a capitation grant for students who passed the compulsory standard in private schools in return for inspection rights and an Arbor Day with trees supplied by the Government.

Rounsevell was against a property tax.  He favoured free trade in principle, but thought it unwise to alter the tariff at the present time.  Property tax would be extremely complex and costly and tend to discourage improvement and industry.  He was not in favour of payment of members personally, but would support it in Parliament if his electors so indicated.
