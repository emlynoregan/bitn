Burra Swimming Pool Committee has visited Mt Barker and Nuriootpa to inspect pools.  The former pool is most impressive: 100 ft x 30 ft and 3 ft deep for 40 ft before sloping to 9 ft.  There is also a wading pool.  Discussion at Nuriootpa taught the committee about purification and filtration and pool cleaning costs and drainage.  The conclusions to be drawn will be discussed at the next committee meeting on Thursday.
