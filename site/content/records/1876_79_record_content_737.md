Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter II

Burra has not been without its mistakes from the start.  It had a survey of four square miles without reservation of roads in any direction – a peculiarity it shared with the nobs’ mining property of Princess Royal.  The bush tracks through the town up to 1864 (I write from memory only) were an impassable bog, better imagined than described.  Previous to that year the Government, considering it necessary to remedy such a disgrace, sent up a surveyor to peg out a road preparatory to macadamising, although it was on private property.  The resident agent, when the work was about completed, displaced all the pegs.  The Government then passed an Act to carry out the work.  The result was a hard road from the Burra Hotel to the Government Post Office, though off it in any direction was bad travelling, especially for that short piece from it to the nice wooden bridge the inhabitants had erected over the creek.  This was so bad bushmen designated it Mud Street.  [Thames Street to Bridge Street.]

Time and money have repaired many of the bad places and the greatest permanent work of note has been the railway to within a mile of the town.  When the mine operations were suspended a few years ago the town’s condition was truly deplorable, which was not improved by the prevailing drought.  Since then Burra has shared in the benefits conferred by the Strangways Act, which allowed some of the land to be opened for agriculture.

Even so settlers could not have bought land and then the necessary farming equipment and seed wheat and then survived a two year wait for a return on their capital, had not the local bank advanced money to some tradesmen, enabling them in turn to extend credit to the struggling farmers.  This gave the fading town a start.  Local tradesmen who had capital derived from profits in palmy days also extended credit.  It was a trying time.  Many tradesmen later grew fearful of their exposure and reacted by seeking to recover by increasing their prices to compensate and limiting credit.  They then went too far and the farmers, as they paid off their credit debts, have turned to the railway and Adelaide suppliers as a cheaper option.  Fortunately the number of new farmers has compensated for the older ones turning to Adelaide.

I am reliably informed that a new farm of only 80 acres is likely to require capital of £500 and so necessitate most new farmers needing credit for four or more years.  Unless Burra traders reduce their charges to something like Adelaide prices, trade in Burra will decline.  When out of debt, the Baldina and Bright farmers may, in two or three years’ time, turn to Adelaide as earlier settlers have done.

Income from the extension of the railway to Hallett will also be ceasing by then, so it is time for local industries to be developing themselves as much as possible.

The lack of early road connections still hinders development.  Trade with the Hundred of Bright would be easier with a road along the creek through Princess Royal property.  The alternative route over Breakneck Hill is difficult and discourages trade from Bright.  Parliament has the power in the Land Clauses Consolidation Act to obtain the more direct and flatter route; otherwise the Bright farmers will travel south to Farrell’s Flat at a loss to Burra’s trade.
