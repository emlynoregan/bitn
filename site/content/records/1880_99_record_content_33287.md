Burra 22 Years Ago.

Elegant buildings and useful villas did not exist as all lands belonged to SAMA.  Payday was monthly and the trigger for horse-riding, hunting, wrestling and considerable blood flowed.  Shop accounts were settled.  Clothes were rather plain.  Roads and footpaths were in a bad condition.  Kooringa was a dust hole in summer and a bog hole in winter.  Streets were often ankle deep in mud.  Commercial St was often impassable due to floodwaters coursing down it.  The railway extended only to Kapunda.  People migrated to Moonta and Wallaroo.  Furniture on wagons was seen leaving each week.  But the coming of the railway opened up the country and farmers began to replace squatters and the old mine temporarily re-opened.  Saleyards were established: now the largest sheep market in the colony.  Since 1876 the Council has spent £11,000 beautifying the town, making roads and footpaths and planting trees and a school, Institute, library and hospital have been provided.  Churches and good accommodation is available and there are prospects of irrigation in the near future.
