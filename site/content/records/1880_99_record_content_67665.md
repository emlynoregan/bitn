Characteristics of the 1899 Paper.

Page 1.

There were the usual large advertisements: many from out-of-town.

Page 2.

Other advertisements, classifieds, public notices.  The news often starts here, but sometimes not till page three, or very nearly.  Editorials were few.

Page 3.

Most of the news was here, but it tended to be a fluctuating quantity.  The paper began the year with little padding, but the column ‘Something for Everybody’ was a column of jokes.  There was usually a serial story.

Local news mostly came in short paragraphs and was normally a fair coverage, but there are papers where it barely extends beyond three columns.
