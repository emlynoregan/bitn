Don Gobbett has launched his book Gluepot Remembered- from Sheep Paddock to Conservation Reserve.

Mr Gobbett grew up in the Riverland, studied in Adelaide and then taught Geography and History in SA before working as a teacher educator in Zimbabwe for eight years and then at UniSA from 1973-95.  In 1990 he researched village settlement along the Murray in the 1890s.  He was assistant ranger at Gluepot in 2001, which led to researching its history.  One of the longest connections with Gluepot is the Warnes family from 1934-63, when Reg Warnes and his son Les lived on nearby Woolgangi.  Le and his wife Nan were major contributors to the story.  The book includes development since 1997, when Birds of Australia took over the reserve.
