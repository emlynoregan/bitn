Papal Honour for Burra’s Parish Priest

The Most Rev. B. Gallagher DD, Bishop of Port Pirie, has received news from the Apostolic Delegation in Sydney that Pope Paul VI has created Patrick Valentine Hughes a domestic Prelate with the title of Monsignor.  Monsignor Hughes was born in Victoria and educated at Christian Brothers in Geelong.  He studied for the priesthood in Europe: in Ireland and Rome. He was ordained at St John Lateran Basilica in Rome in 1926.  He is also an Arts graduate of Melbourne University.  He has worked in the northern part of SA, notably at Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Peterborough, Carrieton and Renmark.  He has been at Burra for 15 years.  This is the first occasion when this parish has been tended by a Monsignor.
