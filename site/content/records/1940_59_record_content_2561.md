£200 was later sent to Lady Gowrie Special Appeal after another series of fund-raising events.  On 2 June we opened a special Ambulance Fund and we hope by the end of July to send £500 to headquarters for this purpose.  In 9 months we sent to headquarters £691-0-8 and purchased materials to the value of c. £400.  We have sent parcels away monthly (comprising c. 500 articles).
