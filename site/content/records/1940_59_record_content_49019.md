Burra Town Council favours superannuation for its employees, but the employees do not.  The Council will therefore keep it in mind for future employees, should they so desire.  The cost to Council would be about £75 p.a.  The premium is 7%, of which the Council would have to find 3½%.

Council will advise the Municipal Assoc. it approves in principal, but would not do anything at present due to financial constraints and because present employees are opposed.
