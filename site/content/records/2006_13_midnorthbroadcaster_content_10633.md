Burra’s Doctor Problems

The Ratepayers Action Group is calling for an independent inquiry into the removal of Dr Dharma Dissanayake’s attendance at emergencies at the Burra Hospital.  They understand that after a number of complaints a hearing was held and the privileges were withdrawn. The matter was discussed with Premier Rann when he visited on 29 May.  Dr Dharma has appealed the decision and an appeal hearing has been held, but the outcome is still not known.  An extension of time until August 23 has been granted.  In the meantime triage services are in place for people requiring medical assistance at Burra Hospital with arrangements for a transferral to Clare Hospital if necessary.  The group is calling for an independent inquiry should no satisfactory resolution result from the meeting of 23 August.
