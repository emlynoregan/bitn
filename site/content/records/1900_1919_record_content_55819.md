Burra Cheer-up Soc.

There was a welcome social on Monday for L-Cpl L. Harris & Pte C. Wahlert, but the latter could not attend.  It also served for Pte Work of Booborowie who left the district many years ago and enlisted from New Zealand.

It was decided to equip two beds for the Soldiers’ Hostel in Adelaide and that 100 Christmas boxes for boys at the front to be sent via the League of Loyal Women.

The Ladies’ band has had to turn down invitations to Adelaide and Eudunda for next Friday.
