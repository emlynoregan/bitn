Ratepayers’ Meeting.

P. Lane asked the Mayor if he voted for or against the Land Values Assessment Bill when he attended the Municipal Assoc. recently.  Mr West said he voted against it because he thought it not fair and equitable.  Many who were for it have now changed their minds.  The National Defence League thought nothing of it except it was an unjust measure.

Cr Rabbich said that he was sorry to say he had been led astray.  The Mayor on his return from the meeting had said he had supported the measure: now he says he voted against it.  [Rabbich was in favour if it.]

He said the water rates were now greater in value than the general rates.  Since the works had been returned to the Council control they had saved about £300 in rates.

Cr Watt spoke briefly as did Cr Parks.

Little seems to have been said by the three candidates (Watt, Rabbich and Killicoat) standing for the Mayoralty except an agreement on the need for frugality.

The Land Value Assessment Bill came in for much discussion, but this is not reported.

Cr Rabbich was for it and Cr Watt opposed.  Messrs Geake, Killicoat and W.C.L. West had not studied it enough to decide.

There was apparently some sort of altercation between Crs Hardy and Rabbich which produced ‘a somewhat laughable scene’, but the substance of the exchange is not reported.

Mr Sampson wanted to know if Mr Geake was a nominee of Lane & Co.  Mr Geake replied he was not a nominee for any particular party.

Notes by a ‘Taxpayer’ to the ratepayers’ meeting add only a little to the substance of the report, but perhaps reveal something of the characters of Mr John Sampson and Mr W. West.

‘Ex Cr Sampson’s remarks re the work done at Henderson’s Bridge for the protection of the vehicular traffic savoured too much of a carping criticism and a fault-finding spirit.’

‘His Worship the Mayor went unnecessarily out of his way and did not take the palm for good taste, when replying to a relevant question asked by Mr P. Lane; he attacked Mr Lane personally’ It was certainly a lapsus lingual on the part of the Mayor when he said that the National Defence League, to which he belonged, was against part XIX.  What has the NDL to do with the Mayor’s voting when representing the Municipality at a Municipal Association Meeting?
