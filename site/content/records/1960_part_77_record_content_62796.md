Bruce Stockman writes:

The new rate struck by the Council will give an income of $82,928 compared with $65,958 previously.  The reason for this 25% increase is said to be â€˜to maintain the present plant and staff operations.

What increased amount is to be spent on maintaining present plant; and why?

What increase in wages is anticipated?

What increase in salaries is expected?

When will Council publish the proposed budget for the coming year?
