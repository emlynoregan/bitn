Burra High School held its Break-up & Entertainment on 19 December in the Institute.  Dr Steele as Chairman of the High School Council presided.

The Headmaster said the school opened with an enrolment of 59: 24 girls and 35 boys and soon reached 60.  An additional teacher, Miss Batchelor, was appointed.  Average attendance was much better than previously at c. 52.  Miss Nield resigned to be replaced by Miss Parker as Domestic Arts teacher.  This week Miss Robinson has been transferred to Mt Barker to be replaced by Miss E.M. Jones.  Between March and the end of June there was great disturbance due to the rebuilding work.  Painting inside is due to begin on Friday.  Next year a woodwork centre will open.  The school fete in April raised nearly £80 towards much needed new equipment.  A shelter-shed will soon be erected.  On 5 September at the Combined High School Sports Burra gained the shield.  A trip to Clare on 13 December was the next sporting event.  The Girls’ tennis lost 9 sets to 7.  The cricket team lost by 10 wickets.

We note past scholars Clifford Flower, Gilbert Walker, Patty Pledge & Lillian Piggott are doing well at University.

There was a Chairman’s Address after Mr Haese’s report.

The Dux of School was Doreen Oborn.

Best Intermediate results for 1927 were by Philip L. Killicoat.

Best Leaving results 1927 came from Doreen Oborn.

The prize list is printed.  [The total report extends for c. 2 columns.]
