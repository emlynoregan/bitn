Burra Slag Extraction Co.

Thomas May, employed by the company, badly injured his right arm and hand when a dynamite cap he was handling exploded on Friday.  It is amazing no worse result ensued.

‘Teddy’ McCann, who had his foot torn off at the works has now left hospital and his comrades intend getting him a cork foot and when he is fit for employment a job will be found for him at the works.
