Booborowie. 15 September.  The petition calling for a district council also asks for the name of the place to be standardised to Booborowie rather than Booborowie, as that is closer to the native pronunciation.  The Aborigines are fast dying out and the meaning of local place names should be recorded while it is still possible; the ‘owie’ section means water.  ‘Boobor’ is large.  Some other names are:

Minlacowie, Terowie, Yarrowie, Yarcowie, Canowie and Bimbowrie – probably a corruption of Bimberowie.  ‘Can’ means small.

[Manning, Geoffrey H. 1990, Manning’s Place Names of South Australia, offers the following meanings:

Bimbowrie	pine tree water

Booborowie	round waterhole

Canowie	from kanyaowie – rock waterhole

Minlacowie	from either minala-kawi – two waters, or minla-kawi – fresh water well

Terowie	hidden waterhole

Yarrowie	[Now Appila] no origin cited

Yarcowie	flood or great waters]
