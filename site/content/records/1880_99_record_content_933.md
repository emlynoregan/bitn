Cost of Meat.  A correspondent complains again of the high cost of meat in Burra, but adds that bran and pollard are also overpriced and the local bread is of poor keeping quality and all too often of light weight.

A Letter also queries why O’Leary Bros [butchers] are allowed to keep pigs in the town with the great stench created.

The editor’s advice was that he should complain to the inspector and noted that the by-law did not allow pigs to be kept within 50’ of a street or dwelling.
