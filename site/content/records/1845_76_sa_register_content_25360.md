Inquest & Obituary.

An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel on 24 August by J.D. Cave.  Frederick Tiptaft’s body had been found in his bed the previous afternoon.

James Kearse, carpenter, of Teatree Gully, said he had been working on Friday 22nd in the carpenter’s shop at G. Gebhardt’s building at Hallett.  [Ian Auhl has added a pencilled note that this was actually Gebhardt’s ‘Wildotta’ at Mt Bryan, now known as ‘Mackerode’.]  When he went into make his tea at 5 p.m. he heard someone breathing heavily or  snoring in an adjoining bedroom and went to investigate.  He found the deceased apparently asleep.  Called Arthur Tuckey and asked what was wrong and was told Tiptaft had been drinking.  At 7.10 on the 23rd deceased was in the same state.  At 8 a.m. he and Tuckey washed the deceased’s face and tried to wake him.  He had not seen the deceased take any alcohol and deceased had worked on Friday and seemed in good health.  For several days he had been complaining of dysentery and passing blood.  Only thought he had been drinking because Tuckey had said he had been on the grog.  At 11 a.m. he seemed worse and at 12.30 p.m. Tuckey went to Wildotta for a horse to fetch a doctor, but deceased was dead before he returned.

Arthur Tuckey, a carpenter of North Adelaide said that on 22nd a trolley had come to remove some scaffolding and the driver, George Jordan, had some rum with him.  The witness, Tiptaft and Sinclair Moodie each had three drinks of the rum.  Deceased did not appear drunk when he went into the house.  Jordan left with the remaining rum at about 4.45 p.m.

Sinclair Moodie gave corroborative evidence and so did George Jordan, saying that he had had three or four drinks with two carpenters and the painter; the deceased.

Lance-Corporal William Smith of Redruth said he was informed of the death on 23rd, but having a sick horse to attend to, he informed the Kooringa police and they sent Dr Dashwood to investigate the death.  When he had got to the body later, Smith found the deceased had a letter addressed W. Tiptaft, a watch and key and nine pence.

Dashwood was not prepared to give a cause of death without an autopsy and the inquest was accordingly adjourned.  An hour later Dashwood reported that the deceased had died from hypertrophy of the liver and fatty degeneration of the heat, probably accelerated by intemperate habits.  He had taken insufficient food to support life.  The verdict was in accord with the doctor’s report.

[Frederick Tiptaft died 23 August 1873, Wildoto (sic) aged 39.]
