Burra Regional Art Gallery’s 2013 Portrait Competition attracted a diverse display of entrees in a wide range of styles this year.  The theme this year was ‘The Eyes have it’.  The winner in the alternative category was Ryan Evan’s ‘Cry Baby’, while in the traditional category first place went to Julie Morris with ‘Pam’s Place’.

Judges this year were Rob Kalleske and Rob Johnston.  The portrait exhibition was opened by Harry Sherwin.

Dr David Sprod opened a small exhibition in the S.T. Gill Room of works by his uncle the cartoonist George Sprod.  Some of the most interesting of the works were drawn during his time as a POW in Changi and on the Burma Railway.  [8 photos page 7]
