Waste Management will be a major cost as Goyder Council improves its processes.  The closure of landfill sites and extra travel distances for dumping could see rates double.  While landfill in low rainfall and isolated areas is very cost effective, the Council has been forced to close all landfill sites and meet the cost of capping them.  Waste will have to be transported to a site outside of the region at considerable cost.  The Solid Waste Levy will also increase.  Expressions of interest from private operators have now been sought.  The current annual cost to operate the regional waste collection scheme is in excess of $113,000 and this has meant the Council could minimise its costs to a recovery rate of $80 per household.  But with the need for higher capital expenditure of $210,000 in 2007-08 and a similar sum in 2008-09 along with changed management processes, a far greater contribution from ratepayers will be required.  Council is supported by Zero Waste and the EPA, but the funds available from Zero Waster to help Councils with infrastructure costs are inadequate.  Council thinks more of the Solid Waste Levy should go to Zero Waste for the next 3-5 years than to the EPA.
