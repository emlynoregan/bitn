Harrold Button writes about the recent Council Meeting report.  He says the main point of the Mayor’s was that a motion passed at a Board of Health Meeting cannot direct the Council to act.  If the Council has no jurisdiction over such matters why did the Mayor as Chairman of the Board accept the motion?  Also if this is the case how can the Board of Health appoint someone to represent the Town Council on the Burra Burra Hospital Board?

Burra Town Council, Monday

Cr Button raised the point mentioned above and suggested the Town Council appoint a representative to the Hospital Board as the Mayor had recently ruled that the Board of Health’s resolutions had no effect on the Council.  Cr Button said he feels he cannot sit on the Hospital Board, but also can’t resign, having never been elected.  The Mayor said he was wrong and out of order.  Cr Button said he could then not attend the Board meetings and can’t resign from a position to which he had never been appointed.

The Mayor said Cr Button would have to resign if that was his attitude.

Cr Button said he couldn’t, as under the Mayor’s own ruling he had no standing.
