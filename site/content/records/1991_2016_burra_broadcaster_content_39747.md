Burra Golf Club Centenary

Over the October long weekend the club celebrates the centenary of its affiliation with the SA Golf Association.  A golf club was first formed in Burra in 1899 and the Burra Record reported the links had been laid out over 1¾ miles from Brewery Flat around the old smelting works.  Presumably it would have started and finished near the current site of the Caravan Park.

In 1913 it was reported to have been re-formed at a meeting chaired by Dr Steele, who was elected President, a position he held until 1942, except for his period of service in WWI.  In 1934 it was decided to erect a clubhouse and to incorporate the club.  The ladies decided to form their own club.  In May 1934 the Town Council gave permission to erect a galvanised iron structure on the Burra Sports Syndicate Ground at Aberdeen, for an estimated cost of £60.

In 1938 a motion was passed thanking Elder Smith & Co. and Mr E. Ford for the use of property – presumably for use of land ‘across the road’ on which part of the course lay and which was private property until 1972.  In 1954 the course had 14 holes and it was then proposed to extend it to 18.  At the 1969 AGM it was moved that permission be sought to plant small trees between fairways, though in March 1970 planting was deferred, pending ascertaining the cost of watering.

In September 1972 Crafter Bros. were engaged to redesign the course for $500, the work being carried out by volunteers and the new course was opened on 29 April 1973.  In 1973 tree planting began in earnest – some trees were planted by primary school children as part of their Conservation Day activities.  In June 1973 a subcommittee investigated the design and cost of a new clubhouse, which was finally opened 28 September 1975.  The next major project was to convert the course from a winter scrapes course to an all year round greens course.  A proposal was submitted to the Burra Burra DC in 1997.  The Council agreed to provide a loan of $175,000 over ten years and a grant of $10,000 per year for five years to assist in establishment costs and initial loan repayments.  As a result of irrigating the course the trees have grown dramatically.

In 2014 Goyder Council was approached to upgrade and refurbish the clubhouse.  Council provided a grant of $25,000, with the total spend expected to be c. $30,000.  A verandah has been erected on the north side of the clubhouse, carpet, furniture and interior lights replaced and the building painted inside and out by voluntary labour.

St Mary’s Anglican Church will have a ‘Blessing of the Animals’ service on Sunday 12 October.
