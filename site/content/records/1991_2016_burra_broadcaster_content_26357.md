Open Gardens

Between 700 and 900 people took advantage of the open gardens at Princess Royal, Old Ashrose of Hallett and Old North Bungaree.  The Princess Royal Garden has been upgraded in recent years and is now looked after by Pauline and Terry Bevan from Burra for owner Simon Rowe, who said he was surprised by the amount of interest generated.  In Burra 14 gardens were open to the public and up to 60 people went on a walk through them.  Over $200 was donated to charity.
