Hallett Hall Supper Rooms

Through the generous gift of Mrs A.G. Owen-Smyth new supper rooms at Hallett Institute were opened on 11 June.  The large supper room is fully furnished with tubular steel tables and chairs and the kitchen is compact and fitted with modern facilities.  There is a large cream brick fireplace in the supper room above which is a bronze plaque indicating that the room was built as a tribute to Sir John Melrose of Ulooloo in recognition of his practical support over many years.  The design of the new rooms is by Glover and Pointer, architects and construction was by E.J. Affolter & Son.  Mrs Owen-Smyth declared the building open.
