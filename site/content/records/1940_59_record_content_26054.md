Second Bus Service for Burra

Messrs Freer & Scott advise that they held a Stand Licence at the Burra Railway Station.

[There followed some debate about legal niceties.]

Cr Kellaway moved that a licence be granted to Messrs Freer & Scott subject to the Licensing Officerâ€™s approval.  Cr Harvey seconded and it was carried.
