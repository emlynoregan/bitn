Burra Town Council

The Local Government Department will not assist the Council to put the stone crusher in order because it would not be economical either in terms of the cost of the machine of in extra wear and tear on the roads by getting all the stone from the one quarry.

There was a report on vandalism of trees by some young boys.

Various road and paving matters were approved.

Cr Kellock reported serious inaccuracies in the Farmers’ Union Weighbridge.  The problem he said was that the loads were weighed one half at a time and there was an incline onto the bridge.

The Town Clerk said he had tested the weighbridges and found them accurate in the past 12 months.

Cr Kellaway said it would cost £200 to £300 to put in a Corporation weighbridge and there would be a man to pay.  The charge for weighing is 6d a load.  The matter was deferred to next meeting.

Cr Riggs moved that a public meeting be called with the object of forming a committee with two members of the public, two members of the RSA and two members of Council to formulate, finance and finalise a scheme to enclose the Monument, guns and Rotunda in Market Square.  Carried.
