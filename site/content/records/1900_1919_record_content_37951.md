The Chief Secretary wrote re the Hospital Board.  The Board had 11 members and he had no power to admit more.  The only way to admit the Mayor would be to drop an existing member.  The Board had been asked to change its rules, but at present nothing had been done.

[The problem was that the previous Mayor, Mr McLaren, was still sitting on the Board, though correspondence in 1912 seemed to indicate that the Governor had appointed him for one year c. March 1912.  Mr McLaren took the view that he was appointed personally, not as Mayor, whereas the Council was of the opinion that he had been appointed as the Councilâ€™s representative and should therefore have resigned on leaving Council.  The fact that he had lost the election to Mr Crewes at the end of 1913 might have influenced his decision to stay on.]

Further correspondence with the Chief Secretary was initiated.
