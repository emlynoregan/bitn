Letter.  Barry Wright writes from his experience of managing a row of six B & B cottages in Burra, expressing some ideas about Paxton Square.  The advisory group could learn from the operation of community hotels at Renmark and Loxton.  Burra Golf Club got the community to guarantee a loan to upgrade their greens.  Paxton Square could do likewise.  Alternatively a resort company could be approached to lease the cottages.  They would have the expertise and the money to lift the profile of the cottages.  The Council has been unsuccessful for about 25 years.
