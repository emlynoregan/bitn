Ratepayers’ Meeting. About 60 assembled on Friday evening last to hear the views of candidates.  The Mayor took the chair and invited candidates for Mayor to speak.  No one came forward.  When candidates for councillors were called Messrs Sampson and Anderson responded.

Cr Sampson, candidate for East Ward and retiring East Ward Councillor, regretted the absence of mayoral candidates.  As they were about to lose Government subsidy they would have to enunciate a plan for more economy.  He had a plan last year to save £200 (Crs West & Ridgway objected.)  He would, if returned, go in for retrenchment.  They had officers who got £230 p.a. for 36 hours a month.  One man could do the work of Town Clerk, Inspector of Weights & Measures & of Nuisance.  (A voice - ‘Scavenger too.’)  No Decidedly not - combined with the Health inspector for £150.  The Town Clerk did his duties properly, but they did not get value for money.  Cr Sampson said last year Crs Ridgway & West took money from the Cemetery Fund, £10, when it was already in debt, and did not get more work done for it.

Cr Ridgway objected and said it was not true.

Cr Sampson said it was - the sexton did what he always had and yet £10 was added to the Inspector’s salary.  That £10 could be saved.  The work could be done for £130 instead of £230.

Cr Ridgway was shocked at Cr Sampson and did not know if he were not open to serious action for charging him with taking Corporation money.  It was a disgrace that such a charge be made at that meeting.

The Mayor explained that there was no charge of fraud.

Mr Geake said the meeting fully understood what Cr Sampson had said and Cr Ridgway was making needless difficulty.

W. Anderson, a candidate for West Ward, would also be for economy.

Mr Lane asked how they would handle the Waterworks accounts.

Mr Sampson they could be done by the Town Clerk and he be paid pro rata.

The Inspector’s work could be done in 3 days a week and they would get 50 offers to do so at £3 for what now cost £5.

Cr West wondered whether nuisances only occurred on 3 days a week.

The mayor did not give a report, as the requisition did not refer to the past.  He would do so at the annual meeting.

Mr Holder said there was no such thing as the annual meeting under the Act.

The Mayor said he supposed he would shortly call a meeting.

Mr Kitchen wondered if any Council worked on the lines proposed by Cr Sampson.

Cr Sampson thought about four, but couldn’t name them.

Cr West said that Cr Sampson was either under a great error or was wilfully false.  They had great difficulty last year, and had always found that Cr Sampson would try to get his own way by foul means if he could not by fair.

Mr Holder moved a vote of thanks to candidates and to the Mayor for presiding.

‘He was not altogether sorry that ratepayers had had such an opportunity of seeing the kind of wrangling that had taken place at nearly every meeting of the Council during the past year.’
