Sister E. Mosey RRC, Sister J. Sinclair Wood, Nurse S. Hatherly, Nurse L. McWaters, Sgt H. Swift, Sgt J. Hatherly, Sgt H. Hatherly, Cpl Hartley Harris, Cpl Percy Herbert, Lieut. V. Riggs, H. Riggs, Pte W. Bowen, F. West, R. Jones &  – Ridgway.

The Ladies’ band attended and led the group in a march from the Cheer-up Room with Pte Will Bowen as standard bearer in front.  He had only arrived home the previous day.  The Burra School Band and scholars followed.

Mr Crewes made a welcoming speech and Mr Foote, on behalf of the Burra Sporting and Athletic Club presented each of the nurses with a wallet containing a £5 note.  In the last month £150 had been paid out in this way and the presentations to the men will be made later.  Afternoon tea followed at the Cheer-up Hall, provided by the League of Loyal Women.
