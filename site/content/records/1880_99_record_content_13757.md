Silverton Mines.  On the last trip down the mail met more than 150 swagmen tramping the road to the Barrier and also dozens of horses, buggies and carts.

The Government has found the mail tender too expensive and will not fund the second mail in a week at this time.

We hear that Hill & Co. intend to put a number of coaches from the Strathalbyn line on the Terowie-Silverton route and this may reduce the price.
