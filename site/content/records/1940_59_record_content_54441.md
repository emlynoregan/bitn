Obituary/Accident

Sydney Clarence Wilmott of Burra was killed early this morning when the tractor he was driving collided with a train from Terowie at the Bon Accord crossing.  He was driving a crawler tractor going north when the train struck it at about 6.45 a.m.  The impact turned the tractor around and it continued on past the E & WS property and was finally stopped on the next corner by Mr Suck, a lodger at the Bon Accord Hotel.  Mr Wilmott was flung off and thrown against the engine, sustaining fatal head injuries.  It is thought he may have been listening to the tractor engine, which had just been overhauled, and so failed to hear the approaching train.  The train was a special for the Easter period.  It is reported that this is the first death at the crossing.  Mr Wilmott was employed by W.H. Kakoschke and leaves a widow and six young children.  [Sydney Clarence Willmott, born 26 April 1915 Kooringa.]
