A Flying Saucer was reportedly seen on Saturday evening at about 8.50 by Messrs P.J. Byrne & R.A. Bevan.  The object had a white light at each end and left a trail of vapour.  It came from the northeast over the Fire Station as seen from Bevan’s shop and disappeared over Brewery Hill.  Many people across the state reported a similar object at about that time.
