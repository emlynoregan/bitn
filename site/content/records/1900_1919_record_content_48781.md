Theatregraph Pictures will soon show in Burra war films featuring The Big Push or The Battle of the Somme.  Lloyd George says: ‘If the exhibition of these films does not stop the war, god help civilisation.’  These are the first official films to be taken under fire.

The writer says: ‘The film does not lacerate the feelings.  On the contrary, it uplifts, it searches the soul.’
