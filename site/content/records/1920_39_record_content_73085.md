Wakefield By-Election

A meeting at the Institute was addressed by R.L. Butler (a former Premier), Senator P.A. McBride & Mr A.D. McDonald MP, with Mayor S. Kellaway in the chair.

Senator McBride spoke on defence – nations of the east were the main threat – the navy had to be built up – Germany had three pocket battleships which had to be countered.  The voluntary militia was to be increased.  He favoured Universal Training.  Munitions works were being expanded.  Planes had to be obtained from the USA and a factory established – he hoped for 200 planes by the end of 1939.

Mr Butler endorsed the words of the senator – Australia needed a staff of highly trained officers and 70,000 reservists.  He favoured a new international agreement.  The low price of primary products was depressing the economy and should be controlled by stabilising the price of wheat.  He favoured setting a home consumption price. He was in favour of the flour tax.

Secondary industries were also needed and he looked forward to the water supply reaching Whyalla and subsequent steel works there.  He was alarmed by the influx of southern European migrants ‘and they were not the best type either’.

A.D. McDonald said he admired Mr Butler and had been surprised when he had resigned as Premier to enter federal politics.  He admired his courage and endorsed him as a fearless fighter for SA.
