New Life for Scroop Park, Burra North1

Over the years the tennis courts at Burra North and their associated amenities block have fallen into disuse.  Council is currently removing the amenities block and taking up the court surface,2 before asking the community for ideas on future use.

[1 The name Scroop Park was an informal one. At least from the establishment of the playground there in 1923 this area was known as Lowe Park.  It was named after Mr Charles Lowe 1854-1925.  Until 1921 he lived at Redruth where he had a bakery near to the park.  He was also a member of the Town Council, representing North Ward from December 1907 to November 1913.  The name Scroop Park certainly derived from much later. In March 1972 the Aberdeen Tennis Club erected gate pillars at the entrance to the Aberdeen Tennis Courts in appreciation of Mr & Mrs Scroopâ€™s 30 years of service (1940-70) as joint secretary-treasurers of the club and for the many hours spent working in this sports area.  (Syd. Scroop 1904-83 and Florrie Scroop nee Hirschausen 1905-91) Thirty odd years later the bronze plaques were stolen, but the pillars were left there when they were enclosed in the Off Leash Dog Park in late 2014.

2The surfaces of five courts were still there in 2016.]
