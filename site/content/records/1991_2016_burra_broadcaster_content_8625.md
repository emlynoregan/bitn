Ratepayers’ Association

A meeting of more than 50 concerned citizens last Tuesday resulted in the formation of a Ratepayers’ Association in the Burra Council District.

Mr Alan Hall said a major reason for its formation was the lack of response from the Council after the last public meeting at the Old Courthouse.  This had called for Council to furnish a business plan for their different areas of activity.  He was also critical of the Broadcaster for what he said was highly selective reporting of Council minutes.
