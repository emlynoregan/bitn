North-Eastern Hundreds.

Some 12 years ago, when land selection was in full swing and farmers could be denied nothing, large areas were resumed from pastoralists, including areas that never yielded an adequate return for the labour expended.  Those areas included the hundreds commencing near the South Rhine [Marne since 1918] on the Murray almost due east of Adelaide and running in a 20-mile band north to Morgan, then northwest along the line of the range and then west of north for 250 miles.  As one goes north the width of the area to the east of the ranges that gets sufficient rain for cropping diminishes.  This was noted by Goyder who observed its effect on the quantity of annual grasses compared with bushes, which predominated in the drier regions.  The eastern belts are noted for the intensity and length of their summer and the coldness and dryness of winter, when most frequently southeast winds prevail.  Surprise is often expressed at the Government surveying such lands for farming when they are so eminently suitable for pastoralism, but at the time had they not done so they would have lost office and their successors would have done so.  Very serious, if not irreparable damage was done to pastoral interests as a consequence.
