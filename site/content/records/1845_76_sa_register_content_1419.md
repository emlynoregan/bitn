SA Mining Association

Today we publish the Second Annual Report of the SA Mining Association Directors. It relates principally to the Burra Burra Mines and their eighteen months of operation from 29 September 1845 to 31 March 1847.  The statements issued are devoid of any attempt at emblazonment, but a little calculation will convince anyone that those who bought scrip at £100 were either well advised or pretty good judges of what they were about.  The production had been running at an average 126 tons per week, but March 1847 averaged nearly 300 tons per week and April looks like being as good.  The Directors have indicated their intention to make an early dividend of at least 50% and they are able to do that from the profits on the first 1.757 tons of ore sold.  It would seem clear that the 9,841 tons already produced will bring in a profit of £34,502 – more than equal to 280% of the subscribed capital.  The Directors assure us that 913 tons lately shipped and the bulk of the stock on hand will be worth upwards of £30 per ton on the British Market.  If this is achieved the clear profit will be nothing short of £82,576.  This will constitute a profit of £88,736 for sixteen months’ operation, or a rate of £66,552 per annum.

Last April we predicted the probable profits for the first year would be £64,528-4-2.

The importance of this to the colony can be gauged from the expenditure on wages, timber, machinery, horses, tools, implements and stores amounting to £32,943-7-4.

Cartage of ores has cost £21,406-10-3 and other expenses in the colony £5,354-12-9.

In addition there are of course the costs of freights paid to British shipping.
