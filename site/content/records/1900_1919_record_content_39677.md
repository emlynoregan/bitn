Burra’s Fire Bug.  A little time ago Mr D. Pizzo’s house in Kangaroo St was damaged when the paling roof under the iron caught fire from soot.  It was being repaired by Mr John Pearce and the family was living in an adjacent house.  On Sunday morning an attempt was made to burn down the house under repair.  Kerosene was used to ignite a door and fire was set in two other places.  Footprints were found, but M-C Queale’s covering of them ‘fortunately [sic] did not make them rain-proof with the result that a shower washed them out.’  [Presumably should read ‘unfortunately!]
