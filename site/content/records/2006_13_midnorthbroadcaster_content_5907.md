Burra Pony Club has been very busy organising events since Australia was declared cleared from the Equine Flu epidemic.  The club recently competed in the Northern Zone Elimination Finals at Pt Augusta.  They sent eight riders and ten horses.  Jennifer Thompson finished second in the junior horse and rider and Burra took out the A Grade Games Trophy, meaning the team will go to the state championships at Wudinna in October.

Coralie Field has been made a life member for her tireless work with the Burra Pony Club.
