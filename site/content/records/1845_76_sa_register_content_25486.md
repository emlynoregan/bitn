24 October 1873, page 5

The Season.  There is an extensive report on northern area crops.

Kooringa 22 October: There has been some light rain, but hot winds have countered the effect and rain is much needed.  Crops, particularly those late sown, are backward.  Grasshoppers are rumoured to have appeared in various places.

Mt Bryan East.  The last month has been very dry, with a few showers last Thursday and Friday.  Grasshoppers are innumerable in some patches.  Calm days alternate with near hurricane conditions.
