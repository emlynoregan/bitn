Burra Daycare has had a busy year with nine permanent volunteers and four part-time and a team of six bus drivers.  Mavis Brooks was farewelled at an afternoon tea after twelve years of service.

From 30 September the Burra Daycare will be known as Burra Leisure Activity Group.  LAG is held three days a week at Burra Community Activities Centre.  Activities include cards, table games, indoor bowls, crafts, ceramics, outings, special days and themes.

Burra Hospital Auxiliary held its AGM on 29 August.  Two Jason recliner chairs and an ear thermometer were purchased.  It was decided to donate $4,000 towards a patient lifting machine (cost $8,475).

The J150 Irish New Year Ball made a profit of $1,045.
