M.A. Radford writes in support of Mr Pearse, at least in part.  His support is not so much on account of non-attendance, as he thought people were living beyond their means, and racing is a luxury that could well be curtailed.  But he agrees that the psychology of the Burra Public is a mystery.  If Mr Pearse can explain their absence from almost every other function he might have an explanation for the races.  Mr Radford does not think the wowser is to blame.  If the regular church goers turned up at the races it would hardly increase the numbers!  People will give money for specific causes, but they wonâ€™t turn up for football, bowls, literary societies, WEA classes, special lectures, gymnasium clubs etc.  There is often a little initial enthusiasm and then stagnation.
