The Editor attaches a comment to say that had the ratepayers wished to avoid the Â£800 debt referred to, they could have done so.  Notice of intention to borrow was given in the Burra Record 21 & 28 September 1948.  Had the ratepayers objected a petition could have been lodged calling for a poll, which could have prevented the Council from borrowing the money.  At present the Council is in the best financial position for twenty years.  Since having taken over the pictures, the overdraft has been reduced and the assets have increased.
