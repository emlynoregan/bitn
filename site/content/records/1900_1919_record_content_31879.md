Burra Institute, 25-27 April, Martin Dobrilla will give a demonstration of 58 hours of club swinging to set up a state record.  He is the world champion club swinger.  Last year at Laura he made a world record of 107 hours 38 minutes.  To assist him two dances have been organised for Thursday & Friday nights.  [Why wouldnâ€™t this also have been a state record?]
