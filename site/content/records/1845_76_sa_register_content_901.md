South Australian Mining Association (SAMA)

We have considerable gratification from perusing the half-yearly report of SAMA as it appears today in our advertising columns.  The report presents important and undeniable facts, but is of necessity deficient in financial returns, of which the English advices are still in abeyance.

On 18 April we ventured to print from an unofficial source the expectation that the probable first half-year profit would be £64,528-4-2.

Up to the publication of the Directors’ Report those gentlemen had not received advice in respect of any of the cargoes sent to England.

The new calculations by ‘our correspondent’ are attached.  [A new series of figures is printed.]

In them he presumes the profit for the first year will be £85,515-16-6.

Since the number of shares is 2,464 the profit will be £34-14-0 per share (if all the figures above can be realised).

It has not infrequently been asserted that the mine’s productivity is unlikely to be continued at increased depths and that the prospects of a southward extension were not cheering.  But operations in September have shown increased production, the quality of ore is maintained if not superior and extensions have continued at depth and in length.

Also the Princess Royal operations have met with increased success, which gives assurance that further discoveries will realise the chain of mineral wealth that has been theoretically described as continuous throughout the lands of the Princess Royal Mining Company and those of the SAMA.

The Princess Royal operations are encouraging.

The company at Burra Burra has raised 1,100 tons in the month, which at £16 per ton on the mine (a price perhaps ridiculously low) gives £17,600 as the proceeds for one month’s work, or £211,200 per annum, being £31,200 in advance of proceeds for the business year last expired, which have confidently been stated at £180,000.

There is no reason to doubt the mine is to go on yielding in astonishing profusion.

The Directors who (except for the Chairman Mr Charles Beck) are not named in the report are: Messrs Charles Beck (Chairman), Stocks (Resident Director), Bunce, Graham, Featherstone, Peacock, Paxton, W. Allen and Waterhouse.
