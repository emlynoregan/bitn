Ronald John Shipard

Married with a family of two â€“ both of whom are in business in Burra.  As a family we are committed to the survival of Burra.  I have been associated with the district for 32 years, having farmed at Hanson and at Nyngan in NSW in that time.  Now retired.  Worked with various committees, including the Tennis Club, Agricultural Bureau, Show Society, School Council, the Anglican Parish Council and other church activities; first elected to Council in November 1989 and re-elected in 1990.  Am committed to keeping a strong DC in place.
