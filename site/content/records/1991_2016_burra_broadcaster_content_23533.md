Paul & Michelle Cousins have taken delivery of an optical fibre diameter analysing machine, which will be at the core of their Cousins Merino Services.  The new machine has advanced wool testing capabilities.  It measures wool staples from tip to base, providing critical information for breeding programs, optimising flock management and preparing lines of wool for sale.  It can aid in genetic selection and can improve wool classing and marketing.  [The article goes into further detail: becoming much like a paid advertisement for the service.]
