Mt Bryan Old Methodist Church celebrated its diamond jubilee on 26 & 27 September and major celebrations attracted old adherents from near and far, creating a veritable ‘Back to Mt Bryan’.  The long report of c. 1½ columns is full of names of those attending and the event is well described, but unlike many such reports this one did not inspire an account of the history of the building or organisation.
