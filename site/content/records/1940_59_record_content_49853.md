Burra-Redruth Methodist Church trustees are spending £1,000 on renovations in honour of the church’s centenary.  The Ladies’ Guild has accumulated over £500 towards the total and other donations at present total about £250.  Work includes painting the building inside and out, floor surfacing and polishing; installation of fluorescent lighting, new carpets and alter furnishings.  Later an inside porch will be added.  New stained glass windows are planned to honour pioneers and the Woollacott and Riggs families.  Celebrations begin 6 May.
