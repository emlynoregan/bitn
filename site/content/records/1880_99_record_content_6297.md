Mr White’s closure of his school and his need for complete rest follow a driving accident during the Christmas Holidays.  He has physically recovered, but his mental powers require complete rest.  He intends to leave Burra.  He has been an auditor for the Corporation and for District Councils and has had a strong connection with St Mary’s Church.  He received a gold watch in 1876 for 10 years service as a lay reader.  He is a Past Master of the Freemason Lodge and sits on the Institute Committee.  In the past he has often had 20-30 miners at his evening school.  When he closed last Wednesday there were 50 children present.
