Cr Collins complained that the George St crossing (the ‘Pig & Whistle’) had been estimated at £100 and had cost £190.

Cr Kellaway said there had been no estimate, but West Ward had promised £50 understanding that to be one third of the likely cost.

Cr Collins insisted an estimate of £100 had been stated and he was not complaining of the quality, but of the error in estimate.

Cr Ewins could recall no estimate and Cr Harris thought £125 or £130 had been mentioned.
