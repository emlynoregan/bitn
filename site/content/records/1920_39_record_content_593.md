Burra Cheer-up Soc.

After a lapse of several weeks the usual trip was made to the station to greet Pte Lindsay Lafsky on 3 February.  J. Drew made the speech and the Ladies Band played Home Sweet Home and the National Anthem.

On 6 February Pte Eric Vivian was greeted: the Ladies Band and E.W. Crewes doing the honours.

Pte C. Pens arrived on Wednesday last, but the society was not informed in time for a ceremony.

A presentation was made to Miss Nell Pearce, one of the band members, on the eve of her marriage.
