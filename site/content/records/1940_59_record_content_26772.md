Summing up the case for a betting shop Mr Lemon said illegal betting was rife in Burra and if legal betting was an evil then illegal betting was a greater evil, breaking not only a moral law but a state law.  A betting shop was the only remedy for that evil.  Betting shops did not appear to have a great effect on sports and no undue influence on young people.  Their effect on businesses was hard to judge because economic conditions were so different from the period before the war.
