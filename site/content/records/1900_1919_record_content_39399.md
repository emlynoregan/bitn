Burra Football Association met in J. Allen’s rooms on 15 October for its final meeting for the year.  The Association is in credit £16-19-7.  The end of the season had been disturbed by the outbreak of war.  One semi-final had been played before the Light Horse had been called up.  Hallett did not play its semi-final with Terowie and was refusing to pay the umpire’s fees.  [C.A. Fuss was present as a delegate.]
