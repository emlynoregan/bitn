Mongolata Mine

Mr Kevin Wallis, manager, said plans were afoot to open the mine to tours within 18 months.  The mine is on private land and was originally operated in the 1930s.  Before it closed in 1954 the Mongolata Crusher had processed about 7,000 tons yielding 45 grams of gold per tonne.  The gold battery, which was erected in 1933, will be restored using a battery from Tarcoola. There are old newspaper reports of a large lode.  It is reported to be 7-10 metres wide at the water table with the assay yielding 150 grams per tonne, with visible gold in the samples.  Kevin said there are plans to open up the ore body in the near future.  The main mine was ‘Byles Mine’ and it goes 250 metres into the hill and was the largest producer on the field.  Within it you can see the gold vault and ore chutes.  The large three-compartment shaft is complete with a wooden headframe.  Tourists will find an interesting mining history using traditional methods of recovering gold.  Crushed ore passes over mercury plates where the gold forms an amalgam.  This is then retorted to leave a gold sponge, which can be smelted to a gold bar.  Any gold escaping this process is treated with cyanide and extracted from the solution using carbon.
