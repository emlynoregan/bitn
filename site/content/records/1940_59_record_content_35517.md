The Mothers’ and Babies’ Health Association has replied saying that they believed the present service at the Burra Hospital would be better than could be offered by a health train that could call only once every five weeks.  At the end of the year they hoped to have Car 3 in operation and then a visit to Burra could be made every fortnight.
