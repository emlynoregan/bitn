Porter’s Lagoon.  Monday last was a terrible day for sports with a very hot northwest wind.  The waves prevented all but two of the swimming events and they were swum with difficulty.  Despite this the attendance, though down, was good.  The lake is presently rather shallow with a maximum of 5-6ft.  Sideshows did good trade.  The running track was praised.  Results are printed.  The cool change towards evening helped make the dance afterwards in the Farrell’s Flat Hall a success.
