Letter.  Mary Press writes to express disappointment that Mr Gunn MP is to stand for re-election, having first been elected in 1970.  She finds it hard to believe that a 1970s politician is best suited to represent our interests.  This is especially true as he resides in Adelaide and Streaky Bay and as Speaker is even more isolated from his electorate.
