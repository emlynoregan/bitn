Mr Mozart who is installing gas at the Institute has placed a street lamp at Henderson’s corner for a month’s trial.  It was lit for the first time on Saturday evening and gave a steady light, but the old ‘best’ light [kerosene] illuminated the area better, having been placed much higher.  There is the need for one or two more lamps in town whether they are to be acetylene or other.
