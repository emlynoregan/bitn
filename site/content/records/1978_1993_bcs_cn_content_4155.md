Burra Burra DC

The Local Government Assistance Fund has provided a grant of $21,000 [Corrected in the following issue to $2,000] to purchase equipment for a wood workshop at the old Court House Hotel Co-operative Ltd.  It is proposed initially to engage three unemployed people to make articles from the Burra Mine timber for sale to tourists and the community.  It is hoped the skills they gain will aid them in obtaining employment on a permanent basis and their place could then be taken by other unemployed.

Paxton Square Cottages Housing Committee held its first meeting in the Civic Centre on Thursday 14 May.  [Those present are listed.]

The brief submitted to the architect was discussed and minor alterations were made thereto.  The committee inspected the cottages to view the restoration work required.  The architect will present sketch plans of proposed works, costings etc. in approximately three monthsâ€™ time.
