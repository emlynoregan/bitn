Burra Primary School Committee.  Chairman R.A. Moreland’s Report

Discussion has resulted in the Public Buildings Department being about to install a fire hydrant.  Sports day on the War Memorial Oval on 28 April was a great success.  Many parents attended Arbor Day.  Burra Burra DC has helped in filling and levelling the creek area of the oval.  It was decided to crop the old garden area to produce hay for sale, but although the ground was sown by Mr K. Gare and germinated well, the rains failed and the crop was lost.  Mr Wardle purchased the paddock at the rear of the school, impeding access to Burra North.  He agreed to allow access along the side of Mrs Tattersall’s residence and the Public Buildings Department is preparing to provide an access path there.  The Town Council has tidied up and screened the section of footpath to Mrs Tattersall’s and provided a pipe for the drain.  A school crossing has been made in front of the Town Hall.  We are negotiating with the Education Department for future accommodation to be supplied in Burra.  Mr & Mrs Auhl were farewelled.  In 1967 Mrs Villis resigned and her position was taken by Miss Satchell.  Miss Satchell was later transferred and Mrs Carpenter filled the position.  Mrs Said was also transferred.  This year there are two new teachers and a new Headmistress.  The Town Council advises that the land in front of the school has been transferred to the Education Department.
