Opening of the Gawler Town Railway [Editorial]

The railway to Gawler was opened yesterday when an excursion train of some 800 to 900 persons.  Thousands of persons also crowded the stations at either end of the journey and other stationed themselves along the route to see the longest train yet moved by steam in SA.  The 100 ton train was moved by a single engine, though the morning’s start was given by a second engine pushing behind.  The carriages were decorated and many of them were new.

[The writer was concerned that tickets were not checked at either Adelaide or Gawler and he trusted that no ticket holders were excluded by the crush of those on the train.  This, he says, must never happen again.]

The Gawler terminus was gaily decorated and omnibuses and other vehicles carried people into the town, about a half a mile* distant from the station.  It was a very successful and happy excursion.

[*The reporter’s account places the station a mile from the town.]
