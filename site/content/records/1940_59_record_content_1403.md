Burra Mine.

A.L. Read, Secretary to the Premier wrote to A.D. McDonald MP giving him references to geological reports on the mine.  Nothing is known of copper values as the mine closed before there was a Department of Mines, or a Government Geologist.  No official plan of the drill holes put down in 1899 has been preserved.  An unofficial report says Morphett’s Shaft pumps had to handle 84,000 gallons of water per hour.  The Burra water supply comes from a 300’ Bon Accord shaft and if the Burra Mine is unwatered it seems certain this would be drained at once.  Water from Morphett’s could then be used, probably being purified before going to the mains.  The quality of the deeper water in the mine is unknown.  The Government is aware of the possible problems of draining the mine as far as the town’s water supply is concerned.
