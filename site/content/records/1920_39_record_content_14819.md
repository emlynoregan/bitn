Fishing around Burra is one thing lacking.  If only fish could be got to live in the creek at Princess Royal or World’s End Gorge or in Porter’s Lagoon.  Mullet was tried at the Lagoon, but failed.  W.D. Bruce, Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game, has told Mr Crewes he would have to visit before advising.  Mr Crewes thinks perch might flourish.
