Obituary.  Alfred Samuel Walker died at the residence of Mrs P. Nolan 179 Franklin Street, Adelaide, on 1 September aged 63.  He was an old resident of this district and married Amelia, second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs F. Bernhardt of Burra North.  He attended Burra School.

[The next section is somewhat garbled.  It says that at 11 he was employed as ‘Jimmy the Tar Boy’ by W.P. Barker of Baldina Station, ‘which is now owned by Mr John R. Barker for 30 years’.  Presumably the 30 years refers to his period of employment.]  Later he worked at Mr Mosey’s Fingerpost Station for 3 years.  He is survived by one daughter Mrs Bert Morgan of Burra North, and by three sons: Ken (AIF), Ron (SAR) and Roy (AMF).  There are two grandchildren.  [Born 2 July 1880, Kooringa.]
