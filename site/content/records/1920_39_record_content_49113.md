Dr D. McD. Steele, Chairman of the High School Council contributes a letter somewhat over 1 column long about the imposition of High School fees.  He outlines the widespread opposition to this move by the Government.  The Minister responded to all protests that he intended the system to be introduced for first term 1934 – parents could apply for exemption from all or part of the fee.  The objections to this were spelled out to him by the various protests.  Dr Steele appeals to all parents to send their children to High School.  One suggestion to save on costs was to close all country high schools except for those at Pt Pirie, Peterborough and Mt Gambier.  He warns that if numbers fall the Government might be tempted to implement this recommendation also.  Those seeking exemption should see the headmaster on the first day of term.  A reduction of – I think – 25% is made for a second child.  The fee applied only to those students over the age of 14.
