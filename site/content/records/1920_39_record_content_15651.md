The Overseer said there was no complaint about blasting at the hospital quarry with sick people quite near.  It was resolved that blasting be not allowed between 8.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. except in school holidays.

[This discussion about the school quarry obviously means the quarry had been proceeded with although the Council, as reported in the Record of 11 March had resolved it not proceed.  Presumably the report there is incorrect and it was the amendment and not the motion that was carried.
