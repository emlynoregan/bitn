A.W. Farley writes about voting for the Apoinga DC.  The problem he describes concerns the number of votes that Koonoona Estate is entitled to.  Koonoona originally exercised 2 votes, then 3 and last year it is alleged they had 5.  It is a legal question of tenants, part-owners and a public company or body corporate and requires clarification and a proper legal resolution.
