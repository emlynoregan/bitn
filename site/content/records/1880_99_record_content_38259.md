The huge cargoes and the number of draught oxen and drays etc. seen en route had prepared us to expect much, but when we went underground ‘we saw enough to convince us we had commenced the examination of a mine incomparably richer and more productive than any of the kind we had ever seen in the United Kingdom.  The present workings consist of 29 shafts or winzes, the deepest being 144’, at which depth a lode of very rich ore has recently been cut.  These amount in all to 1,850’ and there are 70 galleries or levels with a total length of 9,292’.  7,900 tons of ore has been raised in the last 12 months and another month will make this figure 10,000 tons.  It is valued at over £23-16-0 a ton and even allowing £18-16-0 a ton for carriage [check this] the value of the ore is at least £150,000.  The mine is undoubtedly equal to produce 300 tons of ore per week, so future returns will be immense.  For the economy of SA the impact can be seen in 13 months the payment for carriage must have exceeded £10,000, and wages £20,000.  British and Colonial freights must be £15,000.
