Paxton Square

Mr Howard Murton has prepared a 46 page report outlining a $350,000 plan for restoring and upgrading the Paxton Square cottages.

The cottages date from 1849 and represent the earliest mining company housing scheme in Australia.  The plan incorporates suggestions for upgrading the 18 cottages located along bridge Terrace and Paxton Terrace for low tariff, family group holiday accommodation, 11 cottages along Kingston Street are proposed as medium tariff motel units with high standard facilities.  Elsewhere in the report the restoration of the Bible Christian chapel on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Kingston Street suggests it could be used as a small conference centre with a reception counter and possibly as an intimate restaurant.  Various suggestions are made for upgrading the open area within the square as an informal recreation area.  Various funding options are suggested.
