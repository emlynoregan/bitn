Burra Mine.  The machinery is gradually being brought into use.  Some initial difficulties were experienced in operating the incline due to inexperience, but now it is running evenly and regularly.  The waste is being formed into an embankment adjoining the incline and at the other end of the embankment is a dressing tower where the ore being dressed falls perhaps 40 ft.  This part is not yet fully operational.
