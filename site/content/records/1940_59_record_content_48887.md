Bowls.  Clare Red 102 defeated Burra Gold 97

Burra Green 121 defeated Saddleworth Blue 61.

Cricket. Buffs had an outright win on Saturday.

Buffs 180 & 4 for 28 defeated Burra 166 & 3 for 108 declared.

[With Buffs totalling 208 and Burra 274, surely this could only be a win on first innings to Buffs, rather than an outright win.]
