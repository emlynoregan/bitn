Burra Rangeland Action Group recently held its AGM, which was well attended by landowners and members from Department of the Environment & Natural Resources and Animal Pest & Weed Control.  The group is particularly interested in the ongoing successful program of fox baiting and programs for weed control and feral goat management.  There are growing numbers of the protected Hairy Nosed Wombat causing concern in some areas.
