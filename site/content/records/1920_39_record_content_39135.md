Mongolata Goldfield Visitors

On the eve of 27 August Dr Keith Ward Director of Mines in SA and H.W. Gepp Commonwealth Consultant on Development arrived in Burra and were met by the Mayor and Town Clerk.  They visited the Institute where they inspected a plan of Morphett’s Shaft and pictures of the Burra Mine.  They were also surprised at the bound collection of the Register from 1852 to 1876 and other records of the Mining Co.  These are very important, as the Mines Dept. holds no official records of the Burra Mine according to Dr Ward.  They were also handed a copy of Frank Treloar’s Looking Back and examined the mineral displays.  On Saturday morning they visited the old mine and jinker at the Mine Store and were given a polished piece of malachite by A.P. Harris.

Last Friday the field was visited by Dr Ward (Government Geologist), Mr H.W. Gepp (Commonwealth Consultant on Development), local MPs Messrs McHugh, Critchley & George, the Member for Barossa Mr Edwards, for East Torrens Mr McArthur, for Pt Pirie Mr Fitzgerald and for Newcastle Mr Harvey.  Their visit was extensive:

To the mine of Fred Lewis & Harold Wall where there is a fine face of ironstone carrying gold.

To Fairchild’s.

To J. Kellaway’s.

To Hogan & Salter’s where gold was washed out in front of them.

To Tom Byrnes’.

To Byles’ Claim

To Flaherty, Bevan & Morgan’s

Then to the top of ‘Windy Point’ to inspect Fred Lewis’s Claim.

To Terry’s Claim.

To James’s Claim.

To Rampton’s Claim

Four miles on to the claim of McCullum, Moore & others.

All along the way Mr Gepp & Dr Ward took copious notes, gave advice and often descended in buckets and scrambled through workings.  They ended with a cup of tea in Mr & Mrs McCullum’s tent at the most northerly point on the field.
