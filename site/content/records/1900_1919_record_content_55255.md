Burra Town Council.

Christie & Gardner have agreed to stand by their scheme and guarantee the Council against loss for two years as long as they are appointed consultant engineers.  They would appoint the engineers in charge of the plant and the Council would follow their directions concerning the working of the plant.

The Railway Commissioner needs more details before agreeing to use electricity.

The Hydraulic Engineer would need to be convinced that electricity was cheaper before going over to its use.

Further advice was given by Clutterbuck Bros. against small cheap plants, which they said had always failed.

After discussion the Mayor said something had to be done: either adoption of the scheme or it had to be turned down.

Cr Radford was against paying wartime inflated prices.

Mr Crewes thought it would be at least seven years before normal times returned.

Cr McBride wanted it put to the ratepayers.  As far as he could see there would be 20 streetlights at a cost of £6,000 and some convenience to consumers.  There would be interest and depreciation and operating costs of £1,400 per year and therefore a considerable loss.

The Mayor said that wrote off the plant in ten years: not a fair estimate.

The Mayor was for getting a decision from the ratepayers.

Cr Radford would resign if they (the ratepayers) decided to go on with the scheme.

Cr McBride would try to make a success if it if the ratepayers wanted it.  [But he was clearly opposed personally.]  He moved for a ratepayers’ meeting.  Carried.

The Saturday night train will run through to Broken Hill from the introduction of the winter timetable.

[Cr Greenwood for East Ward wanted a hole filled in Kuchenmeister’s Creek – is that the creek running past Kuchenmeister’s slaughterhouse to the cemetery?]

The issue of Mr McLaren’s appointment to the Hospital Board was raised by Cr Killicoat.  The Town Clerk said that in 1912 the Chief Secretary had been asked that ‘His Worship the Mayor, Mr John McLaren, be appointed a member of the Board’.  The Chief Secretary in reply wrote that ‘His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to appoint John McLaren, Esq., Mayor of Burra to be a member of the Board for that year’.

Cr McBride said McLaren was Mayor, but had been personally appointed.

Cr Killicoat asked why the Council had intervened and nominated a candidate if not to get a representative on the Board: they did not write when other vacancies occurred.

Mr Crewes said it had at the time been distinctly understood that it was ‘The Mayor’ who was appointed.

Cr McBride dissented and the matter dropped.
