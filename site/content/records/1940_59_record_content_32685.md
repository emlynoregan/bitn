Burra Town Council

Permission will be sought from the Under-Treasurer for the transfer of the Â£400 swimming pool money to the Victoria Park project due to the impossibility of building a swimming pool now.

Cr Marston moved with respect to the Centenary money that a move in conjunction with the above be made in the Supreme Court for its transfer.
