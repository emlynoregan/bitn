The Karkulto Mine.  The persistence of the SA Mining Association Directors in working this mine is likely to be rewarded.  Captain Roach in his report of 8 September says a splendid lode has been found in the 25 fathom level going north from the diagonal shaft.  Samples of red oxide obtained have shown 30% copper.  In a subsequent report the Captain continues to speak favourably.  A large sum of money has been spent on the mine; not less than ________.  [The sum is unclear, being printed as £30,00 , but the report of the company printed in the Register 18 October 1860, page 2 gives the figure as £31,407 so the above estimate must have been £30,000.] We are glad it may now be reckoned among the prosperous mines in the colony.
