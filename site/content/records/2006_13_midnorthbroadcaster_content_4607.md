Burra Creek will get a management plan and the community is being invited to contribute ideas to Hemisphere Designs who are the consultants given the job. The group is looking at landscape design, recreational planning, vegetational assessment, and stormwater re-use along with cultural and heritage values.  As a by-product of the plan, tourism should also benefit.
