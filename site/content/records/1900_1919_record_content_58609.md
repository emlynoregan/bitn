W. Field.  They rushed from here to assist when the fire was on A.D. McDonald’s property, but the blaze came swiftly on.  The Misses Therese and Marjorie Field quickly saddled horses and mustered all their stock on the fallow and gave Mr Duell on ‘Koonoowarra’ the alarm.  By then the fire was on their property.  W. Field galloped back, but Stan Field and Mr E. Carter had to run to ‘Monavea’.  They tried to save a load of hay, but it burnt and even the woodheap was burnt.  Mr Field’s haystack was a record size and was destroyed.  The Misses Field several times had to beat out flames that caught their hair or clothes and W. Field fell over a burning wagon, cutting his face and fracturing his jaw.  His losses are less than others as his wheat was all at Burra Station and his implements and large sheds were saved.  The fire scorched the house, burning one verandah post.
