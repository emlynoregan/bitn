Mrs Frank Spencer and family left Burra at the end of December to live in Whyalla where Mr Spencer has been conducting his business for some time.  Mr F. Spencer had long been associated with many matters associated with the welfare of the town and especially as a donor of sports trophies.  Mrs Spencer has been running the business here since her husband left for Whyalla.  Mrs Spencer was given a farewell by friends at the CWA Rest Room on Thursday 26 December in the form of a bridge evening and supper.  A presentation was made of a handsome handbag.  Mrs Spencer left with the two girls, Frances and Tasma and son Seth.  Her elder son Peter has been in business in Whyalla for some months.
