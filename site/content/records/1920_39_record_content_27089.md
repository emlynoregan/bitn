Sir John Melrose

Mr John Melrose has been made a Knight Bachelor in the Commonwealth Honours.  He was born at Rosebank SA on 12 January 1860 and educated at Prince Alfred College.   He got experience for a year in a mercantile office before going to Franklin Harbour to assist in the management of Wangaraleedini Station until 1883.  Early in 1884 he went to Ulooloo Station to manage it for his father and on the latter’s death he bought the station from the trustees.  He later acquired, with the late Mr H. Dutton, the North Booborowie Estate and its flocks.  He ahs built up a splendid stud and spent the greater part of his life at Ulooloo.  In July last year he gave £10,000 to the Waite Institute.  Those who know him acclaim his honesty of purpose and kindly disposition.  When he lost his eyesight he continued to direct his enterprises.  Among his other benefactions is the Maternity Wing of the Burra Hospital to which he gave £1,600.  He has long been associated with the Hallett DC and is a member of the Burra Hospital Board.
