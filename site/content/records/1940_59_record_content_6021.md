The Burra Institute

A special meeting of subscribers to the Burra Institute was held on 29 May and it was found impossible to form a committee to carry on the management of the Institute.  Previously the Trustees had indicated their intention of resigning on 30 June.  This state of affairs is due to the fact that for some time the committee has found it practically impossible to meet the heavy liabilities due to the heavy debt and the consequent large sum to be found annually in interest payments.

F.L. Worth as president of the last committee outlined the difficulties under which the Institute was labouring.  For some time the committee had found it difficult to meet the £160 annual interest bill on the £3,100 mortgage held by the State Bank.  The bank had refused either to write off some of the debt or to reduce the interest rate. Last January the committee found it impossible to carry on any longer.  Apart from the interest burden, the other costs were salaries, upkeep of the building and the maintenance of the library.  Neither the public nor the subscribers had taken much interest or offered much assistance.  Under Section 75 of the Act the business was being carried on by the Trustees, but they would refuse to function after the 30 June.  In the previous week Mr Douglas of the State Bank had been in Burra and the position was put to him.  The Bank seemed still to be uncompromising.  Under Section 73 the Trustees were entitled to resign and if they did, after 30 June there would be no one running the Institute.  The Mortgagee would then have to foreclose.  There were two ways open.  Things could be let slide and see what the bank would do.  The other was to form a committee and try to carry on.  A move to get the Corporation to take over the Institute was supported by a meeting of ratepayers, but a subsequent poll voted otherwise.

Mr Bowles said at the meeting referred to the Mayor had asked the bank if it would accept £2,500 for the mortgage from the Corporation.  His Worship has thought he could raise that amount.  He was not aware that this had been officially put to the Council and neither had he heard the bank’s response.  He was in favour of letting things go and seeing what the bank would do.

Mr Worth said there were only 150 subscribers.  Income had fallen off because of a lack of functions other than patriotic ones, and they were entitled to a reduction of one third in hire fees.
