Burra Merino Studs.  A short article is reprinted from the Burra Centenary Souvenir of 1945.  Another extract from the same source describes Burra’s annual off-shears sales.

Cousin Jack’s of Burra now boasts the largest turned wood display in SA.  Cousin Jack’s opened on 15 December 1985.  [A photo of resident artist and proprietor Gary Donaldson with a selection of his work is accompanied by a brief article.]
