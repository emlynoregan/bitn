Mr Binks-Williams writes a letter citing one he received recently from Harold Foote concerning the late Joe Lloyd and how much Mr Lloyd helped the bowling club.  He was always willing to do voluntary work – nailing hundreds of palings on the new fence and carrying ‘tons’ of cement – and of the garden he made and kept bright with flowers – and, of course, about his tournament wins.  Binks concludes by saying how much the same could be said of Harold Foote with respect to work around the bowling club.
