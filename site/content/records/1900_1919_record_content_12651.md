24 December

Alex Cobb was fined 5/- or 14 hrs for being drunk in Market Square on the night of 23 December.

Alex Cobb was fined £1 or 1 month for using indecent language.

Alex Cobb was fined £5 or 2 months for assaulting M-C Grosser.

Alex Cobb was charged with being idle and disorderly.  C.C. Heinrich of the Burra Hotel gave evidence that Cobb had hung around deterring other customers from the hotel and had not left when asked to.  Mrs Heinrich said he had threatened to smash up everything in the house.  Heinrich admitted that Cobb had spent money in the hotel and that he had changed a number of pound notes for Cobb.  Cobb thought Heinrich’s complaint was a bit much when he had spent over £40 at the hotel.  Though he had only 1/6 on him when arrested, he now had £3 that had arrived from Melbourne the day before.  The case was eventually dismissed.
