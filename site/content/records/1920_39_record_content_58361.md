Mongolata Goldfield

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM Co. report for the fortnight to 1 November.

The Main Shaft has been sunk to 109 ft and timbered to 80 ft.  Began crosscutting at 108 ft to intercept the spur exposed in the Main Shaft at 86 ft.  The crosscut is expected to be about 15-20 ft.

Open Cut: work here has been temporarily stopped with 500 tons ready for the battery, which has started crushing.  A large part of this trial crushing is overburden.

The battery is presently operating two shifts.
