The Royal Exchange Hotel has had a makeover and has emerged as the first Irish Bar in the Mid North and Clare Valley Region.  It is operated by Adam Nicholls and James Reilly.  Guinness is available on tap.  With the death of Peter Reilly, James’ uncle, it has been decided to rename the front bar Reilly’s Bar in his memory.  The hotel serves meals in its large dining room and in summer will operate the outdoor beer garden at the rear of the building.
