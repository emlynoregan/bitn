Obituary.  John Pearce aged 85 died at his residence Leighton House, Kooringa, on 7 February.  He was born at Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire 22 June 1840 and migrated with his parents Mr & Mrs James Pearce when aged 6 on the Marion, arriving at Pt Adelaide in February 1848.  [These figures do not add up.]  They came directly to Kooringa.  On leaving school he became a builder and carpenter, like his father, working actively into his 70s and controlling the business until about 80.  He received much assistance from five of his sons.  He built the first house in Terowie and in Yarcowie.  In the district his work is seen in many buildings such as the Burra Institute and Post Office.  He was a good organist and played for the Kooringa Wesleyan Church till c. 1900 when his daughter the late Miss Alice Pearce took over and when her health failed Miss Trix Pearce took over.  He was also a good shot and runner.  In 1870 he married Miss E.J. Symons of Kooringa who died in 1924.  11 of 14 children survive: The Misses Cill [Priscilla], Gertrude, Laura & Beatrice E. (Trix), Mesdames P. Milner (Dulwich) & A.S. Dearlove (Ketchowla), J. Edgar Pearce (Kooringa), Alfred E. Pearce (Fullarton), Norman W.R. Pearce (Toorak Gardens), Clement W. Pearce (Kooringa) & Oswald C. Pearce (Unley).  There are 17 grandchildren.
