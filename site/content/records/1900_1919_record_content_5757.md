The Unemployment Meeting in Market Square on Saturday night was presided over by the Mayor.  Rev. Murphy moved: ‘That this meeting wishes to express its sincere regret upon the suffering among working men and their families in this district on account of lack of employment, and is of the opinion that the matter should be placed before the Government with a view of something being done immediately to relieve the distress.’

Mr Hardy moved: ‘That a deputation be appointed from this meeting to wait upon the Mayor and Council at their meeting on Monday night with a view of inducing the Council to ley the cause of the unemployed of Burra before the Government with a request that some public works be started immediately to relieve the distress throughout the town and district.  [Page 2 reports that both motions were passed unanimously, though this is not said in the page 3 report.]
