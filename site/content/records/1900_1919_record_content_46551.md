Mr Harcus thought a reply sent to the doctorsâ€™ letter might bring them to a more reasonable state of mind.

Mr Crewes suggested three members of the Board interview the Medical Officers.

Mr Warnes: Crawl to the doctors!

Mr Crewes: No.  Matters were critical and they had to think of the patients.  He moved an amendment that Mr McBride and Mr Hawkes wait on the doctors and discuss the question.

Mr Warnes then suggested it all be put to the Chief Secretary for guidance.

Both the motion and the amendment were lost.

Mr Warnes suggestion about the Chief Secretary was then carried.
