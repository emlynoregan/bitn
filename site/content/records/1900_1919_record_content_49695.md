The Recruiting Meeting, Wednesday.  A further report with in excess of 2 columns of detail.

[The incentives now being offered surely indicate that getting volunteers was growing more difficult.]

‘If two or three friends enlisted and desired to remain together they would be guaranteed one tent and would not be parted.’  If a lad a distance out desired to enlist they would go and get him and fill out papers, arrange the medical and pay him 10/- for the day.  He could also have six months leave without pay, which would count as active service.  Volunteers could choose which section of the army they entered.  For the Commonwealth the requirements were for 3,375 a week and enlistments were 1,368.  Men from WA and Victoria had to make up for the SA quota.

Speakers were Lt Robinson, recruiting officer for the Wakefield District, Hon. E. Lucas, Mr Anstey and Mr W. Hutley.
