Richard Hugh Bell Kearns (57) was born in Adelaide, but lived for a number of years in Burra.  He is a step-son of the late Mr Jack Kellaway, a former Burra resident. Mr Kearns later moved to Broken Hill.  In the New Year’s Honours List he was awarded an MBE.  Mr Kearns is a Fellow of the Australian Society of Accountants and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries.  He joined the accountancy staff of the North Mine in 1938 and has been Chief Accountant for the past nine years.  In World War II he spent 5½ years in the RAAF and saw service in the Solomon Islands, narrowly escaping with a small party when it was over-run by the Japanese in 1942.  He has had a long involvement in community affairs in Broken Hill.  He is currently deputy chairman of the District Hospital Board and Hon. Secretary of the Broken Hill Legacy Group, Chairman of the Mines Dental Clinic, past Chairman of Broken Hill Branch of the Australian Society of Accountants and President of the local History Society.  He has served on the High School Council, in the Parents & Friends’ Association, the ABC Concert Committee, the Mine Employees Pension Fund, Workmen’s Compensation Joint Committee and the War Veterans’ Home.  He is married with three children, one of whom has recently graduated s a Bachelor of Economics and another is attending Flinders University.

[He was born in 1914 and his father died in 1918.  His mother married John Kellaway in 1925 and he was in Burra from then (and probably earlier) and attended Burra Primary School, gaining his QC there in 1927.  After school he worked for Drew & Crewes and in 1937 transferred to the office of M.W. Bednall, solicitor.  In December 1938 he joined the office staff of North Broken Hill Mine and enlisted in the RAAF in 1940.  Mr & Mrs Kellaway retired to Croydon in 1941.  His mother died 1950 and step-father in 1969.]
