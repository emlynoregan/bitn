Letter.  Francis Walling writes of the importance of the Burra Charter.  The charter was revised in 2013, with small, but significant changes.  ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) has launched seven Practice Notes that are designed to explain how the Burra Charter principles and processes can be applied in practice.  The documents are available at www.ICOMOS.org/australia.
