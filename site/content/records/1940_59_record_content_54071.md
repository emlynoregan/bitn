‘Onlooker’ writes concerning the late Ben Hill.

Before WWI ‘Spider’ Hill, as he was known, was a good enough footballer to be picked for the Association team when Kooringa had five big Kellaway brothers and Aberdeen a hard-hitting team with only the rovers weighing in at anything near the ten stone mark.  The Ramblers (mainly Kooringa shop assistants) also had some good men who failed to keep ‘Spider’ quiet.  His claim to be the first Burraite to drive a car could well be correct because Jack Sangster and Albert Gebhardt had SA registration numbers 27 & 28 between them.
