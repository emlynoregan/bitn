Burra Town Council, 18 June

It was resolved to place a small swing bridge across the creek at the end of Young St.  The cost is not to exceed Â£75.

Various minor works were approved.

The Mayor said he favoured a new assessment.  Costs had risen 100%, so the old rates and assessment had to be changed.  Cr Kellaway said a new assessment would be fairer.  The last assessment was seven years ago.  Discussion was postponed.
