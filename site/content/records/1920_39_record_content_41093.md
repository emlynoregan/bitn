When the club was formed in response to The Advertiser Learn to Swim Campaign P.A. & A.J. McBride gave permission for the mine pool to be used as the only suitable spot in Burra.  As the time was late in the season attention concentrated on making the approaches safe and grading and fencing one end of the pool to make it safe for beginners.  Working bees did a lot of pick and shovel work and were helped by boys from the High School under Mr E.A. Haese and senior Primary School boys under Mr Tuck.  200-300 people came to the opening on Saturday.  The pool is one of Burraâ€™s beauty spots.  There are many pepper trees growing on ledges and in crevices.  The weather was perfect and it was in fact the only hot day in February.
