The School Bus.  Last week we said the bus was not running because the operator wanted 10/- a day more.  In fact he wanted the same as last year and the Department offered 10/- a day less.  Even at last yearâ€™s rates it did not pay the operator to continue, but he was willing to go on.  The Education Department is not satisfied with the conditions of travel and the contract has been extended for this year on the condition parents subsidise the contractor 10/- a day.  Something will have to be done to see that the conditions do not continue next year.
