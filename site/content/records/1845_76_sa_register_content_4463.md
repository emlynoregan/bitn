27 March.

Thomas Miller appeared to substantiate his right to a bullock claimed by Albert Meurant.  It appeared that about a year ago Meurant bought the bullock and soon after lost it.  A few days ago he saw the bullock in Millerâ€™s team.  Miller proved he bought the bullock from J.F. Angas at Flaxman Valley at about the time Meurant lost it.  His Worship ordered the bullock be returned to Meurant.
