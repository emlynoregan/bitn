Burra Town Council, 3 September

It was resolved to send the Town Hall piano to Mr Boehm in Adelaide to be repaired for £14.

It was decided to ascertain the cost of installing flood lighting in Market Square, from the Electric Supply Co.

[An interesting insight into attitudes and ideas of the day is revealed in a complaint by Cr Bevan over people leaving the pictures just before the interval, while the gazettes were being screened – to the annoyance of those wishing to view same.

Cr Bevan: perhaps a clause could be inserted into the agreement with Burra Talkies to prevent their leaving.  Or perhaps the proprietor could screen the gazettes immediately after interval.

The Mayor said those leaving were showing bad manners and perhaps the police could take some action in the matter.

Cr Kellaway thought those leaving could be prevented from returning until after the interval.

It was resolved to write to the proprietor requesting him to rectify the matter.]

Sgt E.R. Davey had written with another request that the Council write to apply through Manpower for his release.  It was resolved that a letter on the subject be sent to the authorities and a copy be sent to Mr E.A. Smith MHR for the district.

Cr Bevan moved that an advertisement be placed calling for applications for the Town Hall [cottage].  He believed it should be occupied by the caretaker and that the duties of the caretaker should include care of the hall’s surroundings.  A special meeting to discuss this issue is to be called.

It was resolved to paint the Rotunda for the Centenary Celebrations.  The front of the Town Hall will also be painted and the entrance gates at Victoria Park will be painted black and the pillars, white.
