Burra Town Council, 5 January.

The Mayor (W. West) reported that the local option poll had resulted in the call for Sunday closing of hotels to be carried out.

Cr Watt asked how much the case against Bagot, Shakes & Lewis had cost.  The Mayor said the two cases had cost £23-8-6.

Cr Sampson moved the account lie on the table to be gone through by a committee.  He thought the ex-Mayor had made a contract with the solicitors in reference to the matter, and if not he had failed to carry out his instructions.  2nd Cr Rabbich and carried.

The Mayor, Cr Sampson and Cr Rabbich will look into the matter.

Cr Rabbich asked if the obstruction had been removed.  The mayor said he did not think so.  The Inspector said he could never catch Mr Lewis in to serve the notice.  Mr Lockyer had promised to remove the obstruction in his yard.  He had not given them written notice.

G. & J. Downer of Adelaide, (solicitors) write to the Council on behalf of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis accusing the Council of being guilty by virtue of the crossing at the brewery and the wall on the Recreation Ground, of obstructing the channel of the creek and they ask that these obstructions be removed to prevent a continuance of damage to their clients.  They threaten renewed legal action if Council fails to oblige.

The Mayor said if the owners of the property were to do what was required of them they would only be doing their duty and a notice ought to be served at once requesting the obstruction be removed.

Cr Sampson thought the firm should be served with the notice and was surprised it had not been.  Cr Rabbich said the same and it was resolved the matter be attended to at once.

Cr Rabbich wanted to know why water had been cut off at the oval on Boxing Day.  The Engineer will be consulted.

Rates for 1891:	General	1/-

Health	3½d

Park Lands	3d

Water to be 	3/- per 1,000 gallons (down from 5/-)

Water over rate allowance 2/6 per 1,000 gallons

Cr Watt asked about a chimney at the Chinaman’s house in Market Square.

Waterworks Committee recommends that water be laid on to the Public School from the main in Kingston St so that the property at the front of Paxton Square and the Brewery would be assessed.

Cr Sampson wanted to know who was employing the Engineer during the repairs to the well.  He felt the Government should be paying him.

The Chairman of the committee said the Government had been written to about it, but so far had not replied.

Cr Watt asked who had told the Engineer to work at the repairs.  No one could say.

Cr O’Leary thought if Cr Sampson had been doing his duty at the time we wouldn’t be asking such questions now.

Cr Sampson replied that he had called attention to things being done by the Engineer without authority on several occasions.

Cr O’Leary said Cr Sampson knew the well was in a state of collapse and the Engineer had to work, or the repairs would never be done.

The Mayor asked that personal feeling be restrained and asked Cr Rabbich to sit down when he rose to speak.

Cr Rabbich tried to move a motion, but was denied.

He apparently moved it anyway, as the paper reports a motion of his that the Government be written to asking to allow the amount of the Engineer’s wages during his time on repairs.

Cr O’Leary moved an amendment that the Engineer be paid as usual by the Council.  It was pointed out that if the Government placed it on the Capital Account the ratepayers would be paying for it forever.

Amendment lost and motion carried after Crs Sampson and O’Leary had indulged in a further series of exchanges.

It was also resolved that the town’s main be flushed.
