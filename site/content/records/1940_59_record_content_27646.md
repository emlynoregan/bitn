Burra Showgrounds

The Burra Show has not been well patronised by stud sheep breeders.  The sheep yards at the showground are in a poor state from misuse during the war years and are almost beyond repair.  Covered yards could be erected at a cost of £300.  At present many of Burra’s sheep are sent to Naracoorte for the stud sheep sales there.  If they are bought by northern buyers they lose a lot of condition from the long journey south and then back again.  If the ram is not sold the owner must bear the cost of travel in both directions.  The first Royal Adelaide Show for some years will be held in 1947 and many sheep from this district can be expected there.  The Burra Show could become one of the finest in the Commonwealth for sheep.
