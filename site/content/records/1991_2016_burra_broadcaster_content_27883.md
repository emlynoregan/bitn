BRTBA held its AGM recently and President Sue Ryan reported on successful events like Jailhouse Rock, Jazz in the Monster Mine and the Antique Fair Weekend as being significant in the economy of Burra and the region.  BRTBA used the system of sub-committees to focus the effort for particular events.  She paid tribute to the members and supporters who gave their time and effort to make these events successful.  The membership base of BRTBA needed to be widened she said.

During the year a survey was completed showing the impact of tourism in the economy of Burra and the region.

A ‘Welcome Pack’ has been prepared to hand to new businesses in the area.

New members included:

Ross & Sandy Sims of the Miner’s Couch

Di Shepherd from Glasgow House

Chris Halls at Chris’s Kitchen

Nicki Bernhardt at Polly’s Tearooms

David [Merrill] & Tracy [Starr] at the Kooringa Hotel

Guest speaker for the evening was Kerry Spackman, manager of Clare Valley Tourism Marketing.  She spoke of her role and the establishment of a regional visitor information centre.  The preferred site for this is near the entrance to the Clare Caravan Park.  This would not affect the Burra Visitor Information Centre and they would not be seeking funds from the Goyder Council area.  Some people mentioned that their best marketing tool had been the magazine Burra and Beyond, but it was almost out of print.  Kerry said that Clare Valley Marketing had no funds to reprint it and it was not encouraging Goyder Council to do so either.  It was a similar product to the Clare Valley Secrets publication which had a print run of 80,000 this year.  Local operators said they had experienced difficulty getting copies – the Burra Visitor Centre originally got only 50 a month, but now that had been increased to 200.  Kerry suggested there could be a series of brochures, perhaps with the general title Burra and the East.
