Burra High School.  Mr E.C. Allen MP asked the Minister of education for information concerning the new High School site and development in Burra.  A new site was purchased about three years ago, but the Public Works Committee recently visited Burra and was unhappy about the site.  Hon. Hugh Hudson said in reply that no decision had yet been made.  Following a visit to Burra and consultation there, it had been agreed that acquiring additional land in the immediate proximity to the Primary School would allow both schools to be redeveloped on the existing site and this would offer advantages in the sharing of facilities.  The representative bodies of the schools and the town endorsed this alternative plan.  Public Building Department has been asked to prepare a sit plan showing future land requirements and the relationship of buildings to recreational grounds etc.  This will involve lad acquisition and redesigned plans and inevitably delay the building program.  Those involved accepted this because of the long term advantage.  The program will proceed as rapidly as possible.
