Burra Unemployment Aid Committee AGM was held 18 May.  The work of the committee began in late 1930 when efforts to raise funds produced £78-16-3.  Expenses were £10-18-6.  At the opening of the year being reviewed the balance was £63-8-4 and proceeds from interest and the shell dance etc. brought it to £77-1-11.  In the year aid was given to 40 persons.  Goods were bought at a discount of 15% so the firms concerned effectively contributed £6-15-0.  Help in the form of clothing has also been given to over 100 cases.  Mrs Day’s ‘Trix Pearce Knitting Circle’ has supplied about 60 items.  Much of the work was done by the late secretary S.R. Oborn.  The present credit balance is £30-17-9.  A new committee was elected with T.H. Woollacott as Chairman and Rev. J.S.W. Coles as secretary.  There are presently many calls for warm clothes and bedding.
