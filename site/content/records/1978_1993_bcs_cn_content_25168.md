Redbanks Reserve

The off-road reserve was closed officially by the Department of Environment and Land Management on 29 January 1993 for probably six months, pending negotiations on the allocation of the land.

Adelaide Chemical Co. will hold an open day on 7 February 2.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.

There will be escorted tours from the visitorsâ€™ car park.  (No children under 16.)
