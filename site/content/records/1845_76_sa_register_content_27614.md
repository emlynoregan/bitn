Booborowie, 19 April

Baldry people, after enjoying the benefits of having a post office, are now lamenting its loss.

The office was incautiously named Gum Creek.  This annoyed those who had lived on the creek for 20 years and got their letters at Kooringa, but could not now know where they might be sent.

The delays and timing of the Blinman mail are also causes for complaint.

Young farmers here have either gone or are going to invest in a square mile block in the Hundred of Willowie.
