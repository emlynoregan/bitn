Mules from Montevideo

The shipment of mules by the Malacca on account of the Patent Copper Company has reached Port Wakefield; of the 180 shipped, so many died in the boisterous conditions of the passage, that only 70 were landed.  In South America mules have been found to be of great service as beasts of burden.
