Court.

A long report deals with a claim from John McDonald against Timothy Sexton for £10 for [use of] his horse and £5 for unlawful detention of it.  Both are of Farrell Flat and the report is more for its entertainment value than otherwise.  McDonald was such a difficult and contrary character that his solicitor Mr Winnall sought to withdraw from the case part way through.  Eventually he was non-suited.
