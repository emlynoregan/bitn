Hallett Railway. The present Government has shifted the Hallett Railway Station half a mile out of Hallett. The new arrangements would allow a private developer to survey a new town within an eighth of a mile, but the Government town with the P.O. will be almost a mile away. A deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works, Mr G.G. Hawker asked it to be placed where originally advised. Hawker said the original site subjected to flooding, but he thought the best solution would be to erect a temporary platform with the final station location to be decided when the line is finally extended to the north as is likely to be sanctioned by the new parliament. This meant that work on the permanent station would be stopped. The deputation was thus satisfied.
