On Thursday 19 August we welcomed home Trooper Ford who is recovering from a kick from a horse.  He had four or five days on Gallipoli before giving in to the injury.

Ptes Ryan, Frusher and Gillett from Broken Hill are visiting.  All were wounded in the initial landing at the Dardanelles.  They have been entertained by the society.

Pte Bruce, who was to have been home on Saturday is in hospital with measles.

Trooper Ford was welcomed home at a public meeting at the Institute on Thursday evening.  Mr Crewes presented him with a wristwatch.  He had landed at Gallipoli on 25 May.
