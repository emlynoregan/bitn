Letter.  ‘Nuff Sed’ writes complaining that Burra Football Clubs need to respect their patrons more by being punctual.  For years Burra teams have been notably unpunctual and last week’s game, which was scheduled to start at 3 p.m. did not begin until about 3.45 p.m.  They will lose patronage if this continues.
