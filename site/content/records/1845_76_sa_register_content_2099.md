Bench of Magistrates.  Monday 13 March.

General Publicans’ Licences [among others]

William Coghill, Gilbert Arms, River Gilbert.

The house was represented as been building for the last three years and was not yet finished.  The applicant said he had a short lease of the house, but had laid out £150 in improvements.  He had five bedrooms and two sitting rooms, one forty feet long and the other eighteen; altogether accommodations for 30 persons.  He had been careful always to keep a good supply of fodder for cattle and horses and had sunk five or six wells for the purpose of obtaining good water.  Granted.

Robert Harris, Saddleworth Hotel, Burra Burra Road.  Represented to be one of the best houses on the road.  Granted.

Daniel Lovelock, Miners’ arms, River Light.  Applicant said he had built a seven-stalled stable and a new sitting room.  The sitting room was more than twelve feet from the tap. There were two bedrooms and he had made arrangements for building seven more.  Granted, but Mr Giles ruled that the house must be improved or the licence would be refused next time.

William Templar, The North Star, Great North Road.

The Chairman said he was sorry that complaints had been made to him by two gentlemen, of great incivility to customers.  He hoped he should not hear of such again.  Applicant said he was not aware of it.  He had tried to make his house as comfortable as possible.  Ordered to stand over.

Thomas Tapley Jnr, The Springs on the North Road.

It was represented that the house was in bad condition and not absolutely necessary.  Applicant was a young man and had not kept a house before; he was seeking a transfer from Mr Cudmore.

Stood over, with leave to apply next quarter.

Abraham Wren, Burra Burra Hotel, Kooringa.  Granted.

Charles James Ware, The Miners’ Arms, Kooringa.

Applicant applied in the room of Henry Chandler who had formerly held the house.  Granted.

[Others along the route of the road to Adelaide are listed.]
