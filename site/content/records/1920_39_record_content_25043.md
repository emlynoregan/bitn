Mayor’s Report for 1927

The year has been one of advancement and improvement.  New buildings in the town to the value of c. £10,000 brought in £23-9-6 in building fees.

During the year the Governor-General and Lady Stonehaven visited with the SA Governor & Lady Bridges.  There were also visits by the Premier of SA and the Federal Treasurer.  All these were entertained by the Town Council.

Early in the year the handsome Roll of Honour was unveiled by Sir Tom Bridges and a public banquet was tendered him.

The Children’s Playground at Kooringa has been opened and is well patronised.

Finance.  The year began with the general account in credit £149-5-6 and is now about £259 in credit, but this will be c. £100 less by the end of the year.

A new by-law has been passed controlling motor traffic.

An inspection of unused streets and unclaimed allotments has been made and the new Council will have to decide on selling or leasing unused streets and selling unclaimed allotments.

Parklands

600 trees were planted, but very severe frosts killed most of the gums, though the pines and shrubs are doing well.  Many gums planted as street trees in the town need replacing with more ornamental varieties.  Victoria Park has been used for sports this year [after its upgrading].  Much more needs to be done to make it what it should be.

The Cemetery is well kept.

The Local Board of Health had no outbreaks of infectious disease to deal with this year, but an up-to-date isolation ward has been added to the hospital.

Public lavatory accommodation has been provided at Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Street lighting has been very satisfactory.  Extra lights have been added and another four are on order to bring the total to 50.

The Fire Brigade has been very effective this year.

The Main Roads are in good order.  The Government grant is never enough to maintain them and the town has this year added £200 to the £400 of the Government grant.

General Rate 1927 	£1855-12-10

Health Rate	£499-11-11

Total	£2355-4-9
