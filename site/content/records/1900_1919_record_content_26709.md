Adelaide Exhibition.  About 100 children from Burra & Copperhouse Schools went to Adelaide by the Broken Hill Express last Friday to see the Exhibition.  They were led by headmasters Mr George Scott and Mr R.G. Galle.  Some returned that night, but others remained in the city with friends or relatives for a few days.
