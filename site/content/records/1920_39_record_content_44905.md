Mongolata Goldfield

Block 8.  Work has concentrated on sinking the top shaft deeper and has gone from 40ft to 50ft with no values.

Mining Prospectors’ Assoc. meeting 11 February

Roy Kirkham was elected Chairman, as the former Chairman has left the field.

Prospectors are asking for the establishment of a post office.

They regarded Mr Whitford’s statements encouraging individual prospectors and not companies as misleading and believe new arrivals would be disappointed.

They point out that new arrivals must pay for water carting and are limited to 20 gallons from the tank a week at 2/6 per 100 gallons.

For prospecting, water must come from dams, as the bore is being reserved for battery use.

All of which makes prospecting here far from easy.  The view of the meeting was that the field is a company proposition.

Wildildie Claim.  The northwest drive is now at 37ft on a small leader.  The crosscut off the southwest drive is at 15ft with no values.  The winze to 8ft struck good values, but soon cut out.

Have holed through to the surface with the rise giving good ventilation.

The Battery

Last week we heard the battery was ready for work and were surprised therefore when the Chief Secretary recently said it would be about a month.  Rumour now says about a fortnight to allow for a grand opening and banquet in the Burra Institute – for reasons not apparent to those at the mine, though it is assumed it will aid the aspirations of some politicians.  Some companies have decided not to participate.
