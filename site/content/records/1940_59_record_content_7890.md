Weather.  Pastoralists to the east are glad to have received monsoonal rains that are still falling in places.  Reports so far in indicate registrations from half an inch to about 90 points.  Falls in the agricultural areas were much lower.  Burra recorded 37 points.  All creeks were reported down.
