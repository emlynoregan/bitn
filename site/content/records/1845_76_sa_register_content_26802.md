Mt Bryan East, 26 October.

There have been splendid rains and crops are looking good.  Farmers are speculating about the time scale for the damage of locusts.  They are hatching in millions, but their appearance seems to be getting later each year and so they may die out in time.

Farmers wish to see the Rabbit Act put into force as soon as possible.
