Obituary. 5 June, Mr Alfred Allen, after a long illness.  Born in England in 1855, he came to SA with his wife and children in the ‘Forfeitshire’ [actually in the ‘Forfarshire’] in 1877.  They came straight to Burra where he was engaged in the cutting to the north of the town to carry the railway north to Hallett.  After that he worked at the Burra Flour Mill as a miller and engine driver for 35 years.  They lived first at Hampton as Mrs Allen objected to living under canvas as provided for by the railways.  Later they lived at Aberdeen until his death.  [Actually at Redruth in the former hotel, the Bushman’s Home.]  Of a family of 17 (10 sons & 7 daughters) 13 survive: Fred C. Allen (Kooringa), William Allen (Aberdeen), F. Alfred Allen, (Alberton), John Allen (Kooringa), A. Walter Allen (Aberdeen), Harold A. Allen (Aberdeen), P. Roy Allen (Kooringa), Mrs Harrison (Unley), Mrs J. Harrison (Aberdeen), Mrs J. McCann (Brompton), Mrs T. Harrap (Kooringa), Mrs C. Rogers (Kooringa), Mrs D. Voumard (Aberdeen) and 50 surviving grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.  [Death registered as 6 June in Kooringa, residence Aberdeen, aged 74.]
