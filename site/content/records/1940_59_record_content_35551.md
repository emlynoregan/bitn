An extract from a sermon by Rev. C.L. Pitman of Redruth Methodist Church is printed – presumably inspired by the local controversy over playing tennis on Sunday.

It strongly supports Sunday Observance and observes that: ‘The idea of doing nothing [on the Sabbath] is foreign to the Commandment.  To keep holy meant and should mean to devote, or set apart, for the Lord.’

He does rather go over the top by citing the German National Council for Youth Fitness as holding its exercises on Sundays, which then led to ‘a body of people, so blood thirsty, that human language fails to describe; for the products of Hitler’s Youth, the National Fitness Group, could skin human beings alive, tan the human skins, and use them for lamp shades.  It cannot be denied that the Nations which honour the Lord’s Day as a day of rest enjoy the greatest liberty, personally, socially, politically and religiously.  Indeed such nations have more holidays, and less working hours than others.’
