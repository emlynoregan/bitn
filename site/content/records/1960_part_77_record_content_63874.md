Burra Burra DC.  Rural Relief Grant

The $20,000 Rural Relief Grant will be expended by the end of the month.  A further $20,000 will be sought. Of the present grant $5,000 has been spent on the exterior renovation of Paxton square.  Seven spoon-drains or cement fords have been placed in the Hundred of Ayers.  $2,000 has been spent on the old reformatory at Burra North.  Repairs are being made to the parapet and some interior stone work.  The rest has gone on kerbing and water tables throughout the town, with work in Thames Street, Best Place, Young, Queen, Church and Hill Streets among others.  Applications for funds have come from the Farrell Flat Golf Club, Burra Show Society and the Booborowie Recreation Committee to assist with updating buildings under their care.

Hanson-Clare Road.  $21,000 has been granted for the sealing of another mile of this road and it is expected to be done before Christmas.

The SA Housing Trust advises it will be erecting a house in the new housing area off Smelts Road for the Education Department.
