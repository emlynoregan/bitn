Burra Cheer-up Society.

Pte Carpenter’s parcel was sent to him and as soon as we have addresses parcels will be sent to Pte Wilmott, Pte Pryor and the two Ptes Williams.

Condolences were sent to the family of Pte Jones.

At the general meeting on 10 January the Mayor took the chair.

There was some discussion about soldiers who had not come to socials to receive farewell parcels.

[In fact the tone suggests that it was felt they had somehow shirked their duty in not attending and the society appeared quite peeved at being snubbed, though doubtless they would have denied this, had they been challenged on the point.]

Mr Milner said the fund should be audited – having had £1,352 handled to the end of December.

Mr Lawn regretted that Pte W. Jones had had such a quiet funeral.  He thought the Society should pledge themselves never to allow one of our soldiers to be buried ‘as this young man was’.  The fact was that it had occurred on a public holiday and no one, not even Mr Crewes, had known when the funeral was to be held.  It was resolved to place a wreath on the grave.

E.J. Harris referred to the designation of the room in the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut as ‘The Burra Hall’.  The name was on a small brass plate about the size of an envelope and he thought something better was warranted.

Mr F. Harris had spoken to Mrs Seager and said the Society was displeased with the way in which the name of the Burra Hall was exhibited, as Burra had done so much for that hall.  Mrs Seager promised to see that the present plate was replaced by a large scroll, and would like it to be unveiled by somebody from the Burra Branch.  It was resolved that a letter of thanks for this be written.

Ptes Lihou and W.J. Herbert have sent photos to the Burra Cheer-up Society.
