St Mary’s Sunday School saw a gathering of parents and pupils on Wednesday to farewell Pte Hilary Fuss.  Rev. S.J. Bloyd presided.  Pte Fuss was the 1st of the Sunday school scholars to have volunteered.  He had been a great help in the school as a pupil and teacher.  He had served in the choir till his voice broke and then had pumped the organ.  He was presented with a wristwatch.
