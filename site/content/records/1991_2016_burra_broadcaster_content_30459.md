Goyder Council

At the last Council meeting over an hour was spent discussing confidential items concerning issues to do with Burra resident Doug Wiltshire.  Last year Mr Wiltshire threatened to sue all of Goyder Councillors for a variety of reasons and said they should all be replaced.  CEO Steve Kerrigan said staff had spent days and days addressing enquiries from Mr Wiltshire.

Council has donated $1,800 to the company Contact Bacon, being the value of the assessment fees for their development application in Bower in accordance with its policy of inducing economic development in that area.

A draft management plan for Paxton Square Cottages is being prepared for public consultation.

The Principals of Mongolata Gold Pty Ltd have written to Council asking if they could set up a boutique brewery in the Unicorn Brewery Cellars.  Council will consult with the National Trust.
