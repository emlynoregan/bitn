The Wilkins 1 Launch

A test balloon was launched at c. 10.30 a.m. and tracked to a maximum altitude of 19,217 km [sic: for metres] and a temperature of -3ÂºC and a location 72.6 km northeast of Burra.  A glitch at launch resulted in a small clip becoming unattached and this removed the ability to determine where the payload would land.  Wilkins 1 was launched at c. 11.30 a.m.  It reached an altitude of 18,472 m, parachuted safely to earth and was successfully retrieved.  [3 photos.]
