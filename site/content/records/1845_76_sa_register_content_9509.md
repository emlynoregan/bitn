Obituary.

‘In June last a shepherd in the employ of Mr Chambers, whilst travelling from the North-west Bend to the Burra, discovered some human remains about 20 miles from the Murray; he also found at the same place a watch and some papers.  From these latter it is ascertained almost beyond a doubt that the remains in question are those of two Germans named Weber, a druggist and Schroder, a miner.  These two unfortunate men left the Burra in November, 1851, intending to go to the Murray.  They had been met on the road by a Mr Plausowsky, who found them destitute of provisions, and who relieved them to such extent as he could.  It is supposed, with every probability, that they perished from hunger.’
