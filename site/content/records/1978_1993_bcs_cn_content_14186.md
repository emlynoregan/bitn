Burra Kindergarten.  A meeting on 3 March decided to go ahead with the changes to provide a full day on Tuesday.  Children may attend for a maximum of four sessions a week from Monday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings and Tuesday morning and afternoon (counting as two sessions).  Full day kindergarten on Tuesday is restricted to out-of-town children and children attending school in the next term.
