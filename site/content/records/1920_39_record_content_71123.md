Editorial: Burra-Whyalla Water Supply

With Whyalla to be a town on a par with Pt Pirie it cannot be left waterless and the Bundaleer and Beetaloo Reservoirs are occasionally in difficulty supplying the present areas, so despite some rumours to the contrary it is inevitable that the Government will build a pipeline from the River Murray to serve it.  Two or three routes are possible and at least one runs through the Burra District.  Once over the ridge to the west of Burra any supply will command a large area which cannot be supplied from Beetaloo and Bundaleer.  This includes Jamestown (with no water supply), Spalding and Booborowie.  In order to ensure the line does go through the area the people should unite to bring pressure to bear upon the Government.  If they do not they might be left to bemoan their hard luck when it does not traverse their district.
