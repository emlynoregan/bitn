Cr Riggs said that originally he had moved the area be 25yds x 15yds and he did not know why the motion on the books said 30yds x 15yds.

The Town Clerk agreed that the proposal if carried out would place the fence 24ft too far towards the Institute.

Cr Riggs couldnâ€™t see that 5yds made that much difference.
