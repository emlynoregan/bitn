Fire.  Last Friday a large stack of lucerne hay caught fire at Koonoona.  50 tons of hay was lost, but the fire was contained.  Two of the lads who had just built the stack caused the fire when they relaxed with a cigarette.  On the same day a train seems to have caused a fire near the ballast quarry, but it was extinguished and a similar fire a little further on was also soon put out.
