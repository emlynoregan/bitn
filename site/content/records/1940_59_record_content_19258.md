Burra Town Council, 16 October

£1-1-0 was donated to Morialta Children’s Home.

Profits from the dance at the opening of the Burra Clothing Factory amounted to £8-8-9 and had been handed to the Town Clerk.

Cr Bevan reported that the swing bridge was in urgent need of repair.

Cr Carpenter said St Joseph’s wall was undermined, as the embankment fretted and was a danger to the public.
