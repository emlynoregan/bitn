Railway Accident.  Yesterday the Adelaide-Terowie goods train struck the rear of a truck driven by Mr F. Seaford, carrier of Burra, at the Bon Accord crossing.  Mr Seaford apparently never heard the warning bell, nor saw the approaching train.  He escaped unhurt, but the rear of the truck tray and the wooden cross-members were smashed.
