Redruth Camping Centre will close after 30 years of operation.  There will be a commemorative service there on Sunday 17 November at 11 a.m.  The camp was the vision of the Rev. Clarrie Hore, when the Redruth Methodist Church closed in 1970.  The Redruth church played an important part in many people’s lives.  The Sunday school building was erected in 1924 and the Redruth Camping Centre opened in 1972 in the Sunday school building.  Among those involved then were Barry Eberhard and Brian Thamm, who have had an ongoing involvement.  The conversion needed only minor kitchen works and rewiring.  A government employment scheme carried out some earthwork and built a retaining wall between the centre and the manager’s residence.  The camping centre worked well in the 1970s.  Many campers arrived by train and walked to the centre.  In 1980 the old Courthouse Hotel was bought (involving a loan).  The hotel had many licensees in its 63 years as a hotel from 1853 to 1921 and after that it was at times a nursing home, a wood yard, garage and a private home.  After its purchase in 1980, it was for a time the Tiddy ʼoggey Tea Room and then a craft shop before being incorporated into the camping centre.  It required much cleaning out and renovation.  During those years it had extensive vegetable gardens and served as a community centre.  Rev. Brian Polkinghorne was then in charge and managed camps at the camping centre across the road.  In 1983 Helen McColl was appointed manager and has carried on the job superbly for almost twenty years.  In 1986 the old hotel was incorporated fully into the Camping Centre and was used by small groups capable of doing their own catering.  During this time the camping centre was occupied for up to 5,000 bed nights per year.  In 1989 the synod took over the management of the centre, with bookings managed from Adelaide and many camps were steered our way.  This resulted in a large number of camps, which continued to 1995.  The management was then handed back to the local church.  Complete packages were organised and teachers just needed to supply supervision.  For the six years 1995-2000 some 19,120 bed nights were provided – and numbers were higher in previous years.

But in the 1990s the number and size of camps fell due to a variety of causes:

Bus costs for students increased.

Teachers became more reticent to take camps due to liability issues.

Sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road made it more dangerous for camps involving both sides of the road.

Administration costs rose, including having to link fire alarms to the MFS in Burra.

Changes were made to the administration in 2001 and there was some hope that Flinders University might use it as a base for various archaeological enterprises, but the centre has run for some years with annual losses of up to $10,000, with the gap being met from the Burra Op Shop and general parish funds.  Many people have contributed to the centre over the years.  Helen McColl often went beyond what could reasonably be asked  in maintenance and operation and there were ongoing contributions from Brian Thamm and Barry Eberhard and from further afield – Reg Sutton (Booborowie(, Ian Denton (Farrell Flat) and Joyce Lommon (Mt Bryan).  The service on 17 November will acknowledge all who contributed and will celebrate its role in the community.
