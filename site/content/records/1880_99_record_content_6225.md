Eastern Plains Selectors.  Dr Stephens has presented the case for payment relief to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.

In 1875 selectors took up land and paid 10% deposit, plus cash for any improvements on the property.

In some cases a second instalment has been paid.

In others payment has been waived for some time on account of crop failures.

The cultivation requirements of the Land Act have imposed further debt.

The memorialists were not anxious to throw up their land and asked for relief in order for a further trial of the land.  Specifically they wanted:

Relaxation of the cultivation clauses

No rent be charged for the next three years

Their right be extended for three years

Not only have the memorialists suffered drought, but in successive seasons have had to contend with rabbits and locusts.

Without concessions they face absolute ruin.

Mr Ward also presented a petition from a meeting held at Johnburg in the north.

The Commissioner said the Government intended to grant concessions in the next sitting and agreed to put the selectors in Baldina and Bright with those in the north.
