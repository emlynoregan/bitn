Civilian Registration

Complete registration of all civilians is part of placing Australia on a war footing.  Forms must be completed and lodged before 25 March.  [Details are given.]

After registration an identity card will be issued to British subjects only, to be carried by the individual.

Mr & Mrs A. B. Riggs learned on Friday last that their daughter Mavis Riggs was back in Australia after two yearsâ€™ service abroad.

Sister Nell Bentley, daughter of Mr & Mrs James Bentley of Knoxville (Adelaide), who had served in Johore, Malaya, Singapore, Batavia and Java, arrived home safely last week after hair breadth escapes.
