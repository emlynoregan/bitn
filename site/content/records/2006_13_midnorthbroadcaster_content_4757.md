‘The Bluff’ Poll Merino Stud at Hallett will cease on 19 March 2008, the day after the Burra Field Days.  After 53 years of breeding Poll Merinos the senior stud principal Max Rayner said it had to be closed as there was no family to carry on.  The stud had totalled 2,694 ha and was divided into 9 lots for sale last year.  A number have already been sold.  The homestead has been in the family since 1867 and the Poll Stud was established in 1955.  There will be an on-site auction on 19 March.  Mr & Mrs Rayner will relocate to Burra.
