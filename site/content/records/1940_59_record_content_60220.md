Weather.  Snow fell at Burra on Sunday morning between 1 & 2 a.m. and carpeted gardens and roofs till 9.30-10 a.m.  Children enjoyed snowball fights.  Further light falls took place at 9.30 and 11.30 a.m.  Further north sheep losses have been significant, but locally they seem to have been fairly light.
