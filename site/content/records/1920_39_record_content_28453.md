Fire.  The Hallett-Copperhouse tennis match at Copperhouse on Saturday last was temporarily interrupted when fire broke out at the home of Mrs W. Edwards.  She had encouraged a reluctant fire with a rather large dose of kerosene and flame had spread to the ceiling.  Fortunately it was soon extinguished.
