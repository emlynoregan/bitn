Burra Burra Show Inc. held its 1936 show at Aberdeen on 3 October in glorious weather.  This year the handsome new Centenary Hall greeted the eyes of spectators and assuredly this building will be the envy of most country show societies.  This allows the old luncheon booth to be used as a pavilion.  Gate receipts were up on last year.  Side shows were numerous and the merry-go-round was well patronised all day.  The Boxing Booth drew a great deal of interest and some of the local lads gave the boxers more than they were looking for.  The display of working exhibits was large.  Entries for the Ring Events were not good, in common with most country shows.  This is possibly due to the decline in light horse numbers and the rise in the use of motor cars.  Perhaps steer riding and sheaf tossing should be introduced.  Jersey numbers might increase if they were more visible.  The yards are strong enough to contain a wild bullock and this obscured the view of the usually docile Jerseys.

Mr M.S. Edwards proved once again to be an efficient secretary.  President I.J. Warnes [photo] continues show as much drive and enthusiasm as ever.  The SA Centenary train was at the showgrounds siding and was inspected by many.

Art and photography entries were few, though the art entries showed talent.  Poultry entries, except for geese and turkeys, were heavy.  Pigeons were highly commended, both homers and fancy.  Cattle were quite well represented generally.  A.J. Melrose showed a particularly entire horse, Grey Friar”.  Horses in action did not meet expectations in numbers, but the quality was strong.  Fleece wool entries were well up to standard.  Pig pens were full, showing the largest entry for years.  Dogs were well represented and of a high standard.  Green fodder exhibits defied recent severe frosts and dry weather and were marvellous.  Farm and dairy produce exhibits fell in numbers, perhaps due to seasonal conditions and this may also explain the small number of vegetable entries.  The small showing was, however, of excellent quality, especially for cabbages.  Recent heavy frosts and dry, dusty conditions reduces the flower entries, especially in sweet peas.  Iceland poppies and stocks were excellent and overall the quality was good.  The Fuss trophy for Champion Pansy went to Alick Ford.

Knitting and needlework were well up to standard.  The extra space for cooking was well utilised and a credit to exhibitors.  The schoolwork section saw strong competition and the entries were well displayed.

The official luncheon was held in the Centenary Hall – ‘capable of seating many hundreds of people.’  It was built for utility purposes and the fixtures are simple, but nevertheless very effective. Before guests entered the hall, Mr Warnes formally declared it open.  The hall was decorated in the Centenary colours of green and yellow.  The tables were decorated with sweet peas, Iceland poppies and coloured ribbons.  Mrs Rowe is congratulated for her efficient service.

[The speeches and toasts are reported at length and the report of the various sections outlined above includes further comments on the best entries and names major prize winners.  A photo of the Society’s first President, Hon. W.B. Rounsevell, is printed.]
