The Burra Swimming Pool.  Letter from E.T. Baulderstone.

He explains that for the last few years the pool has been administered by the Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club, which has had a lot of difficulties in doing so.  At the recent AGM it was decided to ask the Corporation to take over the administration.  The Council saw the possibility of the pool not functioning and realised its importance in teaching young people to swim and in the relaxation and enjoyment it offered citizens.  The Corporation also considered the amount of effort and capital invested and so decided to accede to the request and to take over the administration.  The Council advertised for an attendant, but so far without success.  Finally the late Mr D. Morrison agreed to help, but unfortunately he fell ill and was confined to hospital.  Mr & Mrs W. Holness have opened the pool at weekends and some afternoons, but due to a lot of undue criticism do not feel inclined to continue.
