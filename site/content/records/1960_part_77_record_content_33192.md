Historical Maps found at Steelton

When the old Steelton Post Office was demolished Mr V.R. Schmaal found some old maps and charts.  The old building was on the Marrabel-Waterloo Road and was built over 100 years ago.  It served as a post office until eight or ten years ago.  It was the former home of the late Mr H.G. Parker, who was the former postmaster and District Council Overseer.  He was also the District Clerk of the old Waterloo DC.  When it became unsafe in recent years, the owner, Mr B.T. Schmaal, decided to demolish it.  On receiving advice of the discovery Messrs A.E. Bannear, R.J. Noye and D.S. Overton visited Mr V.R. Schmaal and took over the historical documents.  A large SA Directory of 1915, which for many years was used as a door stop, was also taken over.

The collection comprises one lithograph map and five hand-drawn maps.  The lithograph shows the area in SA cultivated for wheat in the years 1870-1882 and the average yield per acre.  In 1870, the year the railway came to Saddleworth, the Saddleworth DC has 16,282 acres of wheat yielding 14 bushels per acre.  In the 1870s the Council area was 39,680 acres.  For the 13 years 1870-1882 the average wheat yield overall was 8 bushels per acre, which was amongst the highest in SA.  Three hand-drawn maps were prepared by the late F.G. Richardson, licensed surveyor, in 1871 & 1877 and dealt with changes to Government Reserves.  They are on linen.

The other two maps are the most interesting and are of Emuville and the Midland Road District.  The map of Emuville is a certified copy drawn in 1883 and recalls the early mining era and its effect on the Black Springs area.  In 1846 a well-known brewer, David Cudmore, built the Emuville Hotel alongside Emu Springs and the Government trough about two miles northeast of Black Springs.  The troughs are still in existence, but the hotel is a heap of rubble.  Cudmore stayed only a short while, as he inherited a small fortune in Ireland.

Thomas Tapley took over and dispensed drinks to the thirsty teamsters working between Burra and Kapunda for the next seven years.  The hotel was at the junction of three roads to Burra and would have done a roaring trade in beer and hard liquor.

About 1850 the Karkulta Mine, a few miles north of the hotel, was expected to become another Burra Mine and two towns were laid out near the springs.  One was Glandore [sic: for Glendore] (now known as Black Springs) and the other, right adjacent to the Emu Hotel was Emuville, comprising 36 blocks of one to four acres; laid out by Edmund Bowman.  However, the Karkulta Mine proved a disappointment and today Emuville is just a name on the map.

The other map of 1875 shows the roads under the care of the Midlands Road Board – an area extending from Pt Wakefield to Morgan and from Kapunda to Burra and it clears up much of the doubt which exists about the routes of the early roads.  At this time the main road to Burra was the ‘Middle Road’ via Kapunda, Hamilton, Waterloo and Black Springs.  The other route was via the ‘West Road’, which in a general way followed the modern bitumen road.  ‘Morris Bridge’ on the Saddleworth-Steelton Road was constructed by the Road Board and named after its secretary.  One variation shows that in 1875 the route south of Riverton went through the small settlement of Navan, east of the present bitumen.  The discovery of these maps brings home the importance of preserving such relics before they are lost forever or are snapped up by hungry antique dealers.
