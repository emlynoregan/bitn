North Eastern Combined Schools Sports were held at the Spalding Oval on Thursday.  The winner for the day was Leighton.  Competing schools were Leighton, St Joseph’s Convent, Booborowie Red, Booborowie Green, Spalding Hill, Spalding Hutt, Hilltown and Willalo.  [Major winners are listed.]

The Art Display at the RSL Hall in Burra on Friday drew a steady stream of visitors.  Ron Kellock’s display of gemstones, minerals and Aboriginal artefacts created much interest.  His display of malachite was a highlight for many.  The works by eleven of Mr Len Bence’s students were also impressive and the Floral Art Group gave a fine display despite the wild winds of the recent past.
