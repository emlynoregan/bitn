Loss of the Barbara Gordon

A letter from George Considin tells of the fate of the barque Barbara Gordon.  This vessel left Adelaide on 20 February with a cargo of 338 tons of Patent Copper Company ore, 177 bales of Bowman’s wool, 4 bales of Mortlock’s wool and a case of wearing apparel of Cleve & Co.  It was bound for Swansea, but at 10 p.m. on 5 May it ran aground at a reef off Cape Agulhas on the south coast of Africa.  One sailor drowned and all the passengers except Mr Considin.  Passengers drowned were: Mr & Mrs Redish & child & Mrs Dalton (all of Kensington) and Miss Hay.
