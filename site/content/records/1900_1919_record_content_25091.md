Eastern Telephone Line.  On Friday the line was operating as far as Sturt Vale and should make Quondong today. The contractors have averaged 11 miles a week and the total length will be 130 miles when completed.  A number of applications to extend the line have been received.  The syndicate has purchased the rooms known as the Burra Musical & Dramatic Club for their Burra office, but have allowed the club to remain in certain rooms for their own use.
