Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.

A large belt wheel was cracked when it fell off the trolly because the horses moved and it had to be repaired at Henderson’s.  On Saturday the first run of the engine was made and it worked silently and beautifully.  We expect the bottom of the pool to be exposed at about 20ft.  Pumping should begin in about three weeks.  When we [Mr Davey] visited the Mine Mr Pryor ordered us away from the site and refused to talk to us.  But if we did not go to the Mine to see for ourselves the shareholders would have to rely on the information released by Mr Pryor and would not know the true state of affairs.  At present there is nothing showing that gives promise of anything valuable from a mineral point of view.  Work at Bunts’s Shaft continues and the intention of management is to get below the old workings.
