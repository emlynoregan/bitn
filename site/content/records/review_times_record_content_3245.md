The Troupe Theatre put on a production entitled The Floating Palais at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The hall took on the appearance of a 1920s dance hall.  The Shiny Shoe Company’s Star & Garter Band performed on stage and actors, acrobats and singers mingled with the crowd of c. 160.  The production was inspired by the Floating Palais, which was a large floating barge on the Torrens in Adelaide near to the present Festival Theatre.  It saw thousands of people dance there from 1924 until it burnt down in 1927.  They enjoyed dances like ‘The Drag’, ‘The Charleston’ and ‘The North Adelaide Bank Robbery Dance’.  Publicity Officer for the Burra Branch of the Arts Council, Mrs Muriel Bence, said the production, which was The Troupe Theatre’s first in Burra, was a great success.  Part of the proceeds will aid the Redruth Gaol drama event in October.
