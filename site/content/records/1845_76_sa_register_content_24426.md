Ulooloo Diggings.  The Northern Argus reports a population on the field of 300-400, with a good proportion at work.  No large finds are reported and in fact the majority of diggers do not appear to be making good wages, perhaps because they are heavily concentrated in one creek.  The gold that is recovered is of good quality, being coarse and nuggetty and we believe is fetching Â£3-17-6 an ounce.
