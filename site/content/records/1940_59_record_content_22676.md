Burra Town Council, 6 August

Much of the time for general business was taken up debating an increase in fees for the cemetery curator for digging graves.  In the end it was resolved that he get the increase he sought for digging graves on the eastern half of the ground, where the ground was harder, but that the price be unchanged for graves in the western half.

Straying stock remained a contentious question.  Mrs Spackman was to be written to asking her to keep her sheep off the streets and the owner of the donkey was to be warned that he were not willing to get rid of the animal the Council would take action.

Pte Cliff Phillips and LAC Frank Lloyd were tendered a social at Leighton Hall on 11 August.  They have both been discharged from military service after four and three years respectively.
