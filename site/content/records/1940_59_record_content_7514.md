Burra Home Guard

Burra Home Guard (or VDC) has so far been in the command of Mr S. Hawker, but he has now been appointed to a position in the Woodside Camp and so has handed command to Mr Eric Murray.  Mr E.C. Collins, Captain of the Burra Rifle Club, made a presentation to Mr Hawker on behalf of members.  Mr Hawker in responding said he had received wonderful assistance from his Second in Command, Sgt H. Fuss, who has spent much time studying the problems facing the Home Guard and was very sincere and keen about his job.
