Wendy Douglas, formerly a local artist, has just held her first solo art exhibition at Hughes Gallery in Adelaide.

Burra Picnic Races on Easter Sunday were the best for years.  Some 500 to 600 people attended.  The RFDS ladiesâ€™ trading table raised $865.  The profit this year is likely to be reasonably good.  Over the years the club has donated c. $30,000 to the RFDS, c. $10,000 to Burra Kindergarten and other amounts the Burra SES, the local hospital, Burra Ambulance service and local sporting bodies.  Burra Pony Club ran a barbecue all day and a breakfast on Monday morning.
