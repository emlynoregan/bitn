Letter to Editor: A Visit to the Burra Burra

I recently was staying in the vicinity of the Burra Burra Mines and took the opportunity to visit the workings.  I was not previously aware of the details of the place, so my comments are based solely on what I could learn on my visit.  Answers to my questions suggested to me that the miners know little of the mine beyond their own ‘pitches’ – unless, like persons in some other crafts, they derive some self-importance or profit in maintaining mystery.

The great mineral deposit lay at the northwest corner of the Special Survey and is about eight miles from the Princess Royal Mine at the southern end of the same Survey.  On leaving [Black] Springs, about 16 miles south of Burra Burra, you cross a range of high hills and proceed up a valley surrounded by ranges of a very bare and bleak appearance, but of a peculiar peaked or conical shape.  The workings are within a mile of the township of Cooringa [sic] and all the shafts etc. lie within the space of about 20 acres.  When I was there about 3,000 tons of various coloured ores lay on the surface.  The blue carbonate and green malachite are, after being ‘jigged’ or sifted over water, very bright and beautiful.  Both vary greatly between being as hard as flint or friable.  Near the principal shaft was a pile of dark red ore as hard as granite, the product of the Monster Lode.  The visitor can see the ore being raised in kibbles by a single horse working a horizontal wheel of large diameter.  Between 200 and 300 men are employed.

Great quantities of logs are piled up for timbering the shafts and levels where required.  I spent two hours wandering the underground, descending and ascending by means of ladders.  The great lode is presently at about 20 fathoms and seemed to be heading off to the northeast.  To the westward the levels seemed rather unproductive and this direction was also the most dangerous ground, being more subject to falls.  The ground seems more promising to the south and southwest and less hazardous.

The water is operated on at about 25 fathoms and is kept under by a pair of bullocks working two ‘water barrels’ the size of beer hogsheads.  No great influx of water is likely at the present levels of operation.  Exploration is made by driving levels about 6 ft by 3 ft and following ant lode met with.  The entire mine may be visited from either shaft, though it is difficult for a stranger to know which way to turn.  Many old workings have been filled up or have fallen in.  The main lode is blasted with powder.  The men were reputed to be doing well enough.

A number of stores and well-constructed rooms and lofty cottages form the Mining Association township of Cooringa [sic] where one may see the walls of the most spacious hotel yet undertaken in the province and a Wesleyan Chapel is also being built, together with rooms for a day and Sabbath School.

The Bon Accord, or Sydney Co.’s Mine as it is usually called, is being explored, but without much success at present.  Indications are said to be good.  A large and substantial police station and stables have just been completed for the Government.

Editor.  Since this has been received we have reports of the falling in of several shafts, but fortunately with no loss of life.  But there is no official news.
