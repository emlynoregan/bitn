In February Mr Ron Walker transferred to Kapunda and was replaced by Mr Pillar.

Miss Inglis went to Nuriootpa High School to be replaced by Miss Miller.

Mrs Jeffery replaced Miss Hallewell.

Mr Pederick, the Headmaster, went to Unley High School after eight years here.

The opening enrolment of 68 was a slight decrease.  Eleven left during the year as parents moved to other towns in search of better employment.  Six transferred in.

It is hoped that 1955 will open with c. 80.

Last year 15 sat for Intermediate and 2 for Leaving.

They gained 11 Intermediate Certificates and 1 Leaving Certificate.

This year 11 sat for Intermediate and 4 for Leaving.

On 23 May the school visited Wayville Showgrounds to see the Queen and Burra High School had a very good position for a close-up view of the Queen and Prince Philip.

The Governor, Sir Robert George, visited the school with his aide Capt. Peter Samuels.

The High School Ball in the form of a Debutante Ball was a great success and 14 girls were presented to Mr & Mrs Stanley Hawker.

At the annual sports day on 23 April

Senior Girls’ Cup		Robyn Tattersall

Senior Boys’ Cup		Ian Allen

Junior Girls’ Cup		Thora Allen

Junior Boys’ Cup		Keith Pulford

The Mid-North High Schools Sports was an enriching experience, though Burra High did not do very well in the points scored.

Interschool sports were played against Riverton and Clare here and Eudunda away.

The school would be firmly behind any drive for a swimming pool in Burra.

Thanks go to the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. and to the High School Council for their enthusiasm and help throughout the year and to the religious instructors who gave their time each Wednesday morning.

The Senior School visited Pt Pirie.

Remembrance Day was observed in conjunction with the Burra Primary School.

15 boys sat for an examination to qualify for selection for a trip abroad under the Advertiser Youth Travel Scheme.

It would be most pleasing to see an increase in the wearing of the school uniform – especially among boys, as it adds to the tone of the school.

Mr H.J.B .Jennison distributed the prizes.
