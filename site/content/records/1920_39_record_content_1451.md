Burra Town Council, 17 May

Vandalism – boys have been removing connecting tubes from the street lamps in East Ward so they cannot be lit.

Cr Kellaway moved that locks be put on the boxes.

Cr Radford said locks would simply be broken off, as had been done twice already.

Cr Radford has inspected an ambulance in Adelaide available for £223 and found it satisfactory.
