Kooringa News, 14 May

The election took place last Thursday.  There was the appearance of a hard contest, with placards and caricatures of opposing candidates conspicuously placed and supporters of each active and assiduous in their efforts.  Despite this and the noisy demonstration in favour of Stocks, it was all an illusion.  It gave the excuse for a jolly spree, but here Stocks only polled 49 [sic: actually 39] votes to his opponent’s 271.  Boxes from other places failed to alter the story and Mr Neales won the seat by a majority of 324.

The Wesleyan Bazaar opened today in the schoolroom adjoining the chapel.  There are seven well-stocked stalls besides a table for edibles and drinkables and another for trinkets for the juveniles.  The money raised is intended to clear the chapel debt.

The Burra Directors have visited the mine and as a result one of the engines has been stopped and 40 hands have been dismissed.  This makes the town’s prospects even gloomier than before.

For pastoralists the lambing is far advanced, but as yet we have had no rain and the scarcity of feed is becoming a matter of serious concern.
