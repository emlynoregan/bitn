Local History

Last April Frank Bitmead of the Adult Education Department of the University of Adelaide visited Burra and was struck with the atmosphere of the town.  He has now suggested a one day conference to be held in Burra in October.  He is willing to bring speakers, exhibits etc. from Adelaide and to arrange a full program if 30 people are willing to attend and pay a fee of about Â£1 each.  The Town Council endorses the idea.  The suggestion is for 1 October or 15 October from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Please indicate your interest to the High School Headmaster Mr M.W. Scriven as soon as possible.
