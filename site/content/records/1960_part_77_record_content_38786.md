The Rural Youth Ball was organised as a Reunion Ball and many former members came for the occasion on Friday night.  Past Presidents entertained past members at a pre-ball party in the RSL Hall.  Miss Shirley Thomas was judged Belle of the Ball and Mrs John Quinn was deemed Matron of the Ball.  Music was supplied by Damon Harding’s ‘Modernaires’ of Clare.  Mr Maurice Collins was MC.  Door takings were $409 and it is hoped to clear about $300.  [Photo 91, 13, 2 April 1968, page 1.]
