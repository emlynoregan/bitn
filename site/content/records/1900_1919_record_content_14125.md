Escapes from Redruth Reformatory.

On Wednesday evening M-C Grosser was told Bertha Learmouth & Ruby Cotter had escaped from the Reformatory.  The night was wet and foggy and the roads sloppy, but Grosser kept on seeking their location.  On Thursday morning he got a trap and went east and after learning no news of them he returned to Burra and learnt they had been seen on the Sod Hut Road.  By dusk the two were at the residence of Mr Watts at Glenora (between Black Springs and Waterloo).  This is Bertha’s fifth escape and ruby’s third.  They were overtaken there and returned to Mrs Holden.
