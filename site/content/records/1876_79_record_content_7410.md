Burra Town Council.

Mr Strike was granted a licence to slaughter small cattle at his premises in Bridge St.

Cr Ridgway's motion to cause the fencing of vacant land in Best Place, Morehead St and Ludgvan St was carried.

Cr Ridgway raised the issue of the Aberdeen railway crossing, saying it needed gates or some other warning device or a man with a red flag to make it safer.

The Govt. has indicated that there will be no payment made on some of the work done on the new bridge. Further application will be made.

Plans will be sent to SAMA and the Yorke's Peninsula Mining Association showing the reserves sought.
