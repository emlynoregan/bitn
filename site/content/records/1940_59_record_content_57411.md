Fires

A passing goods train started two fires on Thursday morning at about 2 a.m. between Burra and Farrell Flat in the vicinity of Hanson.

[The editor expressed the opinion that coal-burning locomotives should not run between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. when fires are most likely to take hold without being observed.]
