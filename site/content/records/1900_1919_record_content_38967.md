Football.  The premiership match was played on Saturday.

Aberdeen	0.1	4.6	5.9	8.12	(60)

Terowie	3.3	3.3	3.3	3.4	(22)

Letter from Charles R. O’Connor football umpire for the match with the disputed goal that worried A.D. McLaren, writes in support of McLaren.  He says the ball clearly hit the ground beyond the goal line before being blown back and touching the post.  It was therefore a clear goal.
