Mackerode Stud Dispersal Sale will be held at the Burra Stockyards on 17 October 1973.

The stud was established in 1882 by G.A. Gebhardt, beginning with ewes and rams from Sir J. Lancelot Stirling’s ‘Napla’, Lake Alexandrina and from William Jervois’s ‘Wellington’ River Murray.  Later rams were introduced from ‘Koonoona’ and ‘Cappeedee’ and in the early 1900s from NSW, with rams from ‘Boonoke’ and ‘Bundemar’.  The early 1930s saw Collinsville blood introduced and all subsequent breeding has been on Collinsville and Mackerode blood.  In the early years the Mackerode rams were small and wrinkly bodied.  Early 1900s rams cut 30-35 lb of wool with 12 months’ growth.  A difficult task was selecting for wool weight and against body wrinkle.  Wrinkles began to disappear by the 1920s and now rams carry an even three-fold front, with no body wrinkle and little tail wrinkle.  The aim has been for large format, plain bodied sheep carrying a heavy cutting, soft-handling fleece of 58s-60s quality.  Fleece testing has been used in the top 20% of young rams each year to select the best 50% of those tested for potential workers.  Testing has shown that rams with 58-60s on count of crimps per inch usually have a fibre diameter of only 21-23 microns (60-64s) which is an advantage and is a result of breeding for soft-handling wool.

Mackerode ewes have a very high fertility rate.  The stud has been lambing twice a year for some years – half the ewes lamb in autumn and the other half in spring.  Ewes that fail to lamb in spring are culled and the success can be seen in the few that now have to be culled.

The dispersal of such a stud is a rare event and offers breeders a unique opportunity.
