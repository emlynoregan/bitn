Burra Town Council.  There has been as yet no definite ruling from the Commissioner of Public Works on the Waterworks, either with respect to the request to extend the lease for three months or on anything else.  It was decided to appoint the Town Clerk at £65 p.a.  One dayman was appointed at 6/- a day.  The cemetery curator was appointed at £80 p.a. and a scavenger at 10/- a day.

Mr Ridgway is to be charged 3/- per 1,000 gallons for water used on the Aberdeen reserve.

Cr Pearce said the two reserves used one meter and he asked how the quantity was to be divided.  There seemed to be no answer to this.

Cr Harris moved that the street lamps be dispensed with.  The one erected in Market Square to prevent accidents was now unnecessary and Redruth only had one because Kooringa did.  Carried and the lamps to be placed in safekeeping.

[The ‘Redruth’ lamp may have been in Aberdeen at the Royal Exchange Hotel Corner.]

There was a petition to open up Mill St to the mill, which would need about one chain of road making, but eliminate the need to keep in repair a longer and less convenient road.

Cr Harris moved that the Government be asked to grant the Council the piece of land in question.  Carried.
