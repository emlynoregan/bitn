Burra Cheer-up Society.  Visit of Mrs Seager.

Mrs Seager, organiser of the Cheer-up Society visited Burra on Wednesday.  The Mayor introduced the visitor.  The President of the society, Mr Sowden apologised for his absence.  Mrs Seager came not to solicit fresh funds, but to thank Burra for the money and packages already sent and specifically as the result of Violet Day.  Mr Winnall asked for clarification on how the funds were to be expended and how Australia Day and Violet Day were differentiated.

Australia Day funds would go towards supplementary pensions for the wounded and helping their dependants and providing light employment.

Violet Day raised money for the Cheer-up Home which was a place the returned wounded could visit at any time when they were discharged.  Many coming from all parts of the state had nowhere to go and this provision was important for them.  They also found a lack of utensils at the camp and the Keswick Hospital was not well equipped and the funds helped there.  Burra had supplied over 100 beds.  The Government had supplied some land for the building.

In the evening of Mrs Seager’s visit we also farewelled two more Burra boys: Ptes J. Kellaway and Stagg.  Mr Crewes presided.

Mrs Seager suggested Burra and Leighton branches provide the soldiers with a luncheon on Australia Day.

On July 17 an inscribed bugle was presented to Lieut. Stevenson’s battalion from Burra Cheer-up Society.

Some 30 dozen handkerchiefs have now been sent from here.

Pte Bruce regretted he could not attend the social.

Monday we had a send-off for Pte Lance Tiver.
