Burra Town Council 7 April

A move to increased the rate of pay for casual labourers from 13/3 to 14/- a day was defeated.

The Town Clerk reported lighting rate returned £270 and the cost of the present 50cp lights was £240.  Four or five more lights remained to be installed and the Council is to have the light at Market Square and the Exchange Hotel burning all night.  A decision on increasing the lights to 100cp was deferred.  A number of lights will be swung in the middle of roads to avoid being obscured by trees.

50 odd blocks of land in the town have unknown owners.

Council has been asked to partition off one end of the Victoria Park shed as a dressing-room, but Councillors were divided on spending Council money on further facilities.  Cr Riggs moved that not >£5 be so spent and this was carried.
