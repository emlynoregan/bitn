Crops 1900-01 Season.

On the western side of Burra where fertilizer is being used with the seed drill returns have been up to 20 bushels per acre and the average is quite 12 bushels per acre.

In Bundey the crops failed due to drought.

In Bright the average was 4 bushels per acre.

Apoinga averaged 2 bushels per acre.

At Baldina crops failed except close to the hills where they got 3 bushels per acre and grasshoppers did much damage at World’s End Creek.
