BCS decided not to host a South African exchange student last month.  Recently there was controversy in Clare when a similar decision was made.  The Burra decision was made through a consensus of staff and parents, primarily because they felt that such a student may not have been exposed to the current Australian opinion on apartheid and as a result may have felt intimidated.  Avoiding being seen to endorse the current apartheid system had been a secondary consideration, but was not the main reason, said Principal Mr Henderson.
