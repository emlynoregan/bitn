Letter.  Louise Krause – formerly associated with the Arts Council, writes to correct incorrect information printed last week re the literary grant:

1.  The total amount of the project was less than $3,000.

2.  Country Arts Small Projects contributed $2,000.

3.  The Arts Council contributed c. $300.

4.  The Country Arts Board contributed $500.

The script produced was not a first draft of Act 1 and was drawn from ideas of locals who participated in workshops.  It was neither elementary nor substandard.  Mij Tanith acted completely professionally and carried out her contractual duties.

[The editor commented that ‘information was obtained from the Literature Board re a sum of $8,962.  This now appears not to have been granted.]
