Burra Golf Club held its AGM 24 October and elected: President, A. Baulderstone; Senior Vice-President, D. Villis; Captain, A. Gebhardt; Vice-Captain, S. Longford; Treasurer, P. Boucher and Secretary, H. Burnett.

Retiring President, Don Kempster, reported on a year where the main concerns had been the result of high rainfall causing the need for more mowing and soft ground preventing the use of the tractor.  Improvements were made to numbers 1, 2 & 11 holes.  Later in the season the combined 9th and 11th elevated tee-off was formed.  The Group Open Day had to be transferred to Kanimbla because of the constant flooding of the ground.

[The usual thanks and congratulations are included.]
