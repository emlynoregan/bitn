Obituary.  Ann Mary Lally died on 15 March at Glen Osmond aged 84 and a colonist of 44 years.  Relict of the late Patrick Lally of Kooringa and mother of Mrs A. Turner of Kooringa and Mrs J. Miller of Clare.

She was born Clarenbridge Co. Galway, Ireland, in 1863 [sic: error for 1836]  and at 21 married Patrick Lally and spent 20 years of married life in Clarenbridge before migrating to SA in the Airlie in 1877 with six children.  They came straight to Burra where Mr Lally worked on the railway cutting north of the town and was subsequently employed by the railways for many years.

About nine years ago her left arm was amputated on account of cancer.  Sir Samuel Way had just gone through a similar operation at the age of 79 years when he visited Burra in 1914 and he went to see the old lady who he was informed had prayed for him.  He later sent a letter and a shawl.  She was a devoted member of St Josephâ€™s Church.
