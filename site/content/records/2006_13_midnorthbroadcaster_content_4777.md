Phoenix Copper has been granted two additional exploration licences.  One covers a tenement in Burra and the other is along the west coast of Yorke Peninsula.  Managing Director Paul Dowd said the licences increase the companyâ€™s chance of discovering minerals.  The company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 12 February.
