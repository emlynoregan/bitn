Burra State School break-up was marked on Friday morning by a visit from the School Committee.  Mr D.D. Murphy said the visit was arranged so the Grade VIII certificates could be given out along with those granting free use of the Institute library.  Average attendance for the year was 237, which was up from 222 the previous year.  Next year the Departmental rearrangements meant there would be only seven grades.  Most students would therefore be promoted, but would retain the same grade number.  Mr Winnall was ill and so his place was taken by Mr E.W. Crewes who gave an address to students.  Qualifying Certificates were then distributed to:

Cyril Sedgman	Bert Broad	John Drew

Lyal Tiver	Fred Wicklein	Harry Rosewall

John Hill	Edna Montgomery	Elizabeth Morgan

Marjorie Ford	Jean Cox	Maude Riggs

Millicent Greenwood	Coralie Tiver

Students recommended for High School were Frank Pearse, Frank Ewins, Ben Elliott & Hilda Harrison.

Rev. Hopton also addressed the students as did Cr Radford, Rev. Ingamells, Rev. Haslam, Rev. Goldrey & Cr Kellaway.

The childrenâ€™s items were interspersed between the speeches.
