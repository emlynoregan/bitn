Burra Waterworks.  On Wednesday Messrs Holder and Rounsevell introduced the Mayor and town Clerk to the Treasurer, Hon. T. Playford, who was acting for the Commissioner of Public Works.  They were asking for the interest on the Waterworks capital account of c. £8,000 to be cut from 5% to 3%.  There were two waterworks schemes in Burra: one belonging to the Corporation and one to the Government.  On the Government scheme the Corporation paid 5% or over £400 p.a. and as the population has decreased this concession is asked.  For the first year they had paid 3% and received £82-15-0 from the Railways and the Waterworks had paid their way at 6/- per 1,000 gallons.  In the second year the Railways had paid £50-5-0 and with interest at 4% there had been a deficiency of £30, even though in addition to charging 6/- per 1,000 gallons they had called up ⅔ of the guarantee.  In the third year the interest was 5% and there was no Railway payment.  They had called up all the guarantee, but still had a loss of £100, bringing the deficit to £130.  That year the charge for water had been 5/- per 1,000 gallons.  Population decrease had meant less water was consumed.  If the Government took over they could only make a profit by charging property not using water.  On the old Waterworks, which they had taken over at a cost of £1,000, they were getting only £10-£12 p.a.  Why could not the Corporation have the use of the Railway Waterworks and supply both the town and Railways?

They also asked that Burra be directly connected by telegraph with Broken Hill: at present messages go through Adelaide.  The treasurer asked that this request be put in writing as the line was being duplicated and the Government would favourably consider the request.
