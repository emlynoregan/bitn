The Inaugural Australian Country Games (formerly the Mid North Games) will be held 23 March to 28 April in the towns of Burra, Clare, Jamestown and Spalding.  The name change comes from a broadening of the activities to be included, so as to embrace art and culture, food and wine, collecting and other recreational pursuits.  [A longer list is printed.]
