Mrs L. White of ‘Sutton Lea’ near Clare writes advocating the use of unfermented wine as a table drink in place of tea ‘as a lot of nerves are shattered through the use of strong tea’.  A high duty would have to be imposed on tea.  This would save rooting out valuable vines when prohibition comes in.
