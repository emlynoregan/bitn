Felicity Martin, the daughter of Dr Thomas Dearlove and grand niece of Trixie Pearce has restored some of Trixie’s photographs from the period of around WWI and the 1920s.  Trixie was a Burra Record journalist in the period and along with sister Nellie Pearce was a keen photographer.  They were both strongly involved in the Ladies Mounted Band, the Cheer-up groups during the war and, through legacies, connected with both Leighton House and Pearce’s Buildings.  The collection is on view at the Hallett Gallery any Sunday throughout the month of May from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  As well as Trixie’s photographs, the display includes some wonderful photographs sent by friends serving in Egypt and Palestine during WWI, ‘and part of the Charge of the Light Brigade, including Lieutenants Sandlands and Mc Bride’.
