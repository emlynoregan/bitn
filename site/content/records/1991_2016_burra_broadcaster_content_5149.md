Booborowie Primary School.

Eugene Madigan (Podge) has retired as groundsperson after years of service.  Falling numbers using the school bus will see that service withdrawn in 1995.  Enrolments in 1995 will however, be the highest for some years, with twelve coming into Reception.  Enrolments should stay c. 33 for the next three years.
