Clip Clop for Cancer Report

Details of the 750 km ride from Broken Hill, starting on Friday 30 September are given.  The ride ended at the anti-Cancer Foundation building on Greenhill Road, Adelaide.  The ride raised $6,500.

[The report does not make clear how many rode or who they were except for naming Liz Hounsell and Kimberley Field aged 14.]

[A photograph of Kimberley with her horse in the issue of 11 September, page 9 suggests Colin Springbett was another rider, as does his mention in the issue of 4 September 1961 page 1.]
