Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  For months discoveries have been made and then dismissed as they proved impermanent.  Work is being pursued in the main shaft – near Peacock’s Air Shaft, where rich ore was found, though it was soon worked out.  Mr Pryor, the underground manager, is hopeful.  Tributers are working other shafts, but with little success.  The mine property is littered with hundreds of tons of decaying timber and thousands of tons of iron.  The Electro-Magnetic Separation Works are abandoned and failed to generate the capital needed to develop the mine.  There was talk that they were being purchased by a Broken Hill Co., but so far no effort has been made to remove them.  It’s a pity no work has been done on Morphett’s Shaft.  Much has been said about Bunts’s Shaft and it may yet lead to something.  Tributers have been prevented from much work by the water rushing in.  A gentleman visited recently and offered to supply suitable pumping machinery for £1,000.  Surely if this is not accepted it is a sign something is ‘wrong in Denmark’.
