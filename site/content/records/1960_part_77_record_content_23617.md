Burra RSL held its AGM on 19 February.  The meeting was well attended.  Elected: President, H. Cornelius; Vice-Presidents, T. Rogers & A. Benger; Secretary, J. Murphy and Treasurer, B. Kotz.

The President reported a very quiet year with a very small committee and the General Committee doubles as the House Committee.  There were 10 general meetings and 10 committee meetings.  53 were on parade for the Anzac Parade with the service conducted by Rev. Lind and the march led by the Pt Pirie Pipersâ€™ Band.  19 members attended the evening service at the Kooringa Methodist Church.  Remembrance Day was observed on 11 November.  The Burra Primary and High Schools attended.  121 crosses were planted in memory of the fallen.  The annual ball was a success.  The Annual Dinner was held on 12 December and was attended by 40 locals and 18 visitors.  Successful badge days were held for Legacy, Myrtle Bank, Anzac Day and Poppy Day Appeals.  The branch continues to support two Legacy Wards with the money for that coming from bottles left at the club rooms.  Bert Samuels left the town during the year.  We provided funeral escorts for the late Ralph Thomas and Roy Lloyd.

Indoor bowls have been a success on Tuesday evenings.  Bowls games were played on Anzac Day.  The Ladies Auxiliary again provided great support at activities throughout the year.
