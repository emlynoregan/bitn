Citizens League Meeting at Burra Institute 15 April.

The speakers were Hon. Crawford Vaughan and C.D.A. Bagot.  There was a large audience.

The Mayor presided as President of the recently formed Burra Branch, which had started with 45 members.  The League was firmly behind Mr Lyons and was confident that men of the calibre of Messrs Lang, Scullin & Theodore with their bogus promises were not wanted.  Vaughan spoke of the depression and of the way out by rigid economy to allow the banks to build up assets which would allow improved credit overseas.  The states were largely to blame for the huge debts.  Theodore’s policies would only fuel inflation which would become further inflation, which could not be checked.  His proposal to dispose of the gold reserve would remove the underpinning of the whole present note issue of £46,000,000.  The German experience of inflation was a warning.  None of the Government’s announced schemes had amounted to anything.  Mr Bagot arrived by the Broken Hill express at 9.30 p.m. and as it was late he began at once.  The League, he said, was non-party and non-political.  They were opposed utterly to repudiation [of debt] and to inflation.  They were for the unity of the people and nation – for organised public opinion.  One outstanding man can achieve this: Mr Lyons.  There was plenty of money waiting for Australia in England, but what was lacking was confidence in the country.  The League had but one objective; the return to prosperity of the country.
