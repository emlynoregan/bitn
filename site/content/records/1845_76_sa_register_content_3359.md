William Stevens of Brown Street, Adelaide, writes:

Having a lot of shovels to dispose of, I waited upon Mr Samuel Boord, store-keeper of Hindley Street.  When I spread my samples on the floor, he pointed to the largest and said that there was not a d_____d Cornishman in the colony would use it because they were too lazy.  I said that if he only paid Cornishmen a good wage he would not find them lazy, and I came away in disgust.  Mr Boord has a shop in Burra and would find a good number of Cornishmen amongst his customers.  I think he should be the last person to cast aspersions upon their characters.
