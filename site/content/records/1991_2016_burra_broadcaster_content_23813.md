Carols, Candles and Cakes

A good crowd gathered in Market Square on 3 December for the annual cake decorating competition, carols and turning on of the decorative lights.  Winners of the cake decorating were:

2-6 years	Kristopher Lycett

7-10 year	Tom Eldredge

11 years +	Shirralee McBride

Darryl Venning did a great job at auctioning them off and $860 was raised for the Burra Hospital, with the dearest going for $70.

Danny Smith hosted the Carols & Turning on of the Lights.

A collection for the Christmas Bowl Appeal raised $200.
