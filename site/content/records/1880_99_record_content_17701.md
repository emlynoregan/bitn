Cr Ridgway offered to take charge of a reserve in Redruth and spend £5 p.a. on it for seven years.  Accepted.

SAMA agreed to allow the use of 15’ of land on the east side of the road from Kooringa to Aberdeen [for a footpath/avenue].

The Hydraulic Engineer said the Waterworks pump was 10 h.p. and would pump 2,700 gallons/hr.

The Public Works Department said their well was adequate for their needs and they would not be Council customers.

The Police Department objected to taking water in Kooringa, but were reminded that their Inspector Peterswald had promised to do so.

Correspondence from SAMA on fixing spouting along the eaves of SAMA owned cottages that overhung footways.

Cr West said that when all other ratepayers were to fix guttering SAMA would too, though it would cost £200, which would necessarily raise rents.  They objected to being singled out.

A dangerous wall in Helston St is to be removed.

Both street lamps were inadequately maintained.  The contractors are to be advised to tend to the same.

Cr Tiver proposed half the cost of cutting the footway on the main road be charged to East Ward as it benefited as much as West Ward.  Cr Coglin 2nd.

Cr Sampson promised a public meeting if it went ahead and raised the cost of the Cemetery Road again - it benefited all wards.

Cr Symons thought North Ward was also a main beneficiary and should also pay.

The Mayor read the minute on work on both sides of the road, which had passed in the presence of Cr Sampson.

Cr Sampson moved it stand over - if East Ward were saddled with half the £140 cost it would swallow the whole of its money.

Cr West thought £30 was a reasonable contribution, but in due course East Ward would have to pay for fencing, planting and completing the eastern footway.

The matter was adjourned for two weeks.
