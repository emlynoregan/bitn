Burra Town Council.

A.H. Haselle writes asking whether the town bridge will safely carry the weight of a traction engine and wagons conveying phosphate to the Burra railway station â€“ a total load of 13-14 tons.  The question was referred to the main road surveyor.  [It would seem likely that this question would relate to the Redruth Bridge rather than the Kingston St Bridge as it was on the most direct route from the east to the station.]
