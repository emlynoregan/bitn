Burra Quilters have presented a quilt to the Burra Hospital Auxiliary to be raffled as a fundraiser.  Justin Ragenovich, CEO of Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service, accepted the quilt and also announced that BCS Health Service would be able to fund the purchase of the cardiac monitor for Burra, thereby freeing up the Auxiliaryâ€™s funds, which can now be used to refurbish some of the rooms at the hospital.
