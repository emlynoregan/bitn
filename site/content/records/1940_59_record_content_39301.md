Letter.  ‘A Friend of the Poor’ writes to report on a recent funeral.  A week or so back a young child died in Burra hospital.  The father, who had lived in Burra all his life had asked men of Burra to drive the mourners of the child in their cars, but they had refused.  Instead two bakers’ vans carried them.  The man who owns the vans is only a stranger in Burra, but he did what he could for the mourners.  ‘I and many more are utterly ashamed of the people with their flash cars.’
