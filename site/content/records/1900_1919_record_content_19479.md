Burra Races are reported in 2½ columns.  Threatening rain, which ultimately did not fall, kept attendance down somewhat.  The course was some two miles from Kooringa and was in good order, but a littler ain would have aided its preparation.  Tote turnover was down £60 on last year and few ladies were seen on the lawn.  The only accident occurred through carelessness in the last race when a horse ran into a post and lost an eye.  The concert afterwards was well attended.  The committee may have to draw on the club’s reserves from last year to balance the books, as acceptances and nominations were down.
