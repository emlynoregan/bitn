‘Accountant’ writes to the editor re the Burra Burra Mines:

The writer who recently put the profits of the SA Mining Association at a very low figure in order to depreciate the value of the mines at Wallaroo must either intend to mislead or be wilfully ignorant.  The published accounts of the Burra Burra Mines show there have been 44 dividends:

9 of 200%	£221,760

33 of 100%	£406,560

2 of 50%	£12,320
