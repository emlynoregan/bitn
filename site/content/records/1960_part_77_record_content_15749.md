Weather.  The month has been the wettest April since 1889 with falls of 3 to 4 inches across the district.  The east has also received good falls.  Burra had 361 points, but Mt Bryan only 130 and Booborowie 91 and Farrell Flat 229, reflecting the nature of thunderstorm activity across the district.  Eastern Stations report from 100 points at Braemar and Kia-Ora to 288 at Redcliffe.

M & BHA raised £31-4-6 at a street stall on 26 April.

Burra Oval Appeal has stalled at £30-5-0.  A picture night at the Town Hall is planned to get the total moving again.

Graziers are complaining of spotlight shooters to the east, shooting cattle and sheep and destroying fencing.
