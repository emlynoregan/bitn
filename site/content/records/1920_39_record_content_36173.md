Leighton Hall Strawberry Fete on 29 November was opened by Mrs T.J. Bailey.  In introducing Mrs Bailey I.J. Warnes said the hall was now 21 years old.  In the first year £250 was borrowed from the State Bank and since then between £1,700 & £1,800 had been expended.  The hall and stage had both been enlarged and furnished, a spacious supper-room, dressing rooms, smoke room & kitchen had been added, but despite all this he believed £100 would pay off the present liability.  Though many older faces had gone, the younger folk continued to show an interest in their hall.  The committee had decided to appoint a young man as secretary and to have a new one each year.  This year they had dispensed with a caretaker and yet people had readily come along to clean up after functions.  The hall committee had acquired a block of land for a bowling green and croquet lawn.  So far they had kept the hall in a sound financial position and he hoped continuing interest in dances, concerts etc. would see it so.
