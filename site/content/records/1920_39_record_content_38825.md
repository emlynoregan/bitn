Burra High School: proposed closure of country high schools

The deputation from Burra High School Council is reported.

Dr Steele spoke for the deputation as Chairman of the High School Council.  They viewed with alarm the recent report suggesting the majority of High Schools be cut altogether.  The Advertiser’s sub-leader had also urged the Minister not to be too drastic in effecting economies.  The committee assumed that by the age of fourteen it was easy to pick the child who would benefit from further education.  Dr Steele said that was almost too young and it was quite impossible to gauge the future of the children at that age.  Mr T.H. Woollacott Mayor of Burra submitted a petition from residents asking that Burra High School be maintained and also a resolution from the local Council.  If Burra High School were closed 57 students would be put on the streets, just when they were beginning to develop their aims, ideals etc.  The correspondence system was an inadequate substitute.  If cuts had to be made they would rather see the ending of Domestic Arts and Woodwork.  Recently £1,200 to £1,800 had been spent on Burra High School and it should not be closed after the expenditure of such a large sum.  The primary school was under the same roof.
