‘A Family Man’ of Adelaide writes dated 19 June.

[The writer is fearful of the effect the investment of such a large sum as £20,000 in mineral land would have on the colony.  In the early days of the colony, he says, the colony suffered from the spirit of speculation and this discovery seems to have reignited that flame.  The British public already look upon the SA experiment in colonisation as a complete failure and both the capitalists and the Government have strong reasons to doubt the soundness of the theory of colonisation.  He goes on to write that in the past three years things have changed in SA.  There has been a close application of legitimate business, resulting in increasing production of necessities, the abundant increase in flocks and herds and workers are now profitably employed and exports exceed imports.

‘The moral and religious character of our producing population stand [sic] pre-eminent amongst the Colonies of the British Crown.’

And a better tone pervades the elite of the Province.

The writer then expresses his fear of the consequences of withdrawing such a large amount of capital from other uses, where it would double its value in seven years.  The mining venture is a project that is unlikely, he believes, to produce a yield within that time frame and from which it could not be withdrawn without great loss.  This dangerous leap into the unknown will, he says, only confirm to others that the colony has not abandoned speculation.  Such an investment must only be carried out through the use of surplus capital and not by diverting capital indispensable to ordinary pursuits.

He calls on the Governor to intervene so as to prevent ‘that which I am apprehensive will proves a public calamity’.]
