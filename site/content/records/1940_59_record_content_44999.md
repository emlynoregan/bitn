Burra War Memorial Project

Stage one, the levelling of the oval, has almost been completed.  The huge old shed in the northeast corner encroached onto the new cycle track and so was cut in half and a new temporary change room was provided.  The oval should be completed within a month.  Shortly an all out effort will be launched to provide a useful and lasting War Memorial.
