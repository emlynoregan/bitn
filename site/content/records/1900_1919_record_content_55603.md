The Concert & Lecture for the Blind on Thursday evening at the Burra Institute drew a good attendance.  The Returned Soldiers’ Concert Party offered their services and Mr H. Raymond gave an address.  The institution was founded thirty years ago.  Their new building in North Adelaide was just complete when war broke out.  They had handed it over for use as a military hospital and it had been handed back last May.
