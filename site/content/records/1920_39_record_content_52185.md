Mongolata Goldfield

Pexton & Sons Takati Claim has crushed 25 tons in the last month for 49 oz.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate to 28 July.

Continued stoping ore north of the shaft and expect to have all ore from here out in the next 10 days.

Values are not holding up as well as hoped at an estimated ½-1oz per ton.

Once ore is stoped out we will continue to sink the shaft.

Approximately 16 tons at grass.

Continued sinking trial shaft and costeening with good values in several places.

Locals at Mongolata continue to express disappointment at the low recognition given in city places to Mongolata compared with unproven discoveries elsewhere, despite the fact that last year 47% of SA’s gold production came from Mongolata.
