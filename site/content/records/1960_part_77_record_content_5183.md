Burra High School Headmaster’s Report for 1960 (The 48th Report)

Enrolment in 1960 was 122; up 6 on 1959’s record.  Only 4 left during the year.  There were 8 in the Leaving Class.

[He then goes on at some length to thank his staff, the High school Council, the Parents & Friends Association, the Ministers of Religion, bus drivers and students.]

The school has striven, beyond the resources of time and staff, to provide for the less academically capable by providing subjects outside of the matriculation route: Shorthand, Typewriting, Home Science, Needlework, Drawing and Woodwork.  Public Examination results last year were very good.  In Leaving the three students won certificates with 90% passes in subjects taken.  In Intermediate there were 14 certificates and three others with six subjects each out of the 22 entrants.  All told our students got 9 credits and a 77% subject pass rate.

Sports continue to feature with weekly house matches, a Swimming Carnival in February and an Annual Sports Day in April.  Burra was doing well with the handicap system in the Mid Northern High School Sports at Riverton in May.  At lunch we were coming second, but rain turned the oval into an impossible morass and hopes were thwarted.  Virtual flood conditions washed out the series of football and basketball matches with Clare and Balaklava.

In July the Leaving Class went to Adelaide to see Richard III and in August the Senior School and some Second Year students went to Clare to see The Merchant of Venice.  The Annual Ball in September was a highlight with record takings of £149.  An Arbor Day in July replaced Visiting Day and most of the trees and shrubs planted are doing well.  A new classroom unit was added in the year and awaits the painters, so it should be ready for use in 1961.  Acquisitions in the year have included a new refrigerator in the Home Sciences room, new floor coverings in the Library, a new motor mower, remodelling of the Library and £100 worth of books.

Adult education classes in Dressmaking and Woodwork continued.

Two items of unfinished business are the site for the new school and the issue of a Hanson bus.

[Tenders for the bus are called on page 1 of this paper.]

At the end of 1960 Miss Shirley Crouch (Home Science) goes to Adelaide and Mr Kowald to Angaston.
