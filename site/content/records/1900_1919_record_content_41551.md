A letter is to be sent to Mr Lewis explaining that Council had never officially accepted the property and that members who were present at the conference with him stated their willingness to accept on the understanding that it was to be put in repair and consequently the present Council considered the proposition now before it to be entirely different from the original one.

The mayor thought that Council should seek a further conference with Mr Lewis.

Cr Radford thought that if the buildings were condemned the Lewis trust would be liable and personally he would not like to be a member of the trust.

Cr McBride said the deeds would be in the Council’s name.

Belgian Relief Fund: £373-11-6.

Wednesday last at the Institute there was a concert by the schoolchildren and the Hockey Girls in aid of the fund which will benefit by £15-15-0.  The event is reviewed in half a column.
