Letter to the Editor from Helen Stockman

I must add my voice to those already raised regarding the reallocation of $210,000 set aside for the Copper Interpretation Centre.  It seems the Jubilee 150 Board held that:

Burra was slow to react to the crisis

There was not now time to complete the project.

It was only at the stage that tenders were received that the working party became aware of the architect’s gross miscalculations and an approach was then immediately made to the Jubilee 150 Board to vary the proposal slightly – for a smaller building on the boilerhouse site rather than the larger one on the plateau.

The working party immediately consulted two architects who believe that the project as revised can be completed within budget and in the time available.  The official opening was always scheduled for October 1986.  The reallocation of the money has been done without conferring with Burra and in unseemly haste.

When you employ an architect recommended by the Heritage Branch itself you expect the job is being done properly and it is quite unfair for Burra to be punished for that man’s mistake.  Objections to the proposed site by the Heritage Conservation Unit should be investigated thoroughly.  To be totally purist about the ruins there is to let them decay until they finally collapse and that is not acceptable to me or to many others in Burra.  Enthusiastic support has been given by the Department of Mines and Energy.  Burra is not accustomed to making a botch of heritage based projects.
