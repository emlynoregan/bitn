BCS Presentation Night was held last Thursday.  A large contingent of parents attended along with MPs Dan van Holst Pellekaan and Rowan Ramsay.  The program was ably compered by Senior SRC members Molly Affolter and Bradley Radford.  With 12 members, this yearâ€™s Year 12 was the largest graduating class for some years.

[The list of awards is printed.]

The Principal [Susan Hart] said that BCS Year 12 students exuded patience and care in tending to the needs of younger students.  They have consoled forlorn reception students and have also been seen speaking to business owners in the town with impeccable politeness.  They have also given each other great support.  They have proved to be great role models.
