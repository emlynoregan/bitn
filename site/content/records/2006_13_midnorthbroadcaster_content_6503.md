Weather.  Significant falls of rain in the region were recorded over the weekend â€“ along with some reports of hail.  BCS recorded 7.4 mm and the Booborowie district had falls of from 15.2 to 28 mm.  The falls were quite patchy though, with 11.6 mm at Jamestown and 3 mm at Peterborough, while Terowie received nil.  Hallett reported 35 mm.  Patchy falls extended to eastern properties too.  Koomooloo has water in its dams for the first time in three years, but even across that station falls varied from 15 to 50 mm.  Generally falls reduced towards the north.
