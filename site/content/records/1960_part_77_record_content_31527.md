Burra Town Council, 26 September

At the oval all the front wall has been dozed down as there was sufficient soil to cover the stones.

Reconstruction of St Dye and Chapel Streets has begun.

The garden area by the bridge in Main Street has been cleared out and in future will be maintained as a lawn.

‘The main Adelaide road has been cleaned so that it can be mowed.’

[The last two sentences would seem to be garbled and presumably they should convey that the garden areas around the bridge in Commercial Street between Ware and Kangaroo Streets have been changed from garden to lawn.]

The Bridge by the Kindergarten [in Queen St] will be started this week.

[Presumably the footbridge on the eastern side?]

As there has been no reply concerning the specimens lent to Thebarton Boys Technical High School, the matter will be referred to the Director of Education.
