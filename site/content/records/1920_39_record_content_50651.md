There were some thrilling motor cycle events and the cycling events were keenly contested.

The military events were in charge of Sgt Major R.J. Bernhardt.

[Personal interest: Ted Fuss won the cycle event for boys under 16.]

The Burra & Waikerie Bands played throughout the day.

The day began with a procession from the Burra hospital in charge of C. Sylvester Preiss.  This set off at 12.30 p.m., led by the combined Burra & Waikerie Bands.  Then came a detachment of the 18/23 Light Horse under Sgt. Major R.J. Bernhardt.

The program at the racecourse began on arrival and 40 events were all run off by 5.15 p.m.

The results are printed.
