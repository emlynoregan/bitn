There is quite a long (⅔ column) report of the case against William Ford for furious driving arising out of the running down of Miss Bruse.  Three witnesses basically thought he was driving too fast, was on the grass and not the metalled road, and the horses were not fully in control.  Two people associated with cabs gave evidence.  Joseph Shore (a driver) said Ford was following other cabs, but might have turned off to avoid the two young ladies.  Robert Zincraft Jones (father of a cab proprietor) thought Ford’s speed was not as fast as the other cabs, he had called out to clear the way, and had done all he could to save the young lady.  Ford admitted to a speed of 7-8 m.p.h., but said he called out, failing to apply the brake as he thought the girls were going to move out of the way - indeed one girl ran to one side and the other tried to go the other way and in confusion ran into the horses.  Fined 30/- + 10/- costs.
