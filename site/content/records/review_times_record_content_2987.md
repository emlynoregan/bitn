Council representatives will meet with the Caravan Park Sub-Committee on 4 April to consider the future of the park and possible alternative sites for it.  It was desirable that the present park be closed because of its location and the small number of sites available there.  They will consider available sites around the town able to accommodate 60-80 caravans.
