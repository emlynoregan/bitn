Burra Burra News

Refreshing rains have recently transformed the place.  The hills are green and there are numerous healthy gardens producing some fine vegetable, though the small insects reported from elsewhere have also plagued growers here.

Work on Redruth Gaol is making rapid progress.

It is a pity that the sum of money voted for a Post Office, Local Court and Police Station at Kooringa has not yet been spent.

An effort is being made to establish a Mechanicsâ€™ Institute, but with what success remains to be seen.  Should the agitators for this cause succeed, it will be a great blessing for the town.

There is some talk of placing a bridge across Commercial Street, which in wet weather is almost impassable and very dangerous.
