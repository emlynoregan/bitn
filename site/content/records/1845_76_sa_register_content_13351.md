Captain Roach:

At about 6 a.m. Saturday he saw smoke coming from one of the shafts, which he thought was Stocks’.  Went to see the problem.  Soon after Captain Mitchell and a man named Lewis went down and subsequently Captains Bryant and Goldsmith and a number of men went down to try to extinguish the fire.  Soon afterwards Captain Mitchell returned to say there was a dire at the 25 fathom level in Stocks’ Shaft.  He believed the fire to be accidental.  In his experience there he had known of one fire in a copper mine in Columbia.  Its origin was unknown.  The timber was very dry in Stocks’ Shaft and though he believed the fire to be out, he was afraid to open the shafts yet.  He did not think they could examine the locality of the fire for several days.  A candle left carelessly might be a cause.  He had found timber burning from a candle more than once and had even found a candle on a powder can.  He had every confidence in the miners whose pitch had been the source.  The two deceased had gone from their place of work to help extinguish the fire.

Captain Mitchell:

[Gave a similar account to Captain Roach with variations on his underground activities.]

He thought a candle left behind the most likely cause.  Some months before he and Captain Bryant had found a candle burning against timber and it had taken them some time to extinguish it.  The fire was where the men had been working.  He had been in Stocks’ Shaft about 8 p.m. the night before and there was no sign of fire then, though there might have been a fire in Glanvill’s pitch without his perceiving it.  Potter and others were working in the 20 fathom level about 30 fathoms distant from Glanvill’s pitch.  They left work about 9 p.m. and passed over Glanvill’s pitch without smelling fire.  A man called Penno and others were working in the 30 fathom level and left work at 7 a.m. Saturday.  As they passed over Glanvill’s pitch they heard a roaring noise.  Captain Roach had discovered the fire before they got to the surface.

Robert Penno:

When he heard the roaring at the plat he went towards it and saw the fire.  He had observed nothing when he went down.

Dr Maurau was recalled:

Though the cause of death of Pryor and Johns was commonly called suffocation, it was more properly asphyxiation.  The former suggests some physical obstruction to the lungs and the latter the breathing of poisoned air.  He believed they were dead for at least an hour before they reached the surface.  They had been taken to the hospital and washed with warm water that would have helped to revive them.  Their pupils were dilated and suggested the inhalation of carbonic acid gas.

The jury found death was due to the effects of a fire in the Burra Mine, which originated from some unknown cause.  They also praised the men who risked their lives endeavouring to save their fellow-miners and in extinguishing the fire.
