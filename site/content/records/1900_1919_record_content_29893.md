Obituary.  Mrs Johanna Farrell, wife of William Farrell and a long time resident of Redruth, died at home on Thursday aged 74.  She came to SA c. 50 years ago from Co. Kilkenny, Ireland and on arrival resided for some time near Mintaro with the Bowan family.  On coming to Burra she was employed at the Pig and Whistle Hotel before taking on the Court House Hotel.  After that she married Constable Farrell of Redruth Police Station.  They took a trip to Ireland and induced the brothers of the deceased (Messrs O’Connell of Petersburg and Nackara) to come to SA.  After returning to SA for a while they let the hotel on lease and retired.

[Apparently born Johanna O’Connell and died 29 June at Redruth aged 74, but note that the age given at death gives a birth year 1837, while that given at marriage gives a birth year 1846.]
