Eyre Peninsula Fires & Burra

CFS groups from Burra, Mt Bryan, Baldina, Booborowie and Farrell Flat combined to hold a carwash and barbecue in the Landmark Car Park last Saturday and raised $1,439.70 for the Eyre Peninsula [Bushfire] Relief Fund.

David Nourse, Chris Reed, Frank Jones, David Spackman, Michael Freak from Burra CFS spent three days attending the Eyre Peninsula fire.

Another CFS crew left for Eyre Peninsula on 18 January with the Mt Bryan fire truck: Dennis Short, Ben Short, Terry Daniels, Kym Thomas & Matt Moran.

Burra Visitor Centre is collecting for the relief fund.

Burraâ€™s five publicans are organising a fundraiser for the relief fund at the Sports Complex next Sunday.  There will be four bands, a sausage sizzle, an auction of donated goods and raffles.

Steve Woolley, who was formerly a Fire Prevention Officer on Eyre Peninsula, visited the West Coast last Wednesday to see if he could help victims.  He says the rebuilding operation will be huge.  In a vast area there are no fences, no tools and no vehicles.  He helped put in some emergency feedlots, but they struggled to find materials.
