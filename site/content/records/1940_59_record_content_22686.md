The End of World War II

News of the Japanese surrender was broadcast at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday 15 August.  The news nearly caught Burra on the wrong leg, because all organised celebrations had been very hurriedly arranged.  Nevertheless, within 15 minutes flags were being run up and pennants strung across the streets.  Market Square and Commercial Street began to fill with excited people.  Children heard the news on the way to school and either gave school ‘a miss’ or on arrival were told it was a holiday.  They were among the first to march up and down the streets singing and, lacking streamers took spare rolls of sanitary paper as a substitute.  Business people soon had windows decorated with symbols of Victory.  After the Thanksgiving Service in the Town Hall people really began to realise that Peace had descended on the Pacific and celebrations really got going.  Mrs S. Sandland, who had brought along bags of pennies, threw them to the youngsters, who were happy to scramble for them, chasing them from one side of the road to the other, quite unperturbed by the tooting of motor horns.  Traffic was held up for some time.  The hokey pokey was being danced in Market Square and flag bedecked cars were soon driving around and even a decorated spring cart, with its horse urged on by the tooting of some sort of ‘musical instrument’.

Unlike the city barmen, those in Burra were not on strike and the hotels were well patronised all day.  At night the shops were lit for the first time in many years and streets were bright.

In the evening there was a welcome home social at the Town Hall for F/O Len Bence, Corporal Bob Morton of the RAAF and Able Seaman Tom Ryan.  F/O/ Jim Warnes had been invited, but was unable to attend.  The Mayor, T.H. Woollacott welcomed the guests home.

The Burra Welfare Committee had carried out a splendid job (under the secretaryship of Mr A.B. Riggs) of seeing that the boys leaving for overseas were suitably farewelled and now that hostilities had ceased would see to it that they were welcomed home by the townspeople.

Mr M.T. Fuller spoke for the RSL and Mr Jennison for the Burra Welfare Committee.

Musical items were given by F/O/ Bence, Mrs Twist and Mr Garrard, who sang a ‘French Rumba’.  Mrs Twist and the Burra North Winsome Warblers then rendered their well-known number, Is ʼe an Aussie’.  Dancing followed into the early hours of the morning.  This spilled out into Market Square, where the crowd dances the Hokey Pokey and formed crocodiles and generally made merry to the strains of an orchestra mounted on a lorry.  A few hoarded fireworks were produced and the occasional rocket set off.  Later the crowd returned to the Town Hall, where eventually the proceedings concluded.

On the following day things were considerably quieter and during the daytime there was little action.  At night a band of young people did lift a piano onto a lorry and drove around the streets singing various songs and included a visit to the hospital to entertain the patients.

The members of the newly formed Salvation Army Band also marched to the Hospital and back and entertained the inmates.

Thursday night saw another dance at the Town Hall.

Thanksgiving Services

On Wednesday afternoon members of the RSL and the VDC, with representatives of the Red Cross, marched through the streets to the Town Hall where one of the largest audiences ever seen in Burra gathered to join in thanksgiving for the declaration of peace, which had been made earlier in the day.

Rev. Cowle opened the meeting by announcing the times for Church Services.  The audience rose and sang the National Anthem, followed by the Doxology and a hymn.  Captain Cox gave an appropriate scripture reading and Rev. Hobbs delivered a Prayer of Thanksgiving, which was followed by The Lord’s Prayer.  Rev. Barrett gave an address on the steadfastness and loyalty of those who had brought victory and of the great sacrifices made and the gratitude earned.

Another hymn followed and then all sang The Song of Australia.

Dr Steele gave an address on behalf of the Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee and paid tribute to the work of the Mayor throughout the war.  He paid tribute to all the service men and women who had contributed to the victory.  Peace would see not only the return of servicemen and women, but also of those who had suffered terrible privations and cruelty as prisoners of war.  The Soldiers’ Welfare Committee would be doing its best to see that service men and women were given employment, good homes and the best educational facilities for their children and to see that the Government carried out its responsibilities to them.

The mayor then introduced Dr Toal [the Catholic priest for Burra] who paid tribute to the fallen and rejoiced with the victors.

Mr G.S. Hawker spoke on behalf of the District Council.

Mr Dollman sang Long Live the King and the audience joined in the chorus.

Mr Jennison, in speaking for the RSL asked people to pour out their money to help rehabilitate service men and women on their return to civil life.  An appeal would soon be made to create comfortable club rooms and it would be a disgrace if that appeal was not fully subscribed.

The Mayor, Mr T.H. Woollacott gave a stirring speech in which he said that promises made to the service personnel as they left would now have to be honoured.  He also paid special tribute to those who had halted the Japanese only 25 miles from Pt Moresby and pursued them through New Guinea and beyond.  He also acknowledged the efforts of Mr Churchill, the late President Roosevelt and the late Mr John Curtin PM.

The service ended with Mrs N. Pearce singing Rule Britannia, with the audience joining in the chorus, followed by a final rendition of The National Anthem sung with much feeling.

The Salvation Army & Victory in the Pacific

Immediately after the broadcast on Wednesday morning Les Gregor sounded Reveille on his cornet, the Citadel doors were thrown open and the drum and flag placed outside.  The children took the Sunday School bells and disturbed the neighbourhood with their ringing.  When the Captain went to ride her bicycle, she found it decorated with flags and streamers.  After the Thanksgiving Service at the Town Hall the Band formed up and marched to the Hospital, where a service was held for the benefit of the patients.  At night an open air service was held, followed by another in the Citadel.  On Thursday the women held a Thanksgiving Service in the afternoon and invited their menfolk to join them with a cup of tea.  A special Victory Cake had been made and all enjoyed the sociability.   There was another march to the Hospital to play hymns to the patients and another open air service at night, this time followed by a social and supper in the Citadel Hall.
