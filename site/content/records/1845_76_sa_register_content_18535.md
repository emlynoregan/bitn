Presentation at Kooringa

A meeting of members of St Mary’s Church took place on Thursday 1 June at the Burra Hotel to present Mr John Winnall with a silver plate on the occasion of his resigning as churchwarden.  Rev. L.W. Stanton presided and after a brief speech in which he spoke highly of Mr Winnall’s services, he presented the piece of plate in the name of the congregation.  The inscription reads:

‘Presented by the congregation of St Mary’s Church, Kooringa, to John Winnall, in recognition of his services as Churchwarden and occasional lay reader during a period of six years.  April 17 1865.’

Mr Winnall briefly responded.

Mr Challoner added his words of appreciation of Mr Winnall’s contribution to the parish.  A vote of thanks was passed to Dr Maurau for choosing the plate and one to Mr T. Bath for his efforts on collecting the subscription.
