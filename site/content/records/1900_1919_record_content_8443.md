Salvation Army.  The Biorama Co. arrived in Burra on Saturday and set up in the Salvation Army Barracks.  The Band was organised to assist.  Pictures on Sunday included Lazarus Raised, The Widow’s Son, The Woman at the Well, Perpetua: An Early Martyr and Jessica’s First Prayer – all were deeply impressive.

On Monday the Band played stirring music in Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen before more pictures were shown.  The proceeds were highly satisfactory.

Cadet Robert Prowse, who was born in Burra and whose father had charge of the local corps was a member of the Biorama Co. visiting Burra.
