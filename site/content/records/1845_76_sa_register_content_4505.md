Port Wakefield

Last week’s Government Gazette contains documents relating to what was lately called Port Henry, in compliment to Sir Henry Young, but which is now to be named Port Wakefield.  It compliments the gentleman upon whose system of colonisation South Australia was established.  Following the withdrawal of the proposed lease, a township will be laid out on Section 2130, with the allotments sold in the usual way.  Leases of the corresponding water frontages will be offered to public competition for terms of 14 years. Lessees will be bound to leave in front of them a breadth of water of not less than 50 ft, assuring access and egress to the upper frontages.

Advertisement.  Township of Wakefield.  Near Port Wakefield at the head of St Vincent’s Gulf.  Plan No. 450.

Lots number from 1 to 127.  Sections 16 to 146 (except 30, 62, 79, 97 & 114) each section is 2 roods, at the price per lot of £5.  Ten lots of water frontages of about 420 ft, each of 1 acre are offered at the upset price of £10 for a 14 year lease and subject to a peppercorn rent.  (Lots 1, 2 & 3 are c. 1 acre and the others are 1 acre less the breadth of a road.)  Charles Sturt, Colonial Secretary.
