The Burra Burra Carriers’ Intended Strike

Correspondence from ‘Teamster’

People are disputing my assertion that supplies in Burra Burra are 40% dearer that in Adelaide.  Meat and butter are the same price, but overall the cost of living is 40% higher.  Everything else has to be transported 100 miles overland.  Most consumable articles are highly damageable and perishable from the summer’s heat and the winter’s rains, and these losses further increase costs.

[The writer than writes 3 paragraphs ridiculing the nine charges brought against the Register editor by the nine Directors and ends by suggesting that 500 teamsters would come to his aid to defend their defender.]

The last news he had was that the Directors had decided not to grant the teamsters their demands.  The teamsters are determined to persevere because:

The Directors cannot help themselves as their ships are already on demurrage.

They cannot do without the ore being brought down, because their account is overdrawn some £40,000 or £50,000 – as one of their wise men said in confidence to a hundred persons.

Was this said to depress the share price to £100 so that the wise man might buy back at that what he had sold at £200?

[The writer goes on at some length to suggest the difficulties that will ensue for the Association if they do not pay the teamsters more.  He wonders where they will get the funds for the next dividend and refers obliquely to a report from England that antimony had been found in some ore, which would diminish its value.]

The editor then confirms the antimony report and also reveals that a recent fire in a cargo if copper ore from Cuba and the loss of a vessel from this colony had caused the underwriters at Lloyd’s to increase insurance rates from 5% to 6%.
