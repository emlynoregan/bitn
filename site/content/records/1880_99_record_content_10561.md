4 September.  The whole Board, excepting Mr Lockyer met at the appointed place, and after making an inspection resolved that while the premises examined are in a bad state of repair, and some of the rooms on the north and west sides are far too damp for occupation as bedrooms and should immediately be repaired, the Board of Health do not consider that there is sufficient danger to public health and safety to call for their present interference.  Also that the occupier be warned, that unless the necessary repairs be effected and dampness remedied within one month, the Board will step in and declare the rooms uninhabitable.  Meeting then adjourned.
