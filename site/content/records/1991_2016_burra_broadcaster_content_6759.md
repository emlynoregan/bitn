Letter.  The BBH Netball Club Committee responded to recent accusations of unfairness in the selection of squads.  They outlined the parameters that had been agreed to in 1993 and pointed out that a solution for the excess numbers was to enter a C grade team at Spalding, but no response had been received to this proposal.  Forming a committee this year had proved difficult and it had taken two attempts to hold an AGM, just to meet quorum requirements.
