BCS.  The Grounds and Surrounds Sub-Committee has recommended the planting of a large number of trees and $200 has so far been allocated for their purchase.  The first stage will see 116 trees planted along the northern boundary.  Further plantings will then be made along Smelts Road, the Agricultural Area overlooking the Creek and then a grove to the west of the new secondary building.
