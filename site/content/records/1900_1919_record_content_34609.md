C. Fuss of Aberdeen showed us, last week, beautiful specimens of ore from the Radium Extraction Co.’s mine to the northeast of Leigh’s Creek.  It scintillated with all the colours of the rainbow.  2 cwt of the ore sold in London for £200 and it averages c. £15 a ton.  The mine uses primitive methods to get about 10 tons a fortnight.  Mr Fuss has made two trips to the mine under considerable difficulties – some of the distance being through ranges on camel back.
