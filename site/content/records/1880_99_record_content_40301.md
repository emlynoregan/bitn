T. Pearce then asked on behalf of the lodges that closet and urinal accommodation be provided for lodge use.

The President said a notice re this was lying on the table to be discussed this meeting and the other matters would be considered and replied to.

A committee was appointed to consider the best mode of improving sanitary arrangements at the Institute, comprising the President (T. Edwards), Mr Wilkinson and Drs Brummitt & Sangster.

The request of the lodges required further debate and was adjourned to the next meeting.
