Tree Planting continued in the reserve at the lower end of Taylor Street at Burra North when Year 9 Science students met with Natural Resources Management Officer, Andy Nicholls and Burra Creek Committee members Bruce and Celine Stockman.  More than 120 trees were planted in less than an hour.  They were undeterred by a recent spate of vandalism that saw young trees uprooted.
