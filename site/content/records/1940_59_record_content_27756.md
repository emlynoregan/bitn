Burra Town Council is anxious to see the removal of some unsightly buildings around the town.  The Mayor said some were sub-standard houses that were still inhabited.

Cr Carpenter, who raised the question, said he was only referring to uninhabited buildings.

The power of the Council to act will be ascertained.

The Council has voted to support the attempt by Messrs Freer & Scott of the Burra Passenger Service for permission to run a Sunday road service to and from Adelaide.  It would depart Burra at 2 p.m. on Sunday and leave Adelaide on the return run at 7 p.m.  This would help visitors who could come on the Friday night train and return on Sunday by coach.

At a recent Council meeting it was resolved to lop certain trees in the town.  The Council has been trying for some time to get the gum trees leading to Victoria Park lopped because they were becoming dangerous.  So far no one has been willing to take on the job.  The Council has now called tenders for lopping all gum trees from the intersection of Welsh Place and Paxton Terrace to and including Victoria Park.

Mr G.S. Hawker has won the LCL Plebiscite to become the endorsed LCL candidate for the next election. [State Parliament.]
