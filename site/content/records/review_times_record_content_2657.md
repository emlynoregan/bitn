1986 Jubilee Float.  The float is making progress.  Nick van Buuren and Glen Ward are building a two-and-a-half metre model of Morphett’s Pumphouse, complete with a steam engine, which will be a feature of the float.  Also on the float will be ore stampers, a trommel-screen and a timber replica of a miner’s home, based on a Paxton Square cottage.  The display will be mounted on a 12-metre trailer, which will also carry paintings of the interior of the mine by BCS Art Teacher Mr roger Boehm.  The $2,100 cost has been supplied by the mine and local sporting bodies, but donations are still needed.  It is hoped that six adults and eight children in period costume will accompany the float.
