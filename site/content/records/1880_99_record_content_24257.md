Characteristics of the 1886 paper.

Page 1.

A mixture of large and small advertisements: mostly local, but some from Adelaide or general.  Larger items dominated, notably those of F.H. Faulding (Patent Medicines), Cross’s Indigestion Drops and G. & W. Shierlaw of Glascow [sic] House Hindley St Adelaide.

Page 2.

Some small advertisements and many for sales of stock, property and of furnishings and equipment.  Public notices relating to Council and Government matters, churches and entertainment.  Market reports.  Editorials and/or leading articles.  Short items of local news with a few more extended ones.  A column headed ‘Items’ sometimes contains very brief items, which can be quite cryptic.  This is sometimes on page 3.

Page 3.

Overflow from page 2.  Some small advertisements. Mostly the news here is not local and sometimes the items are non-news articles of more general interest and jokes.  Some longer local items and letters including lengthy effusions from favoured contributors.

Page 4.

Larger non-local advertisements dominated by patent medicines, except for the large one for the Burra Record & General Printing Office.  There is usually some poetry and a novel in serial form.

The editorial must often have been on matters of little interest to the general reader.
