Obituary.  Miss Bessie Young, sister of Mrs C. Woollacott of Redruth, died at Tyabb, Victoria on 2 July.  She was the only sister of Mrs Woollacott and a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Young of Aberdeen and spent her early days in Burra and has been a frequent visitor since.  The doctor stated she had died very suddenly from a blood clot from a gum boil going first to her temple and thence to the brain.  [Born Elizabeth Selina Young 11 December 1861 at Ashmore (Burra).]
