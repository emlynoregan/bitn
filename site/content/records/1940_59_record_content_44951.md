Burra School lavatories were inspected by the local Board of Health on 20 March and were then worse than when previously inspected.  They were a disgrace.  Work was also needed on the yard and rooms.  The Chief Secretary replied on the matter, that the contractor had experienced difficulties in obtaining essential materials and was currently working at Pinnaroo.  Work would begin at Burra within 14 days.  The work of installing a septic system began on Friday.
