Annie Howell’s Court Case is reported in over four columns.  [Apparently mainly for its entertainment value.]  Heard before T.W. Wilkinson & A. Harris JPs.

Annie Howell was charged with seeking to rescue one grey horse, one spring dray and a set of single harness, which had been seized by the bailiff – also charged was her husband, John Howell.

Mrs Howell objected to the case being heard as her witnesses were absent.

R.L. Giles, bailiff:

On 12 January went to Mongolata to execute two warrants – one for £7-16-6 and the other for 15-12-6.  The Howells refused to hear the warrants or to pay up.

(Annie interrupted to say they had the Attorney General’s advice not to pay.)

On attempting to seize the horse Mrs Howell said it belongs to John Howell.  The second warrant was for John Howell and he said the horse belongs to Mr Barker.  The debt is in consequence of a court verdict in 1898.

Howell said he would rather go to jail than pay.

The bailiff had then seized the items as above.

The bailiff then claimed that Mrs Howell urged her husband to get a gun and shoot them and then get an axe and kill the horse – stick them with a knife.

Mrs Howell continually interrupted the evidence with dramatic gestures and exclamations of denial and was ultimately threatened with removal to the back of the court.

The bailiff offered to go to Mr Barker’s to ascertain the ownership of the horse – Mrs Howell insisted on accompanying him, riding with the two bailiffs in their buggy.  Howell followed with the dray.

On the way they stopped at Mr Jones’s at Mongolata and at his invitation had dinner.  Mrs Howell objected that she was left in the trap all the while.  After dinner the bailiff found that the Howells had gone off in the dray.  They followed the dray tracks into the hills and found Mrs Howell sitting in the dray in the ranges.  Mrs Howell interrupted to say it was on a three chain road short cut to Barker’s.  They went on and near Barker’s met with Howell coming back to say that Barker was not home.  The bailiffs decided to go into Burra.  Mrs Howell tried to eject the assistant bailiff from the dray and Howell seized the horse and tried to unfasten the reins.

Mr W. Moore, who had been picked up at Jones’s and was the son of E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff, helped to restrain Howell who then rushed to the side of the horse and tried to unfasten the trace.

Mrs Howell suggested they go to see Mrs Barker and examine Mr Barker’s cheque book [as evidence of his ownership of the horse.]

They went to Mr Barker’s where Mr Giles ordered Mr Moore to drive the dray to Burra.  Howell again tried to unfasten the reins.  W. Moore then held Howell while the dray was driven off and Moore then made a run for the trap with Giles and they drive off with Howell heaving a large stone at them.

The cross examination by the Howells was dramatic and rather frenetic and in the end profitless for them.

E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff gave evidence confirming that of Giles, the bailiff and W. Moore’s evidence was corroborative.

Mrs Howell said she was in bed very, very ill on 12 January and got up when Giles arrived.

She claimed ‘They have taken all I had . . . By burning me out and taking me to court.’

(Clarified after objection – that the ‘they’ of the burning were in fact unknown.)

She claimed that Giles had insisted on her going with them to Baker’s [whereas his evidence had her insisting on coming along.]
