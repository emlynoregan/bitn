‘Factotum’ writes objecting at some length to the measures apparently taken by Council to overcome the dog problem.  If indeed a bitch was used to lure dogs it was a vile and indecent act and ratepayers should ascertain how Councillors came by the right to use a decoy and if all dogs so captured were indeed stray of committing a nuisance.  It is a clear case for the SPCA.
