Belgian Relief Fund.  There is considerable enthusiasm to take up the challenge for further money raising.  Mr McLaren as secretary of the fund has sent off another £70 from the sum raised.  The Mayor has arranged a band concert for Friday night.  Mr Lane will lend his shop next to the Savings Bank as a depot for goods to be auctioned.  Mr McLaren offered to do the auctioning.  Mr Walker thought stores with old stock might make a donation.  A weekly donation scheme was also suggested.  The above were all endorsed by a public meeting at which nearly £18 was immediately promised.  The Musical Committee meeting saw the Hockey Club agree to give a concert and Miss Pearce will arrange a ‘Birthday Party’ and Miss Bullen a Children’s Concert.  The Brass Band concert last Friday raised £3-15-10.  The town will be canvassed with weekly subscription cards.  The fund now totals £259-6-10.
