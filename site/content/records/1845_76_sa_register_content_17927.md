Accident.  Mr Harris was proceeding north with a survey party last Saturday with a dray loaded with almost a ton of rations etc.  At a steep slope about six miles beyond Chewing’s station and 36 miles north of Burra, the two leaders headed down slope just as a wheel passed over a stone and the dray was hurled completely over.  Mr Harris was seated in the front between the driver and Mr Morris, a surveyor.  The other two were thrown clear, but Mr Harris seems to have been struck on the hip by the falling load and the iron rail of the dray came down on the small of his back.  He could not be released for almost ten minutes.  Medical aid was sent for and a gentleman recently arrived by the Murray travelled all night and found Mr Harris in a very low state.  After treatment Mr Morris constructed an ingenious litter and Mr Harris was conveyed carefully to Burra where he is being attended by the Doctor and Mrs Harris.
