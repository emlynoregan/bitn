Baldina Mongolata Gold Mining Syndicate.  Manager’s report for fortnight to 23 August.

Farnden’s Hill.  The drive north from Riggs’ Open Cut was extended 8 feet to 181 feet.  The leader has split into three and looks promising, but carries so far no values.  The stope advanced 7 feet to 55 feet with no values.
