Presentations were made to Ex-Councillors J. Sampson & D.J. O’Leary at the Council Chamber at the Institute last Wednesday.  The Mayor, W. West, presided.

Ex-Councillor Sampson had given 13 years service and Ex-Councillor O’Leary 4 years.  The Mayor spoke of their selfless service and the signatures of 107 ratepayers spoke of the general satisfaction with their efforts.  [Since it is said there were 60 signatures on each address, presumably they represented 107 different people.]

John Sampson spoke in reply, saying he was the first to speak of borrowing money to improve the town and met with great opposition, but he was sure it would ensure the success of the town.  He referred to the barrenness of the town 30 years earlier, when he came to it, and gave an interesting account of it in those times.  The Burra Oval had been held up as a white elephant, but is now acknowledged to be a benefit to the town.  He said he was the town’s oldest resident, having arrived about 44 years ago and he had seen many changes.  He could recall several hills in Kooringa being covered with sheoak, whipstick mallee and other variety.

Mr O’Leary expressed surprise at the occasion and spoke of how they had worked well together for the town and differences were settled in the Council Chamber and they were soon friends again.  He also spoke of harmonious work with Cr Watt.  He considered the Waterworks important for the town.

Councillor G. Parks spoke in support of the former Councillors as did Crs Watt & Rabbich, the Town Clerk W. Davey & Mr T.T. Shortridge.

An adjournment was then made to the Burra Hotel for refreshments, speeches, songs and recitations.
