Obituary.  George Brown of Hampton died at Burra Hospital on 10 October [though it says 9 October on page 2] aged 66.  Six of his sons served in the Great War and we believe all returned.  A widow and large family of grown-up children survive.  [See also XXXXIXI, 43, 24 Oct. 1928, page 3 where it is corrected to five sons serving in the Great War.]
