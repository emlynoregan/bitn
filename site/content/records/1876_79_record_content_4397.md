Rabbit Problem. Long 2nd leader. Dynamite has been found wanting, as have sulphur fumes producing machines. Mr G.A. Gebhardt has had great success with bi-sulphide of carbon. This is available at 2/6 per oz. As a fluid and an ounce will do several large warrens. A little on a rag on a small stick is placed in a hole and the mouth of the warren is blocked. The fumes then circulate and suffocate the rabbits. As the animals are not poisoned the carcases are not dangerous to dogs or pigs.
