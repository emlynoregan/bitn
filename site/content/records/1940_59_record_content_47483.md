Mr McIntosh, Minister of Railways, responded to a question from Messrs Hawker and Quirke MPs, asking if the Riverton Refreshment Rooms could be kept open for trains other than the Broken Hill express.  He said the matter was always under review, but at present they could not get staff and until they could obtain waitresses, it was not feasible to do so.
