Captain Finniss [Deputy Surveyor-General and Commissioner of Police] reached home after visiting Moorunde and the Kapunda, Burra Burra and Princess Royal Mines.  He visited the various police stations as far as Mount Remarkable, having ridden some 420 miles.

He reports that there is little doubt that the flock of Mr Tennent and two shepherds have fallen into the hands of the natives.  [Details of this incident and the recovery of 50 sheep are printed.]

Mr Finniss reports himself perfectly surprised at the Burra Burra [Mine].
