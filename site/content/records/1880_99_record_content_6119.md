Burra Life - A slightly oblique attack on some aspects of town life, which no doubt was clearer to the locals of the day.

It condemns the bad language from a skittle saloon, formerly a Blacksmith’s shop in Commercial St (‘on the lower side’).

Also there is reference to a lover’s land ‘up a secluded glen, once a well known road to a great mine, and nearly opposite to where now stands a large flour mill’

‘the sound of osculatory process came to my ear.’
