Cappen Dick came down to give me a whack.

I had a stick

An’ I broke his back.

It would tell of the big melting; of the little engine house and the sluices of flowing water; of the batteries with their never ceasing pound and rattle; of the water wheel and the groups of men employed at the various plats, and of many other things.

When the engine house was burnt down by mischievous boys, ‘That there MAN’ crashed badly, but someone rescued him and he now stands, or rather revolves, on a pedestal in a paddock near the entrance to the mine nearly opposite to him once stood a battery of stamps and a huge waterwheel sent a stream of water flashing and dancing in the sunshine.  Both now are gone but as he slowly revolves he seems to be recalling former scenes, himself alone a relic of a vanished past.
