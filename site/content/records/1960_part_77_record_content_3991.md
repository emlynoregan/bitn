Burra Races last Wednesday had to contend with wind and patchy rain, but nevertheless had a crowd of c. 1,500.  Twenty-two bookmakers attended.  The club expects to make a small profit.  [Results are printed.]

The Burra Cup was won by Tod Star ridden by Raven.

There were two minor accidents.  In the First Maiden Woolyarn fell, but the jockey, Nadels, escaped injury and in the Improvers the jockey J. Letts had his leg jammed against the barrier stalls by Canunda and had to withdraw, being replaced by A. Alma.
