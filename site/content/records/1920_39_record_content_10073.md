Obituary.  William Henry Vivian died on Saturday at his residence ‘Oakland’ Cheltenham St Rosefield.  He was a resident of Burra for 57 years.  Beneath a rugged exterior he was known to have a kindly and sympathetic heart and had boundless generosity.  He was born in Penzance Cornwall in 1846 and arrived in SA with his parents in the Hoogly in 1855.  They soon came to Burra in a bullock wagon.  His father was a collector employed by the Burra Copper Mining Co.  Harry was a teamster for 19 years carrying supplies to The Barrier and to stations.  In 1880 he took the lease of Opie’s Hotel and in 1885 moved to the Commercial Hotel where he stayed for 26 years, retiring to Adelaide in 1912.  In 1869 he married Miss Elizabeth Watkins of Hampton who died in 1885.  He later married Miss B. Yeo.  There are seven children from the first marriage and three from the second.  His widow and 8 children survive:

Mrs W. Ewins (Kooringa), Mr T. Vivian (Knightsbridge), Walter Vivian (Broken Hill), William Vivian (Medindie), Mrs H. Tame (Unley), Herbert Vivian (Glenelg), Miss Nellie Vivian (Kooringa) and Miss Rite Vivian (Adelaide).  [Died 27 January 1923 aged 76.]
