Letter from Pte R. Woollacott, 18 January, from the front in France.  He writes of life alternating between the front line and resting further back – perhaps 2-3 days up and then 24 hours respite.  Trenches 5’ deep and 2-4’ wide and at times up to 15” deep in sloppy mud.  He describes day-to-day duty is some detail for c. 1⅓ columns.
