Burra Burra DC

Construction of the cycle/pedestrian path on the eastern side of the creek is proceeding on schedule and it will be sealed early in 1982.

Work on the beautification project is also proceeding:

The creek has been widened at the northern end [the St Just Street Ford area.]

After Christmas shutdown parking areas will be constructed, grasses sown and trees planted.

A Jubilee 150 Fund has been established to assist with funding projects for the jubilee year.
