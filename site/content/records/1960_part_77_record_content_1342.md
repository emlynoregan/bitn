Burra Institute

President F. Atkin presented his annual report.  Membership was steady.  About 250 new books were added to the library.  Cataloguing has been a long job, but is now nearing completion.  Circulation of books and magazines has been about 7,500 for the year.    The library holds c. 6,823 books.  Membership at 31 December was 126 adults, 35 scholarship, 18 juveniles and 1 life member for a total of 180.

The New Year began in credit £12-1-4 and ended in credit £23-2-11.

Thanks to the Town and District Councils who each gave a grant of £5.

The Government subsidy of £50 is vital for the continuation of the Library.  £63 was spent on books, freight, insurance, repairs and sundries.  £120 for the Librarian’s salary and £40 on magazine subscriptions.  Subscriptions bring in £135, so the need for grants, subsidies and money raising efforts is obvious.
