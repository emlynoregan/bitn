Mr J.S. Pryor and the Burra Record.

In the last issue several letters appeared which reflected on that gentleman.  We take the first opportunity of refuting the statements in the said letters the import of which escaped our notice in the rush of business.  There was not the slightest compulsion about our signing the apology which appears in another column.  Mr Pryor displayed a genuine Christian spirit throughout the whole proceedings and accepted the apology mentioned.  We are sorry the letters appeared and we do not believe there is a word of truth in any of them so far as they reflect on Mr Pryorâ€™s character.
