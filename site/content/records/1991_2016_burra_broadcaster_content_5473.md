Accident.  A semi-trailer loaded with groceries overturned on 19 December 1994 and ended up in Richard Rigg’s paddock.  The manager of Hi-Speed Transport has since sent cheques totalling $1,000 to the local volunteer organisations that helped with the clean-up.  The rollover occurred 10 km north of Burra on the Barrier Highway.  The driver escaped with a broken hand.  [Photo.]
