The Burra Burra Contribution to the Exhibition of All Nations in London in 1851

Yesterday and on Tuesday the Directors of the SA Mining Association arranged for a display in the Directors’ Board Room of the specimens of copper ore and metallic copper, which they are sending to London for the Exhibition next year.  Visitors to this display have included the Governor and Lady Young, the Lord Bishop and the elite of SA society.  There were about a thousand other visitors ranging from those attired in fashionable dress to those in the more homely attire of the rural interior.  All were granted free admission and polite courtesy by Mr Ayers, the company secretary and Mr Phillips, who took special charge of the display.

On entering we saw the various curious and magnificent specimens and heaps of native copper, but our notice was especially drawn to a large lump of ore displayed in an upturned case and of a quality likely to yield 45% copper metal.  It weighed, we think, not less than 8 cwt and came from the 30 fathom level of one of the lodes.  There was also a smaller, but even richer specimen from the same lode at the 40 fathom level.  The monster lode itself is said to have a breadth of 15 fathoms within two well defined ‘walls’; the lode holding good above the 30 fathom and below the 40 fathom.  It is said that were it practicable or desirable to do so a twenty or even 50 ton lump might be obtained in one piece.  Ores exceeding £18 in average value are now being delivered to the Association at a total cost for mining and raising of not more than 18/- per ton.  After hearing this we may not be so amazed at the marvellous dividends of 200% per quarter.

Among the brilliant specimens of red oxide, malachite, green carbonate, virgin copper and copper in a merchantable state, we must not forget to laud the first fruits of the Association’s new mine at Karkulto (the section at Emu Springs), purchased at the last Government Land Sale for something above £10,000.

The eight bags of admirable samples of SA wheat, barley and oats, and the SA Company’s case of olive oil, all prepared for the Exhibition of All Nations, were also examined by the visitors.

‘England, if properly instructed as to the vast capabilities of these colonies, cannot fail to view them with feelings of pride and exultation as valuable portions of the British Empire.’
