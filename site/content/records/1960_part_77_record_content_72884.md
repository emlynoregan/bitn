Obituary.  Monsignor Patrick Valentine Hughes died on 18 September.  After his retirement he lived at Port Pirie for a year with the Bishop, before moving to ‘Villa Beovich’ at Myrtle Bank, a new home for retired priests conducted by the Little Sisters of the Poor.  The funeral was at Burra on Friday at 11 a.m. when Bishop Gallagher of Port Pirie was the Principal Celebrant at the Requiem Mass, assisted by Father Kevin Matthews of Burra, Mons. Thomas Horgan, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Adelaide and twenty-eight priests.  Place of honour was given to Archbishop Beovich of Adelaide, who studied in Rome with Monsignor Hughes.  Friends came from Renmark and Barmera where he had been Parish Priest as well as from elsewhere in SA.  He was a gentle and frugal man with a great zeal for his faith and a love for children.  He was born in 1891 and educated at St Augustine’s Geelong, Victoria, Mt Melleray Seminary, Ireland and at the Propaganda Fide College in Rome.  After ordination in Rome by Cardinal Pompili in 1926 he went to SA and the then Diocese of Port Augusta.  He served as assistant priest in Peterborough, Port Augusta and Port Pirie and was locum tenens at Carrieton before becoming Parish Priest at Renmark and later at Burra, where he was a familiar and respected figure until his retirement several years ago.
