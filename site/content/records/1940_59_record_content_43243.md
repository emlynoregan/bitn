St Mary’s.  Temple Day was held on Sunday with a Sung Eucharist at 11 a.m. when the celebrant was Rev. R.S.T. Pettet assisted by Ven. Arch-Deacon T. Thornton Reed of Adelaide.  Lunch followed in the hall.  In the afternoon Festal Evensong was preceded by an organ recital by Clem Davey.  The object of the day was to raise £250 to wipe out the church overdraft and this was achieved.
