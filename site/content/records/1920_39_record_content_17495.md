Obituary.  Henry Webster, husband of Elizabeth Webster of Kooringa, died at his residence ‘Shafton’ Kooringa on 9 November aged 71.  [Note that in the previous issue his death was said to have occurred on his property at Ironmine.  The registration of death agrees with the date and age and lists the place as ‘near Burra’ which tends to support the Ironmine version.]

[A portion of the obituary at the bottom of column 7 is missing.]

He left home aged 21 and went to Queensland where he carted stores with a bullock team to Hungerford Station.  Later he took building jobs for Mr Hungerford – first the homestead there: a two-roomed house and cellar.  He saved £300 and sent it by mailman to be banked at Clare.  The mailman lost his way and died and his mails were lost, but the bag was found twelve months later hanging on a tree by some blacks and the contents eventually reached their destination.  When Broken Hill came into prominence he became a carter on that track for several years before taking land at Yacka and while there he married Elizabeth Cadzow, the second daughter of Michael Cadzow of Mannanarie.  He tried his hand at the Coolgardie diggings without success and on returning sold the Yacka farm and went to one at Wandearah near Port Pirie for 12 years.  In 1903 he sold that and bought a portion of Shafton Estate where he was the first arrival.  He was badly shaken by being thrown from his buggy on show day and though apparently not badly hurt it is believed this triggered the heart attack which resulted in his death.  He leaves a widow, three sons and one daughter: John (Hallett), Henry & Crawford (Shafton) and Mrs L. Williamson (Hanson) and three grandchildren.
