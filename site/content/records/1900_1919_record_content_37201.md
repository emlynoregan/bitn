The Mayor said the Board was believed to be about to ask the townspeople for assistance, but expected this without allowing the town representation.  The mayor had also asked why the press was excluded from Board meetings.

Cr Lane moved that the Members for the District ask the Chief Secretary to make provision for the representation of the town.
