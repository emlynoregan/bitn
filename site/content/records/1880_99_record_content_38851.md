The Waterworks.

These began the year in credit £105-5-4, collected £656-12-6 in rates and will be in credit an estimated £255-18-2 at the end of the year.  This represents a profit this year of £115-12-10, despite reducing the rates by £197-10-0.

We anticipate a fall in rates for the next year due to the lower assessment and with the same rate in the £ we anticipate a loss next year on this basis of £3-0-5, which can easily be taken care of from the accumulated credit.

We succeeded in having the Capital Account reduced by £640, which saves £32 p.a. in interest.  Mr P.L. Killicoat donated the pipes to enable the water to be laid on to the oval.

The timber in the well is rotten and we have applied for it to be replaced and also for the pumps to be raised, as they have been working badly.  This work will be done immediately.  The Government will also lay on water to the state school.  The cost in each case will be added to the Capital Account.

Trees.  In the year 549 were planted: 52 in East Ward, 41 in North Ward and 426 in No. 2 Reserve at Redruth.  The trees and carriage cost £12-3-5 while other costs brought the total to £47-5-10.

c. 500 trees planted previously had died and were replaced.  Subscriptions of funds for trees totalled £47-5-10.  The planting of No. 2 Reserve was planned to be the School’s Arbor Day, but it was wet and so were two other days chosen and eventually it was abandoned for this year.

£34 was sent to the Mayor of Bourke for the Bourke Relief Fund.

Sunday Closing.  Legal opinion is that a fresh poll is needed if the ratepayers of East & West Wards desire Sunday Closing.  Six years ago the poll in favour was taken when the Middle and South Wards were the arrangement.

The Council has decided not to bring the town under the Sparrow Act, as it would involve increasing taxation.

Health.  Last year the death rate was high, but this year it has fallen back to normal and sanitary conditions are good.

The enlargement of the cemetery will have to be done soon, but has been deferred for this year.

Anticipated income for 1891:

Credit balance	£75

Rates	£450

Subsidy	£112-10-0

Dog fees etc.	£83

Expenditure on bonds & working expenses	£512

Available for public works	£208-10-0

Report adopted.

Cr W. Hardy thought the financial position was satisfactory.  He regretted being saddled with the Waterworks, but they had to make the best of it.

Cr Rabbich agreed about the finances.  Two years ago things were not so good with a debt of £250 and £300 [due] in bonds, but with economy and receiving licence fees they had managed well – greatly assisted by the Town Clerk.  In 1888 the Waterworks was handed over to the Government – a move he had opposed, as he believed that the Council could always work them more efficiently than the Government.  This had been proved when they returned to Council control.  The planting of No. 2 Reserve was good work he had initiated.

(Cr Sampson: You promised to see it paid for and have not done it.)

Cr Watt felt the Mayor’s report covered the story and he would simply say he had done his best for the town.

Cr O’Leary said West Ward compared favourably with the others and he did not think, as some had said, that the Waterworks were a white elephant.  He thought tree planting should be restrained for a while until the Parklands liability was reduced.

Mr Pinch said he would stand for Mayor.  Finances were not all that good and after redeeming the bond there would be little enough left for public works.

Mr West, also standing for Mayor, said he had been a resident for 33 years.

W.T. Rabbich & W.H. Linkson will stand for North Ward.

C.C. Williams & W.H. Hardy will stand for East Ward.

J.A. Watt will stand for West Ward.
