History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr, No. 3.

The copper deposits at Burra were different from elsewhere in that down to 40 fathoms the ore was a jumble of patches of rich copper ore in irregular and often unexpected places.  It was easily worked with little blasting required, but the miners all expected ‘she would make down’.

The Bon Accord Mine was sunk to 50 fathoms where they cut a proper fissure lode.  John Nickles of Copperhouse worked on it and it embraced the width of the engine shaft and its depth and direction suggested it was a continuation of the Burra lode.

As for Princess Royal, Mr John Nickle and F. Harris, father of the esteemed present townsman, worked there too.  They found good malachite a few feet down.  In all probability there is a connection between the two mines, but companies would have to be prepared to go deeper than the Burra Co. that only scratched the surface.  I lived on the Burra Mine in the 40s and early 50s and as a whim boy hauled hundreds of tons of rich ore from every level and nearly every shaft.  Mt father was the timberman who inspected the mine daily to see timber was secure.  Much rich ore was washed into the Burra Creek in periodic summer thunderstorms and no doubt lies buried under silt brought down from the Mt Bryan watershed.  The bed of the creek now being some ten feet higher than originally.
