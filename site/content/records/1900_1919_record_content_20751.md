The Governor, Sir George Le Hunte, paid a semi-private visit to inspect the Reformatory, School and Hospital in a short three-hour visit.  He was met by Dr Sangster in his car.  Mrs Holden conducted the Governor around the Reformatory.  Headmaster, George Scott, and the chairman of the School Board of Advice, Dr Sangster Sen., showed him around the school.  The Corps of Cadets formed a guard of honour.  After looking at the building and visiting classes there was an assembly.  Lunch was taken at Dr Sangsterâ€™s and the Hospital Board met him at the Hospital in the afternoon before he took the afternoon train to Adelaide.
