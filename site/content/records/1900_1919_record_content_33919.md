Burra Town Council, 17 March.

Council resolved to try tar dressing of a road experimentally for a chain or two.

The Burra Band asked for the use of the Council Depot for practice on Sunday mornings.  They regret the day, but can find no other.

Cr Wicklein was opposed, as there was a church right opposite.

The Mayor understood the band was practising in Victoria Park without permission and he would not care for the Council to officially sanction even that.

Cr Wickleinâ€™s motion denying the request was passed.

Local Board of Health.

Mr Slattery of the Royal Exchange Hotel wrote that the Inspector of Hotels had ordered the removal of urinals and installation of a pan system.  He had pointed out that this was not in operation in the town, but to no avail.

Cr Lane thought the pan system an abomination whether carried out in the night or the day.  The Council should do all in its power to stop its use anywhere except where absolutely necessary.

Council approved the removal of the urinals.

Kooringa Post Office.  Complaints about the poor lighting at the post office continue.
