Mr George Herbert was entertained at Frank Harris’s shop on Tuesday 16 August to congratulate him on 50 years work for J.T. Walker & Sons bootmakers.  He was congratulated by the Mayor.  Mr Herbert had been known as a footballer, cricketer and rifleman and now as a bowler.  He was presented with a travelling bag.  Mr A.L. Walker spoke in support.  J.T. Walker had established the firm in 1872.  William Walker (J.T.’s father) was a contractor on the Mt Barker railway and was responsible for several tunnels on the line and also for part of the northern line.  After an expensive legal case which caused him expenses of £30,000 W. Walker took up farming at Red Hill.  J.T. Walker learnt his bootmaking in Melbourne and later began business in Mt Barker, coming to Burra in 1873 and began in the premises now occupied by Mr Terry (tailor).  All boots were then hand made.  Mr G. Herbert joined the firm 14 August 1882 when they were employing as bootmakers Mr M. Pederson, Mr A. Topperwein, George Herbert, Joe Kellaway, Jim Kellaway, T. McInnes, F. Wilson and J.T. Walker.  Mr Pederson was in charge of the workshop.  They had branches at Jamestown, Terowie, Peterborough and Broken Hill.  In 50 years they had never had a dispute or cross word with Mr Herbert.  Mr Pederson said he was pleased to see George looking so strong and healthy after 50 years of work.  C.J. Pearce added his congratulations.  He remembered the Walkers when they started and their employees included Albert Oppermann and Bill Anderson.  J. Drew recalled George as a youngster.  He was always known as ‘King’ to his pals.  G. Dane & E.J. Davey endorsed the remarks.  Mr Herbert responded briefly (saying in passing that Mr Pederson taught the crowd their trade and was the manager).
