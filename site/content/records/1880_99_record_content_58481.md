Editorial on The Court of Appeal.

Sixty-three appeals were sent in and eight were withdrawn at the last moment.  In the remainder reductions totalling £33 were made: the largest being one of £5.  Cr Hardy wrote out a number of the appeals and not one of those appellants put in an appearance.  This is a queer coincidence, but ‘ratepayers can expect nothing else while they allow such representation in the Council’. 

A better plan would have been for Council to have made a reduction all round and to have saved £25.  ‘It was monstrous and unworthy of the position of councillor to make himself officious in getting ratepayers to appeal.’
