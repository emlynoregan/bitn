Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co. half-yearly report.

Development in the period cost £374-8-2 in the area mainly of Peacock’s Shaft and Peacock’s Bye-shaft.  20 tons of ore assaying at 23-35% was sent to Wallaroo.  The company has contracted with Messrs C.A. Smith & Co. to lower the water level in the mine from 25 to 50 feet, on most satisfactory terms.

C.A. Fuss has returned from Paull’s Consolidated Copper Mine.  He reports the mine looks good and erection of the big plant is being pushed on with and should be finished in about two months. The ore bodies now showing promise big returns when treated by the plant.
