Break and Enter.  On the night of 21-22 November the Burra Supermarket was entered by way of a side window.  Cash to the value of c. $500 and some cigarettes were stolen.  On the same night Drew & Crewe’s Shop next to the supermarket was also entered by a rear door.  Though nothing seems to have been stolen, damage was assessed at c. $300.
