Burra Bowling Club

The opening of the 1958-59 season came as the culmination of a three year plan of improvement made possible by a £500 bequest from the late E.F. Marston.  President G. Dollman and President of the Associates Mrs Field welcomed members and visitors.  Mr Dollman thanked all those who had helped, especially the Town Council and Mr Dudley Jacka and Messrs Bert Wardle & Sons for their earthmoving equipment.  He called on Mr A.G. Owen-Smyth to declare the greens open.  He congratulated the club on the extension to the greens and their part in forming the new North-Eastern Bowling Association and for the help given to the new club at Hallett.  Mrs Owen-Smyth then put down the first bowl.  The Immediate Past President Mr H. Binks-Williams then unveiled the plaque on the Memorial Gate.  Mr Binks-Williams had been the instigating force behind the major changes Mr Dollman said.  Mr Binks-Williams thanked all who helped – a list too numerous to read out, But Mr Dudley Jacka had been of outstanding assistance and Mr Colin Parker had completed the Memorial Gate at about 50% of cost.  The Mayor and Mayoress attended the ceremony.
