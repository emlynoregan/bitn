Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate; fortnight to 2 June

J.E. Hogan reports having sunk the shaft to 39ft; timbered where necessary.  The leader was now 5” wide with values estimated at 2-3oz per ton.

At 39ft level started driving on a leader north and south.  North to 8ft and south to 4ft.

Expected to crush 25 tons on 15 June.

A.H. Farnden reports sinking a shaft to 45ft.  Stopped sinking and has come up 25ft and started to stope out ore at the north end of the shaft showing good values.

We understand several interstate investors have put capital into the field.

The battery is still going at full pressure and gold has been quoted at £8-10-6 an ounce.
