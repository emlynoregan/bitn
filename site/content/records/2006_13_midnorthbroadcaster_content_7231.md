WoolPoll Panel

Tom Ashby of North Ashrose (12 Km north of Spalding) is the only South Australian to sit on this yearâ€™s panel.  He is Vice-President of the Australian Assoc. of Stud Merino Breeders.  The role of the panel is to act as an independent scrutineer of the WoolPoll process and to make recommendations to AWI about levy rates to be polled and the process of it.  The levy is at present 2% of the gross proceeds of the wool clip.  They will also make recommendations on the spending of the levy: at present 60% goes to marketing and 40% to farm research and development.
