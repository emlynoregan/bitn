Good weather saw about 2,000 attend. Despite recent bad seasons the stock was good, but implement yards were bare - or nearly so: 2 reapers, a single, a double and a multiple plough, one set of harrows and a seed sower. Four nice buggies were shown by C.A. Kruger of Adelaide. G.A. Gebhardt did particularly well with Longwools and E. & C.W. Bowman with Merinos. Horses were good and dogs very good this year. But cattle were poor. Flowers, fruit and vegetables were better, but require better presentation. Dairy produce and poultry were excellent, with the latter much improved.
