Peter Brodie writes, concerned about the transfer of the title to the Burra Hospital is being transferred to the Lower North Health Advisory Council.  This is a voluntary body with no authority and Burra has only minor representation on it.  A public forum is being held to discuss this at the Burra sports Complex at 1 p.m. 26 March, before the next Lower North HAC meeting.
