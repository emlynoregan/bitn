Burra-Adelaide Road

An article outlines Burra’s claim for prompt action on sealing the Adelaide Road.  In 1938 Main Road 45 was recognised as the main route to Broken Hill and accorded No. 1 priority for bitumen, despite which it has frequently been pushed aside while other places seem to get bitumen overnight, and this despite Burra’s production of primary produce valued at £2,300,000 annually.  [And other arguments.]
