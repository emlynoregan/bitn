Adrian Johnson.  In September, while shearing at Mt Pleasant, Mr L. Martin, Burra contractor, could not obtain a wool classer and Adrian Johnson, who has been with him as a shed hand for two years, classed the wool.  At a recent Adelaide Wool Sale the wool topped the market.  Adrian has never had any tuition in classing and has picked up the skill himself.
