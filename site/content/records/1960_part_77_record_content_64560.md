Adelaide Wool Sales.  Prices rose spectacularly on the opening day.  They were up 20-25% on the closing rates from 15 December 1972.  An almost total clearance to the trade followed.  [Local district prices are printed.]

Mrs Paech, who is leaving the district to live at Wirrabara, was farewelled from Mt Bryan on 2 January by representatives of the CWA and the Anglican Ladies’ Guild.

Robertstown DC decided at its Christmas meeting that the approaches to the swing bridge at the Burra Creek [Gorge] would have to be removed or remodelled due to road construction in the vicinity.

Rainfall for 1972 was 1399 points or 3½ inches below average and of this 4 inches fell in January and February when it did more harm than good.  [Further details draw comparisons with other dry years.]
