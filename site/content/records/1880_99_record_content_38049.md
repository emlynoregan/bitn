Burra Town Council.

There has so far been no further reply on the Aberdeen crossing.

In response to approaches by the local Members Lake and Holder to the Commissioner of Public Works, it is likely the Waterworks well will be retimbered and the cost charged to the capital account.

The mayor believes the subsidy on the rates from the Government will be paid once the Bill gets through the Legislative Council.

The Cricket Club request to be allowed to graze sheep on the oval was refused.

Mr Geakeâ€™s tender for lighting the Market Square lamp has been extended for three months.

The lamp in the North Ward is to be lit for another month.
