E. Harold Parsons writes concerning statements that he has been a claim jumper.  He outlines the law that says a mining lease must be manned 8 hours a day on weekdays and 4 hours on Saturdays.  If this is not done the lease is liable to forfeiture.  The lease in question had not been worked for five months.  The owner had been working on another lease.  The owner had then left the field and was interstate.  Parsons’ company also found that the owner had allowed his Miner’s Right to expire.  In the eyes of miners and of the law of the land had abandoned the claim.  The Department informed Parsons the area was crown land and had been open to pegging for some time.  Parsons pegged the claim.  Many of the Mongolata claims have not been worked in accordance with the rules.  It is not the man who undertakes to work an unworked lease who is unfair, but the man who like the dog in the manger will not do the work, but expects to stop others just by putting pegs in the ground.
