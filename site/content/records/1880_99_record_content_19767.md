Mr Morris, of McLaren, White & co. has offered verbally to sell to the council the Aberdeen Reserve.  A written communication is awaited.

Cr Sampson asked when the making of the ford between East and North Wards was ordered.  [This seems to refer, given later discussion, to the ford in St Just St]

The Mayor could not say: he recalled the order, but would have to have the minute looked for.
