Gladstone Gaol is progressing well.  The archway and residences either side are complete.  The boundary wall is 18’ high and encloses 5½ acres and is now complete on the eastern side.  The northern side is almost complete, with the western side still open.  The south side comprises the residences and a short section of wall.  The cells are 11’ x 7’ and are floored in Mintaro slate.  [Other details are printed.]  Sara & Dunstan expect to finish within time by February 1881.
