New Decorative Stone.  There is a further report on the stone found by Norman Ford and Percy Fuss at Mulga Hill 70 miles northeast of Burra by the Deputy Government Geologist L.J. Winton.  It appeared to be a form of fractured shale with a form of kaolin filling the fissures and could be polished beautifully and used where marble was used in building, table-tops etc.  Mr Woodward manager of Pt Pirie Smelters also reports on the mineral content and says the rock is weather and water resistant.
