Burra Traders’ Association will hold a meeting on 28 October to explain the ‘Main Street’ concept and how the grant of $20,000 can best be spent.  The idea is all about revitalising the commercial centre and Burra has been chosen along with several other centres to take part in the scheme.  The Association would like as many as possible to come along and have their say in the implementation of the scheme.
