Burra Silos wheat intake to yesterday equals the record 1966-67 season of 295,000 bushels.  It began a fortnight later, with the first delivery on 10 December when Mr Graham Heinrich of World’s End and then Mr Gordon Webster of Springbank delivered a load and deliveries here have been more concentrated this year.  A number of farmers have already delivered their quotas of 75% of their harvest.  Some have decided to bag the other 25%, while most have converted to bulk storage.  Burra has the capacity to stack 17,000 bags and Norm Maxted of Mt Bryan delivered the first bags on Friday.  Not much remains locally to be reaped.
