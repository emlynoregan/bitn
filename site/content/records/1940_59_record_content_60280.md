Accident.  T.H. Villis’s car was badly damaged in the week when it rolled down the hill at the Mine, narrowly missing Morphett’s Shaft and rolling over twice.  Had it continued it might have ended in the pool.  The owner’s dog apparently relaxed the handbrake when it jumped into the parked vehicle.
