Mineral Leases – Kooringa Meeting

J.P. Winchcombe was in the chair.

The petition drawn up included the suggestions:

All Crown land should be obtainable on lease for the raising of ores of metals.

That leases should be for 21 years.

That within three months the lessee shall provide such particulars as the Governor may require and pay a 10% deposit of the upset price of £1 per acre before work commences.

That the land be subject to a rent of 2/- per acre per annum and that the continuance of the lease be dependent upon the constant employment of at least three men in bona fide mining for every 80 acres of the land leased.

The land shall revert to the Crown at the expiration of the lease with the lessee having a preferable claim to the fee simple thereof at £1 per acre.  (Subject to a report by two disinterested experienced miners that the land is sufficiently promising for the purpose of raising metalliferous ores to justify a reasonable expectation that mining operations will be pursued thereon.

The chairman then set about explaining the reasoning behind these recommendations.

Mr Powell moved an amendment that the fee simple price by £3 per acre.  This was strongly opposed by a miner and one of the drafting committee, and after their speeches Mr Powell agreed to change his amendment to £2. It was put and lost with only Mr Powell supporting it.  The petition was then endorsed unanimously.  It was decided to act quickly and to let the petition lie in Mr Powell’s shop for six days for signatures.

[One of the speakers had suggested that upwards of two thousand signatures could be expected, if the people had not all left for the Diggings.]
