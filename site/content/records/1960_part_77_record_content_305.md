Weather.  Thunderstorms in the past week have filled many dams to the east.  Some graziers had been carting water for months.  The past week has seen temperatures well over the century with no relief at night, but a cool change arrived on Saturday night and rain began to fall at about 9 a.m. Sunday.  Burra scored 41 points to make 57 for the month.  Some places to the east recorded up to 50 points on Sunday and with earlier thunderstorms some have totalled 150 points for the week.
