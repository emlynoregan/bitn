‘Witless Heedless Howler’ writes about Cr Hardy and the Appeals.  Paul Pry spotted the amusing side of the events, but he did not comment on the illegal action of one of the councillors in attempting to be both advocate and judge in several cases.  Cr Sampson questioned whether a councillor who signed a notice of appeal could adjudicate upon the case.  The Mayor said he could not.

Cr Hardy played the role of advocate and one would have supposed that he would therefore have taken no part in the decision-making, but no he remained in his place and acted as one of the judges.

[The writer goes on at some length to decry this ‘perversion of first principles of justice.’]
