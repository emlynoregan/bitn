New Petrol Regulations

[Details of new regulations concerning petrol stocks held by individuals are printed.]

Census forms for reporting stocks are available from post offices.

Car owners who had laid up their cars for the duration of the war require small quantities of petrol to turn the engine over regularly to prevent corrosion.  Up to a quart of petrol may be purchased in sealed containers without a licence or ration tickets from stores, ironmongers, service stations etc. and this would be quite sufficient for this purpose.
