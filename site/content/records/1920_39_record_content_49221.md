Fire.  On 5 January, with a westerly gale blowing some drovers near Booborowie Bridge started a fire which left the stockyard there and entered I.J. Warnes’ property where only swift action by workers saved the lucerne bailing equipment.  It then entered F. Hogan’s and after burning 40 acres of grass was stopped at the stock road.  Beyond lay Phil. Beinke’s wheat and then wheat and grass for miles.  One of the drovers was arrested and heavily fined.  [See earlier report 55, 2, 10 Jan. 1934, page 2.]
