Ministerial Visit to Pt Wakefield.  [Editorial]

When the Burra Company ceased to use Pt Wakefield the port was little used.  There were abandoned houses and grass grew on the wharfs.  The population departed.  Mr Bright has devoted himself to the development of the poor.

He succeeded in getting money for a tramway to Hoyle’s Plains (£69,000) and also got £7,000 for clearing a channel in the bay.  These works are near completion and a ministerial visit was arranged.  A party of twelve left Pt Adelaide in the Goolwa last Thursday, reaching the channel off Pt Wakefield by midnight.  The party started off in a couple of boats at 7 a.m. and travelled up the new channel.  It was to comprise a cutting 4½ feet deep and 3,300 feet long and 100 feet wide, of which 3,000 feet has been completed.  The channel connects with a short channel made by the Burra Co. 17 years ago.

The old channel is only 50 feet wide and only half the depth of the new.  The contractor suggests he deepen the old channel instead of completing the 300 feet at the sea end of the new channel and this idea is likely to be adopted.

The object was never to det ships to the port, but to allow barges access so produce could be taken out to ships – previously even barges were useless at neap tides and were often laid up for days together.  Now the locals have 4½ feet at ebb tide and 6 to 7 feet at high tide.  This will suffice for barges at all seasons.  Silting has not been a problem for the old channel and seems not to be bothering the new.  It has however, drained the creek and deepening of the old channel will surely aggravate that.  This will, in part, be compensated for by the new Government wharf of 250 ft, erected at a cost of £1,655.

The party then landed to inspect the town.

[A description of the town and its wheat handling operations follows.]

The principal buildings are the hotel – near the proposed terminus of the railway – and Mr Ferguson’s Mill.  The abandoned stores of the Burra Co. have been re-opened.  A new hotel is not yet open.

[The tramway is then described at length.]

The line runs generally east through Bowman’s Flat to Hoyle’s Plains and towards the Skillogolee.  At various points it intersects the old road of the Burra Co., still used by the traffic between Auburn and Pt Wakefield.  It crosses the river once at Dunn’s, via a cheap iron bridge.  It reaches the Two-Mile House also known as the Wallaroo Inn, where the Wallaroo coach changes horses and then goes 14 miles to Dunn’s.  At Dunn’s is a bush public house – it was originally the Copper Co.’s station for their bullock drays.  Here the company’s bridge over the Wakefield is more than twenty years old and rather shaky.  Here the tramway will cross on a light iron bridge.  The visit of the party stopped at the end of Walker’s contract 22 miles from Pt Wakefield.
