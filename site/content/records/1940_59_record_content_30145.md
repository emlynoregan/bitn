Burra Hospital.  To get this year’s £2,000 subsidy for the new Nurses’ Quarters building would have to start soon.  If the amount is not spent by the end of the financial year the grant is void.  The aim was to spend this year’s £2,000 and carry on with the aid of the grant for the year to 30 June 1948.  Architects Dean Berry and Gilbert have been asked to expedite matters.

Miss C. Crewes has been appointed permanent secretary of the Burra Hospital.  She has been acting as such since G.H. Dow entered the AIF.  After holding the permanent position for him, Mr Dow has now advised the Board he intends to open a business in Melbourne.
