Burra Hospital Emergency Service.  The closing of these services, as announced last issue, has caused widespread community disappointment.  The two local doctors at the centre of the drama are determined to stay in the town.  Country Health SA issued a statement saying: ‘There are no changes to services offered at the Burra Hospital.’ And ‘Members of the local community who require medical attention are encouraged to attend the Burra Hospital as they normally would.  During a skills assessment it was determined that the role of one private contracted General Practitioner at Burra Hospital should be limited to long-stay patients in the residential aged care section.

The two local doctors deny that any such assessment took place.  Two directors came to Burra and had a chat over dinner at a local hotel, they said.  Dr Lakman Fernando said his wife had full Australian qualifications and was fully certified to treat emergencies.

The situation at present is that GPs from Clare will provide emergency services when required.  Nurses will remain at Burra Hospital to provide nurse-led triage.  The health Minister, John Hill MP, has denied that there is any threat to close Burra Hospital.  Local pharmacist, John Barton has described the two local doctors as ‘caring professionals’ who put a lot of effort and concern into daily practice.  He offered them his moral support.
