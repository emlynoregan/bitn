Burra Senior Citizens officially dissolved on Monday morning.  The group had given more than 30 years of community involvement.  With low numbers and no sign of recruiting more, the five remaining members met to finalise banking arrangements and to dissolve the organisation.  Shirley Broad had been President for 17 years and recalled the good times and the friendships over that period.  The organisation began in 1978 when then BCS Principal Chris McCabe thought the town needed a Senior Citizens Club.  He mentioned it to Edith Carpenter, Laurel Neill and another person, who spread the idea around town.  Foundation members were Len & Sue Hentschke, Laurel Neill and Beryl Kakoschke, with Mrs Kakoschke, who now lives in Wallaroo, being the only remaining original member.  Before long there was a group meeting in the CWA rooms in Chapel Street, free of charge.  Various speakers were arranged.  Eventually Ray Jennison came along and a committee was formed.  The group grew until it was too large for the CWA rooms and meetings were transferred to the Uniting Church Hall, also free of charge.  A few months later when the Burra Council had completed renovations of the RSL Building, the Senior Citizens were offered the main meeting room for a place to gather.  Len Bence offered a painting to be raffled.  The money was to be towards a trip that never eventuated, but all funds went to projects around Burra.  While the club provided social and recreational opportunities, a major project over the years has been the beautification of the banks of the Burra Creek.
