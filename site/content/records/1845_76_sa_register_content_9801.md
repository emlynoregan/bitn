The seven year contract with the Patent Copper Company (now the English & Australian Copper Company) for the sale of ores raised at the mine, expired this month, but it expected that a new contract will be made with the company.  There are upwards of 4,000 tons of ore on hand yet to be delivered under the terms of the contract.

The company is sinking a suitable shaft on their Karkulto property, with a view to working the large and rich copper lode discovered there.

The exports of copper from the Burra Burra Mine this year are likely to add considerably to the wealth of the colony as well as to the fortunate owners of the company.
