H.M.M. Wilson, Taylor St, Burra North writes thanking ‘The Man Who Sees’ for his thoughts for the transported residents of the town.  She and her daughter were living in a ‘flat’ with a harsh landlady.  She found herself forced to come to Burra when ill and came to a tiny cottage of four walls and a roof for which she was grateful to the Mayor ‘for his unremitting care of my little girl and myself, but the people in general were not very kind or thoughtful to the stranger at their gate’.
