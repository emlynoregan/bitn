Goyder Council:

Will request Transport SA to take over responsibility for the maintenance of the Burra Heavy Vehicle Detour as traffic is mainly from outside the Council area.

Council has donated $590 to Burra Community Development Committee for two BCS students to attend a youth leadership program.

Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee has expressed concerns about the poor housing, lighting and pedestrian safety around the old jinker.  CEO Steve Kerrigan said lighting would be improved and bollards erected to protect pedestrians from traffic – these could extend as far as the toilet block.

Council will approach the interim managers of Paxton’s Cottages seeking their interest in extending their contract to 30 June 2003, prior to which expressions of interest would be called for the future management of the facility.

An inspection will be made of the roof of the Old Bible Christian Chapel, seeking costings for repairs and all cottages will be inspected before a report is prepared on upgrading needs with associated costs.

A request has been made for Council to support a request for ABC FM Radio and SBS television to be received in Burra.  The ABC will be approached to provide information on the options and time frames for Burra residents to receive ABC FM Radio.
