Burra Town Council, 24 January

There was considerable debate over whether Mr Hill, Premier of SA should be given a Civic Reception, as he was coming principally for ‘the purposes of political propaganda’.  It was eventually decided he should be entertained and arrangements were made as requested for visits to the school, hospital etc.

C.J. Pearce & Son applied for permission to erect additions to their workshop.  Cr Allen said they were already up and he considered the Council too lenient in such cases.  Cr Woollacott said Council had been in recess and the Inspector was on holidays and you could not expect a man to delay three weeks for permission.  They are to be informed that the Council considered that they should not have gone on with the work without permission.  [Which seems to solve nothing!]

Headquarters of the 23rd Horse wrote asking assistance in purchasing regimental colours.  Council is seeking advice from the other Councils involved.  It is believed the total cost will be about £75 and each Council would be asked to pay about £10.

Burra Show Society presented an enlarged photo of the late J.E.H. Winnall.  Council accepted it.

The Public Works Committee recommended 25ft of concrete pipe be used in making a crossing into Ann St near James Reed’s and this was opposed by Cr Riggs, but passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.
