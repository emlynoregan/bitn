Bench of Magistrates, Monday 21 March

[Applications for publicans licences.  Among a long list for locations across the colony were the following.]

Charles William Cowper for the Pig and Whistle, Kooringa.

The police that the stable complained of had been repaired.  Granted.

John Dunstan for the Bushman’s Home, Redruth.

The police report was unfavourable, saying the house was too small for an inn.

H. Mildred and Mr Parker promised, on behalf of the applicant, that the house would be improved.  The Bench felt that it would have been better if the improvements had preceded the application.  Dunstan said he had just taken over the lease from Mr Opie and it had about a year to run.  He had cleared out a foundation and laid stone to built additional bedrooms.  Heretofore he had accommodated all comers with beds on sofas without complaint.  The stable and stockyard had been rebuilt.  He expected the bedrooms to be finished in about two to three weeks.  Mr Mildred read memorials supporting the applicant.  Mr Bonney said the hotels at Kooringa were all abominable and no licence ought to be granted unless there was proper accommodation available.

Application refused with the right to re-apply next quarter.

William Oliver for the Commercial Hotel, Copperhouse.

A second report by the police was against the character of the applicant and the conduct of the house.  It stated that the applicant was of intemperate habits and the house was not kept in a clean condition.  Mr Parker said the house was frequented by sheep drovers and there was ample space in the paddocks for sheep and sufficient accommodation for the drovers.  He read a memorial in favour of the application and said it was intended to let the house as soon as possible and that Mrs Oliver was fully competent to run it in the meantime.

Refused.
