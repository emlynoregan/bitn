The Miss Burra ‘Pin Up Girl’ Contest

Final figures were announced by the Mayor at a dance at the Burra Institute last night.  The final figure raised was £1,068-13-10.  Lotus Twist was the comfortable winner, raising £558-14-6 for the Burra North FFCF Unit.  She had been backed by a very strong and hard working committee, with Mr H.C. Brooks as the organising secretary.

Miss Margaret Steele with £385 for the Burra FFCF Unit was second, with a strong committee and Mr Ken Murphy as secretary.

Miss Mary Lloyd representing the RSL Wives Group finished with a total of £123.  She lives a fair way out of town and consequently no big functions were arranged in town on her behalf.  Mrs Sheldrick was the secretary.

The Mayor said it was a wonderful thing that such an announcement could be made on the eve of the Greatest Military Victory in History, when all were on their tip toes waiting to hear the magical words, ‘Hostilities Have Ceased’.

Mrs Woollacott presented each of the girls with a posy.    Mrs Twist thanked all the people who had stood behind her with work and money.
