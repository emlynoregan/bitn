Heidi Crick reports on activities recently of the Goyder Youth Advisory Committee.

In National Youth Week in April a Youth Forum was held at the Sports Complex and over twenty young people from BCS discussed issues facing young people in the area.  Among them: lack of transport, lack of youth facilities, health services.

ROB Fest was held on Saturday 12 April in Balaklava.  Approximately 450 people attended and 13 young bands competed with three headline and supporting acts.  The profit is still being collated, but is likely to be just over $3,000, which will go towards to running costs of Rob Fest 09.

On 15 May four YAC members and I were involved in filming a DVD for the Office of Youth for the Local Government Association and we received the assistance of the Goyder CEO, John Brak, and of the BCS Principal, Jim Lowe.  An aim of the project was to look at what facilities and initiatives are available for young people and to find out why so many are leaving country areas.  YAC also assisted with the Emergency Risk Management mail-out.  YAC holds an elective at BCS on Friday afternoons to survey and work on ideas and initiatives for youth in the area.  A drug action week will be held in June.
