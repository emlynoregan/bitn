VP Day Celebrations at Mt Bryan were held on Thursday 16 August.  A Thanksgiving Service was held in the Hall, convened by Mr Gordon Maxted and conducted by Rev. Cowle of Burra, assisted by Rev. Warren of Hallett.    Rev. Cowle gave the reading and the address.  A two minute silence was observed out of respect for the fallen and Mr Jack Hooper, a recently returned soldier, recited the verse from Remembrance.  A few minutes interval was followed by the civic part of the evening’s proceedings.  Dr Toal spoke of the Peace and joy of victory and also of the debt of gratitude owed to those who fought and above all ‘to the imperishable dead’.  Miss Anne Murray then sang Trees.  Mr T. Quinn remarked on how much was owed to the various services, including the Home Guard.

Mr F. Jefferies then sang Land of Hope and Glory.

Mt Bryan had done its best for the war effort and the amounts collected locally during the war were: Red Cross £3,959; FFCF £1,055; Soldiers’ Farewell £136; Schools’ Patriotic Fund £480; for a total of £5,630.  The Band then played Rule Britannia.

A fireworks display was held outside, while the hall was prepared for dancing and a big bonfire was lit.  Mrs E.E. Edwards kindly provided the fireworks display.  Dancing commenced at 10 p.m., with Darrell Field’s Band providing the music.  Supper was served and later, at about midnight several carloads of people arrived from Burra and Hallett, anxious to continue their celebrations, taxing the Hall to its utmost.
