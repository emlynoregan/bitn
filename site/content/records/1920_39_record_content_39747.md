Burra Town Council, 19 October

The District MPs wrote supporting the Council’s complaint about the collection of water rates twice in a year.

The Town Clerk reported that the new assessment was reduced by £2,558 from £14,539 in the following proportion: North Ward £754, West Ward £1,102 and East Ward £702.  Total £2,558.

On the present rate the revenue would fall by £250.  The assessment was adopted.

Ratepayers are to be allowed to cut feed from the creeks gratis.  (To cut the fuel load for fires.)
