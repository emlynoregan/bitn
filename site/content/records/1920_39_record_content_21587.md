Redruth Court

T.P. Halls on behalf of his son Robert George Halls sued Guy Dollman for compensation under the Workman’s Compensation Act.  On 20 August 1926 [sic: error for 1925] the plaintiff aged 15 had been asked to light a blow lamp.  An explosion of a tin of methylated spirits enveloped him in flames and he was in hospital for six weeks and unable to do anything for 12 months.  The worst injury was to the first finger of his right hand.  He was still afflicted in a variety of ways.

Evidence was tendered of what the plaintiff could do since the accident.  Dr Steele’s medical evidence was at variance with the degree of residual damage now being claimed.  Evidence showed that the boy could earn 15/- a week.  Dr Steven, the boy’s doctor, was not called and the only inference the court could draw was that the plaintiff’s case would not be supported by him.  The case was dismissed with parties to pay their own costs.
