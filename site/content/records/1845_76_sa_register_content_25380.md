Mt Bryan Flat.  There has been rain and the crops are looking good.  The host of the Mt Bryan Hotel is about to erect a booth at the Waukaringa Gold Field.  The road between Burra and Mt Bryan Flat is bad and drays and wagons are being bogged daily.

Kooringa.  The recent fine weather suits the farmers, but we hear more rain is needed on the eastern runs.

An entertainment featuring Mr Lipsett’s readings, and musical items under the direction of Mr A.H .Forder raised about £3 for the Redruth chapel Bazaar Fund.

An entirely local company; the Great Extended Waukaringa Co., of 20,000 shares was started without brokers of free shares in about one hour.

Shearing is becoming general with teams loaded with provisions and numbers of shearers leaving the town every week.
