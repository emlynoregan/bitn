The Burra Art Gallery’s exhibition ‘All That Jazz’ drew standing room only for its opening on Friday night.  They were greeted by the great sounds of the James Bailey Jazz Ensemble from the Elder Conservatorium.  Chairman Peter Harvey introduced the judges, jazz musician James Bailey and artist Ronald Adams.  Winner of the $500 art prize was Julianne Pulford for her clay sculpture ‘Jazz Band Junkies’.   A Merit Award of $100 went to Glenys Christopher for her pastel ‘JC Jazz at Kilikanoon’.  Merit certificates went to Maja Zweck for her collection of leadlight and to Evan Hawk for his sculpture ‘Rust in Peace’.  [Photo: Evan Hawke, Julianne Pulford & Glenys Christopher.]
