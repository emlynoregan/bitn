Weather.  Last Friday rain in the far northeast heralded the beginning of one of the most welcome drenchings on record.  In some areas it was deemed the best in 60 years.  The falls extended for two days and a night.  Rain in Burra started on Saturday about 9.30 a.m.  From Midday Sunday reports of over 2 inches were coming in from the east.  At 3.30 Ketchowla reported 329 points, than later Sturt Vale with 357, North Koomooloo 349, Lock Winnoch 403, Kia Ora 350, Collinsville 300, Mulga Hill 410, Manunda 340, Pitcairn 400.  Further south falls were less, but still often over 2 inches: Baldina 237, Poonunda 275, Quondong 265, Woolgangi 160 and Burra 247 are representative.

Falls may in fact be higher, as some telephone lines have been cut since Monday.
