Tom Canny writes a comment on the Premier’s visit.  He regrets the need of the Institute committee to present such a tragic balance sheet, but points out that it is typical of the balance sheets of farmers and businessmen.  He refers to the opportunity to change things at the coming election.  He also comments on the way the visit was advertised as being non-political.  In that case with reference to the public meeting he would like to hear them when they were trying!
