Burra Creek.  Concerns about both the quality of water and the decreasing levels of water in the Burra creek have been expressed to Hemisphere Designs.  The project team led by Mr Stuart Heseltine has been in Burra canvassing residents.  The report will consider the creek’s future and its quality and ability to retain water in a suitable way.  The Council is concerned to gauge reactions to a decrease in the amount of water retained in the creek.  The Asset Manager said the present level is costing a fortune to maintain and it is not sustainable.  There have been a number of suggestions to enhance the creek area including the provision of an amphitheatre and a bike trail.  The plans would have enhancement of the area’s appeal for tourists as a major focus.
