Burra Waterworks.  A ratepayers’ meeting last Thursday debated the issue of the waterworks.  The last time they met it was thought advisable to extend the lease to the end of March 1888.  This was done.  As this is now drawing near the Mayor and Town Clerk waited on the Government and asked that interest on the capital be reduced from 5% to 3%, as 5% would be impossible to sustain.  The Government reply has not been received.  50 ratepayers attended.  P.L. Killicoat, the Mayor presided and reported the above action.  J.D. Cave, Town Clerk, gave a financial statement.  The meeting resolved ‘That unless the Government grant the concession in interest asked for by the Corporation, this meeting is reluctantly compelled to advise the surrender of the lease.’

This was moved by Dr Brummitt, 2nd Rev. S. Gray and passed unanimously.
