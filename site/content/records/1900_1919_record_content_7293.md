A Bolt.  John Ford was at the old slaughterhouse one day last week on his way to the Black Waterholes and he left his six-year-old daughter in the cart.  The horse bolted and dashed along the Baldina Road, the cart swerving onto one wheel for about ten yards, but the young girl managed to bring the horse to a stop and by the time the pursuers had caught up she had succeeded, though she lost some skin from her hands in the process and all he joints were stiff from the exertion.
