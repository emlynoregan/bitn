‘Another Parent’ writes saying that if many people have lost control of their boys by the age of 14 it argues for military training.  Although a teetotaller he does not agree that hoteliers are trying to ensnare our boys.  If total lack of control occurs from 14 years on, this points to something badly wrong in [home] training.  Perhaps the provision of alternative activities is needed.  Billiards away from hotels for instance.
