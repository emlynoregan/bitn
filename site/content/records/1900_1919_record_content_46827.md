R.D. Pascoe’s Sheep Photographs.

[Article reprinted from ‘Bendleby’ in the Australasian.]

While commenting very favourably on Pascoe’s collection for the modern Merino there are interesting references to collections, which go much further back.  One of the best collections of old-time portraits of Merino sheep is in the possession of Alick J. Murray in his Mt Crawford home.  These show the evolution of the long-necked ram free from apron or cross folds such as are still seen in the Carngham flock in the Western District of Victoria.  These were evolved to cope with the spear-grass seed troubles of the north.  Cross folds acted as a trap for the seeds and caused endless trouble to the rams and indirectly for the owners.  The Mt Crawford gallery contains some prints and engravings and photographs of old-time sheep collected by the late E.M. Pitts of the Levels and were secured by Mr Alick J. Murray after Mr Pitt’s death.  For a collection of sheep in modern times nothing compares with the collection of R.D. Pascoe of Burra SA.

Not older than 12 years, it contains all of the most noted rams and ewes which have been making history in that period in SA.  It began with two or three portraits of local sheep and a small case of wool from Koonoona Station.
