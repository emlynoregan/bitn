Burra Railway Station

The old overhead steel tank of some 30,000 gallons capacity was demolished last Thursday.  It was understood to be about 50 years old and was mounted on stone walling about 15 ft x 30 ft x 30 ft high and some 2 ft thick.  A previous attempt to blast the walls had little effect, but this time the tank was toppled and has been broken up for scrap.  A large ‘Blackstone’ motor and pump was used on the bore underneath to fill the tank.
