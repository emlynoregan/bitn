W.J. (Jack) Richards and his brother Thomas Richards visited Burra last week after an absence of 30 years.  Mr Richards is Chief Inspector in the Sewers Department and left Burra 40 years ago.  He was in the employ of the late Mr Harry Pearce, tinsmith, the only brother of Mr C.J. Pearce.  Mrs W.J. Williams is his only sister.  [This ambiguous statement does not make clear which Mr Richards is which.  When their father Thomas Richards Sen. died in 1908 Thomas was cited as living in Adelaide, so presumably he was the brother who had been away for 40 years in 1935.  W.J. Richard ran a bicycle shop in Burra North and later a garage in Kooringa, firstly on his own account and then as manager for Murray Aunger.  He left the town for Adelaide in 1916.  They had a second sister, Elizabeth Mary, Mrs John Prior who was still alive at this time.]
