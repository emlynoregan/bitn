Burra Hospital should have its X-ray plant installed and operational in about two to three weeks.  It has been decided that the H. Thomas bequest has to be kept intact and so Mr Warnes has offered to pay for the conversion of a room for the machine.  This is in addition to his Â£260 donation towards the cost of the machine.
