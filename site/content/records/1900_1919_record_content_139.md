J. Morgan Local Health Inspector charged John Ford with keeping pigs in close proximity to the slaughterhouse.  Ford denied it, saying the pigs had 1,000 acres to run on, but the SM pointed out that was all the more reason why they should not have been observed close to the slaughterhouse.  Ford admitted not having written permission to keep pigs at all.  Fined 10/- plus costs to a total of Â£2-6-0.
