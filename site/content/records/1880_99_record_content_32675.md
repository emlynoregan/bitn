Burra Town Council, 3 June.

The School Board of Advice, which is about to erect a footbridge over the Burra Creek, seeks an opening in the Avenue opposite it.

Waterworks Department seeks payment for 40,000 gallons of water used to water trees.

Mr Ridgway declined to pay for the water, which had been used on the reserve under his care in Aberdeen.  The 5/- will be paid by Council and the water cut off.

The deed for the Burra Hospital is missing and a search will be made for it.

Mr Littlejohn, the Waterworks engineer applied for an increase in salary.  Debate held over.

Resolved that the Aberdeen water trough be opened.

Council will seek support of other councils to get the law changed to allow councils where hawkers operate to charge licence fees.  (At present the council where the hawker lives grants a licence for the whole colony and so the city area gets most money.)
