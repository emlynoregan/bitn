Burra Primary School Welfare Club has raised Â£400 over the past two years, which with subsidy has enabled the purchase of a new wireless unit with pick-up, microphone and nine speakers.  This enables outside use for rhythm and marching etc. and places a speaker in each room.  This will enable classes to tune in to selected educational programs.  Some time ago the club also raised money for a film projector.  The next project is for some playground equipment.  The last few years have seen the school transformed with bituminised yards, new rainwater tanks, extra classrooms and shelter sheds and new fencing.
