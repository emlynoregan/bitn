Burra Town Council

A request from the SA Tree Planting Association to support a program of plantings to commemorate the Queen’s visit is to lie on the table for the time being.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd is pleased to supply extra lighting during the holiday period.

The water tank at the cemetery will receive attention.

Mr Dunhill has now retired from the position of teacher and superintendent at the Burra North Methodist Sunday School, after over 40 years’ service.  Mr E.J. Reed recently spoke very highly of Mr Dunhill’s service when he (Mr Reed) was tendered a farewell on 17 January.  Mr Dunhill was presented with a table electric light stand in appreciation of his work for the Sunday school over many years.
