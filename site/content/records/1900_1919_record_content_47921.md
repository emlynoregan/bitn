‘Equity’ writes drawing attention to a long and complex clause 64 of the Licensing Act of 1908 in which it would appear that any organisation ‘of which the members are or may be, of less than twenty-one years of age’ cannot be granted the form of liquor licence required for the show.  The Show Society has such members.
