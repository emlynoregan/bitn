BCS.  The historic Kooringa Building has undergone a facelift.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said most of the work was finished in April with some finishing touches in the May school holidays.  About $90,000 was spent replacing stone affected by salt damp.  Concrete rendering was replaced, the rood refastened and the exterior was repainted in accordance with the original colour scheme; the roof is red, the timber window frames are bottle green and the horizontal concrete bands are a fawn colour.  The brickwork was re-pointed.  Work will now begin on the interior, including the construction of a mezzanine floor to house the local history collection.  Curtains and blinds worth $1,100 have recently been installed in the western end of the building to help reduce summer heat.  These have been paid for by the schoolâ€™s fund-raising committee, which has raised more than $2,000 this year for improvements.  $350 of gardening equipment has also been purchased along with technical drawing equipment, photographic enlarger, a drum kit and extra guitars.
