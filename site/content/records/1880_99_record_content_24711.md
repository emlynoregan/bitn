Burra Young Men’s Union.   As it settles into a more permanent existence after almost twelve months it has drafted a new code of rules and a slight increase in membership.  The Union owns a piano (nearly). An entertainment on Friday of songs, recitations and farces went well - performed by D. Herbert, F. Wilson, W.H. Hardy, & G. Herbert with Mrs Hocking at the piano.
