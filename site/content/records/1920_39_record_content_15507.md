Redruth Court

The adjourned case of Claude Attrill who was charged on 29 December 1924 with illegal betting was resumed on 30 March.

The evidence is exhaustively reported in about one column and the case was ultimately dismissed due to somewhat conflicting police evidence.  The bench nevertheless issued a stern warning, as they were clearly convinced that he was guilty and said the maximum penalty would be imposed in any subsequent appearance.

A case of having his bar door unlocked during prohibited hours against W.F. Brown of the Farrell’s Flat Hotel was also dismissed.
