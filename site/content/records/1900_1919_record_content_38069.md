Challenged to a Duel

Some time ago P.G. Klose of Rowlands Flat had a lawsuit with Norman McBride of Kia Ora Station over a boring contract and the plaintiff was non-suited.  Now Klose has challenged McBride to a duel.  He appeared before Adelaide Police Court last Saturday charged with issuing threatening words and was given a good behaviour bond of Â£25 for six months, failing which jail for six months.
