Cricket.  The fire on Saturday saw the two matches being played closed, but a decision has been given on the first innings, with Burra and Koonoona having a win.

Burra made 5 for 213 and the Buffs 103.

Koonoona made 123 and The Colts 48.

On Saturday the Burra team made a presentation to Mr J. Brennan, who will shortly be leaving the Association to take up duties at the Mt Gambier Post Office.

Congratulations go to Mr Ron Pascoe, Captain of the Colts team, who will leave shortly as a member of the SA Railways team to play in a carnival in Tasmania against combined Railway Teams from all the states.
