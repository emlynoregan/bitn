Mr J.G. Sara of Burra North writes some reminiscences as an 80-year-old.

Most of the article is not made up of reminiscences about Burra, but the following points are relevant:

As a lad I worked on the Burra Public School, which had the capacity for 1,000 student, beyond the requirements of the population, but later it was used for both the Primary and High Schools.

I also worked on the Roseworthy College and the Gladstone Gaol, where the firm employed over 200 men at the one time.

I remember the closing days of the Burra Mine.

I worked in one of Burra’s flour mills for several seasons.

At 19 I was joined by a Burra boy to visit WA, travelling on the old barque Ribsten of 350 tons.  The crossing from Pt Adelaide to Fremantle took three weeks. (1883)

On returning to SA, I worked for Dunn & Co., millers at Quorn for 12 months.

Later I rejoined the staff of Sara & Dunstan and as a young married man was sent to their Terowie business and after 12 months to Cockburn to conduct a general store and carry on forwarding and agency work.

It was a busy time and my wife and I saw about 150 teams in the town and saw the first train cross into NSW.

In the depression [of the 1890s] Sara & Dunstan closed their Broken Hill business.

After some time at the Proprietary Mine, I went to WA again and set up with a partner in a grocery business in Perth, residing in Claremont.

I later returned to SA and took over the business in Burra of Messrs James Tiver & Sons in Aberdeen, including the Aberdeen – now the Burra North – Post Office.

With the aid of my wife and son, Frank, we enlarged and developed the business and after nearly forty years in Burra and Burra North, I retired at the age of 83 and Messrs T. Pascoe, and Robert Campbell joined with Mr Frank Sara as partners in Sara & Co.

My wife and I continue to reside in the old home attached to the Burra North store.
