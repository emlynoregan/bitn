The stock crate collided with a telephone pole bringing down communications between Burra and Booborowie.  The crate was wrecked and three cattle were killed instantly.  Another six had to be destroyed subsequently.  Stock losses were estimated at $800 to $1,000.  The driver and a passenger escaped injury.
