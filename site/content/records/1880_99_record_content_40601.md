Consequently I moved that the lowest tender by 2d a yard be accepted, viz. R. Cox & Son, for 400 yards, be accepted.  Cr O’Leary 2nd.

Cr Sampson then moved that the ballot be used in allotting the work, but considering the circumstances the Mayor thought that absurd.  Cr Sampson then moved that 200 yds only be given to R. Cox & Son, 2nd Cr Parks and carried.

The argument used now was that we should divide the work, but this was totally inconsistent with the procedure for dealing with the south end tenders when J. Herbert got 400 yards when only 1d per yd lower than the next lowest tender.

I left the Council in disgust at the whole business not being consistent with honourable and independent action and I would not to any further extent have anything to do with such, whatever the consequences.

Cr Watt’s motion re an explanation from me is ridiculous and I will appeal to the ratepayers for their decision as to mine or their action under the circumstances.

After I left there was still 400 yds to be divided so why, if equality was the call, was this not awarded 100 yards to each of the equal remaining tenderers instead of, as was done, 200 to each of two favoured parties.
