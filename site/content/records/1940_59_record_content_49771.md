SA Stud Merino Breeders Assoc. entertained a party of Stud Merino Breeders from New Zealandâ€™s South Island at the Burra Hotel last week on Tuesday night.  T.E. Ashby, as President of the Assoc., was toastmaster.  Sir George Jenkins, Minister of Agriculture, toasted the visitors and Mr Lyons responded for the visiting group.  Mr Ashby said the early studs had been founded in a strip about twenty miles wide stretching from Kapunda north through Burra and Hallett to Terowie.  Lucerne was grown in two valleys along the strip.  The oldest of the studs were Anlaby, Koonoona and Collinsville.
