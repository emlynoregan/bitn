Burra Town Council, 21 March

His Worship the Mayor reported attending the Air Force Association Dinner.

After inspection of the Smelts Road Bridge with the Highways Engineer Mr Wilkins, it was decided that a weight limit of 3 tons be imposed on it.

Burra Football Club was granted the use of the Burra Oval for 1960 season for 1/- and to pay for light and water for the season.

It was resolved that the footbridge be fitted with cyclone fencing.  [Presumably the footbridge that replaced the swing bridge opposite the Town Hall.]
