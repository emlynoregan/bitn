The New Year

[The editor is hopeful that the great exodus of labour to the eastern colonies’ goldfields will not continue and become a major economic problem for the colony.  He hopes the recently announced discoveries of gold in SA, some of them near the capital, will keep many would-be gold miners in SA.  He says that while not wishing to induce those to remain who might have a fair prospect of success, the paper is anxious to be scrupulous in publishing all the information favourable and unfavourable so that decisions will be well informed.  Vicissitudes in the fortunes of the colony are to be expected and at present many are anxious due to the fears of depopulation from the disappearance of labour to the diggings.  The writer hopes the worst fears may be unjustified.  His hopes for 1852 include the cessation of transportation of convicts to Van Diemen’s Land, the establishment of direct steam communication with England, a considerable extension of agriculture, progress in building a railway to Port Adelaide, an increase in Government revenue, a Legislative Council improved by experience and in general peace and prosperity.]
