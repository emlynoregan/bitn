Stephen and Maryann Angel of Décor Made Easy this week celebrate four years since they opened their doors.  Examples of Stephen’s work can be seen in some of Burra’s Hotels, the new Barker’s Homes Cottages, numerous bed and breakfast establishments in the area and in the newly refurbished Tourist Office in Market Square, but most of their work comes by word of mouth from private clients.
