J.M. McBride was 80 last Friday and almost the whole family was there to celebrate.  He was born in Northern Ireland in 1831, the eldest son of the late Mr James McBride who held a commission in the British Army.  He left home at 14 and was a seafarer till settling in SA in 1856.  He arrived with 5/- in his pocket and worked himself up to being one of the most successful squatters in the district.  He is the father of five sons and six daughters.  He bought Broken Hill shares when they were £10 each and sold some later when they were £1,400 apiece.  He presently owns Teetulpa Station of 900 square miles, carrying 50,000 sheep, as well as other valuable stations.  He has been a great philanthropist, especially in later years.  Although he had had severe illnesses he is in fairly good health at present.  The Mayor sent a letter of best wishes.
