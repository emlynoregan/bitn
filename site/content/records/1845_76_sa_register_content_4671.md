Port Wakefield Land Sales

‘The Government Land Sale proclaimed in a Supplementary Gazette, on Saturday, the 13th April, commenced yesterday at 11 a.m.’

When it became known that water frontages were being reserved at the township of [Port] Wakefield, intending purchasers petitioned that the whole of the land for sale be withdrawn ‘to prevent the undue value such partial sale would give to the sections withheld.  The petition was signed by John Hart for the Patent Copper Co., P.J. Tod, George Elder, Henry Mildred, G.M. Waterhouse and Emanuel Solomon.  As a consequence the sale of the Wakefield allotments and river frontages was postponed to this day at 11 a.m.

[A list of the sections that were sold is then printed, giving the information of Section number, areas, purchaser’s name and sum paid.  The total comes to £5,908-16-0.]
