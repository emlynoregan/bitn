Characteristics of the paper in 1901.

Page 1 was as usual full of larger advertisements, but most were now not local.

Pages 2 and 3 carried smaller business advertisements.  There were no editorials, and the local news tended to come in small items which were annoyingly interspersed with long small print articles that look at first like news, but turn out to be advertisements for such things as: Dr Morse’s Indian Root Pills, Dr Williams’ Pink Pills (for Pale People), Bile Beans, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, Ayer’s cherry Pectoral Plasters and Clement’s Tonic.

Page 4 continues with advertisements dominated by patent medicines including: Vitadatio (a cure for hydatids), Holloway’s Pills & Beecham’s Pills.

There is a serial: The Quality of Mercy, by U.X.L. (Author of Carl‘s Old Rug, Cabbage Tree Man, etc.) on page 3.  There is some padding with jokes etc, but it is minimal most weeks.  These became more noticeable by May when the serials ceased, but their quantity was erratic.  Towards the end of the year a serial returned with Marie by U.X.L.  Which ran from 13 November to 18 December (missing out 20 November).

‘Sparks’ are less cryptic than when they first appeared with one word comments.

The news has to be sought amid the advertisements which appear in similar style and print, though some of the latter are distinguished with illustrations.
