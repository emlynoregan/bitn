Mt Bryan Fitness & Wellbeing Centre has been set up in the former Tennis Club Rooms, where the Mt Bryan Progress Association has been meeting.  Daphne Lines obtained a Grant for Seniors, which enabled the purchase of the first equipment.  Since then further items have been obtained through donations.  The formal opening was last Sunday.
