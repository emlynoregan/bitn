Obituary & Inquest.  Held at Kooringa Hotel on Saturday afternoon on the body of Emma Patterson aged two months, who died 26 August.  John Lewis JP as coroner and W. Davey as foreman of the jury.

[Born as Amy Patterson 1 July 1892, died as Emma Patterson 26 August 1892.]

Dr Brummitt:

Had seen Emma Patterson three or four times before last Monday.  She was thin and wasting rapidly.  Could find no sign of disease.  I had little expectation of the baby’s recovery.  Saw the child at home 23 August: she was disgracefully dirty despite my frequent advice.  The bottle was never once cleaned.  The mother and grandmother assured me it would not take food, but it took food while I was there while a neighbour nursed it.  On Wednesday arranged for Mrs Fisher to take it home which she did out of pity.  Saw it again at Fisher’s Thursday when it was clean and well looked after, but could not live long and it died at 1 a.m. Friday.

‘cannot recollect a case in which a child has been more grossly neglected than was this poor little thing.’

Harriet Fisher described how she visited and eventually offered to take the child for 5/- a week to allow the mother to go out to service.  The arrangements were made in the presence of Dr Brummitt.

The mother and grandmother were present when the child died.

Laura Patterson:

Am a single woman living at Kooringa.  The child, aged two months, was born at Terowie.  Mrs Potter was midwife and Dr Hill attended.  (The witness here contradicted herself.)  The child was getting on well till I came to Burra.  The child caught a cold - we could not get our things when we came here and slept on the floor three or four nights.  Got fresh milk from Dr Brummitt daily and gave it five bottles in 24 hours.  Could always get sufficient food for the child.  Never received any support from the father.  Positive Dr Brummitt never cautioned me.

John Patterson, grandfather of the child:

The child was never strong, continually crying.  It was fed on condensed milk and sugar.  Dr Hill attended the ninth day after birth.  Doctor complained to me about its treatment after its death.

Martha Patterson, mother of Laura Patterson:

‘ . . . it was always a very week [sic] child.  It seemed to dwindle away from time of its birth.  Sometimes fed on maizena and sometimes on condensed milk.’

After half an hour the jury said ‘Emma Patterson came to her death from natural causes, accelerated by neglect owing to the unfortunate circumstances of the parents and insufficient home comforts and necessaries of life.’

And ‘. . . there had been considerable amount of neglect on the part of the mother; who should be severely censured by the coroner.’
