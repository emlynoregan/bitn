Tiver Family Reunion.  272 signed the family book at the Burra Town Hall and at least 300 were present.  James Tiver helped to construct the main Hall 100 years ago.  Bad weather prevented the planned gathering at the racecourse.  People brought their own lunches and there was a thanksgiving service.  Hedley Thomas of Mundulla took family group photographs and there was a display of old photographs and family documents.  12 December was the 109th anniversary of Edgar Tiverâ€™s birth.  The oldest descendant present was Netley Sumner of Hallett aged 79 and the youngest was the baby Luke Tiver a great grandson of Charles Godwin Tiver.  A few days later a letter was received from Raymond George Tiver in the UK where he has lived for many years.  He is a grandson of James Hugh Tiver and nostalgically recalled memories of Burra and Hallett districts from 50 or 60 years ago and of relatives.  [The report names many of those present.]
