Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Pumping is to start this week.  Thomas Rosewall, who worked there 53 years ago, is preparing a ‘jiggy’ near the old floors to treat dumps that were not properly worked before.  There is plenty of room for more jigs, but two will be erected to start with.  The bottom is expected to be about 25’ and another 25’ into the mullock will then be excavated to drain it.  The pool contains a large quantity of crayfish.  About 2-3 tons of ore are ready for despatch.
