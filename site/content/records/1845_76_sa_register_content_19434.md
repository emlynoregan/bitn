Kooringa News, 13 June

A local Destitute Board has been established here under the presidency of Mr MacDermott SM.

Accident.  An accident occurred on Friday evening to Mr & Mrs Trembath who were driving from Redruth to Kooringa in a spring cart.  Near the bridge a wheel struck a post and the cart overturned.  Neither passenger was seriously hurt.

Weather.  Gentle rains have saturated the earth, but little has extended to the east.  Lambing is proceeding, but losses in the extreme cold and with poor feed are high.  Two farmers, who may be taken as average, report a 50% survival.

The lode recently cut in the new shaft at the Mine is still looking good, though proving it will take some time.  The permanent nature of this shaft is making progress slow.

The man Holland, accused of altering a cheque of Mr Spriggs from £15 to £50 has been remanded, the prosecutor not yet having come from the North Eastern Plains.

Obituary.  Emily Alice Martlew aged 2 years 7 months, daughter of a shepherd in the employ of Mr Barker of Baldina, strayed from her hut on the evening of 9 June.  Despite an immediate search no trace was found.  Four fires were lit and the parents searched all night.  Mr Barker had a man searching all the next day and when he was unsuccessful the police were notified.  Her body was found by Police Trooper Catchlove with Mr William Barker some four hours later.  The child was found lying face down about three quarters of a mile from the hut.  An inquest at the Miners’ Arms found that death was by exposure.

[Emily Alice Martlew born 15 November 1863 Logan’s Gap: died 11 June 1866 near Baldino (sic: for Baldina.)]

Sunday night was the coldest for some time with ice on every open tank in the morning when the thermometer at 7 a.m. was 27°F.
