Burra Town Council, 17 May.

The Clerk reported receiving information from the Architect-in-Chief’s Department concerning proposed work at the schools – as previously noted – though adding that the new room would be of iron construction and the existing shed would be extended.  The room deemed unfit for used would be re-floored.

Two tenders were received for work to be done at the Lodge Room [in the Town Hall] and W. W. Carpenter was the successful tenderer.

The Town Clerk reported the election results as previously noted.
