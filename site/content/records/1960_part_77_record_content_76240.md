Burra Burra DC

The rate was declared at 2c in the dollar compared with 1.8c for 1974-75.  This was largely to accommodate inflation.  The minimum rate payable for a property in the Townships of Burra, Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat is $40.  Outside those the minimum rate payable is $15.  The differential rate has been declared at 10c in the dollar for all towns including Hanson, bringing town rates to the maximum possible 12c.  This has followed a further reduction in State grants for road works.  A grant from the Grants Commission in Canberra of $20,000 is one bright spot in the gloom.
