Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Cheer-up Ladies Band entertained friends and Cheer-up Society members at a social evening in St Mary’s Parish Hall to mark their disbandment.  The President E.W. Crewes thanked the girls for their invitation and for their magnificent record of patriotic work.  He also thanked the conductor, Mr James Bentley.  Their reputation was high throughout SA and other states.  He regretted their disbandment.  His remarks were supported by Rev. G.K. Haslam.
