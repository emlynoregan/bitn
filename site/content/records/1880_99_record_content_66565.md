Court.

John Bennett was charged with assaulting his wife on 8 July with scalding water.  M-C Jemison prosecuting.

Sophia Bennett recalled her husband coming home at noon and asking for money, but she said it was all committed to pay bills or the baby’s needs.  The butcher came then and when a small girl got her mother’s purse to pay him Mr Bennett took it from her.  When she continued to deny him the money he got cross, threatened to hang himself and then threw the contents of the kettle over her followed by a kerosene tin off the fire.  She ran outside and her husband followed and caught her by the hair.  A daughter ran to help her and took the baby.  Her husband let her go and she fled to a neighbour's where she sent a girl for M-C Jemison.  Her husband dragged her outside again and threatened to bash her face in.  She went home and her husband again started abusing her.  John Bennett tried to suggest his wife was drunk at the time, but the daughters supported their mother’s story.  He was sentenced to two months in gaol.

John Nelson was charged with using indecent language and fined £1 or 7 days.

On a further charge of indecent behaviour he was fined £5 or 1 month.

To both charges he replied he knew nothing about the matters.  He was allowed until Wednesday to find the money, but having failed, was sent to gaol.
