The Year 10 camp at Enfield High began last Sunday for four days.  Two Geography field tours encompassed Port Adelaide, North Haven, Westlakes and the Barossa Valley.  A morning was spent at the Parks Computing Centre and an afternoon at the Careers Centre in the city.  A morning was also spent at work observation at selected places.  Other activities were ice-skating at Marden, a visit to NSW 9 to see the taping of a segment of the Curiosity Show.  Some spent time at a beach and others took in a film or went roller-skating.  Facilities at Enfield High School were good (and cheap).
