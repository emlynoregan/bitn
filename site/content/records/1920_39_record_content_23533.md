The Red Cross Jumble Sale on 24 June raised £38-5-9 nett.

Sgt J.R. Johns was given a valedictory social in the Redruth Memorial Hall on 24 June.  Speeches are reported by Cr Riggs, Rev. R.H. Lee & Rev. Fr W.H. Nesdale, [A rare instance of the Catholic priest being in a protestant building and sharing a platform with the Methodist minister.] Mr Radford, E.J. Davey and the Mayor who handed over a wallet with £20.

Sgt Johns looked back on his six years and listed the things indicating progress in the town in that time: the unveiling of the Soldiers’ Memorial, the visit of the Hon. W. Hughes PM, the installation of electric light, opening of the new showgrounds, opening of the Redruth Memorial Hall, the Maternity Wing, the building of the Railway Dam*, many beautiful homes built on ‘The Crest’, two visits by the state Governor and two by Prime Ministers (Hughes & Bruce), the Back to Burra celebrations.  During his stay 200 people had received the pension.  He said he would meet up again with a Burr boy as M-C Tom Rosewall was also going to Loxton.  Rev. W.O. Harris ended the speeches and specifically welcomed Rev. Fr Nesdale to the gathering.

[* The building of the Railway Dam seems to have passed unreported in the paper for some reason and the reference to it at the social provoked laughter because locals had predicted accurately that it would never fill.]

Rev. F.B. & Mrs Hewitson were given a farewell in the Parish Hall.  There were speeches by the Mayor, P.J. Pickering (People’s Warden), Mr Bryant (Minister’s Warden), Mr Haese (in charge of Burra High School), Mr A.G. Gebhardt, Mr Twist, W.G. Hawkes and Master George Hann on behalf of the choir.  The formal part of the evening was followed by an hour or two of dancing.

The Kooringa Masonic Lodge presented Rev. Hewitson with an ornate inkstand during the week.

Rev. J.S.W. Coles of Norton Summit has been offered the position at Burra and we understand is likely to accept.
