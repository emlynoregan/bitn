Burra Town Council.

The Hydraulic Engineer has refused to allow Mr Sedgman to take charge of the Fire Brigade, as it would interfere with his other duties.

Police have been enquiring into the removal of trespass notices from the town gardens, but without success.

An electric streetlight is to be placed at the corner of Young and Morehead Streets, connected with Mr Reedâ€™s.  Arrangements will be the same as in Kooringa.

Cr Radford though a Fire Brigade should be organised.  The Hydraulic Engineer is to be asked to allow Mr Sedgman to instruct in the position and fixing of hydrants, fire plugs etc.  Some gentlemen are to be interviewed about organising a brigade.
