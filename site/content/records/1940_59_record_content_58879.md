Obituary.  Mrs J.R. Barker of Baldina died last Wednesday night [29 April].  She married Mr John R. Barker 35 years ago next July and was born Grace Mabel Fearon, eldest daughter of Mrs & the late Mr A.H. Fearon of North Adelaide and was born in Dubbo NSW in 1896.  After her marriage she interested herself in the welfare of the community.  She was the oldest surviving member of the Burra Red Cross and was at one time the branch’s vice-president.  In WWII she was, with other hard workers, instrumental in making the branch one of the foremost in SA.  She was also local head of the Burra Air Observers’ Corps for women and Vice-President of the Fighting Forces Comfort Fund and of the CWA.  She was a staunch member of St Mary’s Guild and Chief Organiser of the Baldina Section of the Women’s Fire Fighting Auxiliary and President of the local Girl Guides Troop.  She was also President of Burra Golf Associates and an interested non-playing member of the Aberdeen Croquet Club.  Her funeral was largely attended and 80 cars followed the casket to the cemetery.
