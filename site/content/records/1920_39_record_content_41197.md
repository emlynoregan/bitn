E.E. George MP advises he has received advice from E.J. Field Director of Lands concerning Soldier Settlers.  Cases will be considered individually.  Reductions in valuations must await more stable markets.  Interest rates will be reduced to 5% if soldiers are paying more.  Those unable to pay should forward what they can plus a statement of their financial position.  Extension of time for payment will receive full consideration.
