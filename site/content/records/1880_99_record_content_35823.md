Election Meeting chaired by the Mayor, Mr T.W. Wilkinson, Burra Institute, Tuesday evening last.

Three of the candidates came before the voters.

John Dunstan said his earliest recollections were of Burra where he was educated, received his commercial education and where he began his business career.  He was against a capitation grant to non-government schools or any other grant.  He was of the opinion that the temperance party have been directing their energies in the wrong direction.  You cannot make a man sober by Act of Parliament.  Traffic [in alcohol] should be properly regulated.  The young should be taught about alcohol and its effects.  He was in favour of elected land boards - i.e. elected from members of Corporations and District Councils.  He believed in protection for productive purposes (enough to get industries established), but not for revenue purposes.  Duty should come off the breakfast table - i.e. off tea, sugar, coffee, cocoa and kerosene.  Land tax should be eased as it was a tax on principal exports.  He was for Federation if entered into carefully and for a transcontinental railway.  He favoured divorce only on grounds of adultery with women placed on the same footing as men.  He favoured water conservation and the Lake Bonney Scheme.
