Salvation Army held special services at the barracks last Sunday in connection with the farewell of Captain and Mrs Bridges who leave this week for Kapunda.  The Captainâ€™s stay has seen an increase in converts and recruits and a financial improvement where income is said to be almost twice that of the corresponding half of last year.  His successor will be Captain Thomas.
