The Leader of the Opposition, Hon. L.L. Hill visited Burra on Friday 18 May and addressed a meeting convened by the ALP at the Burra Institute.  He was accompanied by Mr M. O’Halloran.  His speech concentrated on what he called the broken promises of the Butler Government – which had got in on promises of more employment, better wages, less taxation, better education facilities, migration and land settlement schemes, better housing and a fair deal for pastoralists etc.  Business was stagnating and the Government had grabbed all in filling recent Senate vacancies caused by the deaths of two Labor senators.  Increased taxation will yield a further £1,350,000 a year.  He went into considerable detail to try to refute allegations of financial incompetence of the previous Labor Government.  The report extends for c. 2¼ columns.
