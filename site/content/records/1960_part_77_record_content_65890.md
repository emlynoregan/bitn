ZOB.  Towards the end of 1972 a youth group named ZOB was formed in Burra under the guidance of Miss Lintern.  Mr Gerry O’Connor made the former Salvation Army Citadel available as a meeting place and three meetings and a Zob-a-thon to raise funds were held in 1972.  T.C. Mends took over from Miss Lintern when she was transferred to Adelaide in her employment.  This year so far there have been three meetings with an average attendance of 60.  The support of townspeople is needed and another Zob-a-thon is planned for 29 April [in the form of a sponsored walk].  Membership is open to those aged 12-19.
