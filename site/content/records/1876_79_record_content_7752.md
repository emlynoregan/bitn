Burra Town Council 8 December.

The Mayor reported that the Midland Road Board would visit on 12 December and he had invited them to a banquet at 6.00 p.m.

Captain Killicoat was appointed to open the Redruth Bridge. [As the local representative on the Midland Road Board.]

Town Clerk reported the sum available for expenditure on public works will be £759.

The Mayor said he hoped in cutting the bank opposite the Institute the Road board would co-operate and reduce the road to one level along the centre. He favoured Ayers St being a general charge, and that the police charge should be half north and half south instead of equally between the three wards. This is to be resolved next meeting.

Other items of expenditure as in the editorial column, though Middle Ward will start the road from Paxton Square via the Smelting Works to Redruth and to form a footpath to the Mine Bridge.

Cr Ridgway gave notice via letter in his absence of the following motions: - 1. The Inspector also to be rate collector at a fixed salary.

2. A man to be placed in charge of the cemetery at a salary and to act also as curator. 3. The Town Clerk to be also the Town Surveyor.

4. Two stationmen to be appointed from 1 February 1880 at £2 per week: one at either end of the town.

Salaries approved:

Town Clerk	£50 as Town Clerk

£50 as Clerk of Works

£10 as Curator of the Cemetery

£10 as Secretary of the Local Board of Health

Total (offer accepted)	£120
