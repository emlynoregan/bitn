Pte Cyril Edwards, son of Mr & Mrs Bert Edwards late of Mt Bryan, has just returned after serving for 1 year 8 months with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan.  He enlisted 5Â½ years ago aged 19 while residing in Clare and served in New Guinea up to the end of hostilities.  We believe he is the last Mt Bryan boy to return.
