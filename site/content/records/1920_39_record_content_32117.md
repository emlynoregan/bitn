General Aid Society AGM was held on Thursday at Redruth Memorial Hall with Rev. W.O. Harris in the chair.  President Miss Bubb reported.

The State War Council had restricted the use of the Soldiers’ Aid Society funds resulting in the reconstruction of the Society as the General Aid Society on 4 October 1928.  Money already collected by the Soldiers’ Aid Society was sent for Christmas Cheer: Angorichina Hostel £7 and the Returned Soldiers Hospitals at Keswick, Myrtle Bank & Bedford Park got £6-15-8 each.  The General aid Society then started with nothing and now has £24-18-1 in the bank.

We held the usual strawberry fete and then went into recess till 7 March.  This provided funds for Christmas Cheer to the blind, useful articles for Burra hospital patients and a donation to the Burra Benevolent Society.  Easter gifts went to Soldiers’ Hospitals and the electric fan fund of Burra Hospital.  A dance in August raised £7-3-0.  We sent £5 to Augie Brandt in his time of sickness.  Major donations have been £35 to the Royal Institution for the Blind and £15 to Burra Benevolent Society.  Mrs Warnes gave an address on the holiday portion of her overseas trip.

Elected were President, Miss Bubb; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames F.M. Pearce Sen., T. Fuller & T. Turner; Treasurer, Miss Bubb; Assistant Treasurer, Mrs A.S. Field and Secretary, Mrs H. Chambers.

35/- was collected for the Brandt Fund.
