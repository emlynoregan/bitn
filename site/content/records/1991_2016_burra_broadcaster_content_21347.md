Hi-Chick Project.  Work has begun on this project on the corner of Springbank Road and the Barrier Highway.  The first of the sheds should be operational by the end of May and the completed project will have five sheds.  Local contractors are connecting a pipeline to supply the operation with mains water as it comes in to Burra.  [2 photos]
