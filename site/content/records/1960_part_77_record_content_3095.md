Weather-Season

Rainfall to date for 1960 is 1349 points.  Most of the district has received about ten inches for the year and soils were getting very wet, but recent fine days and frosty nights have permitted some drying out to allow seeding operations.  Crops have germinated well enough, though some areas are waterlogged and some early sown crops are infested with weeds.  Pastures are generally looking well.
