Peacock’s Chimney

The Governor, Sir Eric Neal unveiled a plaque to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the re-siting of Peacock’s Chimney.  When SAMIN began the open cut mining at Burra in 1971 Peacock’s Enginehouse and Peacock’s Chimney were to be demolished.  Burra National Trust members Gerry O’Connor, Murray Tiver and Dudley Cockington set about saving the chimney, which was taken down stone by stone and rebuilt at its present site.
