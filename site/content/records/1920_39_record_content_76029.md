Improved Store for Bence’s Ltd.

£1,000 is being spent to modernise and reconstruct the old Drew & Crewes’ Store which has been taken over by Bence’s Ltd.  There will be a large Men’s Department with a Men’s Cash & Carry & Sporting Section.  The main Drapery Section will be laid out on a Cash & Carry basis with items priced and ticketed.  The Grocery Section has been sub-let to Mr A.P. Rogers who will specialise in Grocery, Hardware, Crockery & Glassware.  Changes are being supervised by Mr A.L. Bence.  The new frontage will be in place this week.
