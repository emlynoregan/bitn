The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]

The half-yearly meeting of the Sa Mining Association is as usual a very satisfactory one.

The ore raised in the six months amounts to 3,462 tons, estimated to average 22½% copper.  This added to the 2,658 tons on hand at 31 March gives a total of 6,120 tons.  Of this 3,873 tons have been delivered to the English & Australian Copper Co. in the six months, leaving 2,247 tons on hand.

At the beginning of the six months there were upwards of 95 tons of copper on hand and in that period 533 tons have been received from the Smelting Co. for ore delivered, making a total of c. 628 tons.  Of this 100 tons have been exported to Britain and 405 tons sold in the colony.  123 tons remain now on hand.

In the previous half-year ending 31 March 1864, 4,189 tons of ore were raised at a cost of £38,159-13-9 or £9-2-2 per ton realising £54,187-10-6 or £12-8-8 per ton for a nett profit of £16,027-16-9 or £3-16-8 per ton.  Compared with the previous half-year less ore was raised, but the expenditure was less and the profits were thus larger by more than £2,000.  To those profits are to be added £1,000 for rent and £6-2-6 for fees received for a total of £17,033-19-3 from which the 54th dividend paid on 3 October has been written off to leave a sum of £7,491-17-8 to credit of profit, covering all transactions to 31 March 1864.

Since the last half-yearly meeting the copper price has fallen from £116 per ton to £101 per ton and the good prices anticipated for the copper shipped have not been realised.
