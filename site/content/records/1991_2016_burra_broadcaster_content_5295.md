Tourism Restructuring

Burra’s management of tourism resources has seen changes in 1994.

Council has taken over direct responsibility for the Tourist Office, Paxton square Cottages, the Mine Museum and the Caravan Park from committees.

A committee of seven councillors will act as the Council Tourism Resource Committee to promote Burra as a tourist destination, in conjunction with the National Trust, the Regional Tourist Association and Burra Traders’ Association.

A Burra Tourism Executive Officer has been appointed to oversee this work.
