Burra Town Council

A special grant of £200 was given by the Local Government Department for the Kapunda-Peterborough Road.  [For the section from Sara’s Corner to the northern boundary of the Corporation.]

The Mayor wanted the road to the station declared a main road.  Cr Woollacott agreed.  Three roads led to the station and included the Bon Accord Bridge.  They were all maintained as local roads.  It was resolved that a letter be sent to the Highways and Local Government Assoc. asking for the road to be rescheduled.

The Mayor, Town Clerk (E.J. Davey) & Cr Woollacott were appointed to the High School Council.

W.L. James applied for the closure of a piece of road in section 2067 and for the purchase of the same if closed.  Granted.

Council agreed to hand over the Burra Hospital deed, as it is now an incorporated body.

Cr Pearce gave notice to rescind the decision on the roads sought by Mr Fairchild.  Cr Woollacott 2nd.

Cr Allen said Finch’s bridge was most creditable.

The Peterborough Band was given permission to hold a concert on the evening of 28 April.

Cr Woollacott asked that a light be placed in the Rotunda.  It would also help to light a dangerous corner.  Prices are to be obtained.

Cr Lee complained of ugly hoardings around the town.
