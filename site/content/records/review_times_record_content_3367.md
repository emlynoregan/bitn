District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said on Tuesday that he was delighted that a further tourist grant of $68,000 had been announced by the Minister of Tourism Ms Wiese at the weekend for further tourist development.  The funds come from the Tourism Development Assistance Scheme.  Some of the money will be used to beautify the area around Morphett’s Engine-House, with walking trails, lookouts and other landscape work.  The engine-house, which houses [sic: for housed] a Cornish beam engine used for pumping during the mining era of the late 1800s, will be opened in October along with the almost completed Bon Accord social history museum.  Ms Wiese said the mining area at Burra was an underdeveloped attraction, which would boost tourist appeal in the Mid North.
