Primitive Methodist Church, Copperhouse, anniversary on New Year’s Day.

‘The number at tea was so large that all the provisions were consumed; even the crusts of bread were eaten.’

‘Not half those present could gain admittance to the chapel.’  £16 has been paid of the debt and certain improvements made.
