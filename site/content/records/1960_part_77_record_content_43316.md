Obituary.  John Alfred Scott Fisher was born at Kilmore, Victoria, the youngest of three children.  He attended Moorabbin State School and later Rochester High School.  As a youth he worked at the Electricity Power House and the butter factory, where he gained a suction gas certificate.  He was a keen footballer and member of the Rochester Brass Band.  In Melbourne he joined Hume Steel Pipe Construction and came to Thevenard as a qualified welder on the Tod River Scheme.  Later he joined the E & WS Department and became second-in-charge of the Tod River Pumping Station.  In 1931 he married Irene Sheridan at Pt Lincoln.  He was later transferred to Burra as District Superintendent and was in charge of the gas engines used to pump the town water supply.  Here he was active in the Burra Rifle Club, Koonoona Cricket Club, Aberdeen Football Club, the War Memorial Committee, and the Burra Pictures.  (He held an ‘A’ class projectionist’s licence.)  He was an advisor to Rural Youth and was on the Burra Library Committee and a keen worker for St Joseph’s Church and School, Secretary of the High School Council and the Burra Racing Club.  He was a North Ward Councillor and was appointed a JP in 1950 and acted as local coroner for many years.  He retired due to ill health and died at the QEH 15 October 1968 [aged 63].  He is survived by his widow and three daughters: Joan Mrs Laredo, Margaret Mrs Deer and Helen Mrs Clark.  Mrs Hamilton of Tongala, Victoria is a sister and Mr H. Fisher of Christchurch, New Zealand is a brother.
