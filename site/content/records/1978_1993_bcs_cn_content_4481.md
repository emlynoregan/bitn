‘Community News’

Financial statement for the first six months of 1981:

Income

Clubs and Organisations	408.00

Individuals	321.75

BBDC	250.00

Burra Apex Club	956.15

1935.90

Costs

Printing	1553.50

Purchase of typewriter	875.00

Additional costs (Letraset etc.)	257.43

Photography	107.00

Maintenance of equipment	50.00

2842.03

BCS Contribution	907.03

Circulation is now in excess of 850 copies per week.

An income of at least $5,500 p.a. is needed and at present the contribution by Apex and BCS is more than is reasonable.  Much cost is saved by 14 community volunteers and student help.  An annual commitment by both individuals and organisations is needed so that a proper budget can be prepared.
