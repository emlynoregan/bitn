Mt Bryan Athletic Club has erected a building to serve as a refreshment pavilion or two roomy dressing rooms and shelter shed. Last Saturday it was opened by the Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC Mr I.J. Warnes.  A fancy dress football match preceded it.  Secretary T.J. Quinn said the total cost of building including voluntary labour was £115-10-2.  £34-16-1 has been received from the Athletic Club.  Temporary loans of £55 from individuals leave about £37 to be found.  Events on the day and donations raised almost £31 leaving only a small sum outstanding.  [50, 29, 24 July 1929 adds another £1 donated by Edlie Thomas.]
