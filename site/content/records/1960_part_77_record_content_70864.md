Stockowners’ Association of SA, Burra Branch held its AGM in the RSL Hall 8 April.

Elected: President, Mr Jock Duncan and Vice-Presidents, Messrs J.T. Drew & R.J. Ashby.  The retiring President, D.G. Radford, reported on a year that started well with prices holding up and record rains, but then came the fuel crisis, tumbling wool prices and a blowfly outbreak, with staggering losses.  Later beef prices also fell, combined with higher wages, shortages of labour and materials, the withdrawal of the super bounty and unfavourable taxation changes.
