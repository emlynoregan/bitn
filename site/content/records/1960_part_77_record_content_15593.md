Mr & Mrs Jim Prior of Hallett celebrated their Golden Wedding with a dinner for 150 people at the Hallett institute on Saturday 6 April.  In 1918 Jim married Miss Ruby Brown at Broken Hill at the first motorised wedding there.  [If this was their golden wedding they should have been married in 1913!]  The couple moved to SA when their daughter Elva was three weeks old.  In the 1920s Jim, known as ‘Nigger’ played football and cricket for Hallett and more recently he was runner-up in the singles bowls championship.  He has always been a strong supporter of the athletics clubs in the district.  Mr Pryor thanked the many friends he had in the district over 46 years there [suggesting he arrived in 1917.]  The cake for the occasion was made by daughter Elva, Mrs Backshall of Mt Barker WA.  Joyce, Mrs L.H. Aldridge and her husband were also present from WA.  [Details of this event extend for 2 columns with 2 photographs: one of the couple and one of Mr A.G. Owen-Smyth proposing a toast.]
