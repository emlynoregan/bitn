New road to the station was bituminised.

The footpath from the National Bank to the Post Office was bituminised.

So was the footpath from the Sunday School to Radford’s corner.

48 chains of road from the Young St Ford to the Racecourse Gate were bituminised.

A new road was made in Graham. [East of Burra Creek.]

Three employees were put on part time; losing on week in four.

Casual work was found for 63 men during the year at a cost of £282-17-3 for 397 days’ work, including those who worked out their rates.

A pound was established near the depot and a pound-keeper and assistant ranger appointed.

Income & expenditure figures are printed.

Ward accounts:

North Ward	in credit £14-15-0

East Ward	in credit £86-0-0

West Ward	in deficit £15-9-1

The Mayor felt that during his terms the work of the Council had gone on comfortably if not always unanimously.  He was not satisfied with the position of the Depot with respect to North Ward.  He considered Councillors should put the town as a whole ahead of the Wards they represented.

Not all Councillors agreed.

He thought it would be better with four wards and eight Councillors.  He would have the town divided east-west at the Church of England and north-south along the creek with funds allocated according to the work needed and not where money was raised.

In answer to questions he said:

The pound-keeper retained poundage fees.

An assistant Ranger was needed for court purposes.

To a question whether some employees are paid less than £3 a week he said three were paid 12/6 a day for three weeks in four.  [If they worked a 5½ day week they got £10-6-3 for three weeks’ work and spread over four weeks this was £2-11-7 a week.]

[There were then questions about the Town Clerk’s salary and this is clarified in his reply on page 3 of this issue of the paper.]

Cr Woollacott moved a vote of thanks for the Mayor & Mayoress.  Carried with applause.

Election candidates then took the platform.

Cr Woollacott [for Mayor] clarified the legal position of his nomination for the Mayoralty.

He had wanted a new assessment as the fairer way of adjusting the rates, but Cr Kellaway and the Town Clerk said a new assessment would cost £50-£60.  He was told an across the board adjustment could not be made, but that was being done in Burnside.  If returned he favoured the appointment of a committee comprising two from each of the Town & District councils and a representative of the unemployed to endeavour to devise a scheme to get some work.  Some thousands a year was being paid in the town for no return.  If the Government gave the Council money the unemployed would be given a certain amount of work and the roads would be kept in order.  The ration business was harmful to business.  Under the present system where were clothes and rent to come from?  Men wanted work not charity.  Like the Mayor of Pt Adelaide, he believed 1931 would be worse than 1930 and that had been the worst year ever faced.  Economy should start at the top, so he would not draw a penny of the usual allowance of £20 for the Mayor.  He believed the Town Clerk was one of the best in the state, but under the circumstances when the men had been asked to take less, he should as well.  He wondered where the money to run the Council would come from with reduced Government Grants and reduced subsidy on rates.

Cr Kellaway [for Mayor] said he was indifferent to the question of legality in Cr Woollacott’s nomination, which seemed to bother Cr Woollacott so much.  He would not be appealing on those grounds if Cr Woollacott won.  He believed that the rates paid could be reduced by lowering the assessment.  As for why Linkson St had not been repaired with the £15 in North Ward funds – the chairman on the Public Works Committee said it would cost £30-£40.  He had 9 years of service and that experience would be available to the Council.  He believed that something could be done with the Burra Mine.  If rations were allowed he thought men could earn on tribute sufficient for clothes for themselves and their children.  Though the Town Clerk’s salary was fixed by the Arbitration Court it would fall by £50-£70 if rates fell.

Mr Jennison [for North Ward] wanted rates reduced, but realised that if it meant lowering the standard of the town he would not be in favour.  At present roads should only be maintained and new works postponed.  He had not been nominated by the RSA to restore the guns.  Though he favoured the original scheme, he did not see how it could be done in the present circumstances.  He hoped the Town Band would succeed.  He hoped the ration scheme would go and that the Council would get the money to distribute instead.  The council needed motor transport; it would save much time and cleaning the town with motor transport was also needed.

Mr Kuchenmeister [for East Ward] is merely reported as saying he would do his best for the town and not for any ward in particular.

The Mayor said it was the new Council that finally had to adopt the assessment.

Cr Pearce said that in relation to Cr Woollacott’s assertion that Burnside was reducing its assessment by a % that it was possible for a DC, but not for a Corporation.

Cr Woollacott & Mr Bevan were in favour of reducing rates.

Mr Jennison said he needed more information and Cr Kellaway was in favour if it were possible.
