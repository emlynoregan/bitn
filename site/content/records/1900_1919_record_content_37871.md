Kooringa Police Court, 22 April.

James Henry Knevitt was charged with hindering police on 18 April.

P-C Horace Clyde Queale was on duty with F-C Correll outside the Burra Hotel at c. 11.15.  There was a congregation of c. 50 including Knevitt, Rosewall and Halls.  Rosewall was singing and ‘sidestepping’.  Queale told Rosewall to go home.  Knevitt stopped Rosewall’s departure and told police to leave him alone.  Queale told Knevitt to stop interfering and repeated the instruction to Rosewall who went off arm-in-arm with Halls to Henderson’s corner.  The three then crossed the bridge with the police following.  A further altercation took place in which Knevitt remarked to Correll ‘that he couldn’t beat him (Knevitt) in a — “dinkum” go’. 

James Knevitt (labourer) gave evidence that he saw Rosewall, who was pretty drunk, and was helping him home, but at Henderson’s Corner police told him to leave Rosewall alone.  Halls and Rosewall then went on alone followed by the police.  Shortly the police returned and told me to go home.  The police followed [me] and in the lane in Paxton Square Correll said to me ‘I’ll give you fight you —.’  He came up behind and hit me on the ear and on the temple.

The bench queried the absence of Halls and Rosewall as witnesses.
