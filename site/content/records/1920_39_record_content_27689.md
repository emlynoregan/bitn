Violet Day was held in local Methodist Churches last Sunday.  A large congregation heard Rev. W.O. Harris at Redruth, where Miss Reed was responsible for bowls of violets.  A similar service in the evening at Kooringa Methodist church also had a large attendance for Rev. E. Lawson.  There the masses of beautiful violets came from Mr J. Drewâ€™s garden.
