Burra Morgan Road

The sealing of this road has begun.  The road is presently sealed for 20 km west from Morgan.  Sealing of the next 17 km has now commenced and should be completed in September this year.  The entire project is due for completion in mid-1999.  It involves a major rebuilding of the road, not just a sealing of the existing road.
