Burra Hospital is to hold a trivia night at the Burra Sporting Complex on 14 June.  Proceeds will be split between the Hospital and the Heart Foundation.  Further funds for the Foundation will come from a 500 km desert walk.  Burra nurse Donna Kelly and her friend Gill Plastow will cover the distance between Ceduna and Woomera beginning on 21 July and taking about two weeks to complete the course.  This is not the pairâ€™s first desert walk.  They have previously covered the Googs Track, the French Line and the Madigan Line while raising funds and awareness for the cause of healthier hearts.
