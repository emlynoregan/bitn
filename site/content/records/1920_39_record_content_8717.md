Burra Hospital Board met last Thursday.

The motion to exclude the press was rescinded.

There was considerable discussion about the payment of accounts.

The back premises (Isolation Ward) are reported to be now in good order.

Cats remain a problem despite the shooting of some of them.

Matron will be allowed to keep a maximum of two cats.

There was a debate about varnish or lino for the nurses and lino was chosen, which annoyed Mr Collins.

The Chief Secretary is considering the requested change to the rules.  [Re a second Medical Officer.]

The Board considered this hiatus unsatisfactory.

W.G. Hawkes (Chairman) said that one problem was that the two doctors declined to work together.

[This discussion took place in the absence of Dr Steele.]

If the Government could not see the rules relaxed he for one could not see his way clear to assist in the management of the hospital.

Mr Davey said the impression he had from the Inspector General was that the change was not likely to be approved.

The rules were not state wide and at present Jamestown and Peterborough were drafting rules.  A conference between the two medical men and the Board was out of the question.  They had been to court and the sores would never heal.  He moved advertisements be placed for two medical med to act as Medical Officers for the hospital, without remuneration.  Mr Sampson seconded.

The Chairman said this would not answer the problem: people wanted their own doctor.

Mr Melrose said they had to wait for a Government reply.  The motion was carried with Melrose opposed.

Mr Sampson said if this did not settle matters he would consider resigning and testing the ratepayers to see if they would accept say a 1Â½d rate to appoint a resident surgeon from outside the town.
