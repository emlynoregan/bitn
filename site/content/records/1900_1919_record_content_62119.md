Burra Sporting & Athletic Club

Last Saturday evening the club held a meeting to present wallets to returned men who had not so far received them.  Mr J. Gallagher, President, presented the wallets at first, but called on Messrs Clark, Weymouth and Marston to complete the job.  Altogether 21 presentations were made.  40 had been provided for, but the others were unable to attend.  Mr Clark said that though unable to hold a sports day this year they hoped for a big gathering in 1920.
