Burra United Friendly Societies’ Demonstration & Sports was held last Wednesday.

The day was very warm and this, together with tennis at Aberdeen and the Rifle Club trip to Gawler, reduced attendance.  The gate was £11-10-0.  The band played in the Rotunda at noon and then marched to the Hospital and back to Victoria Park leading the lodge members in full regalia.  Entries were fair.

Results are printed.

[C.A. Fuss was chairman and A. Fuss one of the judges.]
