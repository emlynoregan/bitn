Burra District Advisory Committee has suggested to Council that a ‘no parking’ area be declared around traffic islands in Market Square.  Council will wait for advice from the Highways Department.

The committee has also suggested more public toilets and perhaps upgrading those at Porter Lagoon.

Signposting Farrell Flat Streets was also suggested and the committee will investigate whether the old Farrell Flat School is a significant building worth saving.
