Advt.  The BullRush Story.  Kerry Mosey was trained at Douglas Mawson Institute of TAFE in fashion.  She recognised a niche for quality locally produced clothing aimed at the Australian rural fashion market and consequently established BullRush Clothing in 1994.  The business continues to grow with a wholesale division catering to the Australian and New Zealand retail market.  There is a customer base extending to the UK and USA served by mail order and an online service.  [There is a retail outlet in Market Square, Burra.]
