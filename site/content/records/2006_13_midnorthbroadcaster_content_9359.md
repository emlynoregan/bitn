He has been SAPSASA co-ordinator and in recent years has had a solid commitment in the area of Work and Vocational Education.  He has been held in high regard by a broad cross-section of students of varying abilities and talents who have received help and support in work choices and life after school and many of whom have been assisted into employment.  Despite being a small school, Burra Community School has had a significant impact in sporting carnivals all over the state.  Mr Wenzel has been District SAPSASA co-ordinator and had greatly influenced the school’s sporting achievements and encouraged all students to get the most out of sporting experiences.  Principal Jim Low said many students count themselves very lucky to have had Mr Wenzel as a guide in their career choices and their sporting accomplishments.  He will continue in his role as SAPSA co-ordinator.
