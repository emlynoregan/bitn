Some changes made will affect Local Government procedure.  Certain District Councils will be able to ask the Government to proclaim that the chief elected member be a Mayor in lieu of a Chairman.  Wives of owners of rateable property are enfranchised.  Councils will be able to set revenue aside in Reserve Funds for certain projects.  Councils will be able to proceed with schemes of development or re-development providing the scheme has been approved by the State Planning Authority.  Postal voting procedures have been revised – in particular it will be easier to find authorised witnesses.
