Booborowie Soldiers’ Welcome Home Committee some time ago undertook to present each returned serviceman or servicewoman with a travelling rug.  As the rugs were available only on a quota system, 23 rugs were unavailable.  These last 23 have now been obtained, but at a much greater price and £100 needed to be collected to cover this.  About £60 was donated at a public meeting and the district is being canvassed for the remainder.
