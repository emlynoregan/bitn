Fire at the Burra Mine

On Saturday 14 April there was much excitement in the town as the news spread that there was a fire at the Mine and lives had been lost.  Unfortunately this proved to be all too true.  Although the fire was speedily brought under control two miners lost their lives.  ‘The cause of the fire was the accidental leaving of a lighted candle close to the timber-work in the 25 fathom level of the mine, which is perfectly dry, no water having risen so high for a considerable period.’

The telegrams sent between Captain Roach and Henry Ayers are printed.

The first at 9.40 from Roach says Roach discovered the fire in Stocks’ and Graham’s Shafts when he rose at 6 a.m.  He sent a captain and men below and they discovered fire at the 25 fathom level. He advises they were doing their best to extinguish the fire and he hopes no lives are lost.
