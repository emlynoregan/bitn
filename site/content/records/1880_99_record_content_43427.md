Burra Co. MI accepted Mr W.P. Barker’s invitation to visit his Baldina property on Wednesday.  36 men went out to try some manoeuvres there.  No less than 100 people were present to do justice to the good things provided under a large marquee procured from Adelaide.  A sumptuous meal was provided.

‘The toast was drank with ringing cheers.’ [sic] ‘Are you listen Walter?’ [sic]

The meal was taken in three sittings of 40 a time and after the manoeuvres the tables were laid for a tea of cakes, tarts etc.  They reached Burra on the return at c. 7.30.
