Inquest/Obituary.  On Saturday lance-Corporal Smith discovered the body of a man believed to be Patrick Coy, lying in a waterhole about two miles from World’s End Station.  At the inquest Samuel Davis ostler at the Miners’ Arms, said the about 11 p.m. on the night of the flood the deceased was in the house and asked the landlord for a candle.  The latter did not hear him and went away.  Deceased walked down the passage and into the back yard at the end of which is the unfenced bank of the Burra Creek.  The creek was flowing fast about 3 ft deep and 80 ft across.  Soon afterwards cries were heard from behind Mr Hutson’s premises.  William Watts, Mr Dawson and the ostler tried to help, but in the darkness could render no assistance.  The jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased, supposed to be Patrick Coy, was found drowned.’
