Obituary.  The Monkey Jack Wall died last week at Booborowie.  [Presumably this animal was well known in the district as no information leading up to his death is given.  It would seem reasonable to assume he was owned by a human Jack or John Wall.]  Apparently he escaped from his cage and created all sorts of trouble including taking the top of his Captainâ€™s little finger nearly off.  It was decided he had to die and having been hunted into a toilet and ending up down the hole was left there to die.  The next morning he emerged in a filthy state and was finally killed.
