Burra Hospital Ball, organised by the staff to aid the Building Fund, was attended by over 500 people on Friday night at the Burra Town Hall.  It is expected that the amount raised will be c. Â£90.  Dancing continued till 2 a.m.  A 10-piece dance orchestra came from Adelaide, led by Jack Brokensha.  Mc was the popular 5KA midnight announcer and disc jockey, Jack Fox.  CWA ladies coped admirably with less than favourable facilities to produce a most enjoyable supper.
