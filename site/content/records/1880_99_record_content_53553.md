Election Meeting at the Institute last Wednesday.  Six candidates drew a reasonable attendance, though the poor weather deterred many from the ‘outside country’.  P. Lane took the chair.  Each speaker was allotted 20 minutes.

Mr Basedow:

Came to the colony in 1848 and represented the District of Barossa 14 years in the House of Assembly.  The cause of the current depression is world wide low commodity prices and also the loss of banks in adjacent colonies and our own extravagance.  The Government had paid too much for improvements on land now lying idle.  Discord with labour was a problem.  He was against increased land tax.  Retrenchment in the public service was needed and the cost of ministers, judges and the Government also needed cutting.

Theo. Hack:

Was SA born and had been a Member of the house of Assembly for Gumeracha.  Labour was not to blame for the depression.  Prices for staple products were too low.  The main causes of the depression lay outside SA.  All departments of the civil service were overstaffed.  The general scramble for office in SA was also detrimental.  He favoured elective ministries.  He could not support a wealth tax which would be impossible to administer.  He did support bimetallism and irrigation settlements.

Mr Patrick:

In 1883 the population was 304,000 and now it was 340,000 and should have been 370, 000 but for out migration.  In the same time the area under cultivation had fallen from 2.7 million acres to 2.6 million.  Mineral production has also been falling and debt per capita has risen.  He was a free trader and in favour of retrenchment, starting at the top.  He opposed a wealth tax or a property tax and favoured a state bank.  He was against progressive land tax and for reduced customs duties.  He opposed land grant railways.

W.B. Rounsevell:

The colony was in a bad way.  Labour and capital needed to go hand in hand.  He favoured land and income tax, but was against a progressive land tax and against a single tax.  He was for retrenchment from the top.  The Education Department alone could lose £140,000.  It was not fair that those whose taxes paid for public schools should also pay for private schools.  He would cut wages to Members of the House of Assembly and abolish payment for Members of the Legislative Council.  He would not pay for improvements on leases.  He supported local industries, free trade and federation.

Mr William Russell:

Was a farmer near Jamestown and had been in the colony 27 years.  He had spent time in the District Council and the Farmers’ Assoc.  Further taxation was needed.  He was never a member of the National Defence League.  They scorned him as he favoured progressive land tax.  The Legislative Council had been too conservative in the past.  Farmers had not been fairly represented in Parliament and not one sat in the House of Assembly.  The extra tax should come from properties of over £5,000 – the large sheep runs – not from farmers.  He was for the payment of members, but for cutting their income from £200 to £150.

Mr Martin:

Was a colonist of 47 years and he had helped the farmer when possible.  Labour troubles were largely responsible for the present crisis.  Unions were a major cause and other aspects of it involved extravagance.  He favoured protection.  The demonetisation of silver was another problem.  He opposed progressive land tax and was for federation.  He was not in favour of easing the requirements for voting in Legislative council elections or of shortening the length of Legislative Councillors’ terms.  He was for water conservation.
