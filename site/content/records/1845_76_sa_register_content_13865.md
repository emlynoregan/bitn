Kooringa News, 22 December

On Thursday and Friday last the scholars of Mr Miller of St Mary’s School were examined by Rev. Ibbetson in the presence of a number of parents and friends.  The program included scripture, history, grammar, natural philosophy, arithmetic, reading, etc.  Prizes were distributed to the most proficient on Friday and tea and cakes were provided.

At Redruth the school run by Mr Bennett has been going for about 10 months.  There are 87 pupils; 52 boys and 35 girls.  The smaller students being in a separate room with Mrs Bennetts.  The scholars here were somewhat severely tested in mental arithmetic, geography, grammar, spelling, reading and history, but they proved themselves equal to the ordeal, with prompt answers and general intelligence.  Mr MacDermott, in retiring, expressed his pleasure and complimented the teacher and scholars on the efficiency of the school.  There was a vigorous onslaught on the tea and cake before the school broke up for the Christmas holidays.

On Friday Mr & Mrs Stephens held their examinations.  The infant school is conducted by Mrs Stephens, assisted by an intelligent monitor.  Here there are 40 boys and 26 girls.  The pupils displayed quietness and decorum and a proficiency that is testimony to the superiority of the Lancastrian over the old-dame-school system in the management and instruction of the young.  In the evening the upper school was examined by Messrs R.G. Wilkinson, Forder and Stephens and Rev. Davidson in geography, reading, spelling, history, mental arithmetic, etc.  The whole result was most creditable to both teacher and students.  Four of the most advanced pupils assist Mr Stephens as monitors and they were examined separately.  They competed for a prize, but were so evenly matched that it was only with difficulty that the decision was finally in favour of a boy named Williams.  After this Mr Stephens entertained the students with a series of dissolving views.  He also revealed that unknown to him, a group of gentlemen who took an interest in the school, had sent a parcel of books to be distributed as prizes.  The Magistrate Mr McDermott is to be commended for his interest shown in visiting all the examinations of schools in the district, even at some inconvenience to himself.

A public temperance meeting was held on Wednesday in the Primitive Methodist Chapel.  For various reasons the attendance was small.  Mr J. Skews Sen. took the chair and addresses were given by Revs Davidson and Whittaker.  Several people signed the pledge after the meeting.
