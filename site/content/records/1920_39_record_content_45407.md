Mongolata Goldfield

[Byles’ GM Co.] At the 92ft level the drive south advanced to 176ft in formation.  Rich seams have now pinched to a thread and values are low.  A rise started at 81ft to connect with the winze from 52ft level has been completed.

52ft level winze number 3 has been connected to the 92ft level.  The south drive of this winze was extended 11ft on formation 9” and a good patch of 60oz of gold was encountered.

Stoping was started above this level, but values are low.

Golden Harp.  Shaft has been sunk 16ft to 32’6” and close timbered to 28ft: ground broken and loose.

Mongolata South GM Co. has taken over a claim 200 yards south of Pexton’s Takati and prospecting has begun.  A nice 6” seam has been opened.  Syndicate shares are offered at £5 fully paid and the prospectus can be seen at the office of the secretary, Graham Dow.
