Edde Collins [sic] writes a rebuttal of Mr Edward’s letter of 6 February re the price for gravelling roads at Mt Bryan.

Mr Edwards has not earned 14/- a day at this contract, as he leads people to believe.  I don’t believe A.E. has made 3/6 a day (horses and dray given in).  He took a contract for 10 chains at 9/- a chain gravelling and took 9½ days over it.  Why was the tenderer not kept up to scratch?  One contract near Mr Bowman’s sheep station is a disgrace, using inferior stuff.  I will work alongside A.E., same hours and earn quite as much as himself, if not more, any time he likes to mention it.  All I want is a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.

[The editor says he had to exercise considerable discretion in eliminating a considerable portion of this letter.]
