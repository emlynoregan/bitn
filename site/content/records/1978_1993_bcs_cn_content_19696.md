Baker & Wooton Family History.  Research by Tasma Wooton, BCS Year 12 History.

One of my great great-grandfathers, William Baker was born c. 1831 and arrived in Adelaide in 1845.  In 1857 he married Mary Ann Webb (nee Bowden).  William was a carpenter and labourer.  William and Mary’s second child, William, lived only one week.  My great-grandfather John Baker was born in 1858.  In the 1880s he secured land at Moockra where he lived with his wife and children.  Large herds of passing cattle used to be watered on the Baker farm, where they were spelled for a day or so.  Rates were 1 penny per head of cattle, 2 pence per horse and 3 pence per camel.  Nearby was an underground cellar used as the girls’ sleeping quarters.  A boys’ room 20 feet x 10 feet was built from rolled out kerosene tins and pine posts.  Seven daughters and three sons survived childhood.

Another great great-grandfather George Wooton was born in England in 1835.  At the age of 12 he went to work for Queen Victoria in her stables.  At 19 he migrated to Australia.  Before he left the Queen gave him a number of gifts – a pipe rammer, a pipe cleaner and a smoker’s cap.

The research of my family’s history has strengthened family ties and I have been introduced to a range of people.  I have learned to use various research tools and learned about the history of SA and the Burra District.
