The Burra Arts Council reformed seven weeks ago after an absence of seven years.  The President is Louise Baker.  They have already sponsored a Song and Dance Program for children and a Wool and Fabric Dying Day.  They are planning a School Holidays Activity Program for primary children and events for the October long weekend.  Memberships from the community are sought at $5 p.a. or $10 for a family.
