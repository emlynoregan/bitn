The Highways Department advised of the proposed deviation of the district road from Main Road 46 to Burra.  This necessitated the re-opening of the road between sections 2264 and 2263, which had been closed 8 April 1880.

The Council’s subscription to Burra Hospital for 1952-53 was £1,380 and for the Clare Hospital £10.

The Main Roads Grant was £5,500 with Council to contribute £300.

Federal Aid to Rural Areas was £900 with the Council to contribute £275.

The Grant-in-aid was £337.

Negotiations with Messrs T.J. & W.H. Quinn for the purchase of one chain wide strip of land at Mt Bryan were finalised except for legal formalities.
