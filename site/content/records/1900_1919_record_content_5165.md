Accident.  On Thursday night, between the Court House Hotel and the Black Bridge in Aberdeen, the mail cart collided with one of Hallsâ€™ cabs.  The mail cart driver, the lad P. Carey, expected the cab to turn towards the hotel, but instead it turned up the road beside the Methodist Church and the mail cart crashed into the horses of the cab throwing out A. Ockenden and P. Carey.  The former was scratched and cut and received a sprained wrist and the latter a cut on the head which was not serious.
