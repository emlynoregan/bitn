Anzac Day Commemorative Service was held at Market Square on Sunday 25 April.  Attendance was lower than usual, probably due to the Monday holiday.  A little drizzle as the march started soon cleared.  About 60 returned men marched, led by local RSL President Mr H. Griffen and headed by the Marananga Band.  W. Kotz and Mr Burt (for the Air Force) were flag bearers.  Pastor M. Martin (Methodist) read the lessons and gave a short address.  Rev. C. Christopher of Redruth announced the hymns and Captain Badenoch of the Salvation Army read the prayers and took the responses.  Wreaths were laid by H. Griffen for the RSL, John Riggs for the Air Force Assoc., C.W. Knight for the Demobilised Soldiers’ Assoc., Mayor W. Carpenter for the Town, E.E. Finch for the Burra Burra DC and A.B. Riggs for the Fathers’ Assoc.

The RSL entertained the band after the service.

Church Parade in the evening was at Redruth Methodist Church.
