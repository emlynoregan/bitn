Sales

H.V. Porter’s 400 acres of freehold land at Gum Creek was sold on Friday for £37 an acre.

L.R. Bell’s homestead block of 55 acres freehold was passed in at £29 an acre, but will probably be sold by private treaty.

L.R. Bell’s perpetual lease property of 507 acres brought an unacceptable offer of £14 per acre, but is also likely to be sold by private treaty.

Burra Progress Assoc. decided at its November meeting to begin the purchase of playground equipment, beginning with a large slide, a log swing, a double seesaw and two self-propelled swings with footrests for the tiny tots.  There was a proposal to extend the area to the swing bridge.

It was also decided to hold the Christmas Pageant on Christmas Eve again this year, after which gifts will be distributed from the Buffs’ Christmas Tree. Then Mr G.H. Dollman will compere a concert at or near the Rotunda and Mr Walter Nankivell will MC a dance in the RSL Hall.  Ron James of Gladstone will be asked to bring his merry-go-round.
