Superphosphate Rationing.  Developments in the Pacific had necessitated the revision of the rationing scale for superphosphate.  From 1 January 1942 consumers will receive only 60% of the quantity purchased by them in 1939-40.  The change would also affect forward orders with deliveries after that date.
