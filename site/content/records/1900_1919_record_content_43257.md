Percy Fuss was struck by the train at the Bon Accord crossing c. 11.30 p.m. on Saturday and he was carried on the cowcatcher for 143 yards.  He was taken to the hotel and treated by Dr Steele.  He was battered and bruised and the skin was stripped from the shin of one leg.  His survival is a miracle.  He is recovering in the Burra Hospital.
