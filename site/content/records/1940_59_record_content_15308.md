Obituary.  Mrs Richard Hill died at her residence in Burra on Friday last 15 October.  She was born near Porter’s Lagoon 29 October 1860 as Mary, third daughter of Mr & Mrs John White of Koonoona Station.  After leaving school she was employed by Mr & Mrs James Cater, first headmaster of Burra School.  She married Mr Richard Hill 8 May 1881 and her husband died 10 February 1929.  In the Great War four of her five sons saw overseas service in Palestine and France.  George died of wounds in France and Sam died of pneumonia.  Horace, late AIF, died two years ago.  She always gave generously to church and patriotic affairs.  Her illness in recent months took her to the city for treatment.  Three children survive: Ben Hill, Mrs John Quinn (Adelaide) and Mr Charles Hill (of Waterworks Dept Pt Pirie).  There are 12 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

[Mary White’s birth is hard to confirm, but a Mary White, daughter of John White was born at ‘Gum Station’ (District of Burra) 30 October 1861, which is a suggestive date.  Her mother was cited as Jane Mavis, but possible siblings have mothers cited as Myers & Mair, which could make them victims of bad writing or illiteracy, or could mean another woman as mother.  The third daughter statement can’t easily be confirmed.]
