Obituary: The Tilly Kubel Case.

The body of Miss Kubel was found by three small boys.  It was floating in a pool by the old ford just south of Roach’s Mill.  They told the news to Mr W.J. Richards and M-C Farrell retrieved the body.  A crowd soon gathered to see the ambulance pass and Dr Sangster jun. identified Miss Kubel at the morgue.  It is surprising that she was not discovered earlier in such a frequented place.

[Details occupy a 1⅓ column report, but add little of substance.]  Mr McGilchrist JP decided no inquest was necessary.  [Born Johanna Mathilda Kubel 25 February 1884 at Bundey: died Johanna Matilde Kubel 14 October 1908 at Burra, residence Kooringa.]
