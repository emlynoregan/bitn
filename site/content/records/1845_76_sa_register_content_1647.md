Wreck of the Brechin Castle

This ship bound for Swansea with a cargo of wool and copper ore is reported lost with all 16 hands and 8 passengers.  [There is some debate about where it went down in the Bristol Channel: near Oxwich or in the vicinity of Mumbles Roadstead.]

The editor adds that the 8 passengers on the passenger list do not include Mr & Mrs Booth and two children or Mr Cook who boarded as the vessel was sailing.
