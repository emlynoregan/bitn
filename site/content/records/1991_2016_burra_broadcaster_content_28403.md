Letter.  Dr Roger Cross, Faculty of Education, University of Melbourne, writes to express his dismay that the BCS staffroom was allowed to be used ‘to peddle the most ridiculous and dangerous beliefs about the origin of species’.  People in a democracy are allowed to promote most ideas, provided they do  not harm others, but the school is there to promote intellectual and social development of a future generation and has a duty to reject some beliefs as not being appropriate – it should not provide ‘legitimacy to what are at best silly, and at worst dangerous beliefs.’
