Helen Szuty does amazing work in producing her independent magazine The Visitors Monthly, which provides tourists with information about the Barossa Valley, Clare Valley and the Copper Country (Kapunda, Burra and Yorke Peninsula).  Now in its second year it is achieving increasing popularity.  It was first published in November 2001 [so not yet in its second year!] and is a tribute to a woman of remarkable drive and focus.  Helen not only edits, publishes and markets the magazine, but delivers a tonne of papers herself â€“ in excess of 10,000 copies a month.
