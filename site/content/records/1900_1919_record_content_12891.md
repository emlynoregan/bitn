John Newcomb, aged 13, was sent to the Brooklyn Park Reformatory for stealing food from a bag on the platform at Farrell’s Flat on 18 January.  He is an orphan who had been sent from the Industrial School to work at Clare, but did not like the position.  The editor conjectures that he is the son of John Newcomb who was some time ago a Burra resident and pursued many occupations including pretending to be a solicitor in the town.  It is believed he and his wife died some time ago in Port Pirie.
