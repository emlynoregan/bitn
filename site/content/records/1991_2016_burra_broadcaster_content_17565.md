Mary Talbot Cross’s The Foundling will be available for sale in Burra from the middle of this month.  It is the story of ordinary folk in Kooringa and their struggle to endure in the shadow of the Burra Burra Mine.  It is set against the backdrop of the Burra strike of 1848, floods and first elections and then the mass exodus to the Victorian Goldfields as 1851 draws to a close.  The hero, Julia Stephen grows from girl to woman against this background.  The author did much of her research for the book in the Auhl Local History Room and acknowledges the help given to her by the late Ian Auhl.
