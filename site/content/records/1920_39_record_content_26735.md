Hanson Methodist Sunday School foundation stone was laid on 28 April.  Rev. W.O. Harris conducted a service prior to the ceremony, assisted by Rev. Lawson.  A move for a hall had been mooted 25 years earlier, but nothing had come of it.  There was a desire for it to be known as Flower Hall.  Rev. Harris said Methodists were more accommodating than Anglicans and Catholics in allowing their churches to be used for other purposes, such as schools and other functions.  He hoped at Hanson this would now cease.  The new hall had some limits imposed on its use by the Methodist Conference.  No dancing was allowed in a Methodist building: ‘the dancing of today was a menace to the young folk’.  ‘Methodist halls were also distinctly prohibitionists.’

Mr E.S. Blunt the Trust Secretary deposited records under the stone – coins, newspapers and a program of the proceedings.  Mrs Thomas Rogers performed the ceremony.  The amount raised including the sum towards the piano was £639-3-2 in hand.  Stone etc. had been placed on the ground and only labour had to be paid for.  The price for the masonry and carpentry was £512-16-0 and the piano would add £66.  Furnishing and lighting would amount to £110.  In all they expected the total cost to be £923-2-3 and Rev. Harris hoped for the £283 balance that day.  Proceeds for the day are expected to be c. £100.
