The Burra Record.  This issue saw a change in the size and organisation of the paper.    It increased in size to become seven instead of five columns wide.  It changed from eight pages to four and many items were printed using an annoyingly smaller typeface.  The reason given was that with an increased circulation they needed to print the paper more quickly and the new format cut the number of times the paper had to run through the printing machine.
