The Burra Community School Council has mounted a commemorative plaque in the Geraldine Smedley Garden.  This garden was so named last year to acknowledge the interest and work that Geraldine and the students have put into it.  It is about seven years old, having been started as a science experiment to see how seedlings and cuttings grow.  [Photo]
