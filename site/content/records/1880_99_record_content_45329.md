The Chinamen at the railway station are in the habit of trapping magpies and last week a tame one managed to get entangled.  Its wings were cut short and it had one leg broken, yet it managed to travel half a mile over difficult obstacles and returned home for food.  [It is likely this refers to the Chinese gardeners on the flat by the creek west of the station.]
