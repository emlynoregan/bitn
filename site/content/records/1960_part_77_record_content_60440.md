The Burra Strike of 1848 [By Ian Auhl?]

News of the strike reached Adelaide 15 September 1848 with a request that twenty policemen be rushed up country because the mines had been occupied by 300 incensed miners, who were refusing to move even one ton of ore.  The trouble started when the Sa Mining Association decided to sack Mr Thomas Burr, Superintendent of the Mines.  When Burr refused to resign the Directors went to Burra and he was relieved of his duties.  He left for Adelaide.  The miners then complained of a grievance concerning the analysis of the ore samples.  The system used three samples taken from each miner’s ore when it was cleaned and dressed.  The first was taken by the miner, the second by the Superintendent and the third was sent to the Directors in Adelaide.  The assay made in Burra was agreed to by both parties, but the Adelaide tests were frequently at variance.  The miners thought they were being underpaid and the Directors thought the miners were seeking high rates for low grade ores.  The Directors refused to talk and threatened to close the mine.  There was a large quantity of ore on hand, which had to be assayed before the miners could be paid and the miners took control of the mines to prevent the ore being shifted.  Only eight of 300 miners tried to work and two of them were tied back to back and paraded through the streets on a wheelbarrow – the other standouts were compelled to push the barrow.  The Directors called on the solitary policeman to arrest the ring-leaders, but he had no chance.  The news caused Burra Mine Shared to slump from £220 to £120 for a £5 share.  Police Commissioner Dashwood and Inspector Tolmer headed to the Mines and several miners were fined for threatening language.
