Burra Burra Miners’ & Mechanics’ Institute

Mr Challoner chaired a meeting at the Burra Hotel last Friday.  The committee reported that since the last meeting the collectors had raised £200, apart from what they could expect from the Mining Company and the Copper Company.  The SA Mining Association had promised £200 plus £50 towards the library and £20 for the first year of operation.  The Copper Company had promised £50 when the foundation stone was laid and £50 when it was ready for roofing, £25 towards book and when it had been established one year, an annual subscription.  The Government had promised one third of the amount for a suitable building and Captain Allen £25.  They proposed erecting a building to seat 100, with necessary accommodation for the librarian and would be so arranged as to allow easy expansion in the future.  The SA Mining Association had granted a lease for 99 years at a peppercorn rent.  The Secretary had been authorised to write to England for some suitable books and periodicals, which he had done.

It was then resolved to form a Working Man’s Committee to facilitate the communication of the views of the working classes to the committee.  This was initially to comprise Messrs William Turpin, Charles Fellows, James Skewes, Christopher Dent, and Daniel Ryan with the power to increase their number to 12.

(Moved Mr Maurau & seconded Mr Joseph Woods.)

It was also resolved that in the event of the Governor paying a visit to the township he be asked to lay the foundation stone, since he had been instrumental in calling it into being.  (Moved Dr Mayne & seconded Mr McNamara.)

Rev. Ibbetson moved that the subscription be £1 with a 5/- entrance fee; the latter to be waived if the person had already contributed a like sum to the building fund. Seconded Mr Thomas Bath.

Rev. Wright then moved that the plan shown that evening be adopted and forthwith proceeded with.

He had no doubt they would receive plenty of assistance from the working classes.

‘They had a good thing in hand and it must go on.  The great object of their anticipated Institute was the moral advancement of all.  It was for the good of the poor man; it would tend greatly to raise men in the scale of usefulness.’  (Seconded by Rev. Hillman.)
