Mary Elizabeth Bagg gave details of what she had done on hearing the shot.  She had sent word to John Carey, Mr Launder (who was working on the new house) and to Dr Brummitt.

Walter Edgar Bagg, eldest [surviving] son of the deceased was the first on the scene, which he described in some detail.

The verdict was of suicide while in a state of temporary insanity.

The deceased leaves a wife and six children, the youngest of whom is â€“ years old.  [The blank space in the paper should be filled with the number 11.  Note that Walter Edgar Bagg sadly died 21 Apr. 1896 of phthisis (TB) aged 20.]
