Burra Annual Show.  The 3rd annual show of Burra & North Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural & Pastoral Society was held last Wednesday and was a great success with record attendance and the gate up £10-£11 on last year.  The weather was not good with intervals of drizzling rain and high wind.  People nevertheless came in large numbers.  Preparations had been excellent.

Elaborate preparations had been made to receive the Governor, who was to attend and open the show.  He duly arrived on Tuesday and was a guest of Mr A. McCulloch at Princess Royal.  But on that afternoon a wire was received announcing the sudden death of the Hon. P.P. Gillen, Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the Government advised the Governor to fulfil no public engagements on the following day, much to the disappointment of many people.

The sumptuous luncheon was well patronised, supervised by Mr S. Edwards.  It was held in a large marquee.  The side shows did good business and the Burra Band played selections in the afternoon.  150 people took part in the show, producing 778 exhibits.

The Agriculture exhibits were very competitive.

Dairy products suffered from a bad season, though the bacon and hams were of excellent quality.

Poultry produced some of the finest birds ever seen in Burra.

E.W. Crewes ‘scooped the pool’ with his fine lot of canaries in that section.

Horse entries were not numerous, but were of good quality.

Cattle produced some good quality competitors.

Ten greyhounds were prominent in the dog section.

Sheep were fairly well represented, but more could come from owners of flocks of under 2,000.

Pigs were better this year.

Implements were few.

Vegetables drew few competitors, but the quality was fine.  This section was dominated by C. Oppermann & S. Baker.

Flowers were better than ever.  Mrs A. Nykiel was the chief prize-taker.

[Personal interest: no mention of any Fuss entries this year.]

Cookery & needlework were rather neglected this year.

The School Class was well represented.
