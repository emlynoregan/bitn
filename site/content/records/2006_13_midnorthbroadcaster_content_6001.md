Letter.  Marj. Edmonds writes calling for ideas on how to promote tourism.  She begins with suggesting a large pictorial sign near the start of the bypass, to direct people into the town.  She calls for a concerted community effort to produce ideas and for volunteers to keep the current attractions open for longer.
