Burra & Booborowie-Hallett Football and Netball Clubs have amalgamated.  This is revealed in a note on the operation of the Burra Community Sports Club Inc.  It is pointed out that membership of the football or netball clubs does not make a person a member of the Sports Club.  One must be a member, or be signed in by a member, or be an honorary member, to drink at the club.  Previously Booborowie-Hallett players or officials were honorary members for the day, as they were Burraâ€™s visitors.  With the amalgamation of the clubs, this is no longer the case.
