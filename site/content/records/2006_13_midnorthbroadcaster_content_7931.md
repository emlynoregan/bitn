AGL will double its AGL Hallett 3 Wind Farm Community Fund contribution to $30,000 following approval of Stage 3.  In all the AGL Hallett Wind Farm Community Fund is now more than $75,000 per year.  AGL is investigating whether the intensity of red aviation lights can be reduced and a number of lights on existing wind farms will be turned off.  The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is developing new guidelines.
