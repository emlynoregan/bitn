We note that trapping is needed because for over three months now the men at Mongolata have had their extra allowance of 7 lb of meat a fortnight cut off.

Things on the field are generally very quiet.  Byles’ Mine is waiting for new machinery and is employing only seven men at present.

The battery is kept going with parcels from other claims and at present is crushing from the Baldina Co.’s claim.

After about 4½ years’ work Mr Rolph Anderson and W. Trew are on good prospects, working on a claim about four miles north of Byles’. 

Mr H.F. Seaton left Mongolata last week after three years there.  He has obtained a position in Adelaide.  He will be missed as President of the Sports Club and at Tennis etc.

The Sports Club has decided to postpone its usual October Sports in hopes of a bigger meeting later.

New arrivals, Mr & Mrs Ton Pexton and children are expected to take up residence soon in their newly erected home.
