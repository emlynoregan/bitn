Mid Northern Secondary Schools Athletics Day was held last Thursday at Burra Racecourse Oval.  Schools competing were Balaklava, Clare, Burra, Kapunda, Riverton and Eudunda.  Riverton gathered most points in both the Champion and Handicap Divisions, but as the rules say a school cannot win both shields in the same year, Burra retains the Handicap Shield.  Mr Quirke MP opened the dayâ€™s activities and Mr J.H. Pash, Inspector of High Schools presented the Shields.  [Results are printed for events, but aggregate scores are not given.]
