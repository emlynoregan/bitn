Kooringa Methodist Church has farewelled Rev. P.N. Potter who was appointed to the position just over a year ago.  Just prior to Christmas Rev. Neil Usher of Redruth Methodist Church enlisted as a padre.  Mr Potter was given charge of both circuits in Burra and went to live in Redruth.  He has covered the Kooringa Circuit as well with the help of Mr Arnold Hunt, a student from Wesley College.

At the end of the service at Kooringa on Sunday Mr Edgar Pearce, one of the church officers, paid tribute to the work of Rev. Potter and also to that of his wife.  A presentation of a lovely eiderdown was made on Monday.  Rev. & Mrs Potter leave today for Cummins.
