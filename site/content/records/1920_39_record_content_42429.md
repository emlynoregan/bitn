Liberal Federation.  With the merging of the Federation with the Country Party the branches of either now cease to function and Burra Women’s Branch met for the last time on Friday last to disband.  Mrs I.J. Warnes took the chair and urged members to keep true to their party’s principles.  She referred to the previous Presidents of the Branch: Mesdames E. Bowman, T. Sandland & W.G. Hawkes [& the paper of 13 July adds Mrs J. Fatherly] prior to her appointment in 1921.  She referred also to the Secretaries: Miss Edith Cave, Mr W.B. Page, Miss M. Sandland, Mrs Maurice Collins & Miss Minnie Rogers who had given eight years service.  Miss Rogers had to resign on account of her health and was presented with three bound volumes.  Mrs Warnes said she would soon be called on to form a Ladies Branch of the new League.  Mrs G.G. Hawkes moved a vote of thanks to Mrs Warnes.
