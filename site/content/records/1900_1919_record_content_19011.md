It is probable Morphett’s Shaft will be repaired from top to bottom.  The Burra Mine has been allowed to remain idle while smaller and less significant shows have been worked to advantage.  To get a return a smelter is essential.  There is every reason to believe 1907 will return prosperity to the town.
