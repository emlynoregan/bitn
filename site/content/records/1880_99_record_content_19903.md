Letter from ‘Ratepayer’ who attended ‘the farce of a meeting held . . . on Friday last.’  There was no report on the stewardship of the retiring councillors and no outline of the works they would like to see in the future.  The only candidate for Mayor was above appearing.  Unless there is a good reason for that I would like to see another candidate come forward with a policy for next year.  As the Mayor says he will call another meeting I trust that then we will hear a report on 1885 and some proper policy statements for 1886.  ‘As I learn, the Town Clerk not only gets his £120 or £130 from the rates for doing very little work, but that he also gets a certain amount from the Waterworks department for work which in all conscience the officer of that department could do himself, and if the amount of salary must be paid out of the waterworks funds, why not let the one who does the work have the pay?’
