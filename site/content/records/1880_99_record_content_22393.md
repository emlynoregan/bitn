Inquest at Baldina into the death of Hermann Rooke who fell under the wheels of a wagon on Saturday.

Coroner, J. Dunstan jun. JP and H. Pinch, foreman of the jury.

Gottlieb Rooke identified the body as that of his son Herman Rooke aged 22.

John August Arnold said he identified the body.  They left Midwinter’s Hotel with wagon drawn by eight horses and the deceased and I walked behind the wagon which contained Carl Obst and his boys and the deceased’s brothers.  When we caught up I climbed up behind and the deceased sat on the shafts and urged the horses on.  They began to trot and then he got down and tried to hold them back. He had hold of the near-side shafter and appeared to fall.  I saw the deceased behind the wagon.  Got down and lifted him up.  He walked with me some distance and then lay down.  Obst asked where it passed over him and he pointed to his abdomen.  Deceased was not drunk: he had four glasses of beer while I was with him.

Carl Obst substantiated the above, saying the deceased had three glasses of beer before Arnold came and was not tipsy when we left Midwinter’s.

William Midwinter jun. son of William Midwinter who keeps the Woodcutter’s Arms* Baldina, agreed that the deceased was not the worse for liquor.

The verdict was death by a wagon passing over his body and was accidental and not otherwise.

[* I have not found this name used for the hotel anywhere else and it is not designated thus in Hoad.]
