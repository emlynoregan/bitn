The Federal Bauxite and Copper Committee visited Burra yesterday and inspected the Burra Mine.  Representatives of the Council and the Burra Progress Association visited the Commission members the night before, at the Burra Hotel.  On Monday morning the Commission made a thorough inspection of the mine on foot.  They also inspected Mr R.D. Pascoe’s collection of mineral specimens from the mine.  The Mayor gave his opinion that the mine had closed before it had been properly opened up and its second stage of development would have very rich, especially with modern equipment.  He also cited the views of the late Mr S. Baker, who had worked in the mine and had only died a couple of years ago and who believed untold riches still lay at the site.

Cr Kellaway, who had worked in the mine [after its closure] as a tributer, also thought much copper still lay to be obtained below the water level.  Dr Raggat (Commonwealth Geologist) said they had been tasked only to examine those properties that could perhaps produce copper at the present price, within two years.  It would take a considerable amount of money to dewater the Burra Mine and he could not say what the whole committee would recommend.  They had still to visit three more towns in South Australia and there were also copper shows in Queensland that were favourable.

As it would be too expensive to dewater the mine just to explore for copper deposits, they would have to form an opinion based on old records, especially those from the last five years of the mine’s operation.

The Commission was then given a pamphlet outlining the history of the Burra Mine.
