Burra National Trust Branch will hold a Christmas party this week at the Bon Accord museum.  In the coming year the focus would be on renovating the Redruth Gaol.  President Mrs Wright said the branch had received a grant for $50,000 from the Commonwealth Bank and was also part of a Bicentennial Project.  An architect will be employed to establish what can be done with the money available.  One wall badly needs re-pointing and another priority was the installation of toilets.
