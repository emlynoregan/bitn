25 December 1850.  Christmas Day was very hot.  The Lady Young was high and dry two miles from the shore, which meant we had to wait 15 or 16 days for another barge, or go home via the Burra.  A cart runs once a week from that place and the fare is £1 for 75 miles.

At the port the nearest water is 18 miles away and at a depth of 100 feet.  Most eatables are cooked in salt water or a mixture of half salt and half fresh water.  A drink for the horse costs 6d.  Drays from Burra frequently numbering 90 are compelled to come from Dunn’s and return there after unloading before the bullocks can get a drink; a round trip of 36 miles in the broiling sun.  When the Burra cart did not appear, I prepared for a forty-one mile walk to the nearest point the northern mail cart touches.  I began the walk in very hot sun at 3 p.m., but after about 12 miles I saw the Burra Mail cart approaching.  The driver had lost his horses in the hills.  I mounted the cart and returned to Port Wakefield.
