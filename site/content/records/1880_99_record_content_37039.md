2nd Leader on protection in Victoria which it says has led to sweating - some women being paid as little as 2/6 a week plus tea and bread twice a day.

As the Kapunda paper says in its last issue:

‘It [protection] is taking from a thousand men what they need and deserve, and giving it to one man who neither needs it nor deserves it’.
