The first tender for a lunch room was rejected as unsuitable by the Architect-in-Chief, but we are pursuing other tenders.  There is practically enough money in hand for this project.  Following the illness in April of the headmaster, Mr Pattrick, staffing has been unsatisfactory with teachers coming and going.  Mr Morrison has done an excellent job as acting Head Teacher despite the staff shortages.  We thank the ex-teachers who returned to assist in this crisis.  A Junior Teacher has been appointed and we are due for a permanent Headmaster after May holidays.  The enrolment of 270 means we are due for a seventh teacher and have applied for a further classroom.
