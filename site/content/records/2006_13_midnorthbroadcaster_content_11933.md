Ally Fricker & Bob Lamb also reply to Aaron Niemz.  They say his letter is not so much concerned with the issue of wind energy as with an attempt to discredit them.  They cannot admit his apparent logic that when people move to an area they should cease to exercise freedom of speech, should not bother their Councillors and should be too busy to take up such concerns.  They also reject his views on the distance wind turbine sound carries.
