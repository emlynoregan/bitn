Canopus Station, 120 miles east of Burra, held its annual effort to aid the Royal Flying Doctor Service on 24 April.  A cricket match was arranged with a dance to follow.  Rain prevented the visit of the Flying Doctor from Broken Hill.  Play began in drizzling rain which continued till all players and the pitch were thoroughly soaked.  Station players made 30 and Renmark 50.  The weather cleared by the time the picnic tea by the woolshed came around.  Dean Page’s Wildcats from Berri provided the music for the woolshed dance.  Several competitions were held and in all £200 was raised for the Flying Doctor.
