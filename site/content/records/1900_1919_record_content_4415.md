Redruth Court, 22 October

SM Stow was welcomed back after being away for some months with a severe illness.

W. Allen ordered to pay Drew & Crewes 3/- owing on goods + £1 costs.

Richard Cousins was sued for £9-19-0 for entering James O’Dea’s property on or about 24 July for the purpose of assaulting James O’Dea. The case was non-suited because of the way in which it was presented as a mixture of civil and criminal matters.

Mrs E. Bowman of Wandillah and her family gave a bazaar at J. Lewis’s schoolroom on Wednesday last in aid of ‘Minda’.  Results were exceedingly satisfactory.
