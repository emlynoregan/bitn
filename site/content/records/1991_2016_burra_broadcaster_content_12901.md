Believe there is a need to maintain a certain continuity and big picture focus with the new council

Over the years have been involved with many community, sporting and school organisations, library, Council committees, health service boards, etc.

I believe I am an effective and committed Councillor with experience and much still to contribute to the new Council

Graham Kellock

Chairman of Burra Burra DC for the last seven years

I believe it is important I stand again and see through the task of amalgamation and ensure the old Burra Burra Council is well catered for in the new and larger Regional Council of Goyder

Have been involved in many organisations and committees over the years

Am pleased to see the sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road, for which I lobbied for many years

We are now endeavouring to get Kooringa Road from Fords Corner sealed.
