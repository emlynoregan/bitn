Obituary/Inquest.  On 6 November Mr Challoner JP held an inquiry into the death of Joseph Thomas whose body had been found near the Railway Store at Aberdeen that morning.  On Sunday the deceased had borrowed a colt from Mr Dünneman of Copperhouse and went to Kooringa at 9 o’clock.  He told Mr Ullman that the animal was wild and given to buck jumping.  He spent half an hour at the Court House Hotel, kept by Mr Martin Davey.  He left none the worse for three nobblers consumed while there.  He told Mr Davey that though the horse had thrown a person twice, he would offer the owner £5 for it in the morning.  He rode quietly away.  The body was found next morning, face down with a pool of blood near the nose.  The deceased was taken to the Aberdeen Hotel where a medical examination concluded death was due to a fall from a horse.  The verdict was death by accident.  The deceased was to have been married in a fortnight and supported his widowed mother.

[Joseph Thomas died 6 November 1871 Aberdeen, residence Copperhouse, aged 28.]
