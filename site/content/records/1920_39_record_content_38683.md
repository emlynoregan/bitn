General Aid Society.  Though it had not been reported earlier the RSL notes reveal that the General Aid Society has decided to disband and had given a comfortable armchair and a tea urn to the RSL and a cash donation to the Angorichina Hostel.  The RSL accepted the donation with thanks and regretted the end of the society.
