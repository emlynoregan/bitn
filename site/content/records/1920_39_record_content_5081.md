Burra Hospital.  [It would appear from the report that a recent state Government Act would require local Councils to raise a rate to help support the hospital.]

The Committee reported back that assuming a £ for £ subsidy the rate required in Burra would be 3½d in the £, raising £1,300 if £400 was allowed for paying patients.
