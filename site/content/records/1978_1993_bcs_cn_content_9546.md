The handover of the Bon Accord Mine Site to the Council was again discussed.  The Jubilee 150 Committee has made it a necessary condition for the building of the Copper Interpretive Centre that the site become Council property and this has prompted much discussion.  The meeting passed a motion reaffirming the branch’s willingness to hand over the property subject to six specific conditions; one of which is approval from National Trust SA, which has still to be given.  The branch supports the concept for a Copper Interpretive Centre on the Bon Accord Site.  A C.E.P. grant to the branch has recently been approved and we hope work will soon begin.  Included are restoration and maintenance work at the Gaol, the Police Lock-up, the dugouts and some too at the Market Square Museum and Peacock’s Chimney.
