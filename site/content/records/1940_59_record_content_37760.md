Burra Town Council, 5 July

The Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston said that according to the Act a fresh assessment for the town had to be made every seven years.  This meant that each property had to be revalued.  Last year the Council had attempted to do this, but had been unable to obtain the services of a licensed valuator.  They had at the time be advised that the Town Clerk could not do this job, but recent legal advice indicated he could carry out the new assessment.  At present the Council was working on a low assessment and high rate and for a variety of reasons it would be beneficial to property owners if the assessment were high and the rate low.

Cr T.H. Woollacott thought the present assessment had been in force for years and had proved satisfactory.  He could see no reason to increase the assessment.  The Town Clerk was a full-time officer and if he undertook the job it should not be in Council time.

Cr R.A. Bevan said he saw no reason why the Town Clerk should not carry out these extra duties in office hours if necessary and he agreed that a fresh assessment should be made.  Cr Lee agreed that a new assessment was long overdue.  Crs Bevan & Lee moved that a fresh assessment be made.  Carried.

A letter from the Hospitals Department said there was a move afoot to increase the contribution of Councils to District Hospitals by 20%.  This, it is said, was a response to steeply rising costs of food, medical supplies and salaries.  Cr T.H. Woollacott said he was surprised at the move, given that all hospitals were now in receipt of substantial Federal Government subsidies.  He and Cr Bevan moved that this Council protest the move through the Municipal Association.  Carried.
