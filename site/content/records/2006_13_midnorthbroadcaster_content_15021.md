The Pygmy Bluetongue Recovery Team (PBRT) met in Burra last Thursday.  Flinders University Professor Mike Bull and his team, Mark Hutchinson of the SA Museum and staff from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources have been studying the lizard since its rediscovery in 1992.   Professor Bull has recently won a grant for further research.  Part of the funding will go towards working with the PBRT to generate local conservation interest and ownership of the Pygmy Bluetongue.  Emu Consulting has been contracted to deliver community liaison.  Professor Bull delivered a presentation on the lizard.  Patrick Mentzel of Nature Foundation SA gave an address on their inaugural September Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard crawl at their Tiliqua Reserve, located near Burra.  Roy Taplin conducted a tour of the Burra Railway Station as a potential interpretation centre.
