President’s Report

Despite the drought the annual show on 10 October 1959 was an outstanding success.  The show was officially opened by Sir Philip McBride KCMG.

The weather was glorious and over 2,000 people attended.

Entries were just short of a record.

The main ring events were good and horses numerous.

A Sanction Dog Show attracted much interest and it was pleasing to see the sheep pavilion comfortably full.

The Rural Youth Sheep Judging Competition was a popular innovation.

Wool entries were well supported, causing congestion in the Agricultural Pavilion.

This prompted the decision to find new accommodation for wool and a new building is being erected for this purpose.  Mr R. Fuss has come forward to help the society erect this building and for this we are most grateful.

The Rural Youth have also been most helpful this year with financial aid and looking after Gala Night arrangements.

Membership remains over 300, a gratifying level and our financial position is sound.

With regret I note the passing of Mr A.T. McWaters, one of our staunchest committeemen, who gave untiring energy to the society.

We thank our secretary Mr T.G. Perry and Miss Hopkins for their assistance and to all those who served on committees or helped in other ways.
