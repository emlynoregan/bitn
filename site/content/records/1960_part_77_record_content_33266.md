Burra Library AGM was presided over by President W. Carpenter who welcomed members and in particular the

Increased interest of juvenile members.  There are 77 members and 20 juvenile members.  120 new books came from the Institutesâ€™ Association.  The annual trading table raised $82.24.  Thanks go to Mrs Bex Kotz as convenor and to her helpers.  Mr Ben Kotz also ran a competition, which raised a further $61.  In the year Mr Bert Cornelius had to resign as Treasurer for health reasons and the librarian, Mrs Steer, also had to resign for the same reason.  Miss Rosalind Parks has taken over as librarian.  Mrs Teague and Mrs Braendler have helped me [W. Carpenter] keep the library open during the holidays.  During the year we also lost our only life member with the death of Mr A.B. Riggs; a past president and long-serving committee man.  Mrs Braendler has taken over the role of Treasurer.
