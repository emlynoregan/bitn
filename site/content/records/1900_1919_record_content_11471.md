James Moyle visited Burra after an absence of 27 years.  He arrived in Burra with his parents in 1847, having come with them to SA in the British Sovereign.  He went to work briefly in the Burra Mine in 1852 before going to the Victorian goldfields, returning in 1853.  He then took land at Hill River and later in the Hundred of Tarcowie.  He is now 69, well and living in retirement in Jamestown.
