Booborowie IGA has changed hands as from 8 January.  Chris Catt sold the business after 18 years to Roger Florence & Monique Haddow.  Chris grew up in Booborowie and moved away in the banking industry.  In 1982 Chris and his brother James bought Booborowie Servwel Store from Alex & Muriel Patterson.  Chris left his ANZ Bank job in Adelaide to run the store with his brother.  After two years James left and Chris continued alone.  Australia Post Office and hardware became part of the business about seven years ago.  The business has had several name changes and in the 1950s it was a John Martin’s store for about four years.  Monique Haddow and husband Vic ran Paxton Square for two years after moving into the district some 6½ years ago.  They have been living in Booborowie for the past four years.  Roger Florence is Monique’s father and after thirty years in the insurance industry in Adelaide has come to Booborowie for a ‘quieter’ life – although he says they have been busier than he expected.  He will work full-time and Monique part-time – with Heike Dargusch also continuing on part-time.
