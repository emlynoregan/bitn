Burra High School.  A new building for boysâ€™ craft is being erected.  The room presently used is crowded and will be converted to a classroom and storeroom.  This will free the library from being used as a classroom.  The Intermediate Class recently had a day in Adelaide to view the film To Sir with Love and in the afternoon visited Parliament House as guests of Mr E.C. Allen MP.
