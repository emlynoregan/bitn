The Minister of Local Government Hon. M. McIntosh was asked by R.C. Blott at a political meeting on Wednesday why the Government took a 99-year lease on the Burra Ballast Quarry and then never worked it.  He was told it was uneconomical.  The questioner might have asked how it was economical to cart stone from Sleep’s Hill Quarry in motor trucks and ship it at the rail head.
