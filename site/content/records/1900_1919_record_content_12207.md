Baldina School Picnic.  There are about 2 columns of detail on the picnic which was held about 7 miles east of Burra in John Roger’s paddock.  Most of the item deals with the sports held, but there is the following reference to the school:

‘The building where the school is conducted is constructed of stone, just along side the Baldina Road and before it was erected a galvanised-room known as ‘Tin Chapel’ served as a place to teach the young.’

[The ‘Tin Chapel’ was the Baldina Church: also known as the ‘Tin Pot Chapel/Church’ and when it was rebuilt in stone it was suggested it be called the ‘Stone Jug Church’.]
