R.E. Dewhirst writes regarding Colts Football.

With NEFL changing to a ‘B’ Grade competition a group at Booborowie has decided to re-form Booborowie Colts.  Spalding and Hallett seem able to form a Colts team, but Burra (because Aberdeen already has a Colts team in the Mid North League) may not be able to do so – though it may yet prove possible.
