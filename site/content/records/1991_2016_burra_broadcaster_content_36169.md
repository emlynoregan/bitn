Thorogoods have added new products to their range of apple beers and ciders.  ‘Billy B’s’ is an oak matured and bottle fermented apple beer, with a whopping 12% alcohol.    It comes in two forms, the Billy B’s Golden and now Billy B’s Dark – the colour of Guinness, the tang of a Granny Smith and the sweetness of a Golden Delicious.  Scrumpy is another product.  In England this is a young rough cider and often contains bits of apple.  Thorogood’s Scrumpy is a sophisticated drop.  Bottled straight from the barrel, it comes in a popular sweet and also in an extra dry version.
