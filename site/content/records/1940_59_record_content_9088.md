The Burra Record this week changes from broadsheet to tabloid format.  Although 8 pages of tabloid use as much paper as four pages of broadsheet, it will be much easier to change the size of the paper to suit demand or necessity.  Adjusting down to six or up to ten or even 12 pages will be simple should occasion warrant.
