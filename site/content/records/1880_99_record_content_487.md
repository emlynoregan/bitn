Editorial on the Credit System; i.e. the habit that farmers have of living on credit with the shopkeepers etc., so that often/generally the whole profit of their crop is consumed before it is reaped.  Although sometimes due to bad seasons, it often starts because a man starts out with too little capital.  The system is a severe disadvantage to shopkeepers too, for whom the risk in a bad season is great.
