Weather.  Rain began falling on Friday and has continued till today.  These are the best rains for February in 59 years with 251 points in Burra to the present.  The 342 points in 1928 came in torrential downpours whereas this has been more useful steady soaking rain.  The eastern mail due back in Burra Sunday night has not yet arrived and the mail from Hallett to Braemar is stuck somewhere en route.  A long list of falls for the eastern area is printed ranging from 112 points at Aldina to 372 at Pualco, but falls from 200 to 250 points were general.  Falls west of Burra were lighter.  Gum Creek had 50 points and the Springbank area 60-70.
