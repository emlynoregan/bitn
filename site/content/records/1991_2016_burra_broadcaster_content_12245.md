Burra Golf Club is seeking $320,000 to establish greens on the Burra Golf Course.  They have written to the Burra Burra DC seeking $80,000 to match a similar amount to be raised by the club.  They would then seek a matching $160,000 from the State Government.  The project would include an irrigation system and the construction of dams.  Council has approved it in principal and recommended it to the new Regional Council of Goyder.
