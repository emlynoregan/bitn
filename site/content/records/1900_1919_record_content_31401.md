Escape from Redruth Reformatory

Last week Naomi Paul [Paull in next issue] and Mona Goodall escaped from the reformatory.  After a fruitless local search Sgt Gibbons had the news they were seen near Manoora.  He went there and then on to Saddleworth where the girls were found at the home of Paul’s sister.  They were brought back to Burra by the 11.30 train.  Paul’s feet were badly cut and swollen and she had to be carried.  Paul had escaped last November and had only been back six days when this escape was effected.  While she was away she got married in the belief this would protect her.
