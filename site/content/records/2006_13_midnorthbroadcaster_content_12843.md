The Burra Cycling Classic

The Norwood Cycling Club held its annual race in Burra last weekend.  Both senior and junior events honoured the late Peter Reilly who had been a great friend and supporter of the event over many years.  Josh Smith won the inaugural Peter Reilly Handicap for Women’s and Masters. [Sic!] The event on Sunday morning threw heavy rain and fierce wind at the riders.  Smith made his winning move about 6 km from the finish and held on all the way to the line.  Burra’s representative, Constable Matt Daum, did well in achieving a personal best and placing in the top 10 in the Masters.  In Saturday’s Classic he finished 20th out of 87 and recorded a personal best.

The Hills to Henley Marathon saw two local residents get second places.  [The report then becomes ridiculous.  It cites a distance of 7 km and says Penny Keane came 2nd in the 20 to 24 age group and 7th overall with a time of 35 hours 20 seconds.  Marry Alletson came 2nd out of 50 in the 50-54 age group and 25th in the fielding 41 hours 38 seconds.]
