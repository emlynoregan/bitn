Numbering of Issues in 1943.

The year began with Volume 64, Number 1 on 5 January 1943 and continued to

Volume 64, Number 4 on 26 January 1943

However, the volume number then reverted to 63 Number 5 on 2 February 1943 and the numbering using that volume continued to the end of the year, with Volume 63, Number 51 (2) 21 December 1943.

This means that most Volume 63 numbers are repeated, but with anomalies caused by the anomalies already recorded for 1942.

There were however, several additional irregularities in 1943:

Number 5 (2) appeared on 2 February, followed by Number 5 (3) on 9 February.

Number 6 was not used in this cycle of Volume 63.

Number 26 appeared on 29 June (that number not having been used in the first cycle of Volume 63) and Number 26 (2) appeared on 6 July.

Number 28 was not used in this cycle of Volume 63.

Number 31 (3) appeared on 3 August and Number 31 (4) on 10 August.

Number 35 was not used in this cycle of Volume 63.
