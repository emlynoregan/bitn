Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Municipal Assoc. advises that loans can only be raised on the whole of general rates and not on two wards only.  To do the latter a separate rate would have to be struck for those wards.  Also a poll would have to be taken over all wards, even if the lighting was for two wards only.

Cr Wicklein moved that a poll be taken on 30 August to decide whether the Council could raise the money.  Carried.

A meeting will also be called for 28 August.

An offer of £15-10-0 was accepted for a block in Ayers St, recently bought – the Council retaining what was needed for road purposes.
