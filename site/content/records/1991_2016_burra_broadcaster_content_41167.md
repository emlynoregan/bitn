Letter from Paul Horne, who recently bought a house in Market Street.  He has had two boxes of tools and a brush-cutter stolen and his experience with the police (helpful though they were when they eventually arrived from Eudunda) has made him realise how important local police are.

‘Well it’s too late to get my tools back, but it’s not too late to get the police back.’
