The Commercial Travellers’ Concert.  About 30 travellers arrived in town on Friday.  Some set up shop in the rotunda where a ‘court’ was established.  The Record reporter went to investigate and was fined 10/- for trespassing.  S.M. Lane was fined 10/- for riotous behaviour, having just consented to be clerk.  Other citizens were dragged in and fined on charges ranging from pitch and toss to manslaughter.  Resisting arrest was a popular charge, though one was fined for not resisting and one for being too heavy to carry.  Mr Ford assisted in the arrests and was fined for doing so.  The Mayor was fined for being the Mayor and not setting a better example.
