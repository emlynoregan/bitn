Tony & Susan Thorogood’s recipe for Mushroom risotto with blue cheese, chestnuts and cider was a top three contender for the Spirit of Tasmania’s “Tassie Tastes” Recipe Competition, which was judged last week.  Susan was pleased that a vegetarian dish did so well in a competition dominated by meat dishes.

The Recipe:

¾ cup Italian Arboro rice.  4 tbsp olive oil, I chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic crushed, 2 cups of dry cider warmed, 250 gm button mushrooms sliced, one cup chestnuts peeled and broken, 200 ml cream, 100g blue cheese chopped, sea salt, pepper & chopped parsley to garnish.

1.	Heat oil; add onion, mushrooms and garlic & fry till mushrooms are cooked.  Turn to lowest heat, add rice and stir to coat with oil, add two ladles of warm cider, stir lightly.  When cider has been adsorbed gradually add more until all has been incorporated in 20-25 minutes.

2.	Add cream, cheese, chestnuts, stir, cover for 5 minutes, stir, turn off heat, cover for 5 minutes, add salt & pepper and turn onto a serving dish.  Garnish with parsley.

3.	Serve with a dry sparkling cider.
