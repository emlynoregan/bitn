Commercial Hotel.  Perhaps we were wrong that this hotel had never before been leased.  Mr R. Sellars of Burra North recalls Vivians running the hotel, but says the late Mr Percy Clark bought the freehold from a Mr Jock Richardson.  He then resigned from the police force to run the hotel.  Anyway, it has been run by its owners for upwards of 30 years.
