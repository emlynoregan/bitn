Sgt F. McGrath discussed parking problems in Burra.  He was particularly concerned with the area of the Burra Town Hall to the Telephone Exchange when functions were held.  Here cars are parked on the western side and ranked on the eastern side, which seriously narrows the road, which is only 43 ft wide and as the main road to Broken Hill it carries heavy transports.  Parking too close to corners is another problem and he recommends painting lines on the areas 15 ft from the building alignment where parking is prohibited.  Traffic islands in Market Square as proposed by the Highways Department would be a good idea.
