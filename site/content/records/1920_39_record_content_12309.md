Red Cross members met at J. Allen’s tea rooms on Thursday to consider re-organising the branch.  Mrs J.C. Sandland was in the chair.  There are two Burra boys currently in Bedford Park Military Hospital and perhaps re-organising the virtually defunct branch would assist them.  Mrs Wigley spoke in support.  Mrs C.J. Pearce, mother of one of the boys, gave an account of how well the boys are treated.  It was decided to re-form the branch.  Elected were President, Mrs C.J. Pearce; Secretary, Mrs F.R. Wigley; Assistant Secretary, Mrs E.F. Marston; Treasurer, Miss Coglin.  The branch will meet quarterly.
