Burra Town Council, 11 October

The swimming pool will be ready for the last week in October.

Murray Water will be available in Burra after Christmas says Mr Quirke MP.

The National Trust was given permission to send the original copy of [the plan of] Morphett’s Shaft to the Archives for preservation.

The Methodist Tennis Club is to be advised that the Town Council is the sole owner of the shed on Corporation land opposite the High School and that the club can lease it for 12 months at a peppercorn rent.

Twenty-five RAA direction signs have been ordered.
