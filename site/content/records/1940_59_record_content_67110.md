Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM on 1 March, marking the completion of 17 years of activity.  Elected: President, Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Vice Presidents, Mesdames R.C. Lott & D. Fisher; Secretary, Mrs C. Phillips; Assistant Secretary, Mrs J .Pietsch and Treasurer, Mrs R. Wickes.  In 1954 the voluntary contribution scheme raised £40.  The School Ball in May was a great success and was greatly helped by the Mannequin Parade organised by Mr A. Bence.  This swelled funds to a further £250-4-3.  This was spent on playground equipment.

A plan is being worked on with the District Council and the headmaster to level part of the old saleyards.  Plans are also in hand to build a bike shed and a luncheon shed.  Money is on hand for both.  Various items of equipment were purchased through the year for the school.  The Club also assisted in raising funds (£16-7-9) for the youth tour.  Two of the oldest teachers left during the year: Mr T.G. Corry and Miss V. Pearce.  A Christmas Party was held for students.

The balance in the bank is £168-18-6.
