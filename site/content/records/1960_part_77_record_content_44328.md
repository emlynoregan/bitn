Mt Bryan Wheat Growers held a meeting in the Mt Bryan Hall on 10 February to press for the erection of silos at Mt Bryan.  Present also were Mr Venning of CBH Ltd and Mr Claude Allen MP.  It was resolved that some form of temporary storage be erected at Mt Bryan and more rail trucks be made available for Burra and Hallett to help the clearance of this year’s crop.  CBH says the bountiful harvest this year has added to the problem – the harvest is about four times the previous year’s and 30 million bushels over the highest ever delivery in SA of just over 50 million bushels.  There was also about 25% carry-over from the old season, as the Wheat Board was unable to sell all of last year’s crop before this year’s harvest and even at this time some 10% of last year’s wheat remains in the silo system.  It is not the policy of the company to erect temporary storage at non-silo stations, but we can say that extensions due to be finalised at Saddleworth next September will now be completed by next month and by 20 March we will have space for an additional 330,000 bushels of wheat at Saddleworth in these new cells.  A new steel structure at Hamley Bridge will have a capacity of 70,000 bushels at about the same time.
