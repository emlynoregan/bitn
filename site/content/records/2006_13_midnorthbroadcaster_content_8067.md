Burra’s Rock ’n’ Roll Festival has formerly been scheduled for February, but this year will be held on Saturday 1 August.  The February date clashed with a number of other events.  The Burra Town Hall is the venue for the Saturday night dance featuring TJ and the Twin Spinners.  On Friday night Paul O’Bryan will put on a free rock ’n’ roll show at the Burra Hotel.  There is also a free event at the gymnasium on Saturday morning where there will be instruction from some of Adelaide’s best rock ’n’ roll dancers.  The traditional Sunday brunch on the banks of the creek will be held in the Paxton Square Chapel to ensure everyone stays dry and warm.  [Photo from last year’s event.]
