The Boys’ Club lads have been meeting in a room in Thames St.  Recently they amused themselves by destroying the toilet and threw the material all over the place.  M-C Grosser collected the ‘gang’.  The boys were properly scared, but were not prosecuted on condition they collect all the debris into a heap and filled in the hole.  ‘Those 14 boys perspired more on Thursday than ever before.’
