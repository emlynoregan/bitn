The Mayor reported waiting on the Treasurer re the Bon Accord crossing.  The latter will consider the matter on receiving the memorials being prepared.  The Commissioner of Crown Lands replied similarly about the Baldina Irrigation Scheme.

Thomas Turner waited on Council and asked that a cab licence be granted to T.P. Halls who was prepared to abstain from alcohol and go into partnership with Mr Stodart.  This was granted. [Perhaps Stoddart.]
