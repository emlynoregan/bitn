Pupils present when inspected, 48; pupils attending school, 80; state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.  Recommended for a licence from 1 April.  Evening school 20 pupils.

Letters were read from Dr Mayne and Dr Maurau speaking very highly of Mr Forder, who was also recommended for a licence by the local ministers, and by Mr Stephens, the teacher at Kooringa.

It was resolved to grant his licence from the 1 April on the understanding he would expend a portion of the stipend on purchasing desks and other school requisites.
