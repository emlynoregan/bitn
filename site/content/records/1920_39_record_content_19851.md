The Mayor said they had recently passed a no confidence vote against Cr Riggs because he supported the reduction of the size of the Hospital Board without instruction to do so.

Cr Riggs said he had, as he understood, been given a free hand.

Cr Kellock ‘Your Worship’s action is “dirt”.’

The Mayor: ‘I object to that remark.’

Cr Kellock: ‘I don’t care if you do.’

He maintained it was so to announce an opinion before the amendment was put.

The amendment was then put and carried on the Mayor’s casting vote.

[The ordering of the above report appears to be confused: as it reads the amendment was put twice, but the content suggests otherwise.]
