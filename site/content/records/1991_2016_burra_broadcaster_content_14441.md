Redfire Resources has commenced exploratory drilling on Stockman’s property ‘The Grove’ next to Richard Riggs’ driveway.  They will sink 50 to 60 holes over the next two weeks, spread over a distance of about 1 km from north to south.  They will also carry out a geochemistry survey along the valley for c. 15 km.  They have recently concluded a major mapping survey of the Mongolata Goldfield and are awaiting results.  Manager of Refire, Bob Besley urged Burra Golf Club to go ahead with its greening project, as the odds were heavily against finding viable deposits there.
