Obituary.  Harry A. Byles, who died at Burra Hospital on Monday 15 July, was born 26 August 1869.  He spent his early youth on NSW stations as a bullock driver.  Later he came to Burra district and became a mail driver in the Eastern Pastoral country.  After that he secured the overseership of Old Koomooloo, which he held until retiring some years ago.  He took a keen interest in the Rechabite Lodge, being a member for more than 50 years.  In 1898 he married Miss Elizabeth Ellen Morgan and they had three children.  He is survived by his widow and three children: Mrs A. Coverdale, Mrs R.A. Bevan and Herbert Byles, all of Burra.
