Burra Quilters recently took part in a project initiated by the Roxby Downs Scrapbag Quilters, in which 300 quilters contributed blocks.  The RFDS benefited by $1,200 from one quilt when it was raffled and two more sold for $650 and $500 respectively.  [Photo of a quilt made by the Burra Quilters.]
