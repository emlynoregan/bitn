Burra Ambulance Service

Following the withdrawal of the privately owned ambulance, which has operated in the district for some time, a meeting has been called to discuss the possibility of buying a District Ambulance.  The withdrawal of the ambulance without notice came as a shock to the townâ€™s doctors.  The Mayor was notified on Monday night, but before he could notify those affected, Dr Pitcher called for an ambulance to transfer a patient to Adelaide.  The doctors then discovered there was no ambulance in the town and the Clare ambulance had to be used.  A meeting will be held on 29 April.  An ambulance committee had been formed, but when the offer of a private ambulance was made its work was halted.
