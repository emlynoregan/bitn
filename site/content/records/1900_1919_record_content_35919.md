Tennis.  After a period of low interest an association has been formed of teams from Kooringa, Aberdeen, World’s End and Porter’s Lagoon.  For the 1913-14 season: Secretary, J.W. Statton.

On Wednesday Aberdeen Gents 11-107 defeated Kooringa 10-104.

[Presumably these are the figures corrected in the next issue.]

Aberdeen Ladies 7-44 defeated Kooringa Ladies 1-26.
