Peter Edson writes as President of BRTBA

‘Bugger Heritage’ and some rather pessimistic views that Burra was declining and that tourism was of little benefit to the town were some of the more depressing comments from Monday’s community meeting.  In the past 30 years many country towns have had is tough and suffered a declining population.  Burra has held up very well and this is largely due to the citizens in the 60s and 70s who saw that Burra’s heritage could promote tourism.  At the centre of this was its Cornish mining heritage and the Burra Mine Reserve established in 1988.  Burra is now being considered for World Heritage listing, which has huge potential for the future.  Over 25,000 visitors pass through the Visitor Centre and over 12,000 purchase the Passport Key to demonstrate its marketability.  Visitors bring dollars into the town.  Many local businesses would not survive without this influx.  A publican has stated that 80% of meals are served to visitors.  Antique stores, coffee shops, restaurants, service stations and banks would not be here but for visitors.  It is part of the SA Government’s Strategic Plan to increase visitor numbers and lengthen their stay.  Exploration and mining outside of Burra may indeed bring benefits to the town, but let us not sacrifice the long term prosperity of our town for what is likely to be short term gain.  And let us not forget that Phoenix Copper’s main interests are its shareholders.  Please let us not disparage the value of heritage and tourism in Burra.
