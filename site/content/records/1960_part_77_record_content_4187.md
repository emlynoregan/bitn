Burra Show

At the opening of the 86th Burra Show on 8 October the Hon. D.N. Brookman Minister for Agriculture also opened the new Wool Pavilion.

[The 1960Show was actually the 68th Show not the 86th.  The mistake arises from not deducting the years in which no show was held.]

There is no doubt the Show received a boost from the excellent wool and sheep sections.  The ability to house wool exhibits in the one pavilion helped the presentation of the other sections.

The Show Committee wish to extend their thanks to all who contributed to the success of the venture.  Many weeks of patient work on the part of Mr Fuss and members who helped him, together with the capable urging of Mr Herb. Riggs and his committee were well rewarded.

Local stores in the town contributed with the display of wool and wool products in their windows.
