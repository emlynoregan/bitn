Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Meeting, Mt Bryan 4 July, attended by c. 60-70 people and chaired by I.J. Warnes.  Minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed.

The Chairman said since the last meeting the committee had met twice.  Plans had been prepared and were at this meeting.  There were to schemes to be put to the meeting.  The committee recommends the one with two rooms in front of the present hall, separated by a passage.  To the left is a large room to hold two billiard tables.  On the right is a reading room and alongside it the memorial room to hold records and souvenirs of the fallen soldiers and for that alone.

The question tonight is whether this is the right thing or not.

Mr Warnes had no exact costing, but estimated it at not less than £1,000 to £1,200, plus furnishing costs of c. £200-£300.  He thought that sum within the means of the community.

One possibility was to issue debentures as the Burra show Committee did for its refreshment room.

Another scheme is that one man has agreed to put up £100 if six others will match him.

Mr A. Jeffries thought the plans too ambitious and a 29’ passage to the hall unacceptable.

Mr Beaglehole said the plan allowed for incorporation of a cloak room.  The hall measured 9’6” x 7’6”.

Mr Pledge didn’t see a problem – consider the entrance to the Adelaide Town Hall – upstairs and around corners.

Chair to Mr Gregurke – Do you think as Mr Jefferies it should be curtailed? – It is 32” x 33’6”.

The one thing to be sure of is to make it large enough and not to change it in a short time.  When we built the hall we built a small place and within two years pulled it down and put up a proper place.

[This would seem to be a reference to Leighton Hall, rather than to the Mt Bryan Institute.]

[The discussion is hard to follow in the report as printed and the two plans seem to be being discussed without the second one being reported and without it being clear which one is being talked about at any given time.]

Eventually the committee’s report was adopted.

Mrs Hatherly had some concern about the voting and abstentions, but the Chair had nothing but contempt for abstentions.

There was a proposal before the committee that anyone who donated £100 be entitled to put a tablet in the hall to the memory of a fallen soldier.  Whether the donor’s name should also appear seems not to have been settled.

Mr Jefferies moved the method of raising the money be left to the committee.  Carried.

Mr Warnes then entered into an explanation of what had taken place in the lead-up to this meeting and made a response to the various writers to the Record, particularly the letters of Mr Pearse and Mr Hawkes.

There was a meeting at Market Square at which the Mayor invited the Chairmen of the District Councils to decide what scheme for a memorial would suit Burra and District.  When the meeting was held delegates decided they would go back to their districts and hold public meetings.  At the first public meeting I called only some 8 or 9 attended on a very wet night.  The meeting was adjourned.  At the next meeting a larger crowd attended and I put my case before the meeting: ‘I did not come here to drive something down their throats; I did not come here to say “You are not to support the Burra,” and I think you will bear me out.’

He then said the voting figures in the Record – 30 for and 1 against & 21 abstaining – were very misleading.

‘Those who did not vote were people who had lost their sons, and did not take part in the meeting.’

The Record reports my warning ‘Before you put this motion, which is a bit hard, think a bit.  You can’t go to the Burra without giving, and if you tie yourselves hard and fast to Mount Bryan you are wholly and solely on your own.’

But we are not hard and fast against Burra: Mr Jefferies said ‘We’ll put Mt Bryan first and then if Burra put up a scheme and we like it we can help them afterwards.’

Mr Pearse accused me of having influenced the vote, ‘but no man will move one of the best districts of people who know how to think for themselves.’

[After some nicely flattering comments about the local area and its people Mr Warnes goes on to say only 8-10 did not vote, rather than the 21 in the Record.]

He then turns to Mr Pearse’s suggestion he retire from public positions in Burra now he ‘has renounced the Burra’.

Mr Collins interjected: ‘It is the positions he would like.’

Mr Warnes agreed that was what Mr Hawkes and Mr Pearse wanted – ‘a clear run’.
