Harrold J. Button writes saying that before Christmas he had urged the burning of the creeks in the town and he censured those who failed to have it done.  The Burra Hotel and the SAFU store could easily have been lost in the recent fire.  Water pressure was shockingly poor.  Too much is done in North Ward than is consistent with fair play for Kooringa.
