The New Dalgety Bennetts Premises in Burra has been awarded a Civic Trust brickbat.  The Trust described the building as a ‘large, graceless, industrial steel shed finished in gleaming white with a patch of stone veneer at the front set between dignified heritage buildings.’

‘An even plainer industrial character shows from Paxton Square across the Creek.’

The Trust was also concerned that the location would bring trucks into what should be a quiet part of the town centre.

Northern Regional Manager John Secomb said he was disappointed, but not surprised by the award.  He said the firm went to great lengths to put on a bluestone façade and the whole development was passed through the proper channels and approved by the Council.  A large cross-section of people had expressed their approval.
