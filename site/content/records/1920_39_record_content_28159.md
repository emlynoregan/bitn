Obituary.  Thomas Kellaway died at Burra Hospital 8 October after a long illness aged 70.  He was born in Kooringa on 29 March 1858 and lived all his life in Burra.  He was the second son of the late Mr & Mrs W. Kellaway of Kooringa.  On leaving school he worked for seven years with Messrs W. Henderson & Statton Blacksmiths and then worked on tribute in the Burra Mine until forced to retire by ill-health.  In his younger days he was fond of sport and also was associated with brass bands (now extinct) in Burra for 20 years.  He was a worker for the Oddfellows Lodge and for some time was President of the Juvenile Lodge.  His health has not been good for over 30 years.  He married Eleanor Reynolds of Kooringa who died six years ago.  Six sons survive: Tom, William, Jack, Stanley and Leslie Kellaway of Burra and Reginald of Yongala.  Two served in the Great War: Pte Jack & Sgt Les. Kellaway MM with bar.
