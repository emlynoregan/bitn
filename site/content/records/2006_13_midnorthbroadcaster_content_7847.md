Captain Crabclaw’s Pirate Party to help launch the book Captain Crabclaw’s Crew, at the Burra Community Library last Thursday saw more than 80 apprentice young crew members attend for a feast before the arrival of ‘fearsome’ Frances Watts and ‘dastardly’ David Legge.  The authors were a bit delayed by fog, but they were greeted with great enthusiasm when they arrived.  The authors signed copies of their latest book and also their earlier publications Kisses for Daddy and Parsley Rabbit’s Book about Books.
