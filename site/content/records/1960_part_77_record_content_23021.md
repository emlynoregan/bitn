Burra Town Council, 21 December

Mrs E.E. Turner was granted permission to demolish an old cottage on allotments 49 & 50 Gregory Street, Burra North.  [CHECK: as there is no Gregory Street, could this be Tregony Street?]

Council advises the National Trust that it has permitted the shifting of the ‘old jinker’ with the question of housing it to be left in the hands of the Mayor.

Closed roads have been merged with the Recreation Reserve and vested in the Corporation of Burra

Under Section 139 of the Local Government Act C.H. Cummins was appointed Councillor of West Ward till 30 June 1966.

Tenders are called for the erection of a public toilet block adjacent to the Town Hall.
