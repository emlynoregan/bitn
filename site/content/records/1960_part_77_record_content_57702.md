Burra Mine

245 representatives from the Adelaide Regional Conference of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy visited Burra on Sunday.  [Key members are named.]  The Samin Ltd plant was inspected, followed by a buffet lunch at the Town Hall organised by ladies of the Burra Primary School Welfare Club, with drinks from the Commercial Hotel.  After lunch the visitors were shown around the open cut and other historic town sites.  Market research by Samin shows the copper oxide product is likely to find a market as an ingredient in fertilizers.  This will require a drying kiln to reduce the moisture content from the present 10% to 1%.
