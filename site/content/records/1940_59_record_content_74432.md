Burra Town Council, 17 September

P.H. Quirke MP submitted a report from the Assistant Manager of ETSA in reference to the negotiations to take over the Burra Electric Supply Co.  These protracted negotiations were finalised in late 1955 when it was agreed that ETSA would acquire the undertaking on 1 July 1958.  Mr Quirke said he would maintain a review to see that as far as he could the building of the transmission lines would cause no delay after 1 July 1958.

The Council approved several new by-laws:

Setting a maximum penalty of Â£10 for driving the wrong way in any street.

Making all traffic keep to the left hand side of the War Memorial and Garden.

Declaring a prohibited are north for 500 yards from the southern boundary of the Fire Station, one the east side of Market Street except for a vehicle drawn up parallel and close to the eastern alignment.

A law confining dogs in the street to being on a lead and banning dogs in shops. [Along with a series of complicated exemptions.]

Regulating street hawkers, setting out locations for stands and the fees to be paid.
