Obituary.  Roy Harold March aged 46, an invalid from birth, was found by his father Mr William H. March dead on 13 July in an old shed opposite his residence in East St.  It is believed he became entangled in a rope attached to a chain suspended from a spike driven into the wall and falling from his wheelchair he was unable to save himself from death due to his physical condition.  M-C Armstrong of Kooringa Police reported the matter to Mr G.E. Dane JP who deemed an inquest unnecessary.  [Born 4 Jan 1892 Kooringa.]
