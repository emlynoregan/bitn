Obituary.  A. McCulloch Sen. died in Glenelg last Wednesday at 80 and was buried on Saturday at Kooringa.  He was well respected in his early days in the district for his charitable work.  He came to SA in the Oriana in 1836 with Messrs J. Reed, Stephen King, Stubbs, and Henry Dundas Murray.  He bought 200 sheep from Murray to whom he acted as shepherd, the two flocks being depastured together.  He took a run on the Gilbert where he bought land.  Soon after he took up land from James Logan at Gottlieb’s Well (near Terowie) and later extended it to Nackara.  Here he was renowned for his hospitality with sometimes 20 visitors at a time.  In 1865 he took up Princess Royal and lived there until about a year ago.  Glenelg was his summer residence and he spent all last year there.  In 1870 he bought Yongala Station.  Generally he was very retiring and his only public office was as Member of the House of Assembly in 1861.  His son-in-law is Mr Justice Boucaut.  He was very liberal to the Anglican Church and at Christmastime to the poor.  His failing health saw him succumb to a second attack of asthma.  He leaves two sons, Duncan & Aleck, and three daughters, Mrs J.P. Boucaut, Mrs Fielder King and Miss McCulloch.  One son, John, died about three years ago.  There are a number of grandchildren.
