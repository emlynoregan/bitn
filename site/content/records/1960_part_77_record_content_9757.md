Weather.  Hail storms.  A wild storm struck Mt Bryan about 4 p.m. on Friday in a confined strip.  Golf ball sized hail and 136 points of rain fell in 40 minutes accompanied by high winds which wrecked two sections of the wheat stack shed and hurled them through telephone lines and wrapped them around one of the large steel poles which was then levelled with ground, but which saved the hotel from being damaged by the flying debris.  Some of the 8 inch by 8 inch uprights were snapped off like carrots and twisted iron and broken timber littered the highway.  Telephone services to the north were cut.  A large tree near the station fell and cut railway control lines.  Hail broke windows and skylights and tore gardens to shreds.  Colin Lloyd, who was working at Mt Bryan, brought in some of the hail which would barely fit into the neck of a two pint thermos flask.  The creek north of the town came down and stranded a number of travellers.  At the top end of the creek Mr H. Griffenâ€™s property received 3 inches with damage to fences etc.  Burra had a less severe hail storm at about 3 a.m. on Saturday.
