Burra Scouts have set a target of $500 to be raised.  So far 50 boys from 39 families are involved in the Cubs or Scouts.  Mr Ashdown, Group Master, said the first year would be the most expensive because basic equipment has to be acquired.  It is hoped each family might contribute $10 and so avoid the more exhausting forms of fund-raising â€“ though no family is bound to pay that sum.  That would leave about $100 to be raised by other means.
