Kooringa News, 26 November

Messrs Neales and Cole were the only nominations for election and consequently were elected unopposed.

[The meeting reported in the paper of 22 November was the only political meeting held before the election.]

The migration to Newcastle continues and numbers of families are still preparing to depart.  The Mining Company has pulled down a row of tenements previously occupied by miners and there are a great many unoccupied houses in various parts of the town.

Collections have been made on behalf of the Lancashire Relief Fund in the Wesleyan Chapel and the result is about £18, which it is intended to make up to £20 before remitting it to the Adelaide Committee.
