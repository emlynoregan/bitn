SA Ambulance Service, Burra Branch held its AGM and Ron Shipard reviewed the year.  The branch had progressed this year, with new recruits fully integrated.  Burra CWA had donated $2,000 in a wonderful gesture and the branch had acquired a new VCR, TV and new rainwater tank.  The driveway had been sealed.  There had been 107 calls to the end of June.  This year’s recruiting program had not managed to get any new recruits.  There was a team of 14 active members.  Matthew Barrowman was appointed co-ordinator after Garry & Jenny Gebhardt resigned as the training team.  His appointment restored enthusiasm and confidence.  The F250 has been modified to a single stretcher ambulance and we hope the other vehicle will soon be replaced by something more appropriate.  Ambulance Officers dressed as life-sized Christmas decorations won a prize in the 1999 Christmas parade and on New Year’s Eve officers waited for the impact of the Y2K fiasco.
