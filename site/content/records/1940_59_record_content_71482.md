Fire.  On Thursday at 9.25 p.m. a fire occurred in the shed-laundry on the property of Mr C.D. Wilkinson in Hill Street, Burra.  Mr Fred Allen, who lives nearby, noticed the fire, which was soon extinguished by the brigade.  Damage was estimated at £50-£60.  The fire seems to have started in a heap of cut mallee and stumps stored alongside.
