Police Court, Kooringa, 26 May before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate.

George Butler was charged by Samuel Mason, acting landlord of the Burra Hotel, with stealing a turkey.

Charles Walters gave evidence that Butler had asked that a bag containing the turkey might be left at Walters’ house for two days.  Walters had believed it to contain beef and potatoes needed on a journey.

George Mason, cook at the Burra Hotel, said he had missed five turkeys from the hotel, belonging to Mr Paxton.  He believed the turkey produced was one of them.  PC Rogers said he had received information causing him to go to Cubbin’s house, where he discovered the bag and the turkey.  He subsequently found that the Burra Hotel was missing some turkeys.  Accused said to Rogers that he had knocked the turkey down in the stable where it was continually making a mess.  He took it to Cubbin’s because he did not know what to do with it.

He was remanded to Wednesday.  [The Cubbin/Walters confusion is as printed.]

Francis McDonough was charged by Mr Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel with receiving £3-19-0 change from a money order for £4 that had been due to Mr Windover.  Mr Windover returned to the bar soon afterwards and the mistake was discovered.  [Various witnesses are cited to prove the case.]  The prisoner was ordered to return the £3-19-0 to Mr Taylor who was ordered to pay the expenses.

[James] Hartshorn was charged with the robbery at Mr Taylor’s.  Benjamin Spargo said he saw two men at the store on the night of the robbery, but the light was too poor for him to identify either.  His Worship said that although there was a strong suspicion there was not enough evidence to convict, he discharged the prisoner with a warning that the police would be watching his future conduct.

Benjamin Aldene was charged with robbery.  William Essex, drayman, said Aldene had asked him to take the box on his way to Gum Creek.  He had agreed, but on receiving further information had removed it from his dray.  His Worship said there seemed to be insufficient evidence to inculpate Mark Allen and Smith, alias Prince Albert. Aldene’s solicitor, Mr Fitzgerald said the boots and shoes found in the prisoner’s box were given to him by a shoemaker to sell on commission.  The case was adjourned for the production of further evidence.

The case, in which Elizabeth Gladwin alleged that Catherine Hutchins had illegally in her possession a ring the complainant had lost, was resumed.  A number of people gave conflicting evidence, some of which was dismissed as hearsay: Maria Nankervis, Mary Ann Harris, Richard Grenfell, James Nankervis, Elizabeth Gladwin and her mother Mrs Thingame, Mrs Deeble and Mr Thingame.

His worship finally ordered that either the defendant restore the ring to Miss Hutchins or else pay 20/- for it plus 29/- court costs.

Mr Hotchin, butcher, obtained a summons against George Madden for using abusive language to Mrs Hotchin.

Mr Fitzgerald obtained a summons under the Masters & Servants Act to recover £10 due to Agnes Dunn for services rendered as a general servant.

Mr Harry Horten gave information of a robbery which had been committed at his lodging last Friday and stated that a box, a case, and a writing desk were discovered yesterday on the hill behind his lodging.  The contents were missing.
