The Infantry Platoon of 27th Scottish has not met with a great response in Burra.  Although only twelve members are required to form the nucleus of a Burra Platoon, so far only six have volunteered.  The first two, Messrs K. Bruce and N. Marston, were sworn in on Thursday night.  Until the Platoon has sufficient numbers all parades will take place at Clare.
