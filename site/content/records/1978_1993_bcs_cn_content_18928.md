Adchem (Adelaide chemical Co.) has announced a decision to acquire equipment to allow expansion of its current production line.  The company is already a dominant world producer of Cupric Oxide and Manganous Oxide.  They now intend to add Copper Sulphate Pentahydrate, which is the largest volume copper chemical consumed in the world and copper cement, which is used as a trace element in agriculture.  This will involve an expenditure in excess of $1 million.  General Manager John Downie said the expansion would result in increased employment at the plant and would ensure continuation of the operation for many years.
