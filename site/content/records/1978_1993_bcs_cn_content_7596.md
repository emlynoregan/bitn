Burra Branch of the Arts Council is arranging for a party to visit the Keith Michell Theatre in Pt Pirie to see the magnificent Lighthouse production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

On 28 July David Williamson’s very amusing play Travelling North will be presented in Burra.  The branch has donated $50 towards ‘Country Come Out ’83’.
