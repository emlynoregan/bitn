Burra Rifle Club held its AGM last Saturday.  Captain E.C. Collins delivered the 34th annual report.  There had been no competitive shooting during the year due to the shortage of ammunition.  They had been able to hold shooting on five occasions by relying on the generosity of certain members and the foresight of Mr Hawker in buying up all Mark VI ammunition. This has enabled them to give advice and instruction to new members.  The membership stood at about 85 members.  The invitation of the RSL to train with them had been appreciated and thanks for instruction and patience were extended to RSL President Mr Hawker and Mr [H.E.] Fuss.  During the year they had attended, with the RSL, three Company Parades at Clare and a field day at Spalding, all of which had been most valuable.  A skirmish on Princess Royal Station against the local Light Horse Troop had also been valuable.  One of the youngest members, Mr Brian Riggs has enlisted in the RAAF.  In the coming year training will continue with the RSL and the Home Guard.  No grants would be made to Rifle Clubs this year, but it had been pointed out that men aged between 18 and 60 could volunteer to serve with the Volunteer Defence Corps. Elected: Captain, E.C. Collins; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt; Treasurer, J.E. Pearce and Vice-Captain, A.C. Aughey.  It was recommended to members that they continue to train with the Home Guard.  The range was being kept in repair.
