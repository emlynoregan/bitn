River Murray Flood Relief Appeal reaches £932-19-0.

Burra Air Force Club Rooms: further donations are acknowledged.

Football.  The Second Semi-Final was played in very bad weather.  Hallett suffered severe casualties and finished with only 15 players.  Burra 10.4 defeated Hallett 6.12.

Players left the field simply done out with the extreme conditions.  Severe cold with wind and rain prevailed for the whole game and at the end players were near exhaustion and barely able to talk.

Accident.  A 1936 V-8 Ford apparently skidded on the wet surface, hit two guard posts, tore out several fence posts and then came to rest against a tree on Saturday afternoon.  The accident occurred near the rail crossing near D.M. Short’s.  Four young men who had been shearing at Gum Creek were injured and admitted to Burra Hospital.  They were: Robert John Colley of Redcliffes, Mildura; Kerry Nobes (17), a shed hand of Launceston, Tasmania’ Carrie Hearn, a shed hand of St Georges, Adelaide and James Joseph Noonan (22), a shearer of Arrodia, Victoria.

Burra High school Ball on Friday night at the Burra Town Hall raised over £90.

Burra Rural Youth Club was addressed by Mr P.H. Quirke MP on the subject of ‘State Government’ at its 27 August meeting.
