Burra Town Council, 16 September.

The Local Govt. Assoc. writes saying the levy for the AWU Case of Â£11-4-6 had to be paid.

Mr McWaters writes saying that watering the trees he and Mr Fairchild planted had become too much for him since Mr Fairchild left the town.  Council employees will water them once a fortnight.

A letter of appreciation for their work is to be sent to Messrs Fairchild and McWaters.
