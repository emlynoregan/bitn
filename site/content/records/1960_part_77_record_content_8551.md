The Anthropological Society of SA visited Burra on the holiday weekend with Society President Mr N.B. Tindale of the SA Museum.  They visited the minersâ€™ dugouts, the old mine, had a buffet lunch the next day at Baldina and on Monday with the permission of Mr Ted Rooke visited the Aboriginal rock carvings on his property.  These had been photographed and tabulated some thirty-five years ago by Professor Wood-Jones & Dr (later Professor) T.D. Campbell.  They also visited camp sites in Baldina Creek where Aboriginal stone implements were located.
