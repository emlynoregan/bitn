SA Election Results

G.S. Hawker (Sitting LCL Member) 	2103

R.S. Richards (ALP)	1487

Mr Hawker won in every ballot box except those in Burra and Burra North:

Burra	Burra North

Hawker	253	134

Richards	371	172

In the Legislative Council the Robinson & Wilson LCL team looks like winning and at the present stage of counting is leading 967 to 438.

The SA Tourist Bureau advises that Burra Caravan Park is eligible for a maximum subsidy of £150.

Burra Show in 1952 made a profit of £200, as was revealed at a poorly attended AGM in Pearce’s Building 2 March.

The Premier, Hon. T. Playford visited on Tuesday night last week and gave an interesting and instructive address.  We note, however, he hedged when questioned about the state of the Black Springs Road.  We learnt he came to Burra via Clare because the Black Springs Road might have been injurious to the Government owned car he travelled in.

The former home of Miss Doris Geake & Miss Jenkins on the corner of Ayre [sic: for Ayers] and Blyth Streets, which is over 100 years old, was sold on Friday for £720 to Mr A.H. Broad.  Though old, it is in good repair.

Population.  The election on Saturday showed how population in the district has fallen.  At the 1950 election there were 4,292 voters and on Saturday there were 579 fewer, or 3,615.

[This decline was corrected on page 2 to 429 instead of 579 after the receipt of postal votes.]

[The writer goes on to urge the necessity of stopping this decline through diversification and decentralisation of industry, suggesting meat, wool and wheat processing industries for Burra.]
