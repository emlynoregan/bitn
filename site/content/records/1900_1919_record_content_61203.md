Burra Cheer-up Soc.

L-Cpl R. Lloyd MM was welcomed by the Ladies’ band etc. at the railway station on 23 July.

The context then suggests that it was on the 25 July that they welcomed Cpl A. Tiver, Pte Bob Bartholomaeus and Pte Spackman, but Cpl A. Tiver’s & Pte Spackman’s presence is reported at the social on 22 July, so this group may have arrived on the 18 July.

A welcome home social on Tuesday 22 July was held for:

Major T. Kenyon	Capt. M. Stevenson	Cpl A. Tiver

Tpr Northcote (a visitor)	Pte Spackman	Pte F. Carey

Pte R. Blott	Pte L. Tiver	Pte Evans

Pte C. Griffiths	Pte N. Tiver

The last two were welcomed at the station that night by the Ladies’ band etc.
