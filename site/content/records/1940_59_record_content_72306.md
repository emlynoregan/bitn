Obituary.  Mr Horace J. Dunn died at Glenelg on 31 March after a very brief illness.  He was 83.  He was born at Black Springs and lived there until retiring in 1947, though he retained a keen interest in the property until his death.  Throughout his life he was prominently associated with public life in the community.  In 1903 he became a member of the Waterloo DC and was elected Chairman in 1906.  When it amalgamated with Saddleworth DC he was re-elected Chairman of the new body and only retired from this office in 1953, with a record 53 years as Councillor and 47 as Chairman.  He received an MBE in 1947.  He was made a JP in 1916.  He was Chairman of the Red Cross in both World Wars and a member of the Riverton Hospital Board, Presiding Officer of Federal and State elections, a Trustee of the Black Springs Methodist Church and Chairman of the Black Springs Hall from its erection in 1912 to his retirement.  In 1928 he founded the Barton Hill Merino Stud, which has been a very successful exhibitor at the Royal Show.  He has been a member of the Adelaide, Burra and Saddleworth Show Committees.  He took a keen interest in sport and was an enthusiastic Glenelg supporter in the SANFL and attended their trial game only a few days before his death.  His wife died five years ago and he is survived by two sons, three daughters and ten grandchildren.

[The birth does not appear on SA Births CD, though 9 probable siblings are listed in the area to Henry and Elizabeth Jane Dunn nee Snow.]
