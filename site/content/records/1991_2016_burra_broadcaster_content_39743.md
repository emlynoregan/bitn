Letter.  Rev Darren Lovell, Uniting Church Minister for Burra and Mannum, writes a letter to Minister Rankine on the current debate over School Chaplaincy.  He says as a qualified social worker (BaSW) he can positively state that School chaplaincy works better than secular welfare type programs.  He had seen that again and again.  The Minister should not let ideological views take precedence over the welfare of the community.
