Burra Benevolent Board

On 24 December the first public meeting of the Board since its inception was held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Kooringa.  The secretary reported dispensing charity to many needy individuals, among them widows and miners who had recently arrived and so did not qualify for sick pay and many others.  The Board had expended £47-5-6 and still had 7/- in hand.  Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson moved the adoption of the report.  He expressed his satisfaction with the Board’s operation and hoped that in future charitable people would make their donations to the Board rather than see the continuation of begging lists, which were open to abuse.  Mr W. Dale seconded and endorsed the remarks about begging lists being abused.

Elected: President, J.W. Macdonald; Treasurer, D.J.H. Ibbetson; Secretary, J.A. Stephens; Board Members, Rev. Flockart, Rev. Hillman, Rev. J.D. Whittaker & Messrs Robinson, Pascal, S. Drew, J. Sleep, W.H. Challoner, Hampton T. Pryor, William Dale and Richards.

W. Pearce moved a vote of thanks to those who had operated the Board and also endorsed it as an improvement on the begging list system.

Rev. W. Flockart seconded and hoped that in the next year they would have £100 to distribute instead of the £47, [which he clearly saw as inadequate.]
