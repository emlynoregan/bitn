The Clare-Spalding Railway

Mr E.C. Allen MP has warned that this line may close in the near future.  Following sharp increases in freight costs in 1966, which added about 3c per bushel in the district, much grain transport has moved to road.  Also transporting grain 50 miles to Pt Pirie is cheaper than using the rail for over 100 miles to Pt Adelaide.  Andrews is the only rail grain terminal north of Clare.  Passenger services were discontinued about 14 years ago.

[Further financial details and other arguments are reported.]
