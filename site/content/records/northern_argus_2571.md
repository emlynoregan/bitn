Obituary.

The Burra community was saddened to hear of the death of Edward Thomas Baulderstone late last week, following a long illness.

The last Mayor of the Corporation of Burra prior to its amalgamation with the District Council of Burra in 1969, Ted’s contribution to the public and community life of this town deserves recognition.

Born in 1904, Ted lived his young years at Scott Creek in the Adelaide Hills.  The eldest of six children, he left school aged 13 and began working in a market garden.

He and his wife, plus the eldest of their children, came to Burra in 1931 during the Depression years, to establish a country market for the fruit and vegetables he grew in the Adelaide Hills.  Over the next few years, he established a green grocery business here.

In 1946 he became a Councillor in the Corporation of Burra, and between 1954 and 1969 was Mayor.

His achievements during those years were many, but the more notable was the building of the St John Ambulance Centre, and the development of the Burra Oval.

However, probably the most visionary of all his work related to the Corporation’s purchase of the old Burra Mine area with a view to its preservation and development into a tourist attraction.

Happily, he saw much conservation and development take place over the ensuing years and was very pleased with the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee project’s work in that area.  Ted was always interested in history and heritage-they were great loves of his.

He became immersed in the work of preserving Paxton's Square and again was rewarded by seeing the Square develop onto a fine accommodation area.

He was a member of the former Lewis Trust, and was treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management which administers the Square, right up until his death.

In 1985, the town showed its appreciation to him by awarding him the Australia Day Citizen of the Year Award.

To name all the committees and groups with which Ted was associated over his life in Burra would be a monumental task, but suffice to say he was a very public-minded citizen, and retained an astute interest in the affairs of the town right up until his death.

To the Baulderstone family is offered the condolences and sympathy of the community.

Ted always acknowledged the support given him by his wife Doreen, who predeceased him by some three years, over his public life.  He is survived by four sons and three daughters, and their families.

[Edward (Ted) Thomas Baulderstone born 1 September 1904 Clarence Park: died 30 April 1897 Elizabeth.]
