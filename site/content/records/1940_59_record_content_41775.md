At the last meeting the Mayor and Councillors paid tribute to retiring Cr T.H. Woollacott after 25 years’ service.

Cr Woollacott was retiring due to his wife’s ill health and also he was not in the best of health himself.  Mr Woollacott had recently moved to Adelaide, but he had done so much for the town as Councillor and as Mayor that the Mayor hoped he would visit Burra one day soon when the townspeople would be able to say ‘thank you’. 

The Mayor also thanked retiring Cr Bevan for his good work as Chairman of Public Works.
