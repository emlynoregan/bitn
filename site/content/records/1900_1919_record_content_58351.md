William Wilks, farmer of Mt Bryan, sued Jehu Lomman, farmer of Mt Bryan, for illegal possession of a scoop.  Wilks bought the scoop in 1916 from Robert Scott and it was missed in June or July 1918.  M-C Giles found it in November 1918.

Giles gave evidence of finding the scoop on Lomman’s property in November 1918.  Lomman claimed to have bought it in Adelaide in March or April, but could not remember the man’s name, didn’t think he got a receipt.  Wilks identified the scoop.

Wilks gave evidence that the scoop belonged to his son, William, who is on active service.  He swore to modifications made to it that identified it.  Lomman claimed he had made the modifications and produced a piece of iron he said was left over from the job.

Robert Scott identified the scoop as one sold to Wilks on 28 April 1916.

F.F. W. Richards, stationmaster at Mt Bryan, denied the scoop had arrived by train from Adelaide as maintained by Lomman.

William Rule of Aberdeen, blacksmith, said he made the bottom plates for Lomman on 15 November 1918.

Arthur Rush, blacksmith, said he had worked on two bows similar to those shows for Albert Lomman, but could not swear these were the ones.

Lomman gave evidence of having bought the scraper in Adelaide and having had it sent up by rail.  He recounted its use.  He now claimed he had obtained a receipt.

His daughter gave evidence of having seen a receipt with J.S. and a date on it, but though she put it on file she had not looked for it.

Two sons, Clarence and Alfred, gave supporting evidence.

William Cornfoot, who had worked for Wilks, gave evidence that Wilks’s scraper was a foot shorter.

John Hedley Lomman & Charles Lomman also gave supporting evidence.

The SM said he disbelieved all the defendant had said and the corroborative evidence as well and fined him £20 with £3-0-0 costs or three months in default.

[The whole report extends for 2½ columns.]
