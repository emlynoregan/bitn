Burra Town Council.  30 April

Sara & Dunstan’s tender for two privies and one urinal at the cemetery was accepted.  The privies will cost £11-9-0 each and the urinal £9-12-6.

The mortuary chapel was ordered readvertised.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands telegraphed that the Hydraulic Engineer had been instructed to arrange with Burra people for a water supply.

The road from Paxton Square through the Smelting Works is to be done by day labour as far as possible.

Tenders called for a footbridge over the Burra Creek opposite the Institute and alternative tenders for one at the site of the old one at the back of the Burra Hotel.
