Cattle Grids.  A Melbourne writer reports that recently while travelling east of Burra he encountered cattle grids.  He speaks as if they were then a new invention, though cattle pits at railway crossings had apparently long been in use.  The local editor says the cattle grids referred to were on ‘The Gums’ station.
