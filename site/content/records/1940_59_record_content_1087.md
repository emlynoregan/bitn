Burra Mine.

Changed circumstances mean that a company can only be floated on the stock exchange, which was not satisfactory.  The smelts heap has been processed twice, yielding £30,000 and £20,000.  The Town Clerk said several mining men had visited Burra recently and would start operations if they got sufficient capital.  It was resolved by the Town council to invite the Premier and the Minister of Mines to visit Burra.
