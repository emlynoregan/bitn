Bagot, Shakes & Lewis reply to the council’s letter about settling the drainage problem and though willing to settle amicably they want to quibble over details - they want the drain pitch-paved every chain instead of every half chain and for the paving to be 3’ wide rather than 8’ and that the road at the corner of the brewery should be made by the Council and that it should be on the south side of the street.

Cr Sampson said he had seen Mr Lewis and there was no valid reason for the south side.

Cr Rabbich - And what about Mr Lockyer?  The south side would block him out.

Cr Sampson said he thought agreement was as far off as ever and if no understanding was come to at once they might as well clear the obstruction and let the water take its course.  The offer had been made to Mr Lewis and if it was not accepted the creek should be cleared out.

Cr Watt thought they might accept Mr Lewis’s offer.

Cr Sampson demurred.
