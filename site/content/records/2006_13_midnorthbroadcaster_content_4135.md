Bush to Burra Cattle Drive

A group of horsemen and horsewomen and 200 cattle recently took to the road for a test run for the Bush to Burra Cattle Drive.  The real thing is planned for October 2008.

Ten committee members drove a herd of Princess Royal cattle to Booborowie and back to test road plans for the event.  It all went well.  Next yearâ€™s plan is to drive cattle on the Kidman & Co. droving lane from north of Whyte Yarcowie to Burra.
