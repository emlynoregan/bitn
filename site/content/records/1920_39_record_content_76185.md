Mr Beerworth the Labor candidate for the Legislative Council by-election spoke in Burra on 21 August.  He spoke of Laborâ€™s plans to aid the wheat farmer by adopting a realistic valuation of assets based on capacity to produce rather than some fictitious monetary value.  Also he spoke on credit from the Commonwealth Bank at cost and the establishment of a wheat marketing board.  He also addressed the problem of farmer bankruptcies, which in SA accounts for more than half the bankruptcies each year.
