A cricket match was played with enthusiasm and a bat given to J. Martin as highest scorer and a ball to H. Ware as best bowler.  The sports closed with a donkey race, and chasing the pig and a sheep.

In the evening there was a concert at the Institute Hall.

The proceeds will aid the Burra Hospital Fund.
