J.O. Denton & Sons of Farrell Flat has finally closed its doors.  About 150 people turned out for a surprise ‘closing the doors’ ceremony for Ian Denton on Friday evening.  A procession of vehicles was led by the local CFS truck with siren blaring down the main street soon after 5 p.m. to see the doors shut on this highly respected family business.
