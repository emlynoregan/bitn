The Burra Railway Station.  There was quite a lot of interest in the railway station, with about 20 people attending the meeting at the Burra Hotel on Monday evening.  As a first step a request will be made to see whether Transport SA could hand it over to the group.  A full report of the meeting will be made available to anyone interested from Simon & Bruna at the Newsagency from next Friday.
