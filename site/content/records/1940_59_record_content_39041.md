Railways Department False Economy

Last year the Town Council employees did up the station road with material supplied by the Railways.  The material was unsuitable and the road is now becoming rough again.  The Council has offered to save the road by top dressing it, but the Railways have declined the offer and now it will soon become as bad as ever.  The Railways Department apparently does not know the old adage ‘that a stitch in time saves nine.’
