Entertainment: Sunday 3 April. Burra Races held on the Mine Paddock.  Good weather and the Burra Brass Band and Orchestra of Burton & Taylor's Grand United Circus were in attendance. There were half a dozen races with the Burra Handicap over 2 miles as the main event. 1st prize was 50 sovereigns. [i.e. 50 gold Â£1 coins]

Reported as a good day with a well managed meeting on a good course. The report is quite detailed.
