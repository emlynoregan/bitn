Violet Day in Burra.

The day was set aside to commemorate the fallen and to raise funds for a home or club for the wounded and incapacitated.  Up to now the Burra Cheer-up Society had sent away about £100 worth of goods, had £25 worth in hand and had farewelled departing soldiers.  Mr Crewes called for a fresh application for the cause to be funded by Violet Day.  He gave a stirring speech to rouse the patriotism of the locals.  Mr Winnall then spoke of the sacrifice of the men in the Dardanelles and how those at home should be willing to make sacrifices in turn.  I.J. Warnes said Leighton would unite with the Burra Cheer-up Society to make a common fund.  W.G. Hawkes spoke of the volunteers in the loftiest of terms and of an empire based on magnanimity, justice and truth.  Following this series of dramatic and impassioned speeches a bunch of violets was sold on the Bugler system.  Trix Pearce reported on what followed.

It is the intention of the Cheer-up Society to build a club in Adelaide where wounded soldiers can go when they please.  Burra is glad to assist in this aim.  In Burra the aim was to sell violets, violet ribbons with a cross, and ‘in memory’ printed on them and programs for the day.  Unfortunately the ribbons never arrived, but the flowers and programs sold rapidly.  At 3 p.m. businesses closed and the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, and Messrs Winnall, Hawkes and Warnes addressed the large crowd at the rotunda.  Mr O’Brien of Dalgety & Co. then proceeded to sell a modest bunch of violets by the Bugler system.  The bidding was marvellous and soon totalled the sum of £243.  When Mr I.J. Warnes finally bought the bunch for £5-2-6.  But after that voluntary contributions continued to roll in and the final price was £382-2-0.  Other proceeds for the day brought the total raised to £414.  The buyers’ names are listed.
