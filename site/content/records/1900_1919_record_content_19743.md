Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.]  There was a false start on Thursday, but the problem was rectified and a second start with different fluxing arrangements was made during the night and a good run resulted.  There was a shut down on Monday due to the failure of the leather of the pump, which will be replaced by a metal valve.  The oil engine is not running well and is the likely source of the next trouble.  The run produced 4-5 tons of matte.
