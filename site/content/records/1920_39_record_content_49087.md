Burra Hospital Christmas Festival was held on 19 December as usual in the open air.  The weather was ideal.  The place was beautifully decorated and chairs provided on the lawn, but scores stood up and others listened from cars drawn up outside.  G.E. Dane organised the musical program.  Burra District Band played.  I.J. Warnes as Chairman of the Board presided.  He said the hospital averaged 18 patients a week.  He commended Sister G. Siegele and staff.
