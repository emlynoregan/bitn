Mt Bryan Primary School is closing at the end of this week after 120 years.  On Sunday there was a get-together of old scholars at the hall.  The children presented a ‘historical essay’ with short skits and songs.  Glan Lines reminisced about old days at the school and Graham Gunn MP said a few words.  The Education Department has been distributing assets:

Playground equipment goes to the barbecue site in the main street.

The fax machine and a computer for public use go to the post office.

Two fridges and two microwaves will go to the hall.

A computer, whiteboard, tables and chairs will go to the CFS.

The last 15 [sic] students will be distributed to other schools; 11 to Burra, 2 to Jamestown and 1 to home schooling.  [Total 14?]

Principal Karen-Lee Paech will return to Whyalla.

Teacher Helena Holman will go to BCS and Paul Naughton returns to full-time study.

SSO Heather Guthrie will work three days a week at Terowie.

The first public school in Mt Bryan opened in 1881 with 36 students in the Wesleyan Church, which was also the Council Chambers located north of the town.  It was open for 140 days.  The first purpose built school opened in 1883 with the same floor plan as the Mt Bryan East School.  It had 39 students.
