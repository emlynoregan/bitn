Kooringa in 1866 from the SA Gazetteer of 1867.

Kooringa is a postal township on the Burra Creek about 50 miles from Kapunda and has daily communication with Adelaide by mail coach to Kapunda and thence by rail to Adelaide.  It is situated on very irregular ground, broken by fissures and watercourses.  The situation and creek divide the township, which is scattered over a considerable area.  There is no corporation or district council, though efforts are being made to obtain the former.  It has an Institute, post office, money order office and telegraph station.  It is surrounded by a chain of undulating hills in many parts of which copper is found along with promising specimens of silver and lead ore – this in addition to the Burra Burra Mine.

While there are no rivers near Kooringa there are the Burra, Baldina and Gum Creeks – but in summer only waterholes can be relied upon.  Kooringa has no mills, but there is a brewery and candle manufacturer.  It is principally a mining and pastoral centre with a few sections under wheat cultivation.

On addition to the Burra Burra Mine there are the All Nations Mine, Flinders Mine, Scrubbers Camp Mine, Kingston Mine and Karkulto Mine.  The two former are worked by a Melbourne Company who are sanguine of success.  Scrubbers Mine is about 28 miles north and a main lode is expected to be struck soon.  Kingston Mine is a further 7 miles northeast.  Karkulto Mine is owned by the SA Mining Association and is 15 miles southeast of Kooringa.  It principally produces iron ore used in smelting copper.  The nearest places are:

Redruth, 1 mile northwest

Hampton, 1½ miles northeast

Copperhouse, 2 miles west

Sod Hut, 8 miles along the Adelaide Road.

The nearest townships are Mintaro and Clare, with which there is communication by Rounsevell’s Coach.  Though Kooringa has no benevolent asylum, a benevolent association has been active for the relief of the poor.  There is a hospital built by the SA Mining Association expressly for the accommodation of their miners, but accessible to the poorer classes on obtaining the permission of the mining authorities.

Hotels in Kooringa are the Burra, Miners’ Arms and the Pig and Whistle.

There is a National Bank branch, a public pound and a Masonic Lodge, Oddfellows’ Lodge and a Foresters Court.  The population of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen and Hampton is about 3,100 with about 460 houses, but of these about 120 are uninhabited.  A corporation would remedy many of the evils.  The approaches to the cemetery are extremely bad and even dangerous.  In crossing creeks and water courses the remains of the dead have more than once been precipitated to the ground.  The present road between Kooringa and Redruth is extremely bad.  The Burra Electoral District is represented in the Legislative Assembly by J.B .Neales and A. McCullock [sic].
