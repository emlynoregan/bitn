Sporting Notes by ‘Whip’

He notes the increase in prize money for coursing:

1891: 1st £15, 2nd £5, 3rd £1.

1892: 1st £35, 2nd £16, 3rd £7-10-0 plus three dogs at £2-10-0 & 6 at £-10-0.

He rates the Gum Creek course as first class.

He calls on the secretary of the Burra Racing Club to get moving or call a meeting and give the money in hand to the Burra Hospital.

Burra Polo he says is not dead - activity goes on any Saturday on the ground near Elders’ Yards, Aberdeen.  Players include: H. Bowman, F. Bowman, C.W. Bowman, F.W. White & A. Gebhardt.  The last game for the season will be on 23 April.

Clare Tennis Club visits Burra next Saturday at the court opposite the hospital.

A meeting at the Royal Exchange Hotel last Friday considered forming an Aberdeen Football Club.  A good attendance decided to go ahead.
