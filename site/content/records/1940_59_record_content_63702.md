Assurances are given re fruit and vegetables service similar to parcels service.

On Sundays the road bus will connect at Hamley Bridge to make the same connection as the rail car now does.

This is not a first step towards drastically reducing services on the line to Spalding.

Four employeesâ€™ houses will be vacated at Spalding and invalidity employees will be transferred to them.

Subsidiary mail services will be introduced to maintain deliveries.
