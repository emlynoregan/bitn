Weather.  The Heatwave

There has been no rain for two months and it has been extremely hot for the last five weeks.  Shade temperatures at Burra have been very high:

5 January	103°F

6 January	104-106°F

7 January	107°F

8 January	109-111°F

9 January	108-112°F

There has been no rain in the town, but out east isolated thunderstorms are reported with even higher temperatures.  Mongolata has been recording 112-116°F and on 8 January Ketchowla reached 118°F.

The heat has been killing fowls and sparrows.  Magpies and starlings are seeking whatever shade they can find.  Mr Chambers of Aberdeen says a similar heatwave in 1889 was followed by 8 inches of rain in April.

Porter’s Lagoon is not proving very useful in the heat.  The water is low and very salty.  Last year it was a veritable ‘seaside’ resort.
