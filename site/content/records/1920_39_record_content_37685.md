William Patrick Fahey was fined £1+ £1-2-6 fees (or 1 month jail) for disturbing the peace at the Royal Exchange Hotel on 11 March.  He was also fined £2 + £1-7-6 fees (or 1 month jail) for using obscene language the same night.

Ronald S. Swindon was fined £10 reduced to £5 + fess of £1-12-6 for driving in a dangerous manner on 12 March.

A motor buckboard he was driving without lights on Smelts Road ran into a sulky driven by Edwin Charles Hopkins.  Also with him were his wife, his sister-in-law and three little children.  The collision opposite Percy Oates’ house broke both shafts.  Mr Hopkins was thrown onto the back of the horse.  His wife with the youngest child in her arms landed on her feet.  Miss Sturm fell onto the rump of the horse.  The other two children fell beneath the horses hind legs.  Hopkins’ son received a slight fracture of the skull and a cut above the right eye and was sent to the hospital.
