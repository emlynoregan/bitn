Yet Dr Cave says there is less sickness there than in any other parts of the district.  Also Mr Daniel’s and Dr Cave’s own houses, though not actually, are, for all sanitary purposes, virtually in Paxton Square and in both fatal cases occurred.  By Dr Cave’s statement if Paxton Square had less sickness that any other part of the district there should have been over 100 cases of typhoid in the district and by my figure of 11 cases, the district should have had more than 220.

Captain Sanders accuses me of ‘interfering’ and is then surprised that I resent it.

‘Let Dr Cave write on this subject to Board of Health in Adelaide and see if those gentlemen do not place as much reliance on his statements as they did on those of Captain Sanders and Dr Dashwood.

[Dr Nesbitt then names the scarlatina cases in Paxton Square.]
