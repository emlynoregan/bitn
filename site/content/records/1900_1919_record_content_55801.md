There was considerable discussion arising from the Chairmanâ€™s previous suggestion that people who could afford to pay had gone to Adelaide and got free treatment.  The Adelaide authorities now wanted names!  Mr A.J. McBride (Chairman) said he had spoken generally.  Mr Radford and Mr Crewes seemed to want Mr McBride to talk his own way out of the difficulty, but ultimately the Board stood with him and said that he had been generalising and if a specific case came to their notice in future they would oblige with a name.
