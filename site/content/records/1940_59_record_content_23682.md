The Centenary Ball was attended by 650 people on Wednesday evening, probably the greatest crowd ever in the building at the one time.  It was impossible to dance with ease, but that did not seem to stop those present having a very enjoyable time.  The hall was wonderfully decorated with flowers.

The gorgeous supper was served on long tables covered with pale green cloths, lit with brass candlesticks.  Oblong and round gold troughs of flowers were arranged down the lengths of the tables.  Supper sittings extended for 10 p.m. to well after midnight.  Mr Essington Lewis was called upon the officially open the ball and did so with a few well-chosen words.  The music was provided by Mr Darrell Field’s six-piece dance band and MC was Mr Ken Murphy.

[The report lists those who contributed to the success of the evening in various ways.]

The Centenary Shop proved popular with visitors and some 650 people visited the display of photographs and curios during the week.  Mr Alf Walker organised the display of at least 500 photographs plus mine and other curios.

The Mock Court was held on Friday afternoon.  Mr A.B. Riggs was in charge as ‘Commissioner of Police’ and M.W. Bednall acted as the judge in wig and gown.  Messrs R.C. Lott and Williams were the constables.  The ‘charges’ were many, for example: Lisle Pearce (funeral director) was charged with trying to drink the ‘bier’ at a funeral; Frank Harris, a sterling seller of badges during the week, was charged with ‘harassing’ the public.  The proceedings were broadcast through the public address system provided free of charge by Mr A.D. Carter.
