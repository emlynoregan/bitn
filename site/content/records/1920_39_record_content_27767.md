Accident.  Last Thursday about midday a truck driven by Mr Stan Woollacott developed a steering gear fault as he slowed down to pick up Mr Les. White at the Mine Bridge.  The truck struck the rails and rebounded onto the stonework of the bridge.  Mr Plowright, a commercial traveller for Matthew Goode & Co. who was a passenger, was thrown out onto the parapet and badly injured his thigh.  He was transferred to Hospital.  The truck was also badly damaged.
