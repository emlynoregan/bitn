Trip to Sturt Vale

The trip to Sturt Vale was remarkable for not seeing a single sheep for the 80 miles to the station house, despite the thousands that must have been along the route.  About 8 kangaroos were seen.  The country was in quite good condition owing to recent, if patchy rain.  As President of the Burra Burra Show Inc., Mr I.J. Warnes had once again invited members of the committee to go out during shearing to inspect the method of working the property.  [22 of the 25 who went out are listed.]

It was a cold day for Sturt Vale with a temperature of 60°F.  En route they called in at ‘The Lagoon’ where the visitors found Mr Fred Gebhardt had one of the finest collections of birds in the state.  The variety included all sorts of parrots including the King parrot, eastern rosellas, rock pebblers, blue bonnets and so on, cockatoos, canaries, kookaburras, budgerigars, pink-faced black-cheeked Nyassa (from Africa), the Bourke and rainbow lorikeets and many others.  The aviary ran the whole length of the house and was spotlessly clean.  He also had some Chinchillian Rabbits [sic] once worth up to 15/- and now about 2d.  There was a small patch of lucerne and a fine vegetable garden.

At Sturt Vale the group was met by Mr rex Warnes who welcomed all and by Mr Codrington Chief Instructor in Wool Classes at the School of Mines.  Of the many kangaroos that once lived on the immense plain in front of the homestead few remain.  About 1,000 were shot in 1933 after they had reduced the plain to a dust heap.  The next visit was to the shearing shed where some 20 shearers were hard at work with about 10 School of Mines’ students classifying the wool under the eye of Mr Codrington.  The shearing shed without the sorting room is about 120 ft long.  ‘Skirting’ was being undertaken to separate the inferior wove of the fleece to enhance its value.  The inferior portions were passed to the students detailed to sort them according to type and value.  Skirting, neck and back wools were graded as were belly and locks.

The average weight of water in a bale was 12 lb and there are 500 types of wool in Australia.  The watercourse at the station starts near Yunta and last flood was a foot deep and about a mile wide.  Joe Parks provided an excellent lunch and A.B. Riggs made a few remarks and thanked Mr Warnes on behalf of the Society for the invitation.  Mr Codrington gave a more technical lecture on wool for the benefit of the pastoralists present.  He had been appointed to the School of Mines in 1920 and soon afterwards Mr Warnes had asked him to take charge of the clip.  At the time strong and fine wools were packed in the same bales and buyers set their price to the lower grade.  He had adopted practices of sorting and eventually removed possibility of buyers basing their prices on the percentage of coarser stuff in a bale.  Mr Rex Warnes thanked the visitors.

Mr Warnes said at that time the firm was employing 71 people, excluding the family, including Koomooloo and Booborowie – among them six women and seven cooks.  They had 32,000 sheep.

The blowfly doubled the work on the pastoral areas and was one of the reasons so many men were employed on the station.  They were greatly disadvantaged by railway freight charges and as a consequence had obtained trucks and were now taking their wool direct to Port Adelaide.  [He mentioned having previously taken the wool by road to the railway at Mt Mary.]  There was also a considerable amount of back loading for the trucks.  He estimated they saved £200 a year: sufficient to pay for a new lorry in five years.  The railways would need to offer considerably more in concessions before he would return to them.
