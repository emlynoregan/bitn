BCS.  The State Secondary Schools Athletics Championships were held last Thursday at Kensington.

As usual Burraâ€™s team was dwarfed in size by the other schools, but again our performance was outstanding.

We competed in B Grade (grading run from A to H).  The girls ended in 3rd place and the boys in 5th out of eight schools.  35 personal best performances were recorded by our athletes and 14 first places were gained.

[These are listed.]
