2nd Leader on The Bon Accord Crossing

After promising some protection for the past 18 months the Commissioners are now saying it is like hundreds of similar crossings and it cannot be protected if they are to have any consistency in policy.  Officials were not impressed with the need for protection, but after representations gates were discussed and then a gong.  The matter went quiet until 20 June when Mr Stodart had a miraculous escape when his cab was struck.  Though the chairman of the Railways has blamed Mr Stodart, we say this is not true: he is a steady and careful driver.

The Bon Accord crossing has heavy traffic.  On the western side it is hidden by a large cutting and if there were something on the line it would be hard for a train to pull up.  Trains coming from the station are hidden by sheds and heaps of coal.  It is very dangerously situated.  The Commissioner says that on market days a porter is sent to the crossing before a train passes and no other precaution is necessary.  This is nonsense.  There was another very close escape on Saturday afternoon by a man in a buggy.
