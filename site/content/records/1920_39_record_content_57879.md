Obituary.  Mr Harry Parks of Kooringa died last Sunday somewhat suddenly, after a long illness.  He was the eldest son of Mr & Mrs Charles Parks of Kooringa and was born in October 1888.  After school he worked with his father, now in retirement, but then running a baking business.  Later flour affected his health and he went to Yardea as a cook for Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride for some time.  Having regained a measure of health he returned to Burra and the baking business, but the old trouble returned and he was forced to give up active work.  He was fond of sport and gardening and had a particular love of cricket.  When coursing was popular here, he found it most enjoyable and had some very classy greyhounds.  He married Miss Dora Phillips, elder daughter of Mr & Mrs James Phillips of Booborowie, who survives with three sons and one daughter: Lloyd, Joffre, Jim and Ilah Mrs W. Coles of Adelaide.  There is one grandson.  He is also survived by his parents and two brothers: Joe Parks (Kooringa) and Tom Parks (Semaphore.)

[Born 3 October 1887 Kooringa: died 15 September 1935 Kooringa.]
