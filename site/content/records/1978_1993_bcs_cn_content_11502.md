As a consequence building the centre on the mine plateau as a new building was deemed unfeasible and on 16 August the committee asked the architect to quit the project.

Since then the J150 Board in Adelaide has been threatening to reallocate the grant for the centre because it believes the money cannot be spent in time.

Contact has been made with the Premier, Mr Bannon, members of the Government and the Opposition and several visits have been made to Adelaide by members of Council and press reports have been prepared.

Council believes the money can and should be spent in Burra and that reallocation would be grossly wrong.  As the money is a Federal grant any change would have to be approved by the Premier and then by the Federal Government.  Council has protested at both those levels.  Mr Bannon has called for a report.

Council has been calling repeatedly for another meeting of the Steering Committee to clarify the matter, but so far no date has been set, though it is hoped it will occur soon.

Burra’s unique significance was acknowledged by the initial grant.  We know the importance of the town’s history to the state and Commonwealth and to enable the preservation and interpretation of what we have it is essential we retain the grant allocation.  You can help by:

Signing the petition currently circulating.

Writing a short letter to the local member, the Premier or the Leader of the Opposition.

Writing to the newspaper.
