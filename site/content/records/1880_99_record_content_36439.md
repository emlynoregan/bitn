Article on Mr P. Murrie Jun. from the Areas Express.

Mr Murrie has been a prominent resident of Gladstone for six years and resided in the district at least twice that long.  He has recently bought the Burra Record from F.W. Holder and is about to leave to take up residence in Burra.  In his time in Gladstone he has been Town Clerk and Town Councillor, a prominent member of the Institute Committee and member of the Local Parliament, formerly as Opposition Leader and latterly as Premier.  He has been a member of the Farmers’ Association, the Vigilance Committee, Captain of the Gladstone Rifle Co., Captain of the Cricket Team and member of the Lawn Tennis Team.  The mayor, Dr R. McDougal was in the chair at the farewell banquet to Mr Murrie in the Gladstone Institute on 23 April.  A testimonial was presented.  In his response he revealed he had grown up and married in Gladstone and been a wheat buyer in the area.  The paper also reported a farewell for Mrs Murrie from the Gladstone Young Christians Union.  She had been a great church worker and assistant organist for six years.  She was presented with a bracket and hymn book.
