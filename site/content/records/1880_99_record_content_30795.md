Editorial on the Government response to the Waterworks question.

The reply is along the same lines as before with a charge of 5% of the total cost.  Some say the delay was just to prevent it being aired in Parliament.  No allowance has been made even for the old works, which were constructed for the railways and not the town at all.  At least the Government should have removed the cost of the old works.  But it is beyond appeal at present and we must now decide whether to accept the works at the old price and then battle on to get the rent reduced.

Since the works were surrendered the law now gives the Council the same rating rights as the Government.

Secondly the possibility of the sale of the Burra Mine gives the town prospects it has not had for years.

Against this, as soon as the mine is pumped dry the probability is the town water supply will be cut off as the water table falls.  The new lease must provide against such a contingency.  A large tank excavated near the Chinamanâ€™s garden for the catchment of a sufficient supply of rainwater would be the best possible arrangement, but this must not be at the cost of Council.  We think it best if the Council do again lease the Waterworks, but with a clause that if the supply fails the Government will provide a new supply at their cost.  If this happens the present cost of rates must stand for one year as rent in advance will be paid.
