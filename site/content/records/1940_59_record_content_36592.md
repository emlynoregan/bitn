Burra Town Council, 19 April

It was resolved to grant a proper agreement be drawn up granting the Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club the right to use the courts until 30 June, with the right of renewal.

Deputy Director of Education wrote to say the schoolyard as a whole has not yet been improved, but an officer of the Architect-in-Chief’s Department will visit on 21 April to report on the means of improving the assembly area and to confer on the possibility of purchase of land.

The Mayor reported that the CWA’s lease in Pearce’s Buildings had expired and they were anxious to establish themselves in the two rooms of the Burra Town Hall.  It was resolved that the Town Clerk interview all contractors regarding the alterations and endeavour to obtain an estimate of the cost.

The Mayor suggested that an invitation be extended through the Premier of SA to their Majesties King George and Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret to visit Burra during their Australian Tour.  He did not think for a moment that the invitation would be accepted, but it would show Burra’s loyalty by sending the invitation.  It was resolved to do so and also to ascertain whether the SA Government would consider setting aside a day for country children to visit the city on the occasion of the royal visit and whether the Government would consider having a special train for school children to visit Adelaide to see their Majesties.
