Burra Town Council, February

Council will meet at 9 a.m. 16 February to inspect a site for the jinker and act accordingly.

Permission was granted for the Aberdeen Tennis Club to play competitive tennis on Easter Sunday.

The matter of hiring the hall to the Methodist Youth Council for country style dancing was left in the hands of the Mayor.

Mr E. Wallâ€™s tender for the Town Hall Toilets was accepted.

A letter will be written to the Fire Brigade complaining that members of the Brigade are arriving at the Station in response to emergency calls in a manner dangerous to the public, driving at high speed in the wrong direction on the one way [section of] street.
