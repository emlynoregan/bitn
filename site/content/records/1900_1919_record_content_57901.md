Visiting Day at Burra School was held last Wednesday.

Proceedings began with physical drill accompanied by the band.  Then the headmaster Mr Hitchcox gave his annual report.  The school had 262 on the roll, comprising 129 boys and 133 girls.  At the inspection the school had been classed ‘A’ for excellent.  Five one-penny concerts in the year raised £10 for improvements.  A concert organised for 19 December aimed to raise money for a piano.  The school had raised £252-6-1½ for the Children’s Patriotic Fund: £132 from the Red Cross effort at Victoria Park in April, £18 from self denial tins, £15 from a Children’s Bazaar in Kooringa, £11 from the Aberdeen effort recently and over £100of War Certificates had been purchased by the children.  Half of the scholars were wearing war service medals, some with up to five bars and two had earned the ‘Star’ decoration for giving over £6: the Misses Gwen Humphris & Jean McLaren.  27 framed pictures had been bought with money from the Seaside Picnic Committee.

Mr J. Biddle reported on the High School.  With an average of 35 pupils the High School had raised £26 for the Patriotic Fund and worked with the Primary School in activities.  22 pupils had war service medals and one had a ‘Star’.  The year began with 42 pupils and ended with 31 compared with 22 last year.  Miss Jones had transferred from Primary to High to help with the numbers.

Last year Josephine West gained the Junior Public Certificate and Jean McLaren a Senior Commercial Certificate, topping the exam and winning the John Cresswell Scholarship.

Mr McLaren gave a speech on behalf of the School Committee.  Rev. Hopton & Rev. Bridgwood, Mr Crewes & Mr Winnall also spoke, the last named announcing a half-holiday.
