George Sangster, second son of the late Dr Jack Sangster and Mrs Sangster of St Peters and grandson of the late Dr J.T. [sic: error for J.I.] Sangster, who came to Burra in 1879 and resided here for 35 years, has been appointed manager of Bennett & Fisher Ltd from 1 July.

George Sangster was born in Burra when his father owned the practice now owned by Dr D.M. Steele.

K. Drew was born in July 1893, Max Pearce in January 1900 and Mr Sangster is also in his early twenties.  Mr Sangster replaces D.L. van Senden who we understand has resigned to go on the land.
