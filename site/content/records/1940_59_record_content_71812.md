‘Burra Ratepayer’ writes in favour of building a swimming pool, but suggesting that the Minister of Education had earlier in the year opened a learners’ pool in one of the suburbs that had cost less than £1,000 – half of which was Government subsidy.  Local resources should be pooled and the construction done at the school.  It should then be handed over to the Education Department, which would be responsible for maintenance, otherwise the ratepayers would be left to ‘carry the baby’.
