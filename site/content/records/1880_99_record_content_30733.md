Town Assessments

On 26 November the Council sat to hear appeals against assessments and made considerable reductions in most cases.  14 cases were later taken to the Local Court where further reductions were asked for - as is the right of ratepayers.  The Council then did the extraordinary act of agreeing to the reductions rather than arguing the cases on merit - and it incurred Â£7 costs on the whole.  The costs swallow half the rates from these properties for the year.  We must conclude that, as the assessment of these properties was on the same basis as others, that either the present assessment is too high by 30% or these properties are now too low.

Those reduced were:
