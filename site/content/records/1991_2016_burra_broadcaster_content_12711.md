The State Government’s Development Assessment Commission has refused approval for an internally illuminated sign for Joe’s Super Snacks in Market Square – based on advice from the Heritage Adviser and because it would have jutted out at 90º and not been flush with the parapet and ‘would not conform with the development plan’.
