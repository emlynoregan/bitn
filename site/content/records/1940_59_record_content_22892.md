The Rotunda Gardens.  These are looking very good and several business people have volunteered to look after them.  Cr Kellaway said they would probably compete for excellence, which would be no bad thing.  Cr Carpenter said there was a minute on the books by which he had the right to look after the gardens for twelve months and he intended to exercise that right.  The gardens are certainly a credit to him and he has suggested that the enthusiasts look after Lane or Holder Gardens instead.  Or perhaps some people would like to look after the Market Square rockery.
