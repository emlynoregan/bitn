1st movement Concerto in B Flat Minor	Tchaikovsky	Sumner & Davey

‘It can be safely stated that this was the first occasion on which concerto work for Pianoforte has been heard in Burra.’

[Such claims as this can often be refuted, but a trove search of the Burra Record suggests that this one might even be correct.  In the early 1900s there was a Burra Orchestra and it might be expected that their concerts could have included a movement or more of a piano concerto, but the paper does not report one.  It does report at least one cello concerto and one violin concerto.  Merle Robertson was advertised to give a concert in October 1923 and she was known for playing the Mendelssohn piano concerto, but there is no follow-up review of this concert.]

[Note: 71, 43, 2 November 1948, page 1 adds some details.  The proceeds of the concert amounted to £47.  Mr R.W. Humphrys of ‘Blink Bonnie’ generously footed the expenses bill of £1-5-6, so that the whole £47 was available for urgent hospital needs and, since the improvements contemplated attracted a £ for £ Government Subsidy, £94 could be spent.  The improvements included a rubberoid floor covering for the Labour Ward in the Maternity Wing.]
