Mary Woollacott celebrated her 60th birthday on 2 July.  Now Burra Community Library Assistant, Mary has spent almost half her life at BCS, starting as a Teacherâ€™s Assistant in 1977.  After leaving school Mary first spent 12 years working for the Burra Record and in 1977, if the school job had not come along, would probably have gone to the city to find work.  She moved into the Library Assistant position in the 1980s.
