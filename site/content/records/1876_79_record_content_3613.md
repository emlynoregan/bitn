The Burra Corp. discussed the whole water supply issue on 13 Feb. The Corporation was under the impression that all that the Govt. was going to do was to place a water trough at the Station Gate, fed from the Govt. main. They were caught unawares when a supervisor and twenty men arrived with instructions to lay a pipe from the Station along Morehead Street and up, Best's Place to the National Bank at Aberdeen.

The Mayor, Mr Lipsett, `believed that a private interest had been brought to bear upon it.' Also things were worse in Kooringa where the water supply was in the hands of one man. He thought that the line could be extended to Kooringa while the men were there to do it, but Cr Roberts pointed out that it was only a 3" main and they should urge the Commissioner of Public Works to supply the whole town. Cr Roberts wanted to condemn the Commissioner.

Cr Bartholomæus agreed they should urge the Govt to supply Kooringa as well. Mr Geake said they should write to the Commissioner pointing out the injustice done to Kooringa. Cr Wilkinson suggested a deputation wait on the Commissioner, while The Mayor said they had already written. The Mayor did not begrudge Aberdeen water, but since the Govt. had voted £820 for the purpose Kooringa should get some of the benefit. In the end they decided on a deputation to ask that the water trough be shifted to the station and seeking clarification of liabilities and cost implications for the Corporation.

In the event that Mr Rounsevell being unable to introduce them, they should seek some other independent member like C.C. Kingston, rather than their other representative, Mr Rees, whom he felt had pandered to private interests and had been operating with the Commissioner as to the water supply arrangements.

[As reported this must have been a rather heated meeting with the whole council much offended by the Govt. action. It is also sometimes incoherent, several times straying onto other subjects in mid stream, such as the Kingston St Bridge and a ford in need of attention.]
