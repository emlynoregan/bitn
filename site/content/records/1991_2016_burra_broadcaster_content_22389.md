Perlite Gets Green Light

The Regional Council of Goyder has approved the planning application to establish a perlite factory at Burra.  The EPA has asked that the Council insert some conditions in its approval.  The next step was for the Council to be provided with engineering drawings for site structures.  The factory is of significance for the state and nation in that its operation would significantly reduce the importation of perlite from the USA.  It will reduce filtration costs for the wine industry.  Ed James of Chillagoe Perlite said construction would begin as soon as possible with a capital investment of $600,000.  Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan said the factory was a welcome addition to the economy and would boost employment.  It would give a demonstration that Burra can continue to improve as it will have a positive impact on Burraâ€™s economy and inject millions of dollars into it.  Mr James hopes the plant will be operating in time for the next vintage.
