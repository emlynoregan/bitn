Mineral Report, by Mr Trewartha of certain lands on the new road to the Burra Mine and on the Wakefield near Emu Plains and in the Murray Scrub east of the Burra Mines.

Of the sections lying near the new road from Burra to the head of St Vincentâ€™s Gulf, he found flat, low ground with no reason to declare then mineral land.

Copper was found in several places in the ranges south of Emu Plains, north of the Wakefield River and west of Skillogolee Creek.  This is a continuation of the metalliferous channel seen in the Emu Plains sections.  He thinks it might be advantageous to lay out more section sin this district.

A large lode of iron mixed with copper was discovered at Gum Creek, where applications have been made.  Mr Trewartha will report more fully on this when sections have been laid out.  About three miles north of the Bon Accord copper was found on the surface in several places and a more detailed report will be made when this district too has been surveyed.

The Murray Scrub about 20 miles east of Kooringa was visited and a remarkable formation met with.  It consists of quartz, clay, iron and a slight mixture of copper.  Specimens have been sent to the Land Office.

At the request of Mr Williams, manager of the Patent Copper Co. Mr Trewartha investigated some land about three miles northeast of the Burra Mine where there are large bodies of silicious rocks, well adapted to the making of fire-bricks and therefore likely, in his opinion, to prove a valuable discovery.
