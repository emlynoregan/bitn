Redruth Court.

Joseph Ford sued Robert McBride for £49 for watering 5,000 sheep on 2 & 4 November at the plaintiff’s dam on Lagoon Run.  The evidence is extensively reported.  Some evidence disputed the amount of damage done while other evidence claimed permission either explicit or tacit had been given.  The bench finally awarded Ford £10.

A related action under the Scab Act of not giving notice before entering Ford’s run was withdrawn.
