Burra Town Council: Municipal Elections

Mayor:	A.B. Riggs	260

S. Kellaway	168

East Ward:	F. Harris	135

M. Morton	60

Auditor:	Graham Dow	215

Alwin Pearce	210

The votes for the Mayoralty of 428 were a record said S. Kellaway.

[The previous record was in December 1878 when 377 votes were cast, but the record would be broken in December 1930 with 461 votes cast and again in December 1933 when 492 were cast.]

This year saw the last election for auditors.  After this auditors would require a certificate and would then be appointed by the Council.  [This was the consequence of a recent Act of Parliament.]
