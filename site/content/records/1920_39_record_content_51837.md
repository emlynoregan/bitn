Mongolata Water.  The Commissioner of Works Office advises they have tested a sample of Mongolata water and conclude it is quite drinkable, although it has a slight taste of tar and bagging.

The editor comments that the sample he was given seemed worse and in any case no one wanted even a slight taste of tar and bagging in their drinking water.

The big tank is being cleaned out this week.
