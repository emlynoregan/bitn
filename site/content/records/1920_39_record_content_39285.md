Mongolata Goldfield

A question of Mr Critchley’s in Parliament reveals that only five heads of the ten-head battery at Peterborough are working.  The Minister denied the equipment was obsolete ‘but somewhat in need of repair’.  Enquiries were being made how to limit other work and concentrate on gold.

With respect to water at Mongolata the Minister said temporary arrangements had been made and negotiations were almost finalised for cleaning out a Government Dam in the vicinity.

[On the same page tenders are called for this work on the western boundary of section25, which is almost directly east of the main group of claims on the eastern side of the road to Poonunda Station.]
