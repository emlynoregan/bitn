Burra Hospital article by F.W. Holder 
The old mine hospital was the building opposite Mr Roach’s Mill. SAMA granted this building to become the town hospital. A building committee was set up in 1875 to take steps to add to these premises and Sara & Dunstan entered into a contract for the work when just then the Burra Hotel came on the market and for various reasons the committee decided to take the hotel in preference to the old hospital building. The property taken over was valued at £1347-15-9 and additional sums were collected in 1876 of £71l-l2-9 and in 1877 of £114-4-0 to form a building fund, supplemented by the Govt. and the formal opening of the hospital after repairs, alterations and additions was on 27 February 1878 by Sir Henry Ayers. On the same day the foundation stone of the school was laid. The Board of Management, elected by subscribers, also met that day. 
It had been contemplated that the Board would run the hospital and the Govt would match the sum raised by private donations and subscriptions. But on 13 March 1877 the Govt. was asked to bring the hospital under the Hospital Act of 1867 and it agreed. This gave the Govt. the right to nominate a proportion of the Board. The income now comes from the Govt. grant and private benevolence. Income includes the churches’ ‘Hospital Sunday’ which last year raised £27-3-0. Contribution boxes are placed around the town, e.g. in the hotels. Private patients can also enter for a fee — last year bringing in £109-12-0. Fees for a bed & sitting room 1st class are 15/- a day, bedroom 1st class 9/- a day, small room 7/- per day and the general ward, 6/- per day. 
The hospital is at present very satisfactory. The honorary surgeon system has made it a very economical arrangement. Staff at present is Miss Lucy, two nurses, two servants and a porter.
