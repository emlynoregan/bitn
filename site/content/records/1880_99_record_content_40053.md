Burra Institute Committee Annual Meeting, 20 January 1891.

The Treasurer, Dr Brummitt, read the balance sheet, which showed they opened the year in credit £14-7-6, received £192-0-4 plus a Government subsidy of £51-11-6 for a total of £257-19-4.  Expenditure was £229-7-11 leaving a credit of £28-11-5 on the 31 December 1890.

The President, T. Edwards read his report.  The library had been replenished with 223 new books.  150 worn books had been removed leaving a total of 3,191 volumes.

There were 50 subscribers paying 3/- per quarter and 21 paying 5/- per quarter.

Elections for 1891:	President	T. Edwards

	Vice-President	Mr Furniss

	Treasurer	Dr Brummitt

	Hon. Sec.	Dr Sangster

[The committee included F.W. Holder.]

The contract price for the hall improvements came to £321-17-8 and the work is due for completion by 31 March.  Scenery and a proscenium will be needed and furnishing of the new dressing rooms will be required too as well as refurbishing the piano, or a new one.  The building fund held £232-14-9 and it will be necessary to formulate a scheme to increase this fund or else the overdraft would be larger than desirable.

A committee meeting on 23 January accepted Mr Fife’s offer to put the piano in thorough repair.

The committee resolved to reply to the Local Board of Health [re provision of a urinal and closet] that in the absence of any legal requirement they decline to accede to the request of the Board.
