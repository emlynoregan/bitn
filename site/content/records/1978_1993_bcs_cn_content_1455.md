An early dugout phase was followed by simple Cornish cottages with straightforward hip roofs and chimneys, sited directly on the footpath with a central doorway and a room either side.  Houses often stepped down the contours, which has provided interest and variety in many streets.  Verandahs were an Australian feature added later, as in Paxton Square, to moderate the harshness of the climate.
