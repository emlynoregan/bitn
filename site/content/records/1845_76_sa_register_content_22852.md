‘Traveller’ writes calling for urgent action on the Saddleworth-Black Springs Road.  He is also scathing about the Black Springs-Chinkford [Chingford - later Manoora] Road.  He says at the very least the four or five bogs crossed between Glendore [Black Springs] and Manoora demand attention.  A bridge across the Wakefield and another in Chinkford are also needed.
