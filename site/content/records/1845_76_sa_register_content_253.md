The Monster Mine

Some of the party who went to inspect the boundary of the Monster Mine returned yesterday after experiencing some of the most tempestuous weather they have ever witnessed.  Our correspondent says there is every probability that the hopes of speculators will be realised.  Having traversed the whole of the line he is satisfied a more splendid country for mining operations does not exist.  When he was there the Surveyor General was pitching his tents, but had not begun operations.  There is no want of food and water for cattle and the Burra Creek, which extends three parts of the length of the mine, will in all probability have good running water all the year.  There is some misunderstanding between the Government and the Gentlemen who have taken the Special Survey regarding the shape of the Survey.  The Governor says the shape should be a rectangle, while the purchasers would favour a rhomboid form to embrace more of the visible mineral wealth.
