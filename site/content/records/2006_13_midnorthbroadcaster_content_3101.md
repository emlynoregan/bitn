Maggie Beer visited Burra last week to research the Cornish pasty.  She visited Polly’s Tea Rooms and had lunch there with Maureen Wright.  Nicki Bernhardt of Polly’s said the distinguishing feature of a Cornish pasty was the crimped top used as a disposable handle.  It was filled with potato, swede, turnip and other vegetables and if meat was available it could be added – usually left over scraps.  Maggie and Maureen also visited Morphett’s Enginehouse.
