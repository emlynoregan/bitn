Goyder Council’s planner, John Brak, said last week that the Council’s Development Plan did not reflect the current expectations of residents in the Council area.  He was addressing BRTBA on how the Council assesses developments in its area.  The present plan essentially pre-dates the Council mergers.  The Council is about to call tenders for a consultant to go through the plan and take into account community opinion.
