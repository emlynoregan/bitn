Australia Day Awards

Tom Albany Padbury received a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for Services to the Australian Wool Industry.  He was stud master at Collinsville in its heyday of the 1980s and made a significant contribution to the improvement of Merino genetics and was also recognised for his work as a stud master, judge and adviser to other breeders.

John Gordon Duncan (Jock) of Gum Creek has been awarded the AM (Member of the Order of Australia) for services to the community, particularly through the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of SA, of which he has been President since 1993.  Jockâ€™s father was also President of the Society in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Jock has recently been overseeing the $7 million extension to the Hamilton Pavilion, which HRH Prince Philip will be opening at the end of February.
