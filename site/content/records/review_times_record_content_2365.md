Spalding-Booborowie-Morgan Road

In reply to a question in the House of Representatives from the Member for Grey, the Minister of Transport said there was no proposal to declare this road a National Commerce Road.  Upgrading to open surface standard began in 1968-69.  Upgrading ceased after 1972-73 for the Burra-Morgan sections and after 1973-74 for the Spalding-Burra section due to shortage of funds.  $25,000 this year has enabled the Burra Burra DC to construct 3.2 km to sub-base standard.  Work is proceeding at present.  It was hoped to finance some work between Burra and Spalding in the next two years.
