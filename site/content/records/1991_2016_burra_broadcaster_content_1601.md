Mark Hutchinson of the SA Museum found a second dead one, presumed to have been killed by a kestrel.

Funding was obtained from the Endangered Species Program and Tim Milne was employed to continue the survey.  On 6 November 1992 the first live animal was seen in 33 years.  Since then, over 50 have been found in three localities.  In spring and summer most were males, presumably out looking for mates.  Females and young were seen later in summer.  It was found they lived in spider burrows rather than in logs or among rocks.  Tim has been able to lure them out using grasshoppers on a rod and line to go ‘fishing’ for them.  They are found in pastures on which grazing has occurred for 100 years, but seem to favour remnant Lomandra grassland of the rocky creek-lines, which have escaped the plough.  These are a threatened community.  The search for further colonies will continue and the life history, movements, behaviour and ecological requirements will now receive attention.  [Photo.]
