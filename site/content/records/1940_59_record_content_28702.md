Burra Show

The first Burra Show since 1939 was held on Saturday 12 October.  Mr A.B. Riggs as President of the Society was a driving force for its success.  He was ably assisted by Mr K.R. Crewes as Secretary and F.H. Reed and R.W. Humphrys as Vice-Presidents, along with a host of people serving as committees, convenors and judges.  [All of whom are listed.]

The weather was most unfavourable, with a strong wind and clouds of dust.  Some sideshow tents had to be taken down and so some sideshows could not operate.

Flowers were fairly numerous and the schools’ display was an outstanding section.

Cooking, produce and other displays in the pavilion were all very good.

Cattle exhibits were above average.

The leading sheep men do not exhibit, despite Burra’s position in sheep breeding, but smaller owners showed quite a number of excellent quality entries.

Ring entries were good despite the difficult conditions and they kept a large audience entertained.

Gate takings of £130 were more than £20 up on the 1939 show.  The Show was officially opened by the Governor of Sa, Sir Willoughby Norrie, who was accompanied by Lady Norrie.

[The speeches of Mr A.B. Riggs and the Governor are printed and the official luncheon and its toasts are also reported at length.  The prize winners of the show are printed in full on pages 3 & 4.

Of personal interest: there were no Fuss entries in the Flowers.]
