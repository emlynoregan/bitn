Kooringa News, 4 June

On Friday evening a meeting was called to take steps for collecting money for the Indian Relief Fund, but due to the short notice it was only thinly attended.  It was adjourned to Monday so that ministers could announce it at church. A tolerably attended meeting was held on Monday in the Kooringa Wesleyan Hall.  The town’s ministers attended and W.H. Wilkinson took the chair.  He had received a description by the last mail of a devastating famine in India, the very locality of the late war.  He outlined the nature of the distress.  At least 10 millions were in need and 500,000 tons of rice would be needed over the next three months.  A committee was set up to collect funds for Indian Relief.  [Members are listed.]  Steps are to be taken to canvass the town for support.

The town has recently been visited by thieves who have entered houses of several citizens while the owners were absent.  Rev. Lloyd’s house was entered during church hours on Sunday and the thieves took a writing desk and a few shillings in cash.  At T. Bath’s they took cash, but left a valuable watch and some jewellery, though they missed a cash box containing a considerable sum under a bed.

The Redruth Bridge is now drawing towards completion.  This is not before time, as the Company has again dammed the creek and recent rains have thus made the ford all but impassable.
