Jubilee Celebrations

A meeting was convened by the Mayor last Wednesday to establish a committee to organise celebrations for the Commonwealth Jubilee and the 75th Anniversary of the Corporation.  The meeting was well attended.  The proposal was for a ‘Back to Burra’ lasting a week.  Mr H.O. Pederick moved that a committee be formed to organise this.  Any surplus funds generated will be shared by the War Memorial (Victoria Park) and the Hospital Building Fund.  The last week in September was chosen for the celebrations.
