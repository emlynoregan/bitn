Obituary.  An unknown man was found hanging in a hut at Douglas.  M-C Williams says that investigations have shown that the deceased was a man who had been staying at John Snell’s boarding house from 24 to 29 November.  He said he had come from South Queensland via Silverton and Port Augusta.  He had no money and was low-spirited.  A swag left at Snell’s contained nothing to aid in identification.  [In view of above oddly registered as dying 28 November 1885 aged 33]
