Burra Mine Buildings Preservation Fund

S.J. Woollacott started the fund with $500.  National Trust members have spent the last couple of weeks sending letters appealing for donations which are tax deductible.  Graves’ Pump House contains some 2,000 tons of stone.  Mr Ian Auhl points out a building similar to Graves’ was transferred from Kadina to Wallaroo in 1876 and they were commonly moved in Cornwall when an ore body was worked out – it being cheaper than quarrying and cutting new stone.
