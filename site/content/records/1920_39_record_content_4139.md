Obituary.  It is feared that Mr Don Kerin has drowned in a boating accident on a lagoon on Mutooroo Run (150 miles from Burra) where he is employed.  His swag was on the bank and the empty boat was found drifting.  The body has not yet been recovered.  He is married to the eldest daughter of Mrs Hobby of Kooringa and there are four young children, the youngest only one month old.  [Details next paper.]
