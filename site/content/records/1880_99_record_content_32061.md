Water Conservation.  Last Tuesday a visit to World’s End was made by Dr. R. Brummitt, Messrs P. Lane JP, E.C. Lockyer JP, D.S. Packard JP, Cr Pinch, Cr Rabbich, Mr Rayner and F.W. Holder, to ascertain the facilities for water conservation.  The party departed Market Square at 6 a.m. and had breakfast at the creek before a walk up the gorge.  Where the road crosses Baldina Ck [sic] [The creek at World’s End is the Burra Creek.] there is a Government gauge which records 500 million gallons p.a.  Within the gorge it is joined by another creek from the southwest.  Probably the best place for a weir would be just below the point where the other creek enters.  A dam here would impound much water with little fear of silting.  After returning to the horses the party continued downstream for about 4 miles to the second range - the Black Hills - passing through the unoccupied town of Lapford.  The Black Hills site seems unsuitable for a weir.  The Commissioner of Public works will be invited to the first site when he comes up shortly.
