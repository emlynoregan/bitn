F.W. Holder as Treasurer delivered the Budget on Thursday.  Despite a £185,000 shortfall in estimated revenue the budget was not in deficit.  Since 1887 the old deficit which then stood at £1,100,000 has been reduced by over £400,000.  There has been a surplus every year since 1887 till last year when there had been a deficit of £200,000.  The income was expected to be down this year due to falling land values.  Expenditure would be cut as much as possible, but there was little left to trim after last year’s cut of over £113,000.  Military cuts would be £10,000 and an excise of 2d a gallon would go on Colonial Beer – yielding £30,000 p.a. and the duties on imported beer, spirits and dried fruits would rise in line with Victoria’s.
