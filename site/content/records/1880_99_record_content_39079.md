Art Exhibition in aid of the Redruth Wesleyan Church.

To the right of the door was a large and well assorted collection of copper ore from different parts and depth of the Burra Mine.  On the wall above were photographs by W. Bentley then next a picture frame in wood and cork: one of several, those of Messrs J. Harry and F. Harris being the best.  The pot plants and flowers were by T.W. Pearce.  Then a stall of curiosities including Aboriginal war implements.  Two large Christmas Trees were loaded with toys.  Then a refreshment stall.  Cases of specimens from various sites, large patchwork quilt by Miss Josling and then a group of dressed dolls.  Next was a stall of work for competition.  Vegetables grown by Mr R. Snell and Mr Gerard.  Then a case of pigeons (‘which did not improve the atmosphere of that particular corner of the hall’).  There was a large stall of seamstress work.
