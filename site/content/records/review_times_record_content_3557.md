BCSâ€™s publication Relatively Speaking was launched last week by the English Language Curriculum Director Ms C. Woods.  Over 400 students aged from 3 to 17 contributed.  Mr P. Quick of BCS co-ordinated the effort and he said that half the 250 people who attended the launch were in period costume.  Copies of the book were given to C. Fidock for his work on it, to the Harris Family of Farrell Flat, who thought of the punning title and to Louise Fidock, who designed the cover.  Schools involved were BCS, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Leighton and the Burra Kindergarten.
