Edlie Thomas recently took a man out to a hut on his property at Ulooloo.  In the night the man was woken with something tickling his ear.  On getting up and finding a light he discovered a black snake coiled on his pillow with a rat halfway down its gullet.  The tickling had been from the ratâ€™s tail.
