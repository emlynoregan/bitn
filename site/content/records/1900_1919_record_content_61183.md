Burra Town Council

Charles Grow wrote offering the necessary land for road alterations at Deadman’s Bridge for £60.

Cr Radford urged acceptance as if a house were built there the chance of alteration would be gone.  The work could be done with the Commonwealth gift of £240 and borrowing if needed.

Carried unanimously.

The Deputy Post Master General said mail services had been cut from 4 to three trips to the station because no tenders had been received for four services.

J. Allen has offered to take charge of the fire brigade to the time of the first meeting.

Several streetlamps have been vandalised.
