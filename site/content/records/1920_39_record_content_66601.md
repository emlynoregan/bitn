Outstanding rates were £110.

He suggested painting a white line on the road from the direction of the Memorial to the silent cop at the Commercial Bank and parking lines on the kerbs.

Cr Dow said the latter would be ignored and he didn’t see how a line could be drawn from the Memorial parallel to the kerb as suggested.  The traffic would go too close to the Memorial.  The whole corner wanted going into again.

Cr Worth said Council could frame a by-law to make car owners observe the Act.

Cr Dow said the whole trouble was the Council talked too much.  There should have been an instruction for Council to tell the inspector to inspect the problem, then the Council to make a request to police and see it carried out.  Instead the Mayor tried to make an excuse for someone, undermining suggestions of Council and was always of an opposite opinion.

[He carried on with similar observations about the Mayor in other contexts including Victoria Park issues.]

A minute was made that the Mayor would reply next meeting to Cr Dow’s concerns about responsibility for welfare and care of Victoria Park.

Cr Worth moved that the Police be asked their opinion of:

The desirability of a white line to mark the centre of the road from the Soldiers’ Memorial to Drew & Crewes’ Lane.

The desirability of banning parking between Matthews’ & Drew & Crewes’ Lane.

The desirability of banning parking from the Commercial Bank corner to Baulderstone’s.

The desirability of a silent cop in the middle of Commercial St opposite the south alignment of Chapel St.

The desirability of altering the existing cop from the position opposite Drew & Crewes’.

Carried.

The Finance Committee is to go into the recovery of outstanding rates.

Cr Kellaway wanted £30 relief funding to go to work cleaning up the cemetery.

The Mayor said the only people wanting relief were children and persons unable to work, but if others could be found the suggestion would be carried out.

He said: ‘All the decent fellows in the town were in employment.’
