Aberdeen Football Club

A special general meeting was held on 2 May, called by President M. Broad.  The President reported on the committeeâ€™s decision to go into recess.  Jumpers will be held for 12 months, all accounts will be paid and $1,500 will be placed on fixed deposit.  A meeting with delegates from other sporting clubs will be held on 30 May to decide what use can be made of the club rooms.

Mid North Lapidary Club members have visited Cowell, Iron Knob, Whyalla, Victoria and New Zealand and have returned with material for cutting and polishing.  A field trip to the Utica Copper Mine resulted in the collection of a small specimen of malachite and atacamite crystal.  Members have visited the local Aboriginal rock carving site and the Redbanks area for jasper.  The next meeting will be in the Town Hall supper room on Monday 2 June.

Farrell Flat railway crossing lights have been delayed by design questions for the crossing.

Adelaide Wool Sales are reported with local prices printed.  Values were generally firm.
