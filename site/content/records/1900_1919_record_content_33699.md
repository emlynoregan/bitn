The Seaside Trip.  A group met in the Council Chamber on Thursday to arrange a cheap excursion to Adelaide and the Semaphore on the 19 March.  A special train will cost c. Â£75, which will work out at 5/9 for adults and 2/9 for children.  A committee was formed and subscriptions will be taken up to provide a good time for the children.  The Burra Coronation Band will accompany the children.
