Ayers School break-up was held in Leighton Hall on the evening of 22 December.  A short program of items was followed by a report from the Chairman of the School Committee Mr Roy Humphrys.  He said the year had not been as good as they could have wished owing to several setbacks, notably influenza.  The school was open for 208 days in 1934 with 26 on the roll and an average attendance of 24.5, but it was the first year ever that no child had attended every day.  Nellie Byles was Dux of Upper grades and Connie Byles was Dux of Lower Grades.  Further items followed the distribution of prizes and supper closed the evening.  The prize list is printed.
