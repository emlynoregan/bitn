Obituary.  William Bass, who was last week seriously injured in a road accident, died on 22 October at Burra Hospital.  He was born in Wales on 24 October 1878.  The family migrated to Victoria when he was a young lad.  From there he went to WA and then Broken Hill.  In 1906 he married Elsie Lihou, 3rd daughter of the late Henry Lihou of Kooringa and they came to Burra in 1909.  He worked for a time in the ballast quarry and later for the Town Council.  He started a milk round about three years ago.  He is survived by a widow with five children aged from 12 years to six months.

[William Herbert Victor Bass.]
