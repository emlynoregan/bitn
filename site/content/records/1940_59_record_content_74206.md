Stockowners’ Assoc. of SA Burra Branch held its AGM on 10 August.  Retiring President A.D. Radford reported on the year.  It had been a period of good seasonal conditions with good rain and feed growth.  The experience of the grasshopper plague showed infestations could be controlled.  Following the meeting on sheep stealing, which let the public know the Association and the police were determined to stamp it out, no further instances have been reported.  Following the shearers’ strike we have an assurance from the AWU that in future they will abide by the rulings of the Arbitration Court.  Present membership is 130.  Elected were: President, John M. Gebhardt; Vice-President, Gerald Gask and H. Binks-Williams & J. Battye are Joint Secretaries.

Mr R.J. Mcauley, a state Vice-President, addressed members on the need for a strong Association and paid tribute to the capable handling of the affairs of the Association by President H.J. Bird, during his office.
