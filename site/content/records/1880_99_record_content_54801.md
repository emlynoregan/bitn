Mr C.F. Newman nearly scooped the pool for vegetables and but for Ah Ching would have done so.

[Ah Ching is probably a.k.a. Ah Chin a.k.a. Chin Young.]

It was not a good time for flowers.

[Personal interest:

Only four results for flowers are printed and no Fuss features in them.

Ah Ching got prizes for 3 cabbages, 6 red beet, not less than 6 varieties of vegetable and not less than five varieties of salad vegetables.]

A full prize list is printed.
