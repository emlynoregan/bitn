The Hospital Dispute. There is an advertisement of 1½ columns by the Hospital Board members — not paid for from Board funds.  It comprises various letters including one from the Chief Secretary via his undersecretary giving Crown Law advice re the Mayor’s right to send patients for admission to hospital. This should surely close this sorry affair. Several letters affirm that the Mayor (E. Lipsett) was claiming the Attorney General’s authority for his being able to admit people to the hospital despite not being a subscriber, doing so by virtue of his office as Mayor. This was cited by R.W. Campbell, Thomas Warnes, & Robert Brummitt. The Board wrote to the Attorney-General seeking to know whether he had so advised the Mayor. Mr W.T. Sheppard, Undersecretary replied that Mr Mann, when Attorney-General, could not recollect giving any advice on this or any other matter to Mr Lipsett. The Board then wrote to Mr Lipsett asking to know when and where the advice claimed was given; he replied he would answer only if asked by the Attorney-General’s applying to him directly. Further correspondence elicited the legal advice that the Mayor had no power, as claimed, to admit patients to the Burra Hospital.
