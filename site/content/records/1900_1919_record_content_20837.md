Before the same bench the children: Morton Harold (11), Otto William (8), Dorothy (8), William Henry (5), Birdie Evelyn (5) and George Stanley William (3) were charged with being neglected children.  Evidence was tendered that the mother Fanny McWaters was addicted to drink and her home was visited by men on one occasion from 9 to 11 November she had left her house and children and had subsequently tried to do away with herself.  The children were sent to the Industrial School till age 18.  The mother made no demonstration at the decision, but asked for custody of the baby aged three, but this was refused.
