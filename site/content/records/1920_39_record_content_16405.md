Soldiers’ Aid Society, held its 10th AGM in Jubilee Hall 9 July.

A fair attendance was depleted somewhat by the measles epidemic.  President Miss Bubb reported a somewhat reduced attendance for the year.  She suggested a change from fortnightly to monthly meetings.  Last 6 September the annual dinner for returned soldiers was given and the other major effort was the fete for the Royal Institution for the Blind.  The collection at each meeting goes towards Christmas donations to sick soldiers.  The last fete raised £85 for the blind.  A brass flower bowl had been given to the Redruth Memorial Sunday School (£1-12-6) and a £1-1-0 donation to a distressed soldier.  £15 had gone to the Red Cross Produce Depot and £7 to the Children’s Hospital.  The past year they had no secretary since the first meeting, though Mrs R. Elliott had acted as such until her removal to Adelaide.  Miss Bubb then took on the acting position.  Elected were President, Miss Bubb; Vice-Presidents, Mrs M.A. Radford, Mrs F. Pearce Sen. & Mrs C. Fuss; Treasurer, Mrs A.J. Wallis; Secretary, to be elected.
