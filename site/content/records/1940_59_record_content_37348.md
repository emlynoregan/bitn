Letter.  ‘Not the Man Who Sees, But the Man With a Nose.’

He writes to say that the World’s End Church was built and opened for service in 1889 as a Wesleyan Methodist Church under the Kooringa Circuit.  The flag has been kept flying for nearly sixty years and in that time many a traveller has availed themselves of the rainwater from its tank, without abusing the privilege or causing any trouble to the church.  However, in 1947 a group of travelling Aboriginals with their flock of sheep, camped in the shed and enclosed their sheep in the yard without seeking authority from anyone.  You can imagine how unpleasant things were for the worshippers when they arrived and had to clear a path though the deposits before the door could be opened.  We supposed that perhaps those travellers knew no better, but last week the same thing occurred and the offenders were not passing Aboriginals, but people who should know better and have more respect for other people’s feelings than to use their Church property as a sheep camp.
