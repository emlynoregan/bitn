West Burra Copper Mine of William Blott & Son at Shafton about 3 miles west of Burra is proving to be the best discovery in the area since that of the Burra Burra Mine over 60 years ago.

Report of the Inspector of Mines.

The mine is situated on Section 118 of the Hundred of Hanson.  [Since renumbered so on modern maps 116.]  The recent discovery was accidental.  A large quantity of stone was being carted from Mr Forrest’s cultivated field and placed on the side of the road.  Mr Blott, who was employed breaking road metal, noticed copper carbonates and traced the source.  Outcrops were not showing, so the land was trenched and a large lode containing malachite was found 18” down.  In two of the surface workings a lode formation bears east and west with a slight angle to the south and is chiefly ferruginous calcite with malachite and copper glance from 1-4’.  At one point an underlie shaft has been sunk in the lode to 30’.  The formation is fairly defined and in the last 5-6’ of sinking and at the bottom the lode is 5’ wide of ferruginous calcite with a seam of malachite 3-4” wide on the hanging wall.  The formation looks promising.  At 26’ a drive has been started west.  A better plan would be to resume sinking the shaft to prove the deposit.  Present indications are highly encouraging.  An analysis of samples taken is then printed.
