Burra Red Cross Circle held its AGM.  A large sum of money and many valuable parcels had been forwarded to headquarters during the past year, but the main financial effort had been £500 for the Ambulance Appeal Fund, of which the Burra Show War Committee contributed £150.  Burra’s quota for the Red Cross Country Drive had been £250, but in the end the branch had raised £425.  [Details are given.]  Mrs John Tennant has resigned as President after 13 years of service.  Elected: Patrons: Mrs T.H. Woollacott & Mrs John Tennant; President, Mrs D.M. Steele; Vice-Presidents, Mrs T.B. Ashton & Mrs John Barker; Secretary, Mrs E.F. Marston; Minute Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery and Treasurer, Mrs C.J. Butler.  It was resolved to form an advisory committee to co-ordinate the work of the district’s Red Cross Circles.
