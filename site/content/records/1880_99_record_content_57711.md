District Council of Burra

The New Council met comprising Crs Barker, Klemm, Kiekebusche, Killicoat, Lockyer, McWaters & Sandland.  Cr Lockyer was elected Chairman.

Cr Killicoat reported a conference between the District Council committee and the Town Council on the ground where the dividing line of the Councils had been pegged out and the idea of fencing the new stock road was allowed to lapse.

Fred Page of Canowie thanks all at Burra Hospital for the attention he received while there.

R. Brummitt (Mayor) writes explaining the load of firewood that Cr Harris sent to the Waterworks.  On the morning of the last public holiday a burst pipe had emptied the town reservoir.  Wood was needed to pump water in to refill it, but although some had been ordered, it had not yet arrived.  Cr Harris supplied the wood in this emergency upon being appealed to by the engineer.  There can be little if any profit to Cr Harris.

The editor responds to the above by commenting that the explanation does not alter the fact that Cr Harris supplied the wood, rendered an account and expected to be paid and then withdrew it.  There were six other wood merchants in the town, some of them closer to the Waterworks, but they were not appealed to.
