Teetulpa Goldfield.  A trip to the goldfield is described.  The ride from Petersburg to Manna Hill was in an open truck (80 miles).  The line is still in the hands of the contractors and the trip took 4½ hours.  Then one of James Terry’s coaches drawn by two horses took them the two miles to the hotel.  (The coachmen were really coining money.)

The next morning, marshalled by Hill & Co.’s wild servants nearly 60 people were crowded onto the two coaches, along with the luggage: ‘being drawn by horses (so-called) - a few months at a haystack might have made them such - during our ride to the notorious gullys one man fell from the top of one of the coaches through overloading which wants, badly, putting a stop to.  After a run of nearly five hours the new Eldorado came into view.’  Only to be greeted by shouts of ‘Return’.

Out of 4,000 people about 50 might be making wages.  Saw several of our townsmen: Messrs Launder, Harris, Williams, Saunders and others, and they all assured the writer that they had not yet made a find.  There are 100s upon 100s that have done nothing.

A small (1 gallon) bag of water cost 1d.  Other provisions are now cheap enough.  The whole concern is promoted by storekeepers, railway contractors and other interested parties.  There are fully 2,000 tents on the field.  More money is being taken in than taken out, but hundreds still come and now diggers from Victoria are arriving.

A P.O. is to be built.
