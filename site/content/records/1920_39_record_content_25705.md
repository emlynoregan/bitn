The Public Holiday last Monday saw the town almost deserted.  People flocked to the Aquatic Sports at Porter’s Lagoon or to the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School Picnic at Johnson’s Creek, Princess Royal, or to Redruth Methodist Sunday School Picnic at Stone Chimney Creek on the property of Messrs Gallagher Bros.  Both picnics were popular and very successful.  Others went to World’s End Gorge.
