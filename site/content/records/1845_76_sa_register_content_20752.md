A new cobalt mine has been opened lately and a company formed in Burra with £1,000 capital – half a crown paid up.  With this the Directors will raise five tons of ore and send it to England to decide on the venture’s viability.

The Princess Royal Mine continues to look well with 14 men working 7 pitches.  One pair calculated they earned £50 for nine days’ work.

Mr Dutton MP and Mr Tomkinson visited the adjoining Dutton’s Square Mile last week to inspect a continuation of the lodes and it is possible these too could be developed.

The proposed railway remains a prime topic of discussion and the farmers continue to lament the closure of the mine.  Nearly 200 are employed in the creek dressing low grade ore, but the labour market is still very full, with many idle.
