Burra Mine

Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilisers are doing a good job at re-moulding the landscape of the dumping areas and dams.  As they are covered to capacity with black residue from copper oxide operations they are smoothed over to follow the contour of gently undulating hills.  Once moulded the area is seeded with rye grass and clover and within six months looks like a naturally grassed hillside.  They are also planting suitable trees on the slopes.  The white stream that issues from the tall chimney is pure and free from contamination.
