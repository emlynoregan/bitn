Burra Schools.  Mr W.T. McCoy, Director of Education, and J.H. Weston, Clerk of Works, visited on Monday with the Commissioner of Crown Lands Hon. G.F. Jenkins.  He toured the building.  Necessary improvements were pointed out.  The High School has just been substantially remodelled and now just needs repainting, which is due in the coming vacation.  The High School occupies the western side of the building and the one very large room has been converted into three: a first year room, a second year room and the Headmasterâ€™s Office.  The large classroom facing south is now a laboratory.  The windows have been enlarged. Afternoon tea was provided by the first year girls.  The Domestic Economy room has also been remodelled.  The visitors then addressed the pupils at an assembly.  The primary school was granted a half holiday on Friday and the High School one at the discretion of the Headmaster Mr E.A.W. Haese.  The Mayor urged the necessity of improving lavatory arrangements.
