Rev. G.E. Rowe also spoke in support and on behalf of members of his church.

Mr W.F. Coglin JP came forward and spoke in appreciation on behalf of the Catholics of Burra.

Rev. Howitt replied - he begged pardon for sometimes perhaps speaking his mind and saying sharper things than perhaps he ought to have.  He regretted has frequent illnesses and unfortunate accidents that had interrupted his work at times.  The parting after so long was painful.
