Cr T.W. Rabbich moved at Council that a petition be laid on the table for the signatures of applicants for blocks of land with a view to asking the Government to carry out the Baldina Irrigation Scheme.  The Baldina Creek is admirably suited for irrigation and would only cost two to three thousand pounds.
