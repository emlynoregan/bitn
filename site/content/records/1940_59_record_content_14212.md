Victoria Park

Following on from Cr Bevanâ€™s remarks.  It is true the place is in a bad way.  The stone wall is falling down and has huge gaps in it.  Posts around the playing area have rotted and the cable around it is on the ground.  The seats have been used as firewood by gentlemen of the road.   The attempt to plant and water couch grass on the oval failed.  An offer to build a cycle track was allowed to pass.  If Burra wants to hold population after the war it has to be made attractive.
