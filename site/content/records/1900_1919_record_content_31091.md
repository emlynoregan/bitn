Numbering of issues in 1911

Volume VX which had started 12 July 1905 was presumably finally noticed to be an error and 1911 started with a reversion to Volume XV which had previously run from 7 December 1892 to 5 July 1905.

The year began with Volume XV Number 921 on 4 January 1911.

And continued to Volume XV Number 971 on 20 December 1911.

XV, 972, 3 Jan. 1912
