Booborowie Hall additions were opened last weekend.  The well-decorated interior, extended stage and a dream kitchen are all outstanding.  The Pre-Opening Ball took over £100 and netted £80 towards the fund.  On Saturday at 3 p.m. Mr Alan Pearce, Chairman of the Hall Committee, welcomed the crowd to the front of the building.  Tenders for the original building had been called in 1920 and it was opened on 21 September 1921 by Mrs I.J. Warnes, after Mr I.J. Warnes had laid the foundation stone on 29 March 1921.  Mr Pearce outlined the generous donations of cropland that had financed the venture.  [See 88, 10, 12 Mar. 1957, page 6.]

The Burra, Hallett and Spalding DCs had also been very co-operative.  Mr B. Dinham, President of the Booborowie RSL was introduced and gave a moving address on the meaning of the memorial.  The Hon. Mr Wilson MLC, State President of the RSL endorsed these remarks and Mr Quirke MP for the Burra District, spoke briefly.  Mr Woodgate, 1st of the Hall Committee Presidents, said this was the third of the town’s red letter days.  The first had been the opening of the Hall, the second had seen the installation of electric light and this marked the completion and dedication of the building.

Mr Bob Wingfield congratulated the Committee and said he had prepared and written the report on the foundation stone ceremony for the Record.  Mr McEvoy said the only man in his day with any money was I.J. Warnes and he didn’t give it in a few pounds, but in hundreds.  ‘He was a good man for the district.’  Mr Leo Gill and Mr E.J. Affolter, the building contractor, added their remarks and Mr Pearce then ran through the costs, which totalled £7,500.

On the previous Friday the debt had been £1,800 and Mr Hawker had said he would allow them to crop another piece of land this year.  Mr Hawker then declared the building open.  People inspected the building and made purchases from various stalls operated by CWA ladies.  Funds raised of £80 were to offset the costs of new curtains.  High tea followed and £54 was taken.  In the evening 500 people attended the concert and door takings were £89.  In total the weekend functions raised £626 [or £700 if the headline is correct.]
