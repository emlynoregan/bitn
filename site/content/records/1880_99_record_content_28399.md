Editorial calling for the construction of a loop railway line from Terowie to Thyer’s Corner to bring the Barrier trade a dozen miles closer to Adelaide.  With only one mine in full swing the traffic is constantly blocked. All is held up at Terowie with the break of gauge.  The solution is either a broad gauge line to Broken Hill or a third raid to Adelaide to allow narrow gauge trains to run to the city.  BHP will not start the smelters again until new arrangements at Pt Pirie enable coke etc. to go that way.  The bullion too will no longer go to Adelaide, but to Pt Pirie.  At the very least new sidings are needed at Terowie to ease the congestion.  The line to Broken Hill should be doubled.
