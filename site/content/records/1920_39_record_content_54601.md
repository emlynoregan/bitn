Mongolata Goldfield

Two carloads of gentlemen from the city visited last Thursday and included were two representatives of English capital.  They were shown a wonderful lot of gold from the Curlew Mine of Messrs Tom Villis & E. Finch (part owners).

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. to 25 January.

Main tunnel advanced to 631ft, passing through a 4” clay seam at 626ft and is now in more solid slate, but with no values.

92ft level.  The south drive advanced to 328ft on a 3ft-wide lode with traces of gold.

52 ft level.  The south drive advanced to 190ft cutting a small seam at 182ft that gave 5dwt per ton by pan test.  Values in the end of the drive are low.

Golden Harp

South drive off No. 1 shaft advanced to 72ft on 2½ft-wide lode yielding 1oz per ton of low grade ore.  Started to stope out ore off the shaft and expect to have 100 to 120 tons to crush at an estimated 15dwt to 1oz per ton.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate: tributer’s report for block 1 for fortnight to 26 January.

Sunk 16ft then drove 6ft south and 8ft north in values of c. 2oz per ton in a seam of oxidised iron and quartz with gold evenly distributed.  Expect 10 tons to crush in a week or two.

Gold still underfoot in the shaft, but presently driving south on the seam where good specimens were found before the holidays.
