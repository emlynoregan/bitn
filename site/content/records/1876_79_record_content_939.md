Editorial.  The Rabbit Nuisance

We cannot recall in England rabbits multiplying such as to threaten crops, but in these warmer climates they threaten to eat the inhabitants out of house and home.  Legislation against them has been found necessary in Tasmania and New Zealand, even more strongly than in SA, but if we do not act very actively we can expect very serious results within five years.

[The article then details the devastation caused in 12 years since rabbits were introduced at Invercargill in New Zealand.  It outlines haw sheep suffer from the loss of feed consumed by the pest.  Details extend for about 1 column.]
