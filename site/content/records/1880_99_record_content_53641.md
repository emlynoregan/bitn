Election Meeting, 24 April at the Institute was addressed by Mr Willcox, Mayor of Adelaide.  W.T. Rabbich took the chair.

The speaker opposed both a progressive land tax and a single tax.  He thought an all round property tax with an exemption of £500 and exempting farmers’ implements and mechanics’ tools was better.  He opposed an income tax and thought the transcontinental railway [to Darwin] was a waste of money.  He favoured a land grant system to see the railway carried on to the Northern Territory.  He was for Intercolonial free trade and believed the duty should be removed from tea, coffee, cocoa and kerosene. (The free breakfast argument.)  He was for cutting ministers’ expenses and reducing the number of members in the House by half.  He opposed a state bank, would encourage mining.  There was a great problem at present of land being ‘thrown up’ – some 60,000 square miles which cost the Government £76,000 compensation for improvements.  He favoured fixity of tenure.  He was against the female franchise and believed 6/- [a day] a fair wage.
