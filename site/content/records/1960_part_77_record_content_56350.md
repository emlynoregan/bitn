Burra Mine

A trial shipment of 15.5 tons of copper oxide was railed out on Thursday to Pt Kembla, where a company will determine the smelting quality of Samin’s Burra product.  During the commissioning stages of the plant there have been some problems, but Mr Harry Rich thinks these have now been ironed out.  The original aim was to produce 2.5 tons of copper oxide per day.  One day in the commissioning stages they produced 3.5 tons.

The product that is scraped from the filters is deposited in 44 gallon drums, each weighing half a ton.  It is expected the plant will be able to ship out 70-80 drums each fortnight, representing 35 to 40 tons of copper oxide.  The actual copper content is 75%.  At present the material being treated is from the dump, from the previous mining operations.  The roofing over the stockpile at the crusher is nearing completion.

Peacock’s Chimney has now been completely dismantled and carted to the new site and the foundation is being dug there.
