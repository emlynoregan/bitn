Burra Kindergarten has been operating successfully from late in 1962 and has now decided it needs more suitable accommodation and equipment.  The number attending has been about 30.  Steps taken so far include the negotiation of a 21-year lease on the Burra Air Force Association rooms in Queen Street, where the kindergarten is now located.  Affiliation with the SA Kindergarten Union is being established.  Work to meet the Union’s standards is being undertaken.  On Thursday collectors will call on families seeking donations towards a £150 appeal fund.
