Burra Town Council, 18 August

The question of the transfer of the Burra Institute to the Council has been referred to the Minister of Education.

Mr A.B. Riggs wrote on behalf of three ratepayers who suggested the Council strike a special rate of 1/8 to buy the Institute in three years instead of 30 and in so doing, saving £2,700 in interest.  Other Councillors were not in favour as it would mean a person now paying £10 in rates would get a bill for £15.

Council resolved to get the painting of Dr Brummit in the Council Chamber re-touched.  It had originally cost £50.

Mr R. Fuss wrote objecting to the way the Council had treated him in rejecting his tender for rebuilding the Burra North Swing Bridge and then calling for tenders for materials so that Council employees could do the work.  The Mayor was of the opinion Mr Fuss should have been given the job and said he doubted if Council would save money by using Council employees.  The tenders for materials are to lie on the table until the next meeting.
