The Main Street Program

Rob Jenkins of the program addressed a group of 40 interested persons on Thursday night.  As a result Mr Stephen Angel will distribute an enquiry sheet to local bodies and individuals to establish the common needs and aspirations of private, commercial and rural interests.  The sheet will seek to identify the best and worst aspects of Burra.  One issue highlighted was that on the same night there were three meetings in progress with similar aims and Mr Jenkins suggested some co-ordination was needed.
