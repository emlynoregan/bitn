I have many times seen the flood marks covering the lime-wash around the rooms, two or three feet up.  There was a hole high up in the side of the chimney breast and I was told that was where out little hoard of money was truly banked and then plastered over and lime-wash applied to appear the same as all the rest of the wall.  We moved to a house near the bank on the north side of Mitchell’s Flat belonging to ‘Uncle’ John Magor.  While there I attended a school kept by ‘Uncle’ John Pellew.  He was a cripple using crutches to get around and wore an old-fashioned black beaver hat.

In a later flood a boy named Reed was drowned.  He lived in a row of brick cottages in Thames St and slipped into the smaller creek at the back of the house and was carried into the main creek.  His body was found near the slaughterhouse some days later.  There were many fine gums along the creek, but they were felled by order of the Mining Co. because it was said they were being killed by the copper contamination from the Mine water.  Walter Way had the contract for this.  Dust storms were prevalent some seasons creating some very dark and dusty days.  Whirlwinds were also common and sometimes three or more could be seen at a time sweeping across the town and carrying away any light material.  Huge flocks of shell parrots passed through in migration, numbering hundreds of thousands.

Boys commonly built bonfires on midwinter night and old greasy bones, rags and other inflammable materials were collected in advance.  The boys ran from fire to fire waving fire sticks and singing the slogan: ‘Hip hip hooray, midsummer day is passing away.’  When the fires burnt low boys would jump over them.  Some boys indulged in smoking, but cigarettes were not known, so they smoked brown paper and cane and used the leaves of the native tobacco that grew on the hills.  It spread out on the ground and the leaves were about three inches long and serrated and the underside was white.

The fired cleared away a lot of rubbish, but the smell on a still night was a great nuisance and the police would sometimes take action to suppress the fires.  One year Corporal Collins arrived at one of our fires and the boys all scattered, but I and my brother had to put it out.
