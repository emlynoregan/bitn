A Fancy Dress ‘Cinderellas’ Dance’ was held in Burra Institute on Wednesday 5 September when Setaro’s Band from Adelaide was unavailable and Mr & Mrs McLachlan of Terowie proved to be good substitutes.  The hall was gaily decorated with a poppy theme.  A list of the fancy dress costumes is printed.
