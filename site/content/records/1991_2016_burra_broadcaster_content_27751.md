Goyder Council has engaged Mid North Pest Control to tackle the pigeon problem in Burra.  Measures began two weeks ago and have reduced pigeon numbers considerably.  In recent years large numbers of the birds were harboured in O’Connor’s Shed at Burra North [Drew & Crewe’s bulk store] and the Commercial Hotel stables [in Chapel St].  Following renovations to these buildings and their new use the pigeons moved to become a pest at Pearce’s Buildings, the Burra Visitor Centre, the Commercial Hotel and Paxton Square Cottages.
