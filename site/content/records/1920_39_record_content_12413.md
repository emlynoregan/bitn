Burra Town Council, 2 December

There were self congratulations all round on an unchanged Council for 1924.

The Fire Brigade replied to a query saying that one man in charge plus volunteers would be more costly.

Cr Woollacott wanted an inquiry, as he felt that some men were continually away without trouble.

It was resolved to move the bell to the Fire Brigade from the Police Station.

A decision on the rates was deferred to the next meeting.

A letter of protest will be sent to the Deputy Postmaster General on the loss of the evening mail service to private boxes.
