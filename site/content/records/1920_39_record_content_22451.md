Obituary.  Beatrice Eleanor (Trix) Pearce, fifth daughter of the late John & E.J. Pearce, died on 7 March at Terowie Private Hospital after a few hours illness.  [Born 4 February 1885 at Kooringa.]

Miss Trix Pearce had been visiting her sister Mrs A.S. Dearlove at Ketchowla.  On Sunday she played the organ for morning and evening services at Terowie Methodist Church.  During the night she wakened her sister with a strange noise and was found unconscious and died at the hospital about 1 a.m. Monday morning.  During the War Miss Pearce and Mr F. Harris were organisers of the Burra Cheer-up Society and no one could have worked harder or more unselfishly than she did for the men who went to the front and those who returned.  On her devolved the duty of organising a Cheer-up send-off to every departing soldier and a welcome to each one returning.  It did not matter whether the returned man was an officer or a private.  She was also secretary and a player in the Burra Cheer-up Ladies Band which took so great a part in farewelling and welcoming the boys.  She was also for many years organist at Kooringa Methodist Church where she succeeded her father and sister and she took a great interest in all the departments of the church.
