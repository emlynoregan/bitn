Australia Day in Burra.

Would Burra produce the goods again?  In the past five weeks nearly £600 had been collected for Red Cross, the YMCA and the Cheer-up Society.

The day was fine.  Bunting, marquees and stalls were erected in Market Square.  Souvenir sellers were afoot.  By 1.30 the crowd was still thin, but by 2 p.m. it had thickened.  There were a series of addresses at c. 2 p.m.  Rev. A.J. Finch was followed by I.J. Warnes who scorned the wealthy men in the district who had not managed to spare even £100 and some not even £1 for patriotic purposes.  Cpl W.M. Hanell, who served under Sgt Darby Killicoat, spoke.

Then Mr Hawkes spoke, followed by Mr Winnall.  The Mayor welcomed Ptes James & Oates.  He had been asked what sum the committee would be satisfied with and he had said £1,000 and been laughed at, but he knew he had not overestimated.
