Burra Contingent & the Patriotic Fund

The boys will return on Thursday on their final leave and depart again on Saturday.

A meeting of the Patriotic Fund decided on an hour’s farewell at the Institute from 7 to 8 p.m. Friday, without refreshments as the boys will want to spend the time with friends and family and in any case the hall had to be set up for the following day’s election.  The band offered its services.

[C.A. Fuss, among others, added to the sports committee.]

Mr Winnall moved that the meeting recommend to finance committee that ⅔ of the fund be sent away and ⅓ be retained (instead of the other way round).  There was some dissention.  The report does not make the outcome clear, but probably it was left for decision at a more general public meeting
