The Sunday Mail (Adelaide) 2 March 1986 Magazine Section, page 43

There is a full page article on the opposition in Burra to the re-development of Market Square.

The article says citizens are taking on the Council, the Highways Department and the State Heritage Branch to save the roadway round the curve of Market Square.

Council wishes to close this roadway in the interests of better traffic flow and safety.  Protesters say this is a nonsense and the last serious accident was more than 35 years ago and Council is merely indulging in a whim.  The Burra Preservation Organisation has been formed to defend the Square and has nearly 300 members.  They claim that Market Square is the heart of Burra historically and economically.  It is said to be the first spot laid out by the South Australian Mining Association, the place where settlers gathered to pay a shilling a bucket for water and where people have always gathered for celebrations and thanksgiving.

The row erupted first in December when goose-neck street lights appeared and residents wanted lights more in keeping with the character of the 140-year-old architecture.  About 140 ratepayers attended a meeting and all but one of the lights have been removed.  Protesters say they have not been informed of the plans for the Square and are angry.  BPO Chairman Gerry O’Connor believes the Square is the town’s most impressive asset.  Leonard Bence said ‘We don’t want a model paved square where people can park’. 

[Other objectors cited were Richard Dollman (22), Derek Rayfield and Jenny O’Connor.]

Jenny O’Connor said tourism had doubled in the last two years.

John McBride and Angas McInnes also objected.  National Trust Chairwoman Mrs Maureen Wright said the National Trust would have preferred to have retained the road, but the Trust does not violently oppose the compromise plan.  Out of it all comes the realisation that the Market Square precinct is not on the State heritage List.
