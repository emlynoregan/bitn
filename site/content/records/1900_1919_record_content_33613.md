SAR.  There has been another narrow escape at the Bon Accord crossing.  After previous trouble there, the railways for a time sent an employee to warn people when a train was approaching, but this has faded out.  On Friday a farmer with a load of wheat barely cleared the crossing when a goods train came along.  Surely a gate or even a bell could offer protection at little cost.
