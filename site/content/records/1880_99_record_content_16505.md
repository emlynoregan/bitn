Salvation Army Barracks.  There is a one-column report on the laying of the foundation stone for the new barracks last Wednesday.  For months meetings have been held out of doors, but eventually a tender from Sara & Dunstan was accepted to erect a plain, but substantial hall 60’ x 45’ x 20’ high for c. £600 with square headed doors and windows.  At 3 p.m. a procession was formed in Market Square led by Major Thurman, Staff-Officer Jones and Captain Prowse and the band and they then marched to the Kingston St site.  After hymns and a prayer the Mayor, John Dunstan jnr, laid the stone.  He was glad the treatment of the ‘Army’ in Burra had lacked the violence and antagonism displayed elsewhere, at least to any great extent.  He then went on to deprecate the ‘despicable action of a certain section of the Clare people’.

Staff-Officer Jones spoke and said it was he who at Clare last Saturday had first been pelted with rotten eggs and then felled to the ground with a stone because he had belonged to the Salvation Army.  He would not have raised the matter had the Mayor not done so first.  He gloried that he was counted worthy to suffer for the Salvation Army and for the Lord Jesus Christ.

Major Thurman then replaced him on the stone and expressed his pleasure in seeing the foundation stone laid of their 12th barracks in SA.  There were now 42 stations and over 60 officers in SA and only 12 months ago there had been only 14 stations and 26 officers.

The procession then went on to the Recreation Ground to a large tent and a tea.  Weather threatened then with rain likely, but the crowd adjourned to Market Square where several hundred people stood for two hours around a wagon from which various visitors addressed them.  Thick clouds of wind-borne dust did not deter them.  We understand financial proceeds were satisfactory.
