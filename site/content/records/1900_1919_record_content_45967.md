Towards that they already had £400 in cash and Mr J.M. McBride had promised a donation of £150, while Messrs A.J. & Phil McBride had decided to give an ambulance complete.

Messrs Pearce Bros [sic, for Pearse] of ‘The Gums’ had promised to submit a 30 h.p. car to the authorities and if suitable would have it fitted up as an ambulance.  He thanked in particular Mr J.M. McBride: his name as a philanthropist was a household word throughout SA.  During the war Mr McBride had given: 	to the Belgian Fund	£3,600

	to the Serbian Fund	£2,750

	to the Salvation Army Field Service	£2,000

	to other funds 	smaller amounts

	Total	£10,900

To which another £1,000 would shortly be added.
