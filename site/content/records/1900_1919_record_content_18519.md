The Storm that passed through recently has given carpenters considerable work.  In one place the wind, being unable to lift the roof forced the ceiling in the front room to fall down, doing much damage to the furniture and destroying a large overmantel.  A house on Cemetery Flat, vacated only the day before, was unroofed and the covering carried a couple of hundred yards and placed against Mr Thomas Broadâ€™s residence.
