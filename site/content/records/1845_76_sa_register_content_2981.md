Supreme Court of SA, 2 November.

Case of Burr v. Beck [and the other Directors of the SA Mining Association]

Fisher appeared for Burra and Gwynne for the Directors.

Having had his contract terminated early, Burra was claiming £3,000 in compensation.

Fisher began by outlining the circumstances of Burr’s appointment as Superintendent of the Mine and those of his dismissal.  Burra had been Deputy Surveyor-General in SA when approached by Ayers on behalf of the Directors to relinquish that position and take on the post of Superintendent of the Mine for a minimum term of three years at £700 p.a.  If the term were not extended he would be entitled to £200 to cover the cost of returning to England, if he chose to do so within six months.  A letter of 31 August 1848 lists these arrangements as well as the company’s undertaking to have a suitable house erected and to pay for water and a fuel supply.  Free travel within the colony on necessary company business was also offered.

Burr’s acceptance, which also repeated the above conditions, was also presented.

Burra arrived at the Mine 10 September 1847 and improvements in the operation followed.  He was appointed a JP.  The Directors visited from time to time, but Mr Burra claimed no knowledge of the real cause of his abrupt dismissal.  The letter of dismissal was presented.

This letter accuses him of ‘want of attention in the cleaning and dressing of ores’.  It was on this that the Directors visited the mine.  The Directors complain that assays proved Burr had accepted ore and paid for it ‘at below the produce at which his instructions authorised him to receive it.’

This they said was the consequence of his careless assaying.  They had reason to fear that a similar discovery of the real value of ores already shipped would entail serious losses to the company and inconvenience.  The letter of dismissal said the Directors would visit the Mine on 14 September 1848 to accept his resignation or otherwise to carry out the decision of the Board.

On 13 September Messrs Beck, Kingston, Ellis and the Secretary arrived.  They refused to receive Burr or to explain the letter.  On the 14 September Mr Beck gave Burr one hour to resign or they would carry out the decision of the Board.  Burr refused to resign.

On 16 September Burra wrote to the Board demanding payment of £1,750 in breach of his contract.

This sum represented:

Two years’ salary	1,400

Two years’ house rental	100

Two years’ water and fuel	50

Passage to England	200

On 27 September Burra received notice that the SA Mining Association had paid £26-17-0 into his bank account as being the full balance due to him.  Burra declined to accept this as settlement.

Fisher believed he had established a breach of contract and it was not his job to prove the validity of the cause of the dismissal; that was up to the defendants.

He claimed of the jury £1,750 less the £26-17-0 already transferred, plus such damages as the jury may determine.

Henry Ayers gave evidence of knowing the defendants and of acting as their agent in writing letters etc. He outlined events leading to Mr Burr’s appointment.  Mr Stocks Jnr had been Resident Director from February 1846 (appointed in December 1845) to February 1847.  Mr Chipman had been appointed Superintendent in January 1847 and it was his letter of resignation that had led to the approaches to Mr Burr in August.

Ayers said he had signed the letter of 31 august on behalf of the Directors named in the margin – their names had been inserted there at Burr’s request so he would know with whom he was dealing: Cass, Beck, J.B. Graham, W. Peacock, J. Waterhouse, W. Paxton, S. Stocks Jnr, J. Brown, J. Ellis and W. Allen.

Gwynne argued for a non-suit, largely on legal technicalities.  When this failed, he then addressed the issue of the causes for the dismissal; alleging Burr’s failure to carry out his duties in the terms of the contract.

One of Mr Burr’s duties was to assay ores, and another duty was not to purchase ores under 20% copper, or of an average less than 25% (in the event of lower grade and higher grade ores being mixed in a parcel of ore).  He should see that the ores were properly dressed.  He had also to keep a diary of events at the Mine.  (Burr contended that the extensive correspondence with Ayers met this requirement.)  He also had to oversee the erection of cottages.

Burr had asked for the appointment of an assistant, Hoskins, to do the actual assaying.  The Directors had grown dissatisfied with Hoskins and decided he could not be recognised as an assayer for the Mine.

On 12 June 1848 samples of ore were sent to Adelaide for assaying and the Directors became convinced that something was very rotten in the management.  On a visit to the Mine the Directors had found six heaps of ore totalling 6,550 tons.  Six samples were taken and half of each was given to Mr Burra to assay and half sent to Adelaide.  This ore had already been bought on the basis of 38⅛% copper.
