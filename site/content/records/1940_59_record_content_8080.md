Letter.  Rex Opperman writes on behalf of himself and Ptes Dave Wooton, Bill Griffiths, Len [Lin] Jesser, Charles Jesser and Tom Allen.

After some two months in Palestine, they are now somewhere in Syria. They travelled over the battlefields where ‘our boys’ defeated the [Vichy] French forces.  The position where they were at present was quiet.  Winter was setting in, with snow falling nearby and they were glad of the parcels of woollens etc. from the ladies at home.  They got free issues of cigarettes and tobacco, which were appreciated.  Mail was getting through after a period when that was not the case.
