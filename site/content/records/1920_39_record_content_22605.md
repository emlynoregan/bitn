Anti-Prohibition Campaign

Rev. W. Heathcote spoke before a good audience on 3 March on why he opposed prohibition.  His visit was under the auspices of the Wine-growers’ Association.  The move would greatly decrease accommodation for travellers.  Fewer hotels would, he said, quite possibly increase drinking; six o’clock closing was expected to decrease it, but if anything business had increased.  He was in favour of temperance and self control.  He hated drunkenness. Sweden, Denmark and Canada had rejected prohibition after a trial.  No one can be made good by an Act of Parliament and forbidden fruit was always the sweetest.
