Mr G.S. Hawker has taken up the state of the Black Springs Road with the Minister of Local Government.  The Minister has placed the blame for the state of the road on the Local Councils.  The Burra Burra DC controls about 8 miles of it, the DC of Saddleworth some 2 miles and the DC of Robertstown 5Â½ miles.  The Commissioner of Highways claims enough funds have been provided for maintenance and crushed screening provided for the Burra Burra DC.  Nothing is said about easing dangerous curves, or that further loose gravel only increases the danger of skidding.  The Commissioner of Highways also blamed most accidents on excessive speed.  The road is notorious.
