The road north of Burra.

Mr John Drew chaired a meeting at Banks’ Assembly Room on 17 July to consider the state of this road.

Leading carriers, tradesmen, farmers and other interested parties attended.

Mr J.R. Stephens moved a motion calling on the Road Board for immediate action, without which the season’s traffic to the northeast would be virtually stopped.  He drew attention to the fact that the difficulties of travelling on the road had always been great, but were increasing as it was being fenced.  There were no parallel routes as in some other areas.  The land was also being rapidly settled, increasing its use.

Mr Harry Pinch seconded the motion.  Mr W.H .Williams supported it and Mr Tiver and Mr A. King also spoke for the motion.  Mr Williams said copper traffic from Boolcoomata Mine could add to the use of the road.

Captain Killicoat proposed a petition for £2,500 to be expended on the road.  He pointed out that Ulooloo could also generate more traffic.  Mr Rosman seconded the motion.  He said the low level of the Darling and Murrumbidgee this year would see traffic diverted to the road.  Burra Station had more than 5,000 tons out of it during the past year and more than that coming in.  He also referred to the sale of section by the Government and the rapidly expanding grain farming in the area.  The sections had sold for at least £1 an acre; he thought the average more like £1-10-0.  Some of this should come back to the district to maintain the road.  The request was quite moderate.  Mr Terry spoke in support.

Mr Lipsett then read the memorial addressed to the Road Board and the petition to be forwarded to the Members of the House of Assembly.  He moved adoption of the petition.  Seconded by Mr Lane and carried.
