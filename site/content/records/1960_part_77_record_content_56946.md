Meals on Wheels

A public meeting will be held on 12 July in the Town Hall to form a local branch of Meals on Wheels.  Members of the Methodist Women’s Fellowship have done the ground work in ascertaining the need for such a service and so far 10 elderly residents have been accepted as prospective clients.  Meals will be prepared at Burra Hospital and delivered to the homes of recipients by voluntary helpers five days a week.  Recipients will pay a small sum each week.  A good attendance at the meeting is needed to make the project a reality.
