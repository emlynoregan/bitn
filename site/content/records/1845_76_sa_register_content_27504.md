Kooringa, 28 March.

The weather continues dry and rain is needed for the continuation of ploughing.

The United Circus Co. gave performances before large and enthusiastic audiences on Friday and Saturday nights.

The district has been free from bush fires this season.

Valedictory Services were held at the Bible Christian Chapel on Sunday to farewell Rev. T. Hillman on the eve of his departure for Auburn.  After tea on Monday Mr W. Davey Jnr was given a purse containing 10 guineas, as a mark of respect for his valuable services in playing the harmonium and in other ways helping to sustain the efficiency of his fatherâ€™s singing class.
