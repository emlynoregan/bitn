Burra Town Council.

A letter from the Postmaster General said that a telephone line would be erected from Adelaide to Burra, but nor till next year as the copper wire had to be procured from England.

A.W. Clode is to have the right of grazing on the rubbish depot in Nelson for 10/- per annum.

I.J. Warnes was given permission to erect telephone poles to effect a connection with the exchange in Commercial St.

Larrikinism is causing concern in Kooringa and a letter will be sent to the Kooringa Police requesting action.

Stray horses and cattle are also a problem.

‘Council recommended that the Burra Hospital be connected with the doctors’ residences.’

[Presumably by telephone.]

The bridge near the Smelting Works is to be repaired.

Council will visit the cemetery on Thursday about the enclosing of the additional ground.
