Kooringa News, 3 July

Recently we have had cold, rain and snow.  Some of the residents enjoyed snowballing.  There had not been a fall for some years.

The 20 June was kept as a holiday and also 24 June as Midsummer Day in England, but as it fell on Saturday the storekeepers kept Monday as a holiday.  The customary salute was fired at the Mine on Saturday.

Business has been greatly depressed of late and several businessmen have had to call their creditors together.

The usual half-yearly examination at the Grammar School took place on 23 June. J. Shortridge was the top scorer for the half-year and he also won the master’s prize for good conduct.  Second was R. Young and then H. Birbeck, F. Cowper, A. Stanbury, W. Thomas, C. Stanton and F. Furniss.

The Melbourne company has commenced operations at the mine at Hallett’s Hill by getting tools and other items ready.

The Wesleyan Sunday School pupils made a presentation last week to their Superintendent Mr Charles Drew prior to him and his brother leaving for Moonta.
