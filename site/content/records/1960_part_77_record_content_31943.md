Straying Stock remains a problem both in the township and the district.  On Saturday evening a vehicle driven by Mr Harold Moxham of Burra North struck two sheep and a lamb about a mile beyond the ‘Baldina’ turn-off on the Eastern Road.  Two of the sheep were killed and the other had to be destroyed later.
