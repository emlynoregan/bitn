The Cullens have finally farewelled the Eastern Mail Run after three generations.  Grandfather Lance Cullen handed the run to his son Henry and for the last ten years every Friday morning his son Rod and brother Peter have undertaken the run.  The lease comes up for renewal every five years and after 47 years the run from 1 July will be taken by Andrew and Penny Shepley.  The run starts at the Burra Post Office and then collects items from Burra shops before heading east.  It takes from 8 a.m. to about 5 p.m.  You have to know where you are going and in wet conditions could easily get lost if unfamiliar with the route.  There are two routes and the Cullens went one way one week and the other the following week, so that a person would get deliveries early in the day one week and late the alternate week.  Rod and Peter will continue delivery work, running trucks and will wait till the lease again comes up in five yearsâ€™ time.
