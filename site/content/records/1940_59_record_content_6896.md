Sgt Tom Halls

He writes from Libya 8 July.  He says his present accommodation was a sandbag ‘igloo’ with an entrance so low that he leave the skin off his back on it on entry.  The days were hot and the nights cold and the flies a torment as usual.  They had lost their Platoon Commander a couple of months ago and Tom had been acting in that role.  He thanks all for various items sent to him.
