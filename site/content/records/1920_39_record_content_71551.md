Burra Town Council 4 July

Burra Electric Supply Co. reports that alterations and installations of streetlights have been carried out as ordered.

Burra Institute Committee writes formally proposing that the Council takes over the Institute.  The balance sheet of the Institute was enclosed.  The only cash involved would be the transfer fees.

Council decided any decision about taking over the Institute will require ratepayer approval and consequently a meeting of ratepayers has been called for 21 July in the Institute.

Cr Dow said ‘that as far a was known the Trustees were not going to carry on with it any longer and someone would have to take it over.  The onus of deciding should be left entirely with the ratepayers.’

R.C. Leggett of Adelaide was given permission to erect a residence in Graham St.

There was a discussion concerning trees in various places.

A move to level the old area of the cemetery (but leaving the headstones intact) was lost for want of a seconder.
