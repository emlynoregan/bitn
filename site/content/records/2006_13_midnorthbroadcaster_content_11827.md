Burra Visitor Information Centre

Following an unforseen shortfall in funds the BVIC committee recently approached the Goyder Council for $35,000 assistance.  Council last week voted to provide $12,000 from the ward fund.  Cr Gill thinks any further funding is unlikely to come from Council’s general funds and the source may have to be through the Unique Services Rating Philosophy.  The problem seems to have arisen from a combination of unique circumstances and a lack of adequately detailed financial reporting.  A turnover of staff had used up accumulated reserves along with funding withdrawn for the SA Tourism Commission.  Council normally provides $42,000 per annum and rent free offices.  Other funds come from the Centre itself, including sales of the Burra Passport and accommodation.  The public is being asked to register its support and there have been economies made by some reduction in hours of operation and staff.  Mr Edson of BRTBA, which has been running the centre for the last eight years, said running costs were c. $160,000 p.a.  It is vital that there be a one-off rescue package and that the centre continue to operate.  The $12,000 provided so far will allow the centre to operate to mid March.  Each year the centre services some 27,000 visitors, with about half coming from interstate and overseas.  It handles about $260,000 worth of accommodation bookings as well as tickets for major local events.  Sales of the Burra Passport bring in $110,000 annually.  This is passed on to the National Trust and Council.  The latter’s share amounts to c. $40,000 – not far short of the Council’s annual contribution to the BVIC.  This is the first time since BRTBA took over that they have asked the Council for help.
