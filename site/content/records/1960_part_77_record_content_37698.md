Burra High School held its Speech Night at Burra Town Hall last Tuesday night and drew a near capacity crowd.  The guest speaker was John Freebairn MP.  Prizes were presented by Miss Clare Freebairn, sister of the guest speaker.  Certificates and trophies were presented by the Mayor & Mayoress Mr & Mrs E.T. Baulderstone.

The Headmaster’s Report will appear in a later paper.  The annual swimming carnival was postponed from Term 1 and was held on 8 December.  [Results are printed.]

The end of the year social was held in the RSL Hall on Thursday evening with music supplied by Mr Darrell Field and from recordings.  Father Christmas paid a visit.
