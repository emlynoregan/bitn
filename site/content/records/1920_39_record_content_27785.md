Sheep stealing is reported to be a serious problem in the Eastern Pastoral Country generally.  One owner recently claims to have lost 200-300 sheep and complained of little action or interest from police.  In addition to large scale theft a good many trollies going through remove a sheep or two en route.  One fellow with a trolly had a pen, disguised as a load of wood, which would hold 2-3 sheep.  A motion was carried to get the executive to take up the matter with the Commissioner of Police.
