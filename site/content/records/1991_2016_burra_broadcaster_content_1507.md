Burra Burra DC

There will be further negotiations concerning a possible median strip in Commercial Street.  This option is being investigated in response to difficulties some pedestrians have in crossing due to traffic and reversing cars.

The Council has agreed to a joint use agreement with the Minister of Education for the proposed new swimming pool.

This includes an annual $5,000 from the Education Department towards the employment of staff.

Tenders are expected to be called by SACON this weekend for the construction of the pool and kiosk on a site adjacent to the school gymnasium.

Cemetery leases.  It has been decided not to cancel leases after the 25 year expiry date.  The importance placed upon the historic value of cemeteries and the ample space of the rural areas gives reason not to restrict the length of the leases.

Council is concerned over damage to local clayback and stone roads done by heavy vehicles in wet weather.  The Council urges users to look after these roads.
