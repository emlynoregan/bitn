Burra SES has taken delivery of their replacement light rescue vehicle.  It is a second hand 4WD Toyota troop carrier, which is able to transport seven crew and their equipment as well as to tow a trailer.  Of the $6,300 cost, half was paid by the Burra Burra DC and half by an SES subsidy.  It replaces a 10-year-old Land Cruiser, which had extensive rust and other problems.
