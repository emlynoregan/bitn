Burra Town Council

The Burra North Badminton Club was granted use of the Town Hall for the season under the same conditions as last year.

RSL invites the Council to the Anzac Commemoration Service at the War Memorial on Sunday 26 April.  Offer accepted.

A report said that a fire escaped while rubbish was being burnt at the cemetery and caused the damage previously noted.  Drums will be provided for rubbish at the cemetery.

An offer from the Burra Football Club of Â£4-4-0 for the use of the Memorial Oval for the season was accepted after discussion.
