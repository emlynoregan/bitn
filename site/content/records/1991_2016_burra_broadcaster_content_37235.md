Market Square & Best Place Redevelopment Plans

The master plan concepts for this redevelopment were adopted by Council in September 2004 and now the final plans are on display in the Council Foyer.  The plans were the outcome of investigation and community consultation by Hames Sharley, a firm of consultants.

The project was jointly funded by Council and Planning SA through the Places for People Program that aims to assist communities in developing and implementing attractive and safe local activity centres.  Kelly Brown & Root Pty Ltd has now been contracted to implement the second stage of the project.  This will see the master plan developed into final engineering design plans as the basis for actual work.
