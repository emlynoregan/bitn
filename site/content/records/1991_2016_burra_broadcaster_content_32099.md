Burra Pool.  There is serious doubt that the Burra Pool will open this year.  The existing pool coating has failed and tenders have been called for tiling the pool.  There is also an issue with the Department of Education, Training and Employment in finalising the Joint-Use Agreement with the Council.  This should have been resolved soon after the construction of the pool in 1993.  Council has resolved not to accept any tender until Council has ownership of the pool and the Joint-Use Agreement has been agreed upon.  The swimming season normally starts on 4 November.
