Mr W.F. Johns, formerly a Burra grazier at ‘Studholme’, has designed a special motor cycle for terrain and cross-country areas and for slow tedious mustering duties.  Produced by the Nippon Gakki Co. Ltd of Japan, they were introduced to SA stock firms last week and were demonstrated in Adelaide.  Mr Johns said the idea came to him when attending to sheep on ‘Studholme’ on unsuitable machines.  He had a knowledge of military vehicles, gained during the war.  Nippon Gakki were prepared to build machines for testing before getting larger orders.  The result is the Liberty Yamaha Ranch Model with high clearance mudguards, upswept exhaust pipes to avoid rocks etc. duplex reinforced frame and heavy duty suspension front and rear in telescopic assembly and five gears, allowing extensive use at low speeds.  Dalgety’s are the distributors.
