Burra Ambulance Volunteers Tony Eldredge & Annette Spackman have been selected to pursue paramedic careers in regional areas.  They will work full-time at a new station while completing the paramedic degree.  Mr Eldredge will move to Waikerie and Mrs Spackman to Whyalla for the five year program.  The program is an initiative aimed at rural people because it has always proved difficult to get qualified university graduates to move to the country.

The move means there is a call for more volunteers now in Burra.  Rosemary Opperman recently received a long service medal after volunteering for the ambulance for almost 27 years.
