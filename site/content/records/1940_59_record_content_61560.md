Redruth Coronation Spring Fair raised c. £240, which is up somewhat on last year.  It was held at the Redruth Memorial Hall on 28 November.

[Personal interest: Mrs M. Satchell sang a solo For England at the opening and in the evening concert she sang a duet with C. Christopher.

Mrs R. Fuss was on the cake stall and the Misses Joyce and Joan Fairchild were on children’s dips.]
