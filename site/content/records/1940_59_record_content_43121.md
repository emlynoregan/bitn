The Town Hall.  Despite a tentative loan agreement having been drawn up by the Savings Bank and agreed by the Council, the Bank has now advised that the present mortgage on the Town Hall would have to be discharged according to the Library and Institute Act before the Bank could loan the money on the security of the General Rate.  The matter will lie on the table till the next meeting of Council.
