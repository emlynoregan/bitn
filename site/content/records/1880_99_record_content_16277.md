Burra Town Council, 17 January.

Cr Ridgway moved that auction and other sales of horses, cattle etc. be prohibited except in places duly licensed under the Corporations Act of 1880.  This was, he said, in the interests of public safety.  Not seconded.

It was resolved on Cr Sampson’s motion that where the ward boundary was the middle of the road, the road expenses would be shared, but footpath and other expenses would be attributed to the ward in which they were actually incurred.

Cr Coglin introduced the idea of a fire brigade, but this matter is to stand over.

Waterworks Committee Report

There has been an interview with the engineer, Mr Jobson.  Before the work can vest in the council the Governor would have to proclaim such in the SA Government Gazette.  The Town Clerk is to communicate with the Government on the matter.

A large number of extensions have been made and the engineer consented to lay down a second pump should the one ordered prove insufficient.  Arrangements for troughs are needed and the Committee recommends:

The Market Square troughs remain as at present with the standpipe to be abolished and a new one connected to the waterworks to be installed.  [The existing troughs and standpipe were served by the Market Square pump.]

The standpipe and troughs to remain in Aberdeen and the troughs to be fitted with lockable covers and the railway station troughs to be similarly treated.

Charges to be 3/- per 1,000 gallons for persons willing to rent the standpipes or troughs except the Market Square trough.  The condition being that the contractors charge the public 6/- per 1,000 gallons and ½d per head per use for cattle or horses.

Arrangements have been made to move the water-rating year so it begins on 1 January.

Cr Sampson asked if the Market Square pump was to be removed.  The Mayor said it would stay and the trough can continue to be used as at present.

Cr Coglin moved the dayman for East and West Wards be paid 6d more per day to come into line with the one in North Ward.  The other Councillors thought he should be paid what he tendered for and the motion lapsed.

Cr Ridgway pointed out that the police constable in Redruth had been away for six months and yet they were being charged the police moiety for his services.  He moved the Government be written to on the subject.

The curator of the cemetery reported that the woodwork of the mortuary chapel needed painting and the wall in places needed pointing.
