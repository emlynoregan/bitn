Farrell Flat Telephone Exchange

For almost every hour of the day for the last 15 years Reg & Pauline Rattley have staffed the switchboard of the manual telephone exchange at Farrell Flat.  Pauline has been a telephonist for 50 years with her longest stay being at Farrell Flat.  Last Wednesday at 10.00 a.m. as Pauline sat at the switchboard suddenly all the shutters fell and remained still.  The exchange had become automatic.  The Rattleys can now become local people again and regain a private life with a chance to join in community activities.  On Wednesday evening 200 people gathered at a barbecue at the Farrell Flat Hall to say a hearty thank you for Reg & Paulineâ€™s services and friendship.  A presentation was made of flowers and a bottle of whisky along with well-wishing cards from schoolchildren.  There was also a presentation of a pendulum wall clock and a large suitcase.  The Rattleys will continue their post office service.
