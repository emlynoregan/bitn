Souvenir of the War.

A large meeting of the combined Patriotic Committees was held in the Council Chamber on Thursday to consider a souvenir book of the war.  Mr Crewes couldn’t see how anything could be done till the war was over.  The cost was also a problem.  He thought that with illustrations it would be c. £100.  Cr Lane was strongly for the project.

E.J. Harris said it was necessary to gather the information for the publication as the war went on.

Cr Radford said if anything were premature the monument was.  He thought there ought to be a committee to gather information and photos with the idea of publishing when the time came.  He believed it would pay for itself.

A motion to collect information and prepare for publication at the end of the war was passed.  A committee of seven was elected comprising the Mayor and Messrs Page, Marston, Winnall, Johnson, & Crs Lane and Radford.  Mr Page to be secretary.
