Advertisement.  SA Mining Association, Burra Burra Mines, Survey Day

The Directors will offer by public survey at the Mine on Thursday 8 inst. The shallow tribute pitches to expire on 2 January 1853.  [This canâ€™t be right.  Neither the 8 November nor December was on a Thursday.  Presumably Wednesday 8 December.]  Henry Ayers, Secretary, Adelaide, 11 November 1852.
