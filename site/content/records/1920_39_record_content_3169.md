Mallett.  There is a report of a trip in Mr Maurice Collins’ 6-cylinder Buick to Mallett Station.  The description goes from Burra to ‘Lucernedale’ at Mt Bryan, Mt Bryan East, Dare’s Hill, (where the wallabies, once plentiful, have been practically wiped out by foxes) then to Mallett past Pitty Mitty Appa [sic – for Piltimitiappa] and finally to Collinsville.  At Mallett there was an orchard of apricots, nectarines, pears, figs, apples, grapes and mulberries.
