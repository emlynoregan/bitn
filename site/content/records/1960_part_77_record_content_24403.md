CWA.  The Country Woman of the Year Quest climaxed with a Ball at Wonderland Ballroom in Adelaide.  Some 1,300 attended.  Floral decorations were magnificent.  Sir Edric and Lady Bastyan attended and group winners were presented to the Governor.  The winner was Mrs B. Spilsbury from the Hindmarsh Valley Branch.  All other 24 finalists will travel by bus to Canberra and the Snowy Mountains, while the winner goes to the North Island of New Zealand for a week and gets a Â£100 wardrobe from John Martins.
