Fire.  Saturday, between 11.30 p.m. and midnight, M-C Queale noticed a fire in Messrs Walker & Sons Market Square shop.  Straw and boxes were on fire in a shed at the rear.  The burning mass was dragged away from the stone shop by Mr Harrap and Mr J. Allen who was in his office in the same building.  The fire was extinguished and people went home when the alarm was again sounded.  (The Methodist Church bell.)  Just before going home Luke Day decided to take some things inside and he found fire in a room in which linoleum and matting had been stored.  Embers from the original fire seem to have blown under the door and ignited packing straw.  Some £20-£30 damage was done.
