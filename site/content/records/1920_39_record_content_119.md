Christmas

Christmas Eve was wet in the morning and well into the afternoon and a heavy fall began at 6.30 p.m., but failed to deter the crowds in the streets.  The fall totalled 86 points.  Good business was done and the Burra Brass Band toured Kooringa & Aberdeen till dawn playing carols.

Christmas Day was fresh and spring-like and many young people left by the afternoon train for the city, leaving the town quiet for the week.

Friday & Saturday saw another 70 points fall and the Redruth Sunday School picnic was postponed to Monday.  There were sports at Aberdeen on New Year’s Day.

The rains have been uneven, but widespread to the east varying from 66 points at Caroona through 180 at Baldina and 46 at Sturt Vale.  But Old Koomooloo scored 4.63” and Koomooloo 3.50”.

Mr & Mrs R.T. Hitchcox and family were farewelled from the Kooringa Methodist Church on 28 December as they are leaving the town.  Mr Hitchcox has been a local preacher and Sunday school teacher.
