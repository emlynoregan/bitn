Silver Discovery at World’s End.  A Moonta syndicate has found silver c. 28 miles from Burra.  A sample has assayed at 1,000 oz to the ton of ore. [This was corrected to 504 oz in VII, 497, 1 December 1885, page 2.]  At the place 14 claims have been taken up and several of them have strong indications of silver.  Messrs Manning, Warne & Roach however, do not like the nature of the country, which is not promising for the continuance of the lode at depth.
