Burra Hospital

The architect, Dean Berry, has visited and examined the possibilities for renovation and additions.  His view is that it would be most economical to make additions to the present Maternity Wing.  Demolition of the old building would cost considerable money and yield little in salvage.  It is at a different level from the main building and expensive excavations would be needed to place a new building on the old site at one level with the main building.  It would also be below ground level – not a good building practice.  He felt the additional wards should be added to the present Maternity Wing.  This and the Maternity Wing would form a TVV shaped building. [Sic.]

The front of the new section would face north and be of two storeys, running back south into a single storey building.  The new front section would be administrative offices etc. and form the front entrance.  Foundations would be of concrete and the building made of cement blocks made on site.  To build in stone was impossible – stone masons were unprocurable.  The present hospital could be used to accommodate the nursing staff and the Isolation Block used to accommodate the domestic staff.  Mr Berry will make a rough sketch of his proposal for presentation to the Chief Secretary.
