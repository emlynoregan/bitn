2nd Leader on the charges for water in Burra: specifically on the idea raised in Council that would allow the unused allowance from the July to December half to be taken up in the January to June half following.  The Mayor claimed he ‘could not see the drift of the motion and could not see any advantage to the ratepayers’.  The editor implies this is nonsense.  Councillors O’Leary and Sampson did their best to counter the views of the majority and their claim that either the suggested change was unnecessary or, if attempted, could not be carried out, seem unbelievable to the editor.

Mr W.H. Hardy, then Councillor for East Ward, had suggested the change last November, so it is not new.  The editor then gives an example.

If a person is rated at 25/- a year he must pay 12/6 each six months in advance, which entitles him to 2,500 gallons before any excess is charged, but in the time of year when tanks are full he may not require any.  Under the old plan if a man entitled to 5,000 gallons uses only 1,000 in the first half and 4,000 in the second he would be charged for 1,500 gallons excess which we hold to be unfair.
