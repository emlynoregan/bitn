The annual show on 9 October was held in perfect weather and drew a big crowd.  It was followed by a well-attended Gala Night.  The show was opened by The Hon. A.W. Christian, Minister of Agriculture.  A notable improvement in the flower pavilion was the installation of permanent tables by the show’s staunch supporter Mr R. Fuss, who gave generously of his time.  F.M. Pearce & Son painted the ceiling of the luncheon room, free of charge, and the Rural Youth Club painted the walls.  Entries were down slightly, but quality was good.  Bird entries were up with no less than 720, of which 329 were pigeons.  ‘Horses in Action’ was well supported.  Industrial exhibits were numerous, but sheep entries were disappointing in numbers.  During the year Mr H.L. Foote resigned as Secretary and was replaced by Mr E.S. Williams, who helped see through a successful show before being forced to resign in December due to ill health.  Mr T.G. Perry was appointed in his place.  The death of active supporters is always unfortunate and this year we record the passing of Messrs Edgar Pearce, W. Pettet, H. Thompson and J. Parker.  The membership stands at a gratifying 300.  Financially we have reduced the debit balance from £112 to £19.
