Suspension of Mr Lang

We understand the reports of the behaviour of Mr Lang at the Burra on a recent occasion are substantially true.  Apparently he has taken it into his head that ‘once a king always a king’.  When he found a notice affixed to the Court-House door at Kooringa bearing Mr Dashwood’s signature as returning officer, he tore it down and even threatened to give Mr Dashwood in charge if he presented himself to exercise the duties of the office forfeited by Mr Lang when he put himself forward as a candidate for legislative honours.  We are also informed that the Governor and Executive Council have forwarded to the Burra several documents and the opinions of Law Officers of the Crown, respecting various irregularities committed by Mr Lang in his position as Resident Magistrate, in some of which he has, it appears, laid himself open to indictment, and the Governor and Council have required him to go to Adelaide to make such explanation as he can, and failing to do so have indicated that he will be suspended from office during Her Majesty’s pleasure.

Mr Dashwood will act as Returning Officer and will act for Mr Lang pending the investigation that has been ordered.
