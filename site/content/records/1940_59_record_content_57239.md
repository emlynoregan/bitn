Burra Town Council, 15 December

The General Manager of ETSA offered to meet the Council on 12 December at his office, or if inconvenient on a date to be fixed in January.  A meeting has been arranged for 8 January with the Mayor, Cr Baulderstone and the Town Clerk to represent the Council.

The LTO advises it requires the Recreation Ground (Victoria Park) to be brought under the Real Property Act.

Burra School complains of damage caused by straying sheep to trees planted near the school.  The owner is to be advised and warned that action will be taken to recover damages if it is repeated.

The Town Clerk advised that William Eddy Young was the only nomination for Councillor for West Ward for the term to expire on 1 Saturday in July 1954 and he was therefore duly elected.
