North Ward had to maintain the Station Road and the one from the racecourse along which all the wheat came.  The road in front of the Redruth Memorial Hall was a disgrace.  They needed proper plant and they had horses which no one would take for their hides.  The Council needed new blood.

The value of the houses and property had shrunk 25 to 50% and he wanted a cut in rates.  He knew a house which cost £400 rated at £900.

The Mayor said no work in North Ward was put up to Committee except by a North Ward Councillor and he denied either unfairness or ill-will.  Cr Woollacott was hard of hearing which had led to misunderstandings.
