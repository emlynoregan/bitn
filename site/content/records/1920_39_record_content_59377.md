New Year’s Eve in Burra was very quiet.  Not a bell was rung or a gun fired, nor any singing or other noise in the street.  We hear on all sides that the rising generation is worse than the previous, but we do not think so when we remember past New Year Eves, when gates were lifted off their hinges, outhouses were overturned and black-paint would be splashed all over every object with the figures of the coming year displayed.  Cows and horses would be let out of their yards, the latter often with a tin tied to its tail.  Watchnight services would be interrupted by the ringing of bells and the discharge of guns.
