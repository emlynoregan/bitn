Terowie Citizens’ Association has completed a project working on its collection of c. 1,500 historic photos.  They have been cleaned and stored in an acid free and stable environment.  A start has been made on identifying them all and copying the most significant and the most fragile.  The program was enabled by a grant of $4,000 from the National Library and $3,000 from the Association’s resources along with more than 700 hours of voluntary labour.
