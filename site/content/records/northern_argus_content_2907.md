Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizer employees at Burra were told last Thursday they had won the Directorsâ€™ Safety Pennant & Award for the seventh consecutive year with over 800 days of injury free activity now.  A cheque for $500 was given, to be donated to a chosen charity.  For 1987 the staff chose the Burra SES and Andrew McInnes accepted the cheque on their behalf.  The money will help to set up the new radio room at the goods shed area, part of which is being refurbished as SES quarters.

The managing director of A & W F Ian Gemmell said the plant at Burra had provided 16% more copper oxide in the last few months and of outstanding quality.  Large quantities of manganous oxide had also been produced.  The company will soon be mining copper ore from Mt Gunson, ensuring a more consistent supply of raw materials.
