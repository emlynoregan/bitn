National Youth Week begins this week on 5 April and the Burra Youth Advisory Committee is hosting a local event launch featuring a program of fun activities at the Burra Pool.  The pool will be closed to swimmers, but there will be face painting, a bouncy castle, mini golf and the Adelaide Ballzup; an aqua ball that allows funsters to play on the water without getting wet.
