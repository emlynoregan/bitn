Land Sales.  There was a rush to buy land subdivided from the South Booborowie Estate when it was offered for sale at the Burra Institute last Friday.  2,847 acres were sold.  It has been reported that further portions of the estate between Leighton and Spalding will soon also be offered.  The small entry charge raised £8 and Mr Brown of Booborowie offered to match this sum, so that Burra Hospital will benefit by £16.  [Details of the purchasers are printed.]
