The General Fund was in credit £56-8-7.  The Benevolent Fund was in credit £33-15-9.

[The latter paid medical and doctors’ fees for players.]

In the last year the Benevolent Fund paid out £44-6-6 for injuries in the 1950 season and £50-7-10 for injuries in the 1951 season.  A private collection for Dean Bernhardt, when he broke his leg, raised £42.  Gate receipts brought in £125-14-6 and subscriptions £91-18-6 (for both funds) of which one sixth or £15 went to the Benevolent Fund.  Elected were: Chairman, R.A. Bevan; Secretary, R.W. Chambers; Assistant Secretary, E.J. Lehmann and Patron, K.J. Murphy.  Admission fees will have to rise to 2/- and cars 1/- (the car fee was amended to 6d in the next issue.)  The cost of footballs was up by £2 each and 12 were used in a season.
