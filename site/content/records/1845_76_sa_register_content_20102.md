[A long list encompasses building in the colony for the previous year.  Burra’s part has been extracted.]

A church has been erected at Kooringa for the Catholics in the Norman style, oblong in form and capable of affording accommodation to a large number of persons.

[This is interesting because there seems to be no other reference to this building.  A summary of the Catholic presence in the town made in 1905 gives the following outline:

Burra Record VX, 697, 11 Oct. 1905, Page 4

8 February 1857	St Joseph’s school-church opened in Commercial St

1870	Sisters of St Joseph took over the school

8 November 1874	Present St Joseph’s opened

1881	Old school & house sold to Hon. John Lewis: new convent & school erected

1885		St Joseph’s [presbytery] built by Father O’Dowling.]
