Feed was abundant here, especially in the gullies.  The north arm of the fire swept the paddocks in front of Copperhouse, separated from it by only the road.  With almost all the men away fighting the fire, another arm came over the Flagstaff Hills and in 10 minutes from the hill had reached Copperhouse â€“ about three miles.  Residents were almost smothered in the smoke.  They managed to save all the livestock except the poultry.  The shifting wind meant that the town had three visitations.  Mr J. Nickles lost a binder and all his grass, fencing, poultry and a chaff-cutter, but miraculously a haystack survived.
