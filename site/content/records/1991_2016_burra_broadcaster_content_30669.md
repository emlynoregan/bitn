The Burra Hospital Auxiliary has been fundraising recently and a charity auction at the Hospital on 28 March raised c. $900.  The Auxiliary is planning its garden party at the beautiful Princess Royal for 13 April.  The funds will go towards furbishing [sic] the hostel units presently under construction.

[Since furbishing means renovating, furnishing would be more apt.]
