Wind Farm Appeal Upheld

Bill Quinn of Mt Bryan has won an appeal against the Environment, Resources and Development Court’s approval of AGL’s Hallett Stage 3 Wind Farm.  The court found that the wind turbines owned by AGL, and operating at Hallett 2 Wind Development are currently incapable of satisfying current SA EPA guidelines.  The appeal also challenged the SA EPA Wind Farm Noise Guidelines on the grounds that they do not adequately protect human health.  There was, however, no determination of the merits of any of the grounds of the appeal.

A resident neighbouring the Hallett Hill Wind Farm (Hallett 2) has brought a noise complaint to AGL.  The company has investigated the matter and preliminary results of tests have reported some audible tones under certain conditions.  Upon becoming aware of this tonality issue in December 2010 AGL shut down a number of turbines in proximity to the residence.  Sixteen of the 34 turbines are currently shut down at night.  The company has been working with the supplier of the turbines to rectify the fault.  The supplier has developed a permanent acoustic treatment to address the tonality issue, but until this permanent acoustic treatment can be implemented Hallett 2 will operate with 16 turbines shut down at night between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.
