St Catherine’s Anglican Church at Hallett was formally closed last Sunday.  It had been unused for several years.  About 50 people attended the final service.  The church was opened and consecrated in 1957 by the late Bishop of Adelaide the Rt Rev. Dr T.T. Reed and dedicated to St Catherine of Sienna.  [See Burra Record 11 June 1957, page 7and 17 Sep. 1957, page 1.]  The unusual shape of the building won awards.  Sunday’s service was conducted by the Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill, assisted by Geraldine Smedley of Burra.  Mary Shattock played the organ.  Having been sold, the building was deconsecrated and secularised.  Jan Tiver read the Declaration of Secularisation.  [2photos]
