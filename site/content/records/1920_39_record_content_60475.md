Kooringa Football Club held its AGM at the Fire Station on 17 March.  R.A. Bevan took the chair.  After discussion about the rather unsatisfactory end to last season it was decided that the club should go into recess for twelve months and that a new Association known as the Kooringa and Aberdeen Association should be formed.  This would have the benefit of assuring a game in the town each weekend and removed the expenses associated with away games.  A public meeting to consider forming the above association has been called for next Tuesday evening, 31 March, at the Fire Station.
