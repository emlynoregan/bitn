Kooringa storekeepers are grumbling at the cost of cartage, which at present is £5-£6 per ton.  Some of the goods are two months on the road and get spoiled.  Small parcel costs are outrageous.  One small parcel not over six inches long cost 5/- and one man refused to take delivery of a small parcel because of the cost.  A railway is sorely needed.
