In one week donations of £510 were collected to enable consecration to proceed.  The consecration will be followed by Holy Communion and then luncheon and Evensong at 3 p.m. with Rev. L.R. Lenthall of Burra (also in charge of Hallett) as the preacher.  St Mary’s Burra Choir and organist will attend.
