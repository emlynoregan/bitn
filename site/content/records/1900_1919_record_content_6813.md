Redruth Methodist Sunday School Anniversary.  The Rev. Alfred H. Carne of Terowie preached and gave the connective readings for the service of song, Only a Waif.  The picnic at Koonoona on Monday 10 November was largely attended.  The amusements were efficiently directed by Mr C. Fuss who has rendered a like service for several years.  The dust storm on Wednesday 12 November seriously reduced attendance at the tea and public meeting where J. Tiver JP presided.  Scholars number 92 boys and 81 girls (173) with an average attendance of 39 in the mornings and 109 in the afternoon.  The annual teachersâ€™ social took place in Jubilee Hall on 13 November.
