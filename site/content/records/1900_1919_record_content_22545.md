Mr Robert Fuss writes complaining that in three cases prizes were awarded at the Burra Show when the pots containing plants exceeded the 7” diameter allowed.  The secretary disallowed a written protest.  Even more concerning, he says, was the taking of a plant of his from a collection of six to make a third in another person’s exhibit in the three-plant section.  And ‘to finish up this bungling I was awarded a prize for six plants with only five showing.’
