Burra Mine

A meeting in connection with the unemployment scheme was held on 10 February.  The mayor presided.  The secretary Mr A.L. Walker read a report from the Inspector of Mines & Quarries Mr H.S. Cornelius following his inspection of 13 January.  30 men were then working, principally on the eastern bank of the open cut be short drives, shallow sinking or open cut.  This area has settled since mining ceased, by 15 to 30 ft.  The ground is marl and grey limestone over soft blue grey slaty shales.  The shales are impregnated with blue and green carbonates mostly in the form of small rounded nodules locally known as blue balls.  The ground is soft and hard to work and near the water level is saturated and the only safe method is to remove overburden and cut down the face in benches.  The nodules are sparsely scattered and range in size from ½” to 3” in diameter and while easily picked out, large quantities of material have to be handled.

At the southwest side a few men are breaking some harder material in which some green carbonate and oxide is found.  In 2-3 weeks they have produced only about 1⅓ cwt per man of ore.  More co-operative work would increase output.

The miners say the richest parts of the crushed ground are near or below water level.  Pumping has not been seriously considered, because in 1901 the Burra Electro-Magnetic Separation Works drained the mine and made an examination.  They concluded that no payable ore bodies to justify operations could be found.  Concerning the disposal of ore the latest offer from Francis H. Snow Pty Ltd for tributers’ ore from Moonta Mines and the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Co.’s Pt Kembla USW tariff was explained to the men and a copy left with Mr Walker.

From work done and the appearance of the available ground it does not seem likely the men will be able to raise sufficient ore to make a living wage.  At £44 a ton for copper there are £30 realisation charges, 20% ore would yield 56/- a ton at the mine and men would have to produce 5 cwt a man per day to get 14/- a day.

The assay report was much more promising than the comments of the Inspector has suggested.

Mr March said the assay was encouragement to go on.

The Chairman said the Inspector’s comments on output were wrong, as after working eight days the men had Christmas off and in fact only eleven men stuck to the job for three weeks; not the thirty stated.

Mr Kellaway asked where the Inspector got the idea the mine had been drained.  The pool had never been drained and in fact it went to a higher level after the pumping and he had never seen it lower than at present.

Mr Jos. Rosewall also said it had never been drained.

Mr Kellaway said at present the men could not earn their food on what they were getting if they had not been getting rations.  What was the Government going to do for them?

Mr March moved the secretary reply to the Inspector’s letter correcting any errors and enclosing the results of the assay.

The Chairman said he had been told the Premier hoped soon to visit Burra.

Almost all the men voted to go back to the mine in view of the assay results.
