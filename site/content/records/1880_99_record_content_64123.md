‘Democrat’ writes with reasons for voting ‘No’ to federation.  He is mainly concerned with the powers of the Governor General.  These are sufficient to overrule responsible government and will be subject to British Colonial Office instructions.  In a strong man the powers could be used to facilitate jobs, thwart the will of the people, and subvert liberties, especially if the Governor General ‘were out of sympathy with, say a Labor Ministry (in the very distant future).’  He has command of the army and could act without the local Parliament if the Home Government was prepared to back him.  Consider the possibility of an Australian Rhodes!
