Anzac Sports have been fixed for 2 May.  Total prize money is Â£120.  Following the accident last year it has been decided not to have amateur motor cycle races.  There will be professional motor cycle races.  Military events will be open to returned servicemen and members of the CMF.  The Lynch Draught Horse Race will be run and there will be a dance in the evening.
