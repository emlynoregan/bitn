Hallett Australia Day Events.  Peter Boaden was Citizen of the Year for his tireless efforts as Council CEO as well as for his work as Secretary of the Swimming Pool, Hallett Fire Brigade, Community Development Board and the Sir Hubert Wilkins Memorial Committee.

The Event of the Year was the Terowie CWA’s ‘Una Bowden Art Show’. 

Hallett District Council held an event last Friday night to celebrate 64 years of existence – the last function for the Council before next week’s commencement of the Regional Council of Goyder.
