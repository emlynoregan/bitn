Burra Town Council.

The Postmaster-General reports that there are no lines available for a telephone to Burra from Adelaide, but possibly provision could be made next year to connect Petersburg and Adelaide and Kooringa could be given access on that wire.

Dayman J. Harvey caught one of the sons of Alfred Allen and a son of D.R. Jones of Millerton, pulling down stones from the Victoria Park wall.  Parents have agreed to pay for the repairs.  Lads are warned that a repeat will mean prosecution.
