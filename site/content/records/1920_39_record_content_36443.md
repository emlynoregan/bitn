Wheat.  [A meeting at Booborowie is indicative of ongoing discussions for some time concerning the plight of wheat farmers whose costs of production, estimated by many at c. 4/- a bushel, were higher than the selling price.]

A meeting to discuss the question of wheat production was called at Booborowie Hall for 15 December by the Chairman of the Booborowie DC.

Chairman T.J. Wedding introduced Mr A.D. McDonald who discussed the implications of unpegging the exchange rate of the Australian pound.

E.E. George MP spoke in favour of a bounty on wheat.

A.C. Woodgate opposed this, as it would do nothing to aid farmers whose crop had failed.

W.J. Cousins supported the bounty system.  He believed that at present 80% of farmers could not pay their way and farmers were entitled to receive at least the cost of production and should retain their wheat until they got it.

B.H. Woodgate said primary producers must fail unless they got 4/- a bushel.  Any practical solution would suit – whether pegging the exchange rate, placing a sales tax on flour, moratoriums or reducing freight rates.  Effective organisation was essential.

P.A. Kilderry supported him and said a reduction in the tariff was also required, as some 500 items were tariff protected, but this would take time and relief was needed urgently.

A.D. McDonald was for a flour tax and pegging the exchange rate.

The Chairman was for a bounty.

F.C. Catt favoured a bounty – other industries received such.

The final motion that was carried unanimously urged the immediate introduction of a bounty of 1/6 per bushel for wheat.
