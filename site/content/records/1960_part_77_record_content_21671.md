Burra Races last Wednesday were well attended.  On Tuesday night 37 points of rain fell, but although Wednesday was windy, it was dry.  The track was in good condition.  There was good racing, although there were only four starters in each of five races and five in the other two.  G. Petty, riding Golden Viking fell heavily in the second race when the horse clipped the heels of Fords Bay [or Fordâ€™s Bay?] as they entered the straight.  He was not seriously hurt, but did not ride again for the meeting.  The Burra Cup resulted in a dead heat.  An anonymous donor provided an identical trophy for the event.  The CWA ladies provided the catering.  [Results are printed on page 5.]
