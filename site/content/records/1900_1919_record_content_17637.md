Mrs C. Pressick has started business in the store previously occupied by Mr w. Barkley and known as Dobbie’s.  She will sell groceries and haberdashery.  Mr Pressick lost his sight some time ago and then canvassed the town selling from a handcart, but he is now too weak to continue.  Five small girls depend on Mrs Pressick.
