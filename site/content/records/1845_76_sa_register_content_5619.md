30 December.  I was up at 4 a.m. for a start for Adelaide and we left a little before 6 a.m. with rain.  It was a miserable day with pouring rain from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., wretched horses and worse roads.  Sod Hut, which is a stone building; Apoinga Mine, Tothill Scrub and Sheoak Log, which is a stone house, scarcely excited a look and so at length to the warmth of Mr Youngâ€™s Hotel at Gawler.
