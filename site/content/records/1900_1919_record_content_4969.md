Obituary.  Alex. Harris died on 25 December 1901, aged 62.  He was born in the parish of Kenwyn near Truro in Wales in June 1840.  In March 1849 he left England for SA, arriving in Adelaide on 1 June 1849.  The family then proceeded to Burra.  He worked in the Burra Mine for several years, but when the Wallaroo Mines opened he went to Kadina and opened a store as a produce merchant.  Later he returned to Burra and traded as a storekeeper and a wood and chaff merchant.  He was Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice, a Councillor for the Burra Corporation and one of the townâ€™s JPs.  He was an energetic worker for the church, being a superintendent of the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School.  He was elected Mayor, unopposed on 1 December 1901, but was taken ill before being sworn in and did not preside at any meetings.  He was a member of Kooringa Lodge of Freemasons and had just completed a term as W.M.  For about 30 years he had been a member of the Kadina Lodge MUIOOF.  The funeral on Thursday was very largely attended.  He leaves a wife, one son and one daughter.
