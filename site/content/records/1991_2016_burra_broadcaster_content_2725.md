‘The Burra School & Community News’ – A Tribute

This began in 1978 following the demise of the Burra Record.  For the first time in 100 years Burra did not have a paper of its own and many felt it had lost its voice.  What happens and is recorded becomes tomorrow’s history.  Chris McCabe, the new Principal of the new BCS and his wife Denise came up with the idea of the ‘Burra School and Community News’.  At first it appeared fortnightly – typed, laid out and printed at the school by Cynthia Burnett.  Early illustrations were hand drawn by Mary Woollacott.

In 1978 BCS was new.  It had an SRC, a Parents & Friends’ Association, a School Council and staff.  The buildings were named after the original villages from the copper mining days.  Ron Thamm was Chairman of the School Council.  The school was officially opened in April 1978. The total enrolment was 456.  There were Community Weeks and film evenings and a Buy-a-Brick Campaign to get a reasonable sized gymnasium.

The gymnasium was constantly in use for PE lessons, lunch-time recreation, after school hours public meetings, badminton, volley ball, ballet classes, fitness groups and basketball.  Edith Carpenter co-ordinated school and community demands.

The National Hang Gliding Championships were held in Burra that year.

In July ‘Joseph and Technicolour Dreamcoat’ was staged at the Town Hall.

Ian & Margaret Allen were farewelled.

200 people attended the opening of the Burra Community Library and State Library Board Chairman Jim Crawford was guest speaker.

The local entertainment group produced ‘Viva Mexico’ in October 1978.

The Burra Conservation Study display was set up in Adelaide and opened by Justice Roma Mitchell.

Porters Lagoon had its own Progress Association.

The large painting in the staff room comprising four panels by former Art teacher Russell Philip was hung.

Another large theatrical production that year was ‘Afternoon at the Seaside’, which was accompanied by a production of ‘Trial by Jury’. 

[Performers etc. are listed.]

In June 1978 the school newsletter took on a more community role and was more widely distributed, being made available from stores in Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Publication became weekly during school terms.  The School Council purchased an offset press for $6,000.

Over the next sixteen years the size and colour of the newsletter changed, but its basic concept remained the same.  It carried news from the school, the community and the Council.  It advertised fund-raising events and had a diary of events and church notices.  There was plenty of sport, a chat column and library news as well as photos.  In short it became a comprehensive newspaper.

Soon Cynthia Burnett needed volunteer typists and Jan Jacka and Di Cameron were the first to offer.  Denise McCabe took up the challenge of layout.  Sue Gebhardt became Chief Editor.  Gradually the numbers involved in all aspects of publication increased.  [A long list of those involved is printed.]

Chronological Highlights:

1978 – The newsletter began.  Burra Apex Club bought equipment such as electric typewriters etc. and continued its support until it disbanded in 1990, when it gave a final donation of $1,300.

1987 – The school printery closed and the newsletter was commercially printed.  In this year a grant of $1,000 from the State Bank helped with equipment.

1991 – David Maher redesigned the logo on the front page.  The newsletter survived on donations and sponsorship – especially from Apex, Burra Traders’ Association and the Council.  It was distributed to each school family and to stores in Burra, Booborowie and Mt Bryan, to Farrell Flat Hotel and for a time at Hallett.  It was also posted to readers interstate, in Adelaide and in other country areas.

[The current production team was then listed.]

It has sometimes been of more than 20 pages and is much to the credit of the community that it survived for 16 years.

Now that Burra again has its own newspaper the ‘Burra Broadcaster’, rather than duplicate news and the effort, the Community Newsletter has finished its job and has made way for the commercial enterprise to succeed.
