Burra Town Council, 5 June

J.T. Pascoe as Secretary of the Brass Band drew attention to the generosity of Mr James Thomas in having a number of lights placed in the Rotunda at his own expense.  A letter of appreciation will be sent.

E.J. Mortimer was permitted to keep a pig at the Bon Accord Hotel.

A move to waive the 10/- building fee on the Club House at the Golf Club failed.

The brass plate attached to the Burra Hall in the Adelaide Cheer-Up Hut has been returned to the Council.  It reads:

The Central Portion of the Hut

Has been christened

THE BURRA HALL

In recognition of

THE MAGNIFICENT ASSISTANCE

Rendered to the

CHEER-UP SOCIETY

By the Mayor and Residents of the

Burra

November 24th 1915

A vote of thanks was passed to General Weir.  A number of other Cheer-Up Hut memorabilia sent to the RSL will be treasured.

Burra Hotel proprietor was given permission to grow vegetables in part of the right of way adjacent to the hotel, there being no traffic using the right of way.

There was considerable debate over moved to impound loose dogs and destroy them after four days.  This led into a discussion concerning recent poisoning of dogs, but eventually a motion to appoint a catcher was carried.

So far there has been no reply to a request that the Duke of Gloucester should visit Burra while on his SA tour.  The matter was left with the Mayor and Town Clerk.
