Burra Town Council, 19 November.

Cr Sampson objected to an article in the Burra News.  It had been written by a member of Council and he found it his duty to object in strongest language to the article which stated that the whole Council had squandered the ratepayers’ money in providing for billets for personal friends, which meant the Mayor and Councillors were dishonest.

‘The councillor who wrote the article . . . is not fit to sit with.’

‘He would challenge the councillor – the writer of the article – to prove one single instance where any councillor had been guilty of providing fat billets for personal friends.’

Cr Hardy rose on a point of order asking if Cr Sampson could prove that a Councillor wrote the article.

Cr Sampson: ‘Will you deny it?’

After some altercations Cr Hardy objected to the assertion that ‘a councillor wrote the article.’

Cr Sampson moved that a vote of censure be passed on the writer of the article.  Cr Walsh 2nd.

Cr Harris thought ‘The article seems to fit a few of the Councillors.

Cr West: It ought to fit you.

Cr Harris: I am clear.’

The motion was put and supported by Crs Sampson, West and Walsh with Crs Hardy, Parks and Harris opposed.  It passed on the Mayor’s casting vote.

The Town Clerk reported that about £170 of the water rates remained to be collected.

The tender from the Burra Record of £2 to print the rolls was accepted.  T. Nicholls had tendered £2-18-0.
