Accident.  On 10 October a car that was parked on a hill at Burra North, without being in gear of having the handbrake engaged, rolled down the slope and crashed into a bathroom and toilet at the rear of a house.  No one was injured, but damage to the house was estimated at $20,000.

[An advertisement in the ‘Personal’ column in the issue for 3 December 2003 apologises for this event and reveals that the driver was Richard Bailey-Hill of Mt Bryan.]
