Wesfarmers Dalgety hosted an information evening last Wednesday to introduce the electronic world of buying and selling Australian Wool through Woolink.  Wool can be placed for sale by the broker on the sellerâ€™s behalf for a set, minimum or best price.  Offers are made by computer over the telephone line.  Other speakers updated the outlook for the wool industry.  The price for wool in 1995 was the lowest ever in real terms.  Dr John Miller, urologist, also gave an address on prostate cancer.
