Ulooloo Gold-fields

[There is a report at some length from a correspondent, on the Ulooloo Gold-fields.]

Mr Dare emphatically denied reports a few weeks ago that gold had been found on his run.  Other information prompted an investigation by Warden Mr Peterswald.  The route to the area follows the North Eastern Mail line from Burra to Willogoleech and then more easterly to Mr Chewings’ Station.  I saw 1½ oz of gold washed out by Mr Westcott and two mates on the claim about half a mile south of Mr Chewings’ head station.  Others have also pegged claims.  I found traces of gold in all samples I washed.  Others were not as consistent, but had found gold, while some had found nothing at all.  There are unconfirmed reports that some gold has been found on Mr Dare’s run.

[The correspondent sums his findings up as being able to dismiss claims that the area had been ‘salted’.  He says the district has all the signs of being an auriferous region.  He says the land is fortunately as yet unalienated.  He goes on to recount the natural resources available for fencing and hut building and says there is no scarcity of water.  He considers the alluvial deposits seem likely to enable a man to ‘knock out a living’.  He seems hopeful that a real gold-field could develop.]

Almost nothing is known of the quartz reefs in the area.  I caution travellers against a large and entirely unprotected hole in the Redruth Bridge, through which two horses have already fallen.

[Mr W.J. Peterswald’s report is printed also.  This essentially confirms the above, with a little more detail, but seems to make no recommendations about the likelihood of there being a payable field there.]
