David Robert Jennings

With the aid of the community we have been able to assist thirteen of our youth to gain their Queen Scout Awards and six to become Young Australians of the Year.  A member of the BCS Council for six years and I have been able with community support to organise an Army Cadet Unit here.  Also am involved in the schoolâ€™s Outdoor Education Program and Lifesaving & Swimming Instruction.  I am a lay reader and councillor in the Anglican Church.
