Salvation Army.  Captain Creswell and Cadet Pollard have started a soup kitchen assisted by Mrs Aberg Jnr. It began on Wednesday of ‘Kindness Week’ in the large hall adjoining Aberg’s butcher shop.  Mr J. McConnon of Burra School sent along scholars to whom he thought a bowl of rich hot soup would be invigorating.  Sixty-three children lined up and availed themselves of the invitation.  The ladies will continue every Wednesday during the cold weather.  On Wednesday last over forty children were served.
