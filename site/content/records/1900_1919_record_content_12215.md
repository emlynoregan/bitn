Rabbits

An all-out attack by trapping, poison etc. has been made and numbers have been much reduced by the simultaneous attack.  It is estimated 30,000 have been killed in a week to the east and reports vary from 300 to 5,000 killed in a single night by various people.  In some places the stench now from dead rabbits is unbelievable.  Phosphorus has been widely used.  In places the bodies have been strung on fences and on some estates there are heaps of dead rabbits every few yards.

The rabbits have been migrating westwards as shown by one landowner who poisoned along a stretch of wire netting fence: the first night he caught 100, the second 200, the third 80 and the fourth 2,500.  The absence of rain is helping in their destruction.

At the latter end of last week Mr Dearlove sent to Burra Railway Station 18,000 rabbit skins weighing almost one ton from Ketchowla.  He has captured up to 3,500 in a single night.
