Burra Day Care is a service provided to people of any age in need of companionship, or who are disabled or socially isolated.  An interim fundraising committee was formed on 26 March in the Aberdeen Clubrooms.  Elected were: President, Darryl Venning, Vice-President, Judy Kellock; Secretary, Lorraine Taylor and Treasurer, Carolyn Nottle.  Over the Easter period we have undertaken the mammoth task of catering for three night meals for 450 people at the Sports Complex.  Any volunteers to help would be appreciated.
