Burra Burra DC has received correspondence notifying it that the plan for Market Square redevelopment had not been forwarded to the Australian Heritage Commission for approval, as was required.  The whole of the town is on the Register of the National Estate and therefore the project must not proceed without the approval of the State heritage Branch.  After a recent meeting a small working party from the Council, the Highways Department, the Road Traffic Board, the National Trust and the State Heritage Branch will meet to look at the proposal.
