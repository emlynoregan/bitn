W. Henderson v. C. Fie for power to evict.

Henderson let some land to Fie.  Fie erected a store and then sublet to Fung Sang and Luke Day.  The latter took possession some 18 months ago.  Day paid Fie rent and Fie paid Henderson, getting a receipt.  Henderson now says he did not give permission for Fie to sublet and so the agreement is broken.

Luke Day was in possession during the year, but the premises are presently unoccupied.  Fie carried on a separate business in Aberdeen as a gardener.  The verdict was in favour of the defendant as Henderson having received the rent had waived his rights.
