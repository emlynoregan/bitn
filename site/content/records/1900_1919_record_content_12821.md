C.C Heinrich of the Burra Hotel has gone to Adelaide due to the illness there of his mother, aged 70.  His father was a produce carter from Adelaide to Burra in the early days and once arrived in Burra with a load of flour, only to have it rushed and every bag taken as before his arrival flour was unobtainable.  Next morning he received the full value of what had been taken.
