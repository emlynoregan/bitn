Letter.  John Oates writes in response to Alan Hall’s alleged comment that the Council had an ‘arrogant and born-to-rule’ attitude.

It seems pointless to elect a ratepayers’ association to belt the Council that has just been elected.

Council would appear weak or foolish if it went to the ratepayers’ association to make a decision.

How can Councillors be unapproachable if they have not been approached?

Since May I have had four people outside of Council contact me over issues.

Ratepayers’ Association says it has c. 60 members – this number would not have elected a Councillor in May 1995.

As a ratepayer, I have concerns over the tourism industry in Burra.  Some small or one large industrial development would bring probably as much or more growth, jobs and money as tourism at present.

Council is propping up tourism because it is saving the town from dying, until some industry is brought here.  I can’t see we have much choice.

Sure, many things cannot be bought in Burra, but if people who shopped for everything outside of the town started shopping here, perhaps Council would not have to spend so much of electors’ money on tourism.

I too would like to see money spent on roads and see rates fixed for a few years.

Every time there is an election the few who do most complaining don’t have the courage to stand for election – using the same old excuse of lack of time.

The last thing we need is division in the town.
