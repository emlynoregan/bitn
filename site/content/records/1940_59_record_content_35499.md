Fire Siren.  A new siren which it is claimed can be heard ten miles away will soon be installed in Burra to be sounded when help is required for grass fires.  It has been secured by the town Council through the Civil Defence Force.  The siren at the Fire station cannot be used to sound the alarm for fires occurring outside the town.
