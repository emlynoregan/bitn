Market Square Issues

A newsletter designed to clear up some misconceptions about Market Square plans has been distributed to Burra residents.  Council chairman Mr James Hawker said that despite public meetings in July and December to explain details, it was clear that misconceptions persisted.  There was a petition going around with a map that was completely incorrect.  As it transpired people did realise that and altered it.  He said that although there had been no major accidents recently in the square, the number of tourists in the town had doubled in five years.  The current position will not be the same in the future.  The parking situation in Burra is undesirable; there is no formal parking and no lines.  People park where they want.  They park near corners and around the triangular island in the square; reversing blindly from the kerb.  There had been three previous plans to change the arrangements in the square, but none had been enacted.  The current plan was the first that had taken account of engineering principles such as traffic management and drainage.  He noted the Burra Preservation Organisation had accepted the mew lighting proposals.
