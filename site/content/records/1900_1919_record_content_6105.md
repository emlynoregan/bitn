Frederick James Uren, licensed victualler of Kooringa, sued Madame Luella for £6 for board and lodging.  She came on 28 May and arranged board and lodging for 30/- a week and after two weeks the arrangements continued at £1 a week.  After five weeks she suddenly disappeared.  She apparently walked to Hanson to get the train to avoid drawing attention to her departure.
