Fire.  On Wednesday fire broke out near George Harry’s residence at Mt Bryan and running before strong winds in high grass it took a firm hold.  Mr Harry lost c. 50 acres and Mr Skewes c. 100 acres of grass and a division fence was burnt.  Some sheep of Mr Skewes were also destroyed.  Mr Harry’s standing wheat crop miraculously escaped.  The origin of the fire is a mystery.
