Kooringa News, 7 March

The meeting on the formation of a volunteer corps resumed on Thursday.  It was again numerously attended, but was characterised by disorder and confusion, due to the presence of a group unfavourable to the scheme and apparently determined to be obstructive.  The meeting was, as a consequence, a complete failure.

Yesterday Mr Macdonald SM investigated claims to exemption under the Militia Act.  A large number appealed, but few had any valid reason.  The day was a source of general amusement and many miners attended, having been granted a half-holiday for the occasion.

The new Bible Christian Chapel at Kooringa is being rapidly advanced, as is the Telegraph Office.
