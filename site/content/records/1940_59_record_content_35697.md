Burra Bowling Club has received a £500 bequest from the estate of the late Ernest F. Marston.  It was the desire of the late Mr Marston that the money be spent purchasing the land adjacent to the present club site (including the Council Depot paddock) for the purpose of constructing tennis courts to be run in conjunction with the Bowling Club.  This would give Burra a site like that at Clare, where bowls, croquet and tennis are all combined.  This would see a large cross-section of the community interested in any further improvements to the area.  It would also enable more readily the sharing of resources between those groups.  Though this interest of Mr Marston’s was made known, there is no stipulation in his will as to how the money is to be spent.  A committee was formed to consider the scheme.
