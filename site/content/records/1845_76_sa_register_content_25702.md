Mr Dawson said the objects of the meeting were altogether unclear and he moved it adjourn for a week so that the objectives could be made clear to those coming a distance to attend.

The meeting resolved to attend to the matters brought before it.

The meeting then endorsed the decision of Council in agreeing to the separation of the North Ward.

Mr O. Harvey moved that the Council withdraw all proceedings against the Government.

The Chairman said that although Cr Lane had said the Council was at law with the Government, they were not.

After some discussion Mr Dawson moved that the matter be left to the Council and this was carried.

Mr Ridgway then proposed that the meeting endorse the view of Cr Lane as above on the representation of wards.  Cr Warnes amended this to leave the matter as proposed by the Council.

Mr Dawson made a lengthy analysis of where the rates came from and how the money was expended.  He concluded that Kooringa Ward got more than its share, Redruth got too little and the North and South Wards had been robbed.

Eventually the original motion was carried.
