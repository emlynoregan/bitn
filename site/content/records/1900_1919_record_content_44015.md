Pte F.A. West writes from Helmeih Camp, Egypt on 3 Oct. He tells of sand getting into everything and of ancient tombs nearby.  He has seen King Tiver, who has had fever and will probably go about the same time as West.  On 6 Oct. he continues.  He has seen Hartley Harris who was thin and pale from illness.  Essen Rule has been made a Sergeant.  ‘Banjo’ Pearce is in Heliopolis Hospital and Dick Ockenden is at Malta with his hand blown off.
