Goyder Council

Peter Boaden, Director of Human Resources, will negotiate with the owners to obtain former railway land at Eudunda linking Centenary Gardens and Town Gardens and to obtain former railway land at Eudunda and Robertstown from its owner and TransAdelaide at little or no cost to Council.

Sealing of the Burra Heavy Vehicle Bypass is now a priority of Council.

Burra Cottage Homes Fund has been invested separately for the purpose of maintenance and major upgrades, help with the acquisition of the two existing groups of cottages and generally to provide more accommodation for the aged in Burra.

Burra Mobil Roadhouse has been granted permission for an illuminated ‘Mobil’ sign sited on the edge of the protuberance at the front of their driveway – to be of similar height to the streetlight and it is to replace all other unfixed signage and the illuminated sign on the driveway canopy.

An Emergency Order was placed on the shed in Drew Lane at the rear of the Drew & Crewes Building at the beginning of this year after the stone eastern wall fell out.  Councillors recently visited the site and have issued a further Emergency Order.  Council suggests poor maintenance has resulted in the wall’s collapse.  Council has authorised the CEO to arrange for the work to be undertaken in accordance with the order and to recover costs from the owners Valladon Nominees & M. Reilly, should the order not be complied with.  Owner Neil Page maintains that the proximity of a tree on Council property influenced the stability of the wall.  The building inspector will furnish an additional report.
