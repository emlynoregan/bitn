Senator Pearson & Mr G.S. Hawker addressed the Women’s Branch of the LCL in Burra.  The Senator said the Government now controlled both Houses of Parliament and would press ahead with a referendum to gain the constitutional powers to enforce the Anti-Communist Act of 1950.  Also it would press for secret ballots in union elections and give more power to the Arbitration Court.  He urged support for the referendum.

Mr G.S. Hawker spoke of his recent trip to Ceylon and Malaya and of the Communist threat in both countries.
