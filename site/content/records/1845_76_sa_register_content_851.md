A party just arrived from the North informs that drunkenness exists there to a frightful extent.

Wages are so high that men can satisfy their worst passions.

Masons and bricklayers at Burra Burra have struck demanding more than their present 8/- per day plus lodgings and rations!

Some miners have left, not liking their new Captain Mr Lawson, who is a practical man and insists on work for money.

The Sabbath is regarded only as a holiday, sacred to cricket and gambling.

Mr Nicholls is off again to the Mines (as advertised).  We commend his steadiness of purpose and from what we hear of his disposition to please his passengers we venture to recommend him.
