Burra CWA, the first branch in SA, has celebrated its 40th birthday, having been established by the late Mrs I.J. Warnes in 1926.

The CWA now has some 13,000 members.

At the Burra celebrations on Friday seven of the foundation members were present when Mrs E.T. Baulderstone was host to a largely attended birthday party in the RSL Hall.  This meeting was also the branch’s ‘National Day’ meeting, with Mexico as the subject for 1966.

[A photo in the paper of 29 November 1966 shows the seven foundation members, left to right: Mrs Steer, Mrs Marks, Mrs Warnes, Mrs Marchant, Mrs Sandland, Mrs Hogan and Mrs Jettner.]

Past Presidents present included Mesdames Jennison, Pietsch, Riggs and Warnes.

Among guests was Mrs Zerbe, State President.

Mrs Badman, Divisional President gave a brief address ‘Coins for Friendship’.

Mrs Zerbe spoke on dress fashion in the 1920s and since.  A cake with forty candles was cut.
