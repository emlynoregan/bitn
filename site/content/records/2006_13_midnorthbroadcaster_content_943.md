Advertorial.  Bill & Stammy Overell re-opened the Burra Hotel late in February, with plans to re-vamp it.  Renovations have been made in the bar and dining areas and will continue in the accommodation section upstairs.  Stammy has recently been a chef with Neagle’s Rock in Clare.  The Burra Hotel also plans to have more entertainment, with different bands each Friday night and they look forward to hosting special functions and catering for the corporate market.  [Photo.]
