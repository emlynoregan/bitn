Mt Bryan Red Cross Gala Drive was held last Wednesday evening.  In the space of seven hours they raised no less than £380.  There was a High Tea and Trading Table, an Auction Sale, a Grand Concert, an Ugly Man Competition, a Bugler Auction of a Picture and a dance followed by supper.

The auction was of a framed coloured picture of a Bunch of Violets, sold in the interests of the Burra Cheer-Up Society during the 1914-18 War.  It had been donated by Mrs Alfred Phillips.  Mr G.S. Hawker became the new owner with a bid of £6-5-0 and the total raised under the Bugler bidding system was £62-10-6.

The Ugly Man Competition raised £249-14-7.

After the concert dancing was indulged in until 1 a.m. to the music of the Rainmakers Orchestra.

With £30 raised by previous dances the total comes to £410.

[The whole event is reported in detail.]
