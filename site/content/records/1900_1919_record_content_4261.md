Redruth Reformatory.  Two girls absconded from the reformatory on 21 September: Agnes Dyke and Maud Daniels and have not been seen since.  Some months ago the same pair escaped, but turned up at The Gums Station.  On 26 September two more escaped about 7 p.m.: Elsie Weaver and Maud Thompson, but they returned the next night, cold and hungry.
