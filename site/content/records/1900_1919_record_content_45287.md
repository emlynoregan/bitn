Burra Town Council.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has approved the tender for the bridge opposite the Institute for £215 and the Department will pay half.

Cr Lane said that in view of the estimated cost of the three bridges being £1,200 and the Department offering to pay half, this offer of half of £215 seemed poor and the Commissioner should be interviewed.

Cr McBride said as he remembered the Council offered to erect the three if they were given £600 and subsequently the Government offered to give favourable consideration to paying for one bridge if tenders were called.

Cr Dane said the Government could interpret half the £215 as ‘favourable consideration’. 

Cr McBride will wait on the Commissioner and if settled satisfactorily the tender is to be accepted.

The Town Clerk has been appointed an Inspector under the Building Act.
