Back to Farrell’s Flat Celebrations

The dates cited are in error, but apparently should be Saturday 20 to Monday 22 March.  The report runs for just less than three columns.

Saturday.  The official opening was from a platform near the Institute.  F.J. Fitzpatrick (President of the Celebrations) called on Hon. George F. Jenkins to open the celebrations.  Other MPs, Hon. A.P. Blesing & Mr MacDonald also spoke as did Mr G.G. Hawkes, the patron and another patron H. C. Atkins.  There was then a procession to Duncan Park.  An official lunch was held in the Institute.

There was an aerial race from Parafield to Farrell’s Flat for three planes, which was won by MacRobertson & Miller Aviation Co.’s Fokker Universal Monoplane, followed by the same company’s Bristol Monoplane and then A.G. Bond’s Gipsy Moth.  Joy rides were offered in the afternoon.  The Bristol Monoplane did aerobatics over the sports ground.

The afternoon’s sports results are printed.

In the evening the Burra Concert Party played to a capacity house.

Sunday.  All churches reported packed congregations and there was an RSL Memorial Service in the Institute in the evening.

Monday.  There was a cricket match at Duncan Park between old and present residents and at 2 p.m. a ‘Back to School’.  In the evening there was a ball at the Institute.
