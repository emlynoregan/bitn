Burra Swimming Pool

65 men turned up on Sunday to help.  45 gave most of a day’s labour and the others at least half a day, representing £120 worth of labour.  They laid half the total floor in concrete six inches thick.  The remaining half will be eight inches thick.  Boxing and levelling etc. will be done in the next two weeks, with the next big working bee arranged for 23 June.  More cement is needed to complete the job.
