The Trial of John Barker at Wilcannia 18 December

John Barker was charged with robbery under arms and appeared before a crowded court.

George Urquhart, manager of Mt Arrowsmith Station at Mt Gibbs said that the prisoner and William Bertram had stuck him and the station up on 23 October 1869. Bertram had taken the witnesses revolver and bailed him up.  The pair had come to the station in the afternoon.  The prisoner had been armed.  Bertram had asked him if he would sell him rations.  When he refused Bertram had said he would take them.  They were occupied half an hour in the store.  Bertram followed him into the hut and Baker followed.  Baker took a double-barrelled gun and said he would return it.  They got meat from the kitchen and then took a grey mare, a grey cob and a black horse.  He estimated the value of the revolver at £5, the gun at about £10 and the horses at £35.  The horses were the property of McCulloch, Sellers & Co.

Peter Devine, labourer of Mt Gibbs, said he was horse driving about shearing time 1869 and saw Baker and Bertram in the yard.  Baker had a revolver and double-barrelled gun and ordered him off his horse.

Baker was committed to the Quarter Sessions at Bourke.

Baker was then charged by the police with stealing three horses valued at £35 from Mt Murchison Station, the property of A. Kirkpatrick & R.B. Smith.

Alfred Kirkpatrick deposed that on the night of 14 October 1869 he had left three horses in the station yard.  [He then described them and their brands.]  When he returned about midnight they were not there.  He did not immediately suspect they had been stolen.  In the morning he found the rails down and an old saddle and a bridle were also missing.  Bertram who was in charge of a hawker’s wagon had not been seen that morning.  The cook said Bertram and Baker had been together in the evening and had left together.  Several boxes and drawers in the wagon had been forced open and their contents strewn about.  A blackfellow had helped track his horses in the direction of Wilcannia.  Two of the horses were his and the other belonged to E.S. Bonney, then station manager.  He informed the police and with the aid of a blackfellow tracked the horses to within half a mile of Wilcannia.

About a week later started with police in pursuit and went to Cobham Lake, Mt Murchison Station.  Found the horses there and a fourth he had not missed before – a bay mare, the property of a Chinaman employed on the station.  Mr Urquhart, the manager at Mt Arrowsmith told him Baker and Bertram had stuck up the station and left the horses there.  He heard that Bertram and Baker had sold his horses to Maori Jack and that Baker had said that the grey was a great little horse and he was sorry not to be taking him on.  Next morning the horses were gone.  He could not find them and returned with the station horse and the fourth horse to Wilcannia.  Maori Jack brought the horses back saying he heard they had been stolen.  He gave them to the police and showed a receipt of Bertram’s for the sale.  He said he had bought them from the prisoner and Bertram.

Baker cross examined the witness.

James Willoughby the cook at Momba said Bertram had been engaged by the Hawker O’Brien to take charge of his wagon and also to carry water and kill sheep by Willoughby.  The day before he went missing he had been with Baker and had failed to deliver the water.  The next day he found him at about 10 or 11 p.m. at the hawker’s wagon, along with Baker.  The next morning when the horses were missed Mr Kirkpatrick asked if anyone was with Bertram the previous night and Willoughby told him Baker was with him.  Willoughby also said things in the dray were all topsy-turvy.

Peter Devine gave evidence as a witness to the sale of the horses by Bertram to Maori Jack.  Under cross examination he could not say that he knew if Baker had any connection with the sale.

The Bench dismissed the charge of horse stealing, there being insufficient evidence.

Baker then lodged a complaint of ill treatment.  The Bench undertook to look into the affair [but sounded distinctly doubtful and seemed inclined to consider Baker’s resistance to the law was the reason for any hard handling.]
