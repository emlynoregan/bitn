The Burra Creek Leaks

Burra District Clerk Mr R.D. Walsh said Council was concerned about water seeping through the walls of the creek.  Financial aid would be sought to plug these leaks.  No. 1 bore of the creek had been closed for the rest of the financial year to allow the problem areas to be identified.  Although the water loss was not at present a problem, it could be in the future and would be monitored carefully.  He had no idea of likely costs at this stage.  Burra’s main water supply came from the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline, but ‘as the creek was Burra’s main tourist attraction, the Council wanted to keep it that way’.
