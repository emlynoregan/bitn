Cr Laurie Sullivan was honoured by the Local Government Association last week for his 22 years in local Government.  He first became a Councillor for the District Council of Hallett in 1983 and eventually became its Chairman.  When the Councils amalgamated, he represented Hallett Ward in the Regional Council of Goyder and in due course became its Chairman, a position he holds today.
