Messrs Dring & Medwell, relatives of the late Mrs Medwell formed a deputation complaining that:

The home where Mrs Medwell had been had not been fumigated, though there were three small children in it.

Neither had it been isolated.

Mrs Medwell had been sent to a cold, barn-like place without a ceiling.

Mr Medwell was in the same place still.

The Isolation Hospital ‘was a den and highly discreditable to an important town and to remove a woman in Mrs Medwell’s condition to such a place seemed to him inhuman.’

The sanitary conditions in the neighbourhood of where his son lived were abominable and should have been supervised.

The ambulance was popularly known as ‘The Freezer’ and Mrs Medwell was moved without stockings or a blanket.

Dr Lyndon said heaters had been put in and professional nursing was the patient’s only hope.

Mr Dring suggested a bagging ceiling might at least prevent condensation from dripping from the roof onto patients.

Cr Dane moved all infected houses be fumigated at once and all possible be done re the ceiling.

Despite the risks Dr Lyndon said he favoured using the Burra Hospital, but pointed out he was only Dr Steele’s locum until next Friday.

Cr Bartholomaeus and Cr McBride moved to get part of the hospital set aside as the Isolation Hospital if the Hospital Board was willing.

Dr Lyndon thought if they were prepared to risk spreading the infection it was worth the risk.

Cr McBride was sure the Board would be.  Passed unanimously.
