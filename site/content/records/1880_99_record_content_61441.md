Redruth Court. 17 December.

The charges against McDonald, Poulston & Emsell were amended from housebreaking to larceny, so they could be tried under the Minor Offences Act and so save time and the expenses of the witnesses having to go to Adelaide.

H. Roach gave evidence about the missing gun and various other items later found to be missing, including a plane and soldering iron.  He was able to positively identify the gun from markings on it.

Gilbert Day, blacksmith of Robertstown, gave evidence of having bought the gun and of getting a receipt signed ‘Henry Roe’, but he recognised McDonald as the vendor.

Julius Mildea, storekeeper’s assistant of Robertstown, purchased an expansion bit from McDonald and witnessed ‘Roe’ signing the receipt.

Augusta Werner, store assistant of Robertstown bought stamps worth 3/8 from Emsell and a model ship for 3/-.  [Later in the sentence it says ‘he bought’, so this was probably August Werner.]

Frederick Allen, labourer of Redruth in the employ of H. Roach, recognised the plane, expansion bit and soldering iron, but could not swear to the rasp or piece of solder.

McDonald made an unsworn statement that they had found a bag under the footbridge to the east side of the Burra hospital with the gun etc. in it.

The charges in the Luke Day robbery were similarly amended.

Carl Thiele, blacksmith of Point Pass, bought tobacco, scissors and two combs from McDonald, but could not swear they were positively the items in evidence, though they were very similar.

Dorothea Schmidt had bought 6 packets of cocoa for 1/6.

Luke Day identified the brand, but had no personal marks on the items.

Lack of positive identification of the items caused the Court to dismiss the Day case, but on the other case a sentence of three months in Adelaide Gaol was imposed.
