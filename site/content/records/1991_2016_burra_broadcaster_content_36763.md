Police Lock-up

Part of an inside stone wall at the lock-up collapsed unexpectedly â€“ probably due to drainage problems.  It was reported by a visitor.  Peter Russell, stone mason from Auburn, is attending to the repairs.  Half the cost will be met by the State Heritage Branch and half by the Burra National Trust.
