Burra High School Speech Night was held last Monday night.  Headmaster Farrow expressed his concern at falling enrolments.  The Mayor and Mayoress, Mr Allen MP & Mrs Allen, Chairman of the District Council Cr G. Finch & Mrs Finch, Miss Sprat Headmistress of Burra Primary School and the religious instruction teachers attended.  The guest speaker was Mr White.

The post war boom and raising the school leaving age led to increased school enrolments, but now the increasing size of farm holdings and migration out of the mid-north to other areas is presenting the school with a period of stability, or even of decline.  The year started with 170 students and finished with 150 – the smallest for some years.  The loss of 20 students during the year is perhaps of more concern than the overall decline.  The 1967 exam results were particularly pleasing with 90% satisfying subject grades in PEB Intermediate and Leaving.  All candidates presenting for the Alternative Certificate (Internal Intermediate Course) were successful.  We congratulate Christopher Freeman who gained 7 subjects with 6 grade 1 passes.  He won an Intermediate Bursary.  Malcolm White and Andrew Ryan were awarded Intermediate Continuation Scholarships.

Recently three students were given Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships based on special examinations taken in July this year: Lynette Griffen, Angela Quinn and Chrystine Steele.  In 1969 the Intermediate Certificate, both internal and external, will be abolished.  The path to University matriculation will also be modified.  The new Junior Secondary Curriculum will provide a challenge to all.  We should guard against judging what a child is asked to do by some vocational yard stick.  Life is big and marvellous and to be enjoyed.  Our concept of it needs to be panoramic and not narrow and hazy.  But the school is not all hard work.  The extra-curricular life is rich and rewarding.  Burra High School has provided the breadth of sport, travel, club, social and involvement in other worthy causes.  I am concerned that on leaving school in country areas like Burra there is something of a dearth of such wider experiences in the community – a lack of cultural groups, of adult education, recognised community groups and projects.  Parents too have a role to play.  There have been instances this year of incidents of deliberate mischief.  If your child has access to a vehicle, make sure it is for legitimate purposes and is handled properly.  If the child has access to a phone at will, should they?  If a child is involved in an incident away from school premises don’t blame the school.  Nine times out of ten it is the parents’ upbringing of the child which is at fault.  And if you are the type to blame the school, don’t then turn around and blame the staff if they do take action.

We are once again very grateful to the Parents & Friends’ Association and the High School Council for all the amenities provided and improvements made.

The triennial election for the School Council in June saw Mr D.H. Field re-appointed as Chairman; Mr T.G. Perry as Secretary and Mr R.B. Jennison as Treasurer.  Thanks to Mr D. White, who has been Acting Secretary while Mr Perry has been overseas.  The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. has been led by President Mrs F. Matthews with Mrs B. Bevan Secretary and Mrs P. Carpenter as Treasurer.  It has sponsored the annual ball, catered for sports day and will on 18 December provide the usual annual banquet.  This year they have provided a portable amplifier, new tennis nets, additions to the library and a television receiver.  The Government has made improvements to school buildings and there is a project to have a recreation room for students.

Thanks are extended to Mrs Cockington for playing the accompaniment for the Girls’ Choir and to Mrs Carpenter for leading them.  Also to the religious instruction staff for doing so well a job that is all too often thankless.

[Mr Farrow went on to thank a variety of people, to wish departing students well and to farewell some staff members.]

Six staff members are known to be leaving:

Miss Newman to Mannum

Mr Murphy to Angle Park Boys’ Technical High School

Mr Schwartz to Norwood

Mr Alfred to Daws Road

And Mrs Day has been promoted to Acting Senior Mistress.
