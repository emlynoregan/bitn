Adelaide Share Market

The latest Burra Burra sales have been at £205 for cash and £210 is asked this evening.

After conversation with persons with mining experience we are rather surprised that the operations of the company have not been carried on upon the lines suggested by Mr John James in last Saturday’s Register.  Not only would the benefits be those he outlines, but we believe there are real dangers that if surface waters should ever find their way down into the mine it could result in disastrous settling with results too horrible to imagine.  Given the peculiar nature of the ground we believe this more than possible.

Share prices quoted in the attached list include:

Burra Burra £5 shares at £207-10-0

Princess Royal £50 shares paid to £37 at £42
