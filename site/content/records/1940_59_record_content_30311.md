Burra Town Council recently discussed noxious weeds in the town.

The Town Clerk said it was his duty to attend to the destruction of noxious weeds, but he needed the backing of Council.  The Council needed to attend to noxious weeds on its own land.  Boxthorn was present in a number of places and should be addressed first.  Council was risking a heavy penalty if it failed to act.  Lack of funds and manpower during the war had exacerbated the problem.  The Mayor said they should begin by concentrating on Boxthorn and True Star Thistle.  The Mid North Local Government Association had recently decided to ask the Government for financial assistance to combat noxious weeds and onion weed in particular.  Immediate action will be taken to eliminate Boxthorn on Council and private property.
