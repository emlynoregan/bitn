Kooringa News, 7 August

The question of the amalgamation of the Telegraph Station and the Post-Office has definitely been settled with the alterations at the Telegraph Station having started.  Two small rooms have been demolished.  Until the work is completed the Post-Office will remain in its present position.

Tenders have been erected for the construction of a handsome building for the National Bank, which will become a suitable companion for the Mechanics’ Institute and Telegraph Station, both of which will be nearby.

I understand log carting for the Mine is about to resume.

Mr Townsend of Kooringa has a gigantic pig.  It was bred by Mr Townsend and is aged about 2½ years.  It is estimated to weigh 700 lb.  Another pig, lately departed this life, was fourteen months old and weighed, in carcase, 414 lb.
