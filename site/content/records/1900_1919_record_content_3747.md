[Johnny Green.] The Burra Mine possesses a splendid echo and on top of the engine house is a battered and weather-beaten effigy.  No one knows how it came there or who it represents.  It is supposed to be an image of the shepherd who found the ore.  When asked what he wanted as a reward, he asked for a pound a week and a bullock team.  One payday he bought a small keg of rum.  Next morning his charred remains were found beneath the burnt remains of the keg and dray.
