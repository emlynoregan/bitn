We oppose the continuance of free troughs after the corporation takes over the scheme.  The cost of supplying the water is reckoned at 3/- per 1,000 gallons and consumption would reach some hundreds of thousands of gallons, so no small sum is involved.  To require the guarantors to pay for persons who do not pay for what they use is out of the question.  Neither can it be made up out of the rates.  Those who use it should pay. Once the new engine is working it should be able to supply water at 1/6 per 1,000 gallons.  A local resident could be used to collect a small charge from those who use the troughs at a fixed fee per head sufficient to leave a small profit for the collector.
