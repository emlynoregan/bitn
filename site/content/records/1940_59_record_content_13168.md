RSL Wives’ FFCF held its AGM 5 March with Mrs S. Hawker presiding.

She reported on the psychological changes in Australia in the last 12 months.  A year ago Australia was in a parlous position, but now most soldiers have returned and their arrival has been met with great joy.  On the other hand there have been many occasions for grief due to losses of family members.  Two members of the FFCF have also died: Mrs S.C. Genders & Mrs G.A. Heinrich.

Membership was now 62 and average attendance was 23.  Parcels despatched since February 1942 contained 198 pairs of socks, 32 balaclavas, 19 pairs long socks, 19 mufflers, 17 pullovers, 8 pairs of mittens, 234 handkerchiefs and 47 face-washers.  They had bought 85½ lbs of wool, 21 yards of towelling and 19 yards of handkerchief material at a total cost of £33-15-4.  The money raising effort of the Annual FFCF Appeal raised £421-18-11 for the three units in Burra.  The group supplies biscuits for the Recreation Club for troops, opened at St Mary’s.  Elected were President, Mrs Hawker; Vice-Presidents, Mrs R.L. Steele & Mrs H. Jennison; Secretary, Mrs Court Pearce; Assistant Secretary, Mrs Castine and Treasurer, Mrs R.J. Lloyd.
