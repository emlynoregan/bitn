Burra & District Tourism Association.  With its constitution now set up and a subscription passed, the association has begun operating.  The association ran a barbecue over the antique Fair weekend and has made a submission to Council on improved signage.  Tourist traffic along the Morgan Road has increased dramatically since it was sealed.  The association is looking at producing a full-colour tourist brochure for the district.
