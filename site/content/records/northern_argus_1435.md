Morphett’s Enginehouse.  A letter from the J150 Board has notified the Burra Burra DC that $120,000 has been allocated to the restoration of Morphett’s Enginehouse at the Burra Mine.  The funds are going for re-pointing of stonework, the installation of doors and windows, rebuilding all floors and balconies on the second storey level and re-roofing.  The slates are presently being placed on the new roof.  [Photo.]
