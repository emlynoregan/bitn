Waterworks Commission.

Cr Sampson asked if the Mayor had given permission for Mr Littlejohn’s diary to be removed from the Waterworks office.

Neither the Mayor nor the Town Clerk had done so.

Cr Hardy said it was another mare’s nest.  He had it.

Cr Sampson wanted to know why Cr Hardy had it and why he was exhibiting it to ratepayers round the town – misleading them by pointing to Sampson’s name in the book and drawing erroneous conclusions.

Cr West supported the statements of Cr Sampson and Cr Sampson then moved that Cr Hardy return the book.  Cr Hardy 2nd saying he intended to do so anyway.  When put to the vote however, Hardy voted against it and the motion only passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.
