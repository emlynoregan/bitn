He felt that if subsidies went then the Council needed to retain locally raised fees (Licences etc.)  Some Councillors dissented on the grounds that subsidies favoured the city over country areas.

Cr Sampson thought they should not have to pay for police and yet not get to keep hotel licence fees, since without hotels there would be no need for police.

The petition was signed on the casting vote of the Mayor.

The matter of the half-yearly Waterworks account was raised.  It was for Â£138-0-5.

It had been stipulated to the late Council that no interest was payable till the works were complete.  Cr Ridgway maintained they were not complete and would not be for 6-9 months - though any small contractor would have done the work in three.

Cr Symons said that was all nonsense - under that argument the works would never be completed while additions were being made.  He moved the account be referred to the Waterworks Committee and this was carried.
