The Municipal Elections are another example.  S.M. Lane is said to be elected unopposed to East Ward.  Then at the Ratepayers’ meeting he speaks, but does not appear in the results.  The election for East Ward appears to elect Mr Ockenden to that position, but at the end of the year he is retiring through the effluxion of time, making it clear that the election was for the extraordinary vacancy created by Mr Crewes’ resignation to stand unsuccessfully for Mayor.  This is typical of the careless handling of material this year.
