Leighton Institute held its Annual Dinner last Wednesday evening.  President, I.J. Warnes took the chair.  The report runs for almost 2 columns.  Mr Cock reported they had paid £80 off the debt last year and would have wiped out the balance this year had the season not been so bad.  Mr A. McDonald said Leighton Dramatic Club had managed to raise between £20 & £30 to reduce the debt.
