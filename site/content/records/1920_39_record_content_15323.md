Burra Town Council, 2 March

The quarry near Mr Gare’s has been inspected and found not to be dangerous.

A civic reception will be given the Prime Minister Mr Bruce on his visit on 26 March.

The Local Government Department advice suggests that the Council could in all probability force the reopening of Smelts Road, which a private person had fenced off and claimed.  The road has apparently been used for over 50 years and maintained by the Council.  The Councillors discussed the implications and decided to inspect the road portion that is fenced before deciding on action.

Park Bros. replied to the complaint about howling dogs.  They were clearly annoyed and said some of the dogs were worth over £50 and they could no more keep them from howling than they could prevent a rooster from crowing.

There was much discussion on road work, especially on the main road from Kooringa to the station.  Also it was decided to buy a Champion Wizard plough for road work.

There was a motion that work in the quarry on the school hill will not be proceeded and an amendment was moved and seconded that work proceed.  The paper reports that the motion was passed

[Discussion in Council on 6 April, reported in the paper of 15 April, shows that work at the quarry did proceed, so perhaps it was the amendment for continuation that was carried and not the motion to cease.]

Cr Riggs was concerned over the confusion between the names Burra, Aberdeen and Kooringa.  He suggested that the town be called Burra North and Burra South, or the name of the station be changed.  [Presumably to Aberdeen to agree with its actual location.]

Cr Kellock brought up a rumour that Cr Kellaway was not a ratepayer [and thus not eligible to sit].

The Town Clerk read the relevant act which showed he was quite entitled to sit.

[The precise nature of the objection and answering justification is not stated.]
