Christmas in Burra.

Stores were decorated and window displays a feature.

Streets were packed Christmas Eve after tea.

The Burra Band played.

The Salvation Army had a long meeting in Market Square.

Shops closed at 9.00 p.m. and by midnight the streets were deserted.

Christmas Day was very hot.

The Carol Service at Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church on Christmas morning was pleasing and profitable and was successfully repeated last Sunday evening in Market Square.

There was a rifle match in the afternoon at the local range for a prize of 20 packets of cartridges, which was won by Lieutenant Butterworth.

The cricket match at the Recreation Ground saw Clare Juniors defeat Burra Juniors by 4 wickets.

Burra Young Menâ€™s Union proposed a dance in the evening, but religious sentiments caused a postponement and consequently a crowd of supporters and opponents gathered at the Salvation Army meeting.

Hotels were open.

The 26th was quiet except for the Primitive Methodist anniversary celebrations.
