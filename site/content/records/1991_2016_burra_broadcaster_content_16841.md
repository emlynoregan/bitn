Edith Pearce was born 91 years ago at Gladstone and later moved to Clare with her parents, older sister and brother, where they lived for some time. When her father retired from farming they moved to the Unley area of Adelaide and she attended Unley High School, though she always said she was supposed to go to nearby Methodist Ladies College as a weekly boarder "to learn manners", but she had refused the offer.  However she had no hesitation in sending her own two daughters there, so we trust that she was reasonably pleased with the end results!

Her maternal great grandparents, the Francis Pascoes and their children had come to Burra from Cornwall in I848 and first lived in a dug-out in the creek. Her grandparents lived in the Clare area where they took up land and one of their 17 children, Elizabeth would become her mother.

She had many fascinating memories - of sitting around the kitchen table aged nearly five and listening to the grownups reading aloud from the newspapers about the sinking of the Titanic; of proudly sitting up in the back of her father's first car, the one with the number 3320 (still on the family cars) as they drove through Clare, hoping that everyone would notice her.  She concluded that very few did - even if cars were still a novelty over 80 years ago.  She was also quite proud of the fact that she saw Halley's Comet twice in her life-time.  She opted to go to a Sunday School picnic rather than going to hear Dame Nellie Melba sing and also recalled walking about on one half constructed end of the Harbour Bridge during a trip to Sydney.  She enjoyed going to Test Cricket matches and saw Bradman play in Adelaide.

She loved all animals, particularly cats and was famous for giving the many creatures in the family menagerie wonderful and appropriate names  The Methodist Church and a long Methodist heritage played a large part in her religious and social life over many years and it was through one of her church’s ministers, the Reverend E.

H. Woollacott, that she met his youngest brother, Stanley, also from a Burra family of long-standing, who was ten years her senior in age.  After a long engagement, due to the fact that both had ageing parents to care for, the couple married in 1944 and came to live in the Smelts Road home which would become a happy, spacious and secure haven in which to raise us.  She was a wonderful, encouraging mother and a devoted and supportive wife.  She spent a number of quite difficult years caring for Dad at home before he needed permanent hospitalisation.

In later years after the sale of the family’s farming and grazing land, travel became one of life’s pleasures and the fact that as a fami1y, we travelled around the world together during most of 1970s set the scene for many other trips by each of us. to various parts of Australia and the globe She made her last overseas trip at the age of 85, made all the more memorable for aging her elder daughter by some 100 years when she got lost in Singapore’s massive Changi Airport for an hour!

She was very well read, loved music, especially that termed Classical, and passed those loves on to us from an early age by constantly reading to us and introducing us to music, although our piano lessons didn’t bear much fruit!

Her wonderful sense of humour still surfaced even in quite recent times when there wasn’t a great deal to laugh about.  She had a great general knowledge and could answer a variety of Sale of the Century quiz questions with ease.  Her witty comments and sense of humour were almost legendary within the family even when age began to tell on her memory.

Perhaps owing to having lived through the Great Depression she liked to put things away in case they would come in useful “for school projects” or for “a rainy day”.  A large house made this habit a very easy one to nurture and judging by what she managed to keep for the projects and the rainy day, we can expect floods sometime in the near future!

Her life span of 91 years saw remarkable changes to the world into which she was born. Those years have seen a range of monarchs, governments, World Wars, and great social changes.  She happily embraced many of those changes which have ranged from the Edison waxed cylinders to compact discs and computers, from horse-drawn vehicles and primitive bi-planes to Jumbo Jets and manned space flights.  Her era spanned times of financial uncertainty to comfortable affluence for main people.  Through these nine decades she maintained a cheerful nature and disposition and even in the last few years when her quality of life declined markedly she rarely if ever complained and was polite to the end.  That she was still able to be in Burra and in our excellent Hospital, with its caring staff, would have meant a great deal to her.

Her death last Sunday morning came as a relief from the burden of a heavy load and we commend her to

God’s loving care.

Throughout her long life, she never lost her faith in His goodness.  We will constantly remember her for the wonderful person that she was and are grateful to be able to say that we are her daughters.

Mary and Ruth

Woollacott.
