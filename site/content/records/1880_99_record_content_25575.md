Obituary & Inquest.  The inquest was held at the Riverton Court House on 17 May on the body of Hermann Lummer who had been thrown from his trap on the 16 May.

Dr Frank Alwork said he found the deceased to be dead when summoned to the site of the accident.  At the hospital later he found the neck to be broken, but no suggestion of foul play.

Leo Lummer, son of the deceased, said he came home and found the horse and trap at the pannels [sic?]  with reins hanging loose.  He drove back and found his father lying on his back on the road by Mr Browningâ€™s house.  His father was aged 48.

George Purdy gave evidence of seeing the deceased in Riverton about 8 p.m. and that he was then under the influence of liquor.

M-C Henry Bushell said he had known the deceased to be drunk on other occasions and that he believed the deceased had fallen out of the vehicle and broken his neck.  The jury agreed with him and gave their fees to the widow who is left with five children in poor circumstances.  A subscription list has been started in Riverton.
