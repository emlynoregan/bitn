Weather.  Good rains have fallen at last with 156 points at Burra and more in some parts of the district: Booborowie reports 212 points and World’s End 180.  At Mt Bryan East Mr Vic. Hughes reported 150 points of rain and glorious falls of snow on Saturday.  To the east it remained dry with falls up to 10 points, though to the northeast Ketchowla got 65.

[Somewhat oddly the report then cites Thistlebeds as getting 54 and Balah 19.]

Intense cold after shearing has resulted in some places experiencing heavy stock losses.  There were gales with dust to the east on Friday.
