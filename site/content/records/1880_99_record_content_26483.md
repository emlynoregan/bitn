Children’s Jubilee Exhibition Excursion.

Cr Sampson has offered a £1-1-0 prize for the best account written by a child of last Friday’s trip to the Exhibition.  Mr J. Lewis JP has offered 10/6 as a second prize and Hugh McCallum a third prize of 5/-.  The papers must not bear the writer’s name, simply a word or motto and be in to the Mayor by 1 Nov.

The excursion passed of on Friday without a single hitch.  The whole town was astir early on Friday with lights in windows and bells ringing and whistles blowing.  Cr Sampson arranged for a fleet of vehicles to take children to the station.  The train of seven carriages and a brake-van was one carriage shorter than expected.  Forms were placed in the brake-van to make room for all.  The engine was decorated with wreaths of flowers.  The crowds of onlookers made loading a little more confused than was planned, but all was ready for departure at 6.05 a.m. with 455 children and 175 teachers and other adults.  A contingent of 43 joined at Farrell’s Flat.  Adelaide was reached only a few minutes late and the train then moved to the Exhibition Grounds, being the first passenger train to do so, arriving just after 10.00 a.m.  Entrance money of £9-12-6 was paid by Mr W.B. Rounsevell.  The children were identified by ribbon badges bearing the inscription ‘Burra Children’s Jubilee Demonstration, October 14, 1887’.  Lunch was taken at noon.  At 4 they were addressed by Mr Holder who announced the competition cited above.  The Adelaide Mayor was unfortunately otherwise engaged.  The trip home was pleasant reaching Burra shortly before 9.00 p.m.
