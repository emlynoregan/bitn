Mongolata Goldfield

Terry’s Claim sent away 4 tons 15cwt to Peterborough and the return was 3oz 4dwt per ton

On Slater & Hogan’s Claim they went down 20ft and lost the seam, but found it again on driving in at the level where they first struck good stuff.

Byles’ Claim is doing well.

Tom Villis & party have driven into the hill c. 160ft, but so far have no returns beyond traces.

Syd. McHugh MP writes that the Minister is considering buying a portable battery for the mine – a permanent one not being worthwhile till the field is proven.

A consignment of boots, overcoats and other items of clothing is being sent up from military stores.

The Mayor has received an answer to the resolutions passed by the Prospectors’ Assoc. from the Director of Mines, L. Keith Ward, dated 29 May 1931.

The Government cannot allow a larger ration for one sector of the community.  Little timber is needed and is available locally.  If the men will submit a tender for the supply of 2,000 gallons of water a week we will do something.  It is not possible to forgo the motor licence fee.  Installation of a battery is not at present justified.  No arrangements can be made for free carriage and crushing of 10 tons of ore.  There is already provision for free crushing of 25 tons of ore from a new property, if it is deemed justified by the General Manager of State Batteries.  No preferential treatment concerning boots and clothing is possible.  The Unemployment Relief Council will soon issue clothing and some more tools will be sent.  A tent will be sent when the enclosed form is completed for the man needing one.
