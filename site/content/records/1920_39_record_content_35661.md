A.B. Riggs writes again on the Burra DC assessment. He says that Button has missed the point at issue.  Riggs was merely pointing out the inconsistencies between the % reduction and the words used in the explanation.  The manner of Mr Button’s appointment or what people said had nothing to do with either Riggs or his letter – which was also written before the Town Council had considered its assessment.  In any case unimproved land values in the DC offer a very different basis for assessment from annual rental values that are used in the town’s assessment.  These have been kept high by: ‘High wages, the result of iniquitous Arbitration Court Awards.’  The municipality could not reduce rental values by a fixed %.
