Mr Holder met his committee Thursday night at the Institute.  A large group had assembled without any asking from Holder.  There are also committees of support for him at Jamestown, Terowie, Saddleworth, Manoora and elsewhere.  At Renmark where there are 200 electors he would have difficulty getting there during the campaign.  He will visit them before the election is formally announced.  He was not running with any other candidate and his supporters could place their second vote where they liked.  He considered himself between the National Defence League on one hand and the Labor Party on the other as a democrat who believed in liberal legislation which would benefit the whole of SA.
