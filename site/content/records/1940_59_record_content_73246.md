Burra Branch if the ANZ is converting to mechanised book-keeping.  It was installed on Friday by Specialist Machine Operator Miss L.M .Williams.  In future statements will be available immediately on application and will always be typed in stead of hand written as in the past.  The change in branches across SA would boost the number of congenial occupations available for girls, which will be particularly important in country towns, where work suitable for girls was often limited.
