CWA’s 80th Birthday

Mary Warnes was a young girl from the city when she married Isaac Warnes [in 1900] and went to live at Koomooloo Station.  Her sister married Thomas William Warnes [at the end of 1900] and lived at Old Koomooloo, some 7 miles away.  They were quite isolated in the days before telephones and with horse transport.  Once a week the sisters rode bicycles to a point about halfway between the two homesteads and had a couple of hours chat over a cup of tea.  This was Mrs Warnes’ only contact with another woman.  Years later the family moved to their ‘inside’ property ‘Wahroonga’ some 12 miles from Burra  and Mrs Warnes thought about making the life of the outback woman less isolated.  At a National Council of Women’s meeting in 1926 Mrs Warnes learnt what had been done in other states by the opening up of women’s rest rooms and this became her goal – a ROOM IN Burra where country wives could rest and relax, tend the baby, make a cup of tea and meet and chat with others on their infrequent trips into town.  In November 1926 Mrs Warnes formed the Burra Country Women’s Service Assoc.  This first organisation at Burra became the first branch of what evolved into the SA Country Women’s Association.    An Adelaide branch with a rest room above a city store followed in 1928.  Other branches followed.  Mrs Warnes served as the State President 1929-41.  In WWII was very active in patriotic activities, notably in providing meals to troops trains in transit from the south to Darwin via Quorn and Alice Springs.  It was also the official camouflage net supplier to the Australian Army.  Other activities of the CWA have included setting up retirement homes at Clare and Quorn, the establishment of hostels and a holiday cottage service.  From the 1960s a changing economy saw more country women taking up paid employment.  SACWA membership fell from 14,500 to fewer than 4,000 in 2000.  Increasing regulation also saw the organisation relinquish many of its accommodation services.  It retains its central headquarters and a hostel and remains as an advocate for country women and their families.  It continues in the 21st century to provide relief in times of recession and natural disasters.  It supports local communities, the Royal Flying doctor Service, funds cancer research and lobbies for better support for the education of country students.  The CWA Café at the Adelaide Royal Show made $48,000 profit last year and Lauke’s scone mix and recipe book are its main fund raisers.  Locally, in 2007, along with many other small branches, the Burra branch in the SACWA Goyder Group closed.  The Southern Goyder Group has since been forced to amalgamate with the former Mt Remarkable Group to form the Frome Group with only eight branches remaining – Orroroo, Morchard, Wilmington, Yunta, Yongala, Jamestown, Booleroo Centre and Murraytown.  The Frome Group is holding a Show Day at Morchard on 19 October.
