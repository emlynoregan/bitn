Burra Town Council

The recent visit to seek a special £200 road grant had been well received, but the Minister said the Government was short of money.  If any should be available they would get it.  Also Mr Piper K.C. advises the Council to fight out the case of the closure of Smelts Road.  His advice was that they had an excellent case whether or not they had done work on the section of road.

Cr Kellaway said the road had been the property of the old Smelting Co. and they had thrown it open to public use and therefore Mr Riggs had no right to fence it.

Cr Kellock said there had been no complaints about the closure and moved the Council take no further action in the matter.  Carried.  [On the face of it this seems an extraordinary reaction unless it refers to a different section of road from that currently designated Smelts Road.]

Cr Kellaway voted against and the Mayor was very disappointed in the Councillors’ stand.

Details are then presented of the repairs needed on the main road from Kooringa to the station.
