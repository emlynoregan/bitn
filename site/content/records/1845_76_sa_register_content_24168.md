Ironmine Primitive Methodist Chapel saw its opening sermons preached by Rev. H.J. Pope, the circuit minister, on Sunday 1 October.  On Monday a public tea was well patronised.  Mr T. Hutchins presided and Mr Pope spoke of the lessons of the late war [presumably meaning the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71].

‘There were as characteristic of Germany, he believed, universality and unity of effort, great promptitude, large expenditure, and much prayer was offered for victory.  This, he held, was the way the church should carry on her warfare.’

The Redruth Choir sang well chosen hymns.  The new chapel was built by J. & T. Pearce of Kooringa for a total cost of c. £140 and the proceeds of the services were c. £40.
