E.C. Allen’s Bomb

On 27 September a parcel bomb was addressed to E.C. Allen MP for Burra at Parliament House, Adelaide.  It had been posted in a letter box in Adelaide in the afternoon of 27thand delivered to Mr Allen at Parliament House. Believing it to be a parcel of goods his wife had purchased at John Martin’s, because of a label on it, he took it home to Spalding without opening it.  Mrs Allen opened the parcel slowly and the bomb, which was exposed when she removed the lid of the box, failed to explode.  CIB members attended with the Army bomb disposal squad and rendered the bomb harmless.  It was in a parcel 6 inches x 2½ inches x 2½ inches.  It was rigged so that a Schermuly ‘Mars’ hand flare connected to a .243 Metallverken make cartridge would trigger gelignite.  Scientists discovered that dust on the wood in the bomb has come from the Burra North area.  Detectives have been conducting investigations in the area from 12 November and the Government has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the sender.
