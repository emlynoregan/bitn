On Wednesday the Mayor and Dr Sangster interviewed the Commissioner of Public Works, R.W. Foster and the Hydraulic Engineer, Mr Beyer, to get some reduction in the Waterworks account.  They sought a reduction of £2,000 from the capital account.  This was flatly refused, as was one of £1,000.  The works were inspected.  They asked then for the remission of the current half-year’s rent of £162 and they are hopeful that this might be granted.  Expenditure has been £200 more than the income for the past two years and at present the account holds £80.  This really means the remission of four year’s rent at 4%.
