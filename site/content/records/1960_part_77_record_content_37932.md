Burra National Trust held its AGM and elected: President, S.J. Woollacott; Vice-President, W.L. Moore; Secretary, Mrs B. Fitzpatrick; Treasurer, Mrs C. O’Connor.

The President reported visitors to the Museum from around the world as well as many district organisations and schools.  Some 1,300 have signed the visitors’ book.  The Museum has helped put Burra back on the map.  The highlight for the year was the visit of the National Trust from Adelaide, which was a great success.  The other three rooms of the building have now been renovated and we now have our own meeting room and a building and museum of importance to Burra.
