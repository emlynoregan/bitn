Cr J. Allen for West Ward writes in response to Mr Treloar’s letter.

He says he was not aware of any petition until a Councillor called and informed him and he thought it cast a slur on West Ward Councillors.

Mr Treloar mentioned it to me on the day of the meeting and I said I would object as it amounted to a no-confidence motion, though Mr Treloar said it was not intended to belittle the Councillors.  I was not aware he and Cr Collins had inspected the West Ward together and therefore was quite right to deny knowledge of it.  When work needed has been suggested I have always brought the matter forward and there are not many cases where work has been shelved as suggested by Mr Treloar.  Those now in office are doing their best for West Ward and the town generally.
