Powered Paraglider Flight

Two Canadian adventurers, Mark Jennings-Bates and Glenn Derouin, have undertaken a journey across Australia in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record.  The journey from Townsville to Perth covers some 9,000 km. The event is also raising money for the Royal Flying Doctor and a Canadian charity, Rally4Life.  One leg of the journey featured a take-off from a site near Burra after seven weeks on the journey.  Mark set off for Port Augusta from Burra on Monday evening.
