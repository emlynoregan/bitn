The Methodist Executive Committee of Laymen, led by H.J.B. Jennison, drew 350 people to the Church Family Dinner to hear about the Circuit Planned Giving Program.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone chaired the meeting.  Mr S.J. Woollacott told the history of Methodism in the community.  Services were held first here in 1847 and few communities in SA could boast almost 120 years of service to the community.  Other speakers were H.J.B. Jennison, F.W. Aitken and M.R. Humphrys.  The final speaker was Rev. R.S. Jenner.
