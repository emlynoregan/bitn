Burra Town Council on 8 July discussed the intention of the Department of Agriculture to enforce the Noxious Weeds Act within the town.  There was plenty of Bathurst burr, three-cornered jacks and wild onion within the town.  Cr S.J. Woollacott thought the Council was the worst offender with respect to noxious weeds.  The owner of the Ballast Quarry Paddock will be informed that the Town Council is being pressed by the District Council to see that he eradicated wild onions from the property.  If he did not do so, Council would act at his expense.
