Burra High School’s 43rd Speech Night and Banquet was held at the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday 13 December.  Mrs G. Stanley hawker gave an address, which was a mixture of a travel talk, philosophy and advice to children.  She encouraged the children to look for ideals and strive to reach them.  Wayne Sibly, the Advertiser Travel Youth, gave an outstanding summary of his trip to and around the UK and anyone present who had contributed to the cost of Wayne’s trip must have felt very proud to have had such a boy representing us overseas.

Mr H.J.B. Jennison, as Chairman of the High School Council, presented the prizes and certificates.  The second half of the program was a series of presentations by pupils.
