Burra Rail Centenary.  Extract from the SA Register, 30 August 1870.

Monday 29 August was set for the opening of the North Extension Line.  The date was chosen chiefly because the MPs legislative duties prevented them from visiting Burra on the four successive days.

A local committee of 30-40 residents arranged the public demonstration, chaired by Mr W.H. Rosman, manager of the National Bank.  The select train started soon after 8 a.m. with a Vice-Regal and Ministerial Party.  [The official party is then listed.]

There was an official welcome at Saddleworth and then at 12.45 the special came within inspection distance of the Aberdeen terminus where it was met by 'a host of strong, healthy looking men, hearty matrons, rosy cheeked damsels and a reserve of children such as only a mining community can boast of.'

All available space was adorned with pine and wattle boughs and the buildings set off with a display of evergreens ;which might have been Birnham Wood come back again to Dunsinane, as in the days of Macbeth.'

The goods shed had been clothed in evergreens till it looked like a bower 100 ft x 40 ft and the Carriage shed was similar on a smaller scale.  The select carriages arrived at 1 p.m. and His Excellency and party were conducted to a special reserve adjoining the cattle platform.  A round of loyal cheers followed from the crowd of c. 3,000

'The local ordnance had fired an irregular salute.'

[Mr W.H. Rosman’s address to the Governor is printed as is His Excellency’s reply.]
