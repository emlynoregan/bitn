Local Land Grab

Returned soldiers are bitterly criticising Government policy that permits large landowners in the district to acquire more land to the detriment of returned men.

Pte O’Connor, a returned soldier voiced his and his comrade’s dissatisfaction at a public welcome home in the Burra Town Hall last Friday.  He said he could cite two cases in the last six months of big landowners in the Mt Bryan District buying out smaller farmers.  Returned men, if given the chance, could have bought this land and made a living from it.

The Mayor agreed that the situation was unsatisfactory.  Much of the first class land around Burra was passing into the hands of large landowners.  Returned men were being told to go and look at land in the South East or Kangaroo Island.  Much of that land was uncleared, meaning much hardship while it was prepared for farming.

The consent of the Delegate to the Federal Treasurer is required before acquiring property and this is supposed to prevent one person or company from acquiring too much, but it is clear the system does not work.  When placing returned men on the land, the land is pooled and lots drawn for it.  This means a man from this district might draw land in the South East, where he would have to learn new farming and grazing conditions.
