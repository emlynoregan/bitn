I.J. Warnes writes re the Burra Hospital elections.  He is concerned that on 21 June certain of the candidates for election to the board would be in favour of the two doctors in the town having equal rights to treat patients at the hospital.  [i.e. M. Collins, E.J. Davey, H. Morgan, W.H. Sandland & P.J. Sampson as in an advertisement that was repeated on 28 June.]

He points out that the Board has been working to bring this about for some time.  In November 1920 Dr Steele & Dr Ashton wrote asking for Dr Ashton to be appointed a visiting Medical officer with the same privileges as Dr Steele.  This request was granted giving Dr Ashton the same right to private practice and to charge fees as Dr Steele – subject to the consent of the Chief Secretary.  On 23 December 1920 Dr Ashton was so advised and gave an intimation that the Chief Secretary had approved.  Only in July 1921 did Dr Ashton refuse the appointment.  On 27 July 1921 the Board advised that the offer was still open in the terms of the joint application of 15 November 1920.  He was advised that Model By-laws passed by the Board and Government and signed by the Governor specifically allow for this.  At the very least since December 1920 Dr Ashton could admit patients if he so wished.  I am not a candidate for election and have no axe to grind – merely wishing to put the facts before the public.
