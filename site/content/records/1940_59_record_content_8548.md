Numbering of Issues in 1941.

The year began with an error in numbering: Volume 61, Number 1(2) 7 January 1941, instead of Volume 62.

This was corrected the next issue to Volume 62, Number 2 on 14 January 1941.

And continued to Volume 62, Number 51 on 23 December 1941.

There were several anomalies:

There was no Number 1 in the volume.

Number 32 was used twice on 12 August and 19 August: there was no Number 33.

Number 42 was used twice on 21 September and 28 September and Number 43 was used for 4 November.

Number 46 appeared on 25 November and Number 48 on 2 December: there was no Number 47.
