Burra’s Flagpoles have been removed and are being restored and painted in time for this year’s Remembrance Day.  Captain Dave Jennings oversaw their removal and renovation.  He hopes the one outside the Burra Hotel can be placed more prominently between the Rotunda and the War Memorial and hopes to have this completed for this year’s Remembrance Day.

[This is an oddly timed article, given that it appeared on Remembrance Day.]
