Burra Hospital was gazetted formally as a subsidised hospital about six weeks ago and shortly the various councils will have to strike a rate to pay a portion of its upkeep.  Each council will then have a representative on the Board of Management.  Ratepayers will elect the others: unless in the unlikely event subscribers contribute one-sixth of the cost.
