Since 1955 a Melbourne Cup Luncheon has been held to support the Hospital.  In that time the committee has raised some $14,000 with Government subsidy.  The President of the Committee in 1969 was Mrs L. Bence.  Last Tuesday the tradition continued with 200 women at the luncheon in Burra Town Hall, which this year raised over $500.
