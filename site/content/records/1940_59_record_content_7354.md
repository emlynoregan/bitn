Obituary.  Waldemar G. Hawkes has died at his residence in North Adelaide.  He was one of the state’s most prominent pastoralists and sheep breeders.  He was the managing director and founder of the well-known Koonoona Stud near Burra and had interests in other properties in SA, NSW and WA.  He was a son of the late Sidney M. Hawkes, barrister, and was born in London in 1863, coming to SA at the aged of 15½ years.  He began his pastoral career as a jackeroo on Koonoona before going to Moorara Station on the Darling, where he gained experience in stud breeding.  When a drought struck Moorara, he returned to SA and became manager of the Burra Branch of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.  Some years later he accepted the position as manager of Koonoona from the trustees of the late Walter Duffield.  Judicious investment in Broken Hill Mines etc. he accumulated considerable capital and as senior partner in Hawkes & Daskein, he purchased the Morden group of stations in western NSW, comprising Morden, Wonnaminta, Packsaddle, Cobham, Mt Arrowsmith and Wyarra, totalling 1,500,000 acres.  He had an interest too in properties in the Southeast, Bolgart (WA) and Tarmoola Pastoral country of Leonora, WA.  Later he acquired a quarter interest in Koonoona Proprietors, then newly formed, to continue his sheep breeding activities.  While at Koonoona he was prominent in many activities in Burra.  He was for many years the Chairman of the Burra Hospital Board and gave generous financial support to many Burra projects.  He made a number of financial donations to St Mary’s Church, most notably the handsome memorial window in the southern end of the building.  In the Great War he was prominent in patriotic work and was seldom absent from the welcomes accorded returning men at the Burra Railway Station.  He retired to Adelaide some years ago.  He was one of the oldest members of the Stockowners’ Association of SA, a past president and a member of the council.  He was also President of the Stud Merino Breeders’ Association for five years.  In 1887 he married Miss Isabella McBride, a daughter of the late R.J. M. McBride of Burra, who predeceased him.  He is survived by two sons and three daughters: Messrs Glen G. Hawkes (Koonoona) & D. Rollo Hawkes (Clare); and Mesdames P.C. Head (North Adelaide), I.B. Jose (North Adelaide) and G. Law Smith (Gawler).  Another son, Lieut. W.R. Hawkes was killed in the Great War.  He was buried at Burra after a service at St Mary’s Church.  [Waldemar Gaskell Hawkes died 16 September 1941.]
