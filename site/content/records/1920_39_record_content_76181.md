Burra Racing Club held its AGM on 23 August.  M.W. Bednall presided.  The financial position had improved.  The death of Mr P.W. Clark, chairman of the committee since 1926 had been a severe loss and many of the course improvements had been achieved through his efforts.  Membership is not what it should be and a drive for more is needed.  Both the yearâ€™s meetings were successful.  The track is in good condition for the next meeting on 4 October.  It will be suggested to the Swimming Pool Committee that they hold a dance on Race Night and the Racing Committee will include advertising with their own and in the race books and through amplifiers on the day.
