Deputation re the Swimming Pool

There is a long report of the deputation already referred to.  Together with the Council discussion it extends for some 4½ columns.

On the evening of 11 April the Mayor welcomed the press and the deputation.  H.J.B. Jennison spoke first.  He presented the deputation and outlined the public meeting’s decision that a swimming pool was desirable.  He rehearsed the background of the project and the £400 loan, of the £825 tender resulting in the decision not to proceed and instead to direct the £400 into a grandstand at Victoria Park, followed by the groundswell of public opinion in favour of the pool, which led to the public meeting and the formation of the Committee and the present deputation.  He said that Mr McConnon would outline how they aimed to raise the extra funds and how they believe plan 2 can be effected for £650.

Mr McConnon was anxious to assure the Council the pool would not become a charge on the ratepayer.  He outlined the benefits of a pool in terms of physical exercise and teaching the life-saving skill of swimming.  He said allowing £700 as the cost, the Council had £400 and the Committee had promises of £100 and the Committee is sure £200 can be raised before building commences, by means of donations and organised efforts and failing that, guarantors can be found.  They asked the Council to appoint two representatives to the Swimming Pool Committee to revise plans and specifications and to formulate schemes of operation.  As long as there was a debt to service interest in raising money would be maintained.  Pay it off and interest dies.  He had seen it with Institutes.  In response to questions he said the Committee would be responsible for maintaining the pool and that at least 150 scholars from Burra School would benefit.

The Council discussion began by rescinding the motion to build a grandstand at Victoria Park and then Cr Dow went through the whole history of the thing once more.

(Continued page 4.)

The vote in favour of a grandstand was because they were then sick of mucking about and wanted to be doing something constructive.  Now feeling had changed.  He presented the petition signed by 163 people in support of a pool.

Cr Robinson was opposed to rescinding the motion and he was clearly not so certain about the ease of raising the extra £200.

Cr McWaters was also sceptical and thought any decision should be deferred until the £200 had been raised.

Cr Jeffery thought the position a little tricky after a poll approving the grandstand, but if the Council gave the Committee a chance to go on building the pool he thought the Council would not be let down.

There was then some informal discussion and eventually Crs Dow, Jeffery, Samuel & Lott supported rescinding the motion for the grandstand and Crs Robinson & McWaters were opposed.
