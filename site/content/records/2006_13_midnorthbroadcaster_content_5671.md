Burra Regional Art Gallery

Mr Len Bence declared open an exhibition of works by Nick Sara entitled ‘Abandoned’ last Friday night.  The theme of loneliness, fear and abandonment was inspired by the story of Henry Bryan, the 17-year-old who was lost in the area in 1839 during the Captain Sturt-Governor Gawler expedition.  Mt Bryan is named after him.
