Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Committee

At A meeting on 15 March Dobbie & Sons were denied permission to inscribe their names as makers of the plates – no names other than of the fallen soldiers will appear.  The PM will speak at the Institute in the evening.  Band arrangements are in hand.  Dr Steele said the RSL was arranging a church parade at the unveiling and they hoped to have a padre from each denomination present.  Rev. J.H. Nield and Rev. F.H. Durnfield were expected.  Official invitations have gone to General Leane, the Military Commandant, the Honorary Architect Mr Makin, Professor Henderson, the contractors, Members for the District, Senator Newland, the Acting Premier & the Leader of the Opposition.

Business places are asked to close and school children to attend.  Decorations are to be purple and white.

The Mayor said Mr Hughes will be presented with a gold mounted piece of malachite to the value of £5.  The committee decided this was outside their scope and a matter for the civic authorities.
