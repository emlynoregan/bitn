The recent Post Office to the south [1960] for instance interrupted the live of verandahed shops.  This sort of development should be avoided in the future.

The elimination of verandah posts and their replacement by cantilevered or hung awnings should also be resisted.  Although such awnings provide shade and shelter, the rhythm, definition of space and the measure of protection from cars provided by posts is lost.

The excuse for the elimination of posts is based on the practice of drivers parking their cars as horses were once left; with their head (or motor) in.  Today bumpers tend to overlap gutters and damage posts, which has led to the angled support or the removal of posts.  The problem is not with the posts, but with the car.
