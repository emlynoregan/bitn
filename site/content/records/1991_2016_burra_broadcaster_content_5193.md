Burra Hospital

The Health Commission has approved funding for only 9 of the 20 long stay beds and a hospital delegation met with the Minister of health Michael Armitage last week to try to solve this anomaly.  There are currently 17 long term patients.  Dr Armitage refused to budge until being embarrassed by the Health Departmentâ€™s own apparent preparedness to fund up to 20.  He then conceded to increase the funding from 9 to 11.9 patients, but refused to give any advice on the funding of the other 5.1 patients.  Written confirmation is now awaited.
