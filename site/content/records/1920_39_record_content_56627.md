Curlew Mine.  Activity is confined to extension of drives north and south at the adit level.  Some rich patches of ore were encountered, but values are very erratic and all appear to be at one side of the levels.  This property is a very difficult proposition to follow.  Values can only be detected by constant use of the dish.  The main tunnel, in my opinion, should be driven further west to prospect country in that direction, in the hope of picking up veins carrying gold that are known to exist on the surface.  34½ tons of ore were treated recently and returned 2 oz 5 dwt 6 gr per ton and from a total of 226¾ tons treated 736 oz 10 dwt 20 gr of gold have been recovered, plus a considerable amount of specimen gold not put through the battery.
