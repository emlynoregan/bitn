The Secretary of the Progress Association wrote saying that the Government had recently purchased the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry and he urged Council to try to get it re-opened as soon as possible.

The Mayor said the Government had taken out a 50 year lease on it and he understood they would not use the stone for the tanks at Hanson.

Cr Kellaway said it seemed the Government would act as a ‘Dog in the Manger’ and they should be censured; getting ballast from Sleeps Hill was false economy when Aberdeen was so much closer to Burra.

It was resolved to write to Mr McDonald MP to move in the matter.
