The Mayor thanked the Town Clerk, Mr O. Bartholomaeus for his careful attention.

Mr J. Jenkins appeared to object to the planting of trees on the road to the Mine Bridge as it was ‘beautifying private property’, but the Mayor thought it a credit to Council.

Mr Jenkins was also annoyed that the Council had acted against public opinion in the slaughterhouse issue, but the Mayor said it had been impossible to proceed on the lines resolved upon.  The Burra Council was not the only one not to have a public slaughterhouse – even Adelaide did not have one.  Cr McLaren said that the authorities seem to have realised that the Health Act as presently constituted was unworkable.  He regretted the apparent apathy of businessmen with regards to municipal matters.

Cr hardy supported the Mayor’s speech.  The £4 the North Ward was overdrawn was due to the flood early in the year.  He said the slaughterhouse question would have been settled if SAMA had not asked an exorbitant price – Mr Jenkins said: ‘They wanted £220.’

Cr Hardy: ‘They asked £500 for it.’
