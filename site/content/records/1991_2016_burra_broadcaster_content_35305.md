Letter.  Jennifer Carter writes in response to Mr Bence’s attack on Dr Roger Cross.  She picks up on Mr Bence’s comment of Dr Cross as ‘a newcomer with views to residency’ and a sneering reference to his education ‘with perhaps a few letters after his name’.  She says Mr Bence dismisses the merits of Australian Tertiary Education.  She has noticed the tendency of longer term residents to attack any newcomer who presumes to express opinions that fail to match their own.
