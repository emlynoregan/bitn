‘A Ratepayer’ writes suggesting that instead of planting trees on a fine open space by the school that is useful for active sports, the children plant red gums along the bed of the creek.  The old butts indicate where they used to grow there – not of course in the main flow, but at the edges thereof and not too close together to encourage a spreading growth.  World’s End and Princess Royal indicate the benefits.
