Shooting Accident.  David Stock of Campbelltown was lucky to escape serious injury over Easter while shooting on Flagstaff.  A companion was unloading a .32 automatic pistol when it slipped and discharged.  The bullet went through his wrist without doing much damage and came to rest in his pocket, lodged against a 12 gauge cartridge.
