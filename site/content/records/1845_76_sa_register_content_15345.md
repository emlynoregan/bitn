Obituary/Death.  An inquest was held this morning before Dr Mayne JP at the White Hart Inn, Redruth [sic: actually at Aberdeen].  Charles Wolfe, a hut-keeper at one of Hallett’s northern stations, had been ill for two or three weeks and on being brought down for medical advice, had died at Gottlieb’s Wells (McCulloch’s) and was then brought on to the White Hart.

Israel Lowe:

Knew deceased and saw him alive about 7.20 a.m. yesterday morning at Gottlieb’s Wells.  He was then seriously ill and I had brought him in a cart from Mr Hallett’s station to seek medical attention.  He had been ill three or four weeks.  He was a hut-keeper at one of the out stations and had to draw water for 1,600 sheep.  He came to the head station and said he was too ill to carry out his work.  He had great difficulty in breathing, but no cough.  He got worse on the way down and I thought he would die at Paratoo.  He took no nourishment on the journey.  He had difficulty in swallowing and took only water.  I don’t believe he was ill-treated by anybody and died naturally.  When we left the station he had two small bags, a handkerchief, a pocket-book and an order for £1-10-6.  I have not given them to the police because he gave them to me for raking care of him.  I asked him if he had any friends or relatives and he said: ‘There is nobody that cares for me, and I care for nobody.’

He said all I had to do for him was to drive the cart as gently as possible; which I did.  When I first saw him he looked like a healthy man, but I noticed he breathed with difficulty.

Dr Maurau:

I examined the body of the deceased Charles Wolfe.  I found no marks of violence.  The body has the appearance of a person who has been ill two or three weeks.  I have heard the evidence of Israel Lowe and believe the appearance of the body corroborates his account of the illness and death of the deceased.  I believe the deceased died from inflammation of the lungs and has probably had a disease of the lungs and perhaps also of the heart, for some time.  I have not moral doubt that he died from natural causes.  The jury returned a verdict of death by the visitation of God, but also commented that there had been neglect with regard to seeking medical aid.

[The SA Deaths CD must be in error in recording the death of Charles Wolfe as 28 February [sic] 1862 at Gottlieb’s Well North, residence Winnininnie aged 30.]
