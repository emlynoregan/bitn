Cr Ridgway as Chairman of the Waterworks Committee felt it was his place to move the adoption of the memorial, but first corrected a mistake in his speech in Council.  The interest they were being charged was calculated correctly as they were being charged 5% on the cost of the services.

As for the capital cost.  It was stated in a letter from A.P. Lungley that the old works had cost £912 complete, but in fact the records show that £832 had been granted for the work of which £65 was returned unexpended.  The Council was only leasing part of the old works - 30 chains of 3” main, 10 chains of 2” main, 2 water troughs, 1 standpipe, and 15 meters.  The only Government cost was for the materials; the consumers having paid for the labour.  The whole cost to the government could not have exceeded £250.

Cr West said there were three vital points in the memorial: -

A larger engine would run on half the fuel for half the time.

Details of the costs were essential.  The costs cited were very much above the original estimate and payable interest was up by 75%.

They had been charged extravagant prices for almost everything.

Dr Brummitt did not agree with the memorial.  In the memorial much was made of details while the chief point was left to last.  It was infinitely the most important and should be the first point.  It was a long and hard battle to get a promise from the Commissioner of Public Works, Mr Playford that the materials would be charged at cost.  If the capital account included a profit of 75% the Council would have been better off foregoing the Government’s low % interest rate and doing the work on borrowed money itself, at a higher rate of interest.  The promise was in a letter to Dr Cockburn and was conveyed to the Hydraulic Engineer.  The Hydraulic Engineer, when sending the cost particulars to Council, had written at the bottom: ‘The above are cost prices, Adelaide’.  This is remarkable when the portion of the Public Works Department signed by him proved that it was not so.

Dr Cockburn was prepared to defeat this attempt to break the promise given and they only need ask and they were sure to have justice and a considerably reduced total on which to pay interest.

When he had written his report as Mayor last year he had written for the cost to date and an estimate for the completion of the whole then fell a long way short of £3,000 at that stage.  If at the end of November last it was under £3,000 how could it have reached £5,652 by the end of December?

As for the first item about the engine.  He had asked Mr Jobson whose opinion was respected and he said it was not so much the engine as another pump and the engine was quite able to work two pumps, so there was really no difficulty at all.  Jobson suggested the Hydraulic Engineer be asked to allow the old pump to remain with the new until another was obtained if it proved necessary.  If the two pumps could raise 5,000 gallons per hour and the tank held 30,000 gallons and was never emptied, the engine would be sufficient.  As to the land - it was desirable, but not worth making a point of.

The Mayor said it was not whether the engine could do the job, but whether the larger would not be cheaper.

The Mayor said: -

12 horsepower pump at 45 lb/in2 cost £84-16-6

6 horsepower pump at 60 lb/in2 cost £140-8-0

Mr Holder said he thought the Council deserved thanks for their efforts to come to best terms with the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department and he desired to help them as far as possible, but he was very much disappointed with the memorial as read.

The one point of injustice was in reference to the charging more than the net cost of works and materials.  He had believed that in dealing with a Government Department the head of which had no purpose of his own to serve, they could rely on being charged actual cost for everything and had no reason to believe they would be otherwise treated.

With the evidence supplied he was forced to the conclusion that something was wrong and must be set right.  Strange to say the memorial did not ask for the one thing they all wanted.  It asked for:

A larger engine

More land

Details of cost

It did not ask that the overcharge should be taken off.  As for the engine - there was no doubt it was big enough when ordered and it was unreasonable to ask the Government to keep it for months or years till they found a use for it when it would do all that was required.

As to the land - several streets were only 33’ wide and accommodated more traffic than would pass the shaft.  Land could be spared from the street without difficulty.  They could have closed the street without extra cost while they were closing the one near Tiver & Preece’s.

They had Mr Mestayer’s promise in writing to allow someone from Council to see the books and papers and obtain the figures of costs.  He had enough faith in Mr Mestayer that if the Town Clerk went down he could get what was needed without troubling the Commissioner.  He hoped Dr Brummitt would move an amended memorial.

Cr Ridgway contended it would be impracticable to close the road due to possible/probable litigation from adjacent property holders.

Dr Brummitt said that when the question of the site was first raised the Corporation solicitor advised that there would be no difficulties in closing the road and no opposition would be likely to succeed.

The Mayor suggested they should add to the memorial at the beginning a clause asking the Government to insist on the promise to charge only net cost be carried out.

In answer to Mr T.W. Pearce the Mayor said the amount of water the railways were expected to have required was from 10,000 to 12,000 gallons per day in summer and little or none in winter.  There was no need to press the matter as in the coming summer the Railway Department would be obliged to ask the Corporation to supply them and this made the larger engine more important.

Mr Bartle the Engineer at the Waterworks, said last summer the highest consumption was 49,500 gallons per week, but there were many more services now.

Dr Brummitt moved an amendment that a memorial to the Commissioner of Public Works be prepared asking that the promise of the late Commissioner, Mr Playford, that the net cost only should be charged, be carried out.

Cr West could not see the difference between that and the proposition.

Dr Brummitt said it dealt with one matter only and left the others out.

Cr Ridgway was unwilling to let the other matters go and so delay settlement of matters.

Mr Holder 2nd the amendment.

The other matters should not be forgotten, but dealt with in another way and not as a grievance.

Mr P. Lane supported the amendment, which was then carried 4 to 6.

Cr Ridgway said if he were in the deputation he would raise the other matters.

The Mayor would raise the question of the larger engine.

The deputation will be: The Mayor, Cr Ridgway, Hons J. Martin, H.E. Bright, Dr Cockburn & Mr Rounsevell MP.
