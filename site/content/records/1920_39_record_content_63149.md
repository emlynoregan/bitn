F.L. Worth writes to correct a statement attributed to him in the paper to the effect that the Floral Float had proved a better and cheaper advertisement for the town than ant stud ram that ever lived in the district.  What he actually said was ‘the float … might possibly prove to be as effective an advertisement for the town as the stud rams bred in the district – noted for its stud sheep.’
