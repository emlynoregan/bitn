Obituary.  Dr Elliott Brummitt died in Adelaide on Monday.  Many folk remember his father the late Dr Robert Brummitt, though it is many years since he left Burra.  Dr Elliott Brummitt was born in Kooringa in 1880 and spent his boyhood here before going to Prince Alfred College.  He saw several years of service in the Great War.  His only brother Dr R.D. (Bob) Brummitt died about two years ago [21 May 1933].  He is survived by his widow, his mother and two sisters: Mrs S. Forsyth & Miss Gladys Brummitt.

[Elliott Arthur Brummitt born 8 April 1880 at Kooringa: died 25 June 1934 Medindie.]
