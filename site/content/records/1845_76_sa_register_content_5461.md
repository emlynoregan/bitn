A Trip to Kooringa

An SA colonist who has not visited Burra has neglected to inspect a marvel.  It is a triumph of co-operative enterprise, liberality and economy, as credible to its directors as it is profitable to its owners and beneficial to the colony.  I enquired as to the most expeditious and cheapest mode of visiting Burra Burra.  A seat was suggested in the travelling chariot with the Directors on one of their periodic visits to the Mine.  Not knowing the Directors and not wishing to wait for such a grand occasion, I took a seat in the mail cart, a van-shaped vehicle covered with canvas and capable of containing about ten passengers.  The proprietor, whose easy manner put everyone in good humour, managed to stow twelve in it.  Even an old lady whose bonnet box was cruelly crushed declared that no one could be angry with Mr Chambers.  He went at a brisk pace through Hindmarsh, descending gullies and scaling banks with great confidence.  When conversation began when we got fairly on the lower road, each assured the rest that the dust was intolerable.  One of the passengers said he had just returned from California, of which he gave a graphic account.  He had saved a good sum at the Burra Burra and wishing to try his fortune in exchanging copper for gold, set off for San Francisco.  His degree of success could be judged from his wasted face and squalid appearance.  [His story then continues for several paragraphs.]

We left Adelaide at c. 3.30 p.m. and reached Gawler Town at about 7 p.m.  We put up at the Old Spot where Mr Schmidt maintained the reputation of the place established by its founder, Mr Calton.  The next morning the group divided.  The Kapunda passengers went on in a spring cart.  Burra Burra passengers continued in a spring cart without any covering.  The horses too were greatly inferior and had but one shoe among the four of them and one with a swollen leg and the others with worn hoofs, so that it was with great difficulty they were induced to move at all.  On arrival at She Oak Log there were no fresh horses ready and the mail was handed over to the driver of the spring cart, which could proceed much faster.  Progress to Kapunda was slow and one of the passengers had often to alight to flog the crippled horse, but eventually the driver was compelled to set it free – which had he done it at first would have saved much time.

We breakfasted at Ferrant’s just on entering Kapunda where everything was in good order and readiness, despite our much delayed arrival.  Newcomers of the roughest class joined the vehicle here and soon made a seat in the mail cart a very unenviable position.  One of the men was a fine specimen of the ‘old colonial bore’, who insisted on recounting his hair-raising adventures.  He was, however, eclipsed by the arrival of an Irish wench whose gross language and forward behaviour is beyond description.  The coarse behaviour and conversation continued till we reached the Burra Hotel.

At the Burra Hotel it was Saturday night and the part set aside for the sale of strong drink was full of people in every condition from sober through exhilarated and joyous to quarrelsome and singing and crying drunk.  Germans were singing a chorus in one corner and Welsh smelters were listening to a Celtic solo in another.  Cornish miners, English and Scotch mechanics and Irish labourers all combined to swell the mighty discord.

In contrast the hotel rooms were spacious, cool and well-furnished apartments, where the din of voices was softened by distance.  The waiter glided noiselessly about and I enjoyed a hearty dinner and went out for a moonlight view of Kooringa.  It differed in no respect from any other thriving town.  There were a number of large shops and a great concourse of people marketing in a quiet and orderly fashion.  I did not see one policeman, or any occasion for one.

[When this article was reprinted in the Burra Record 94, 38, 3 Oct. 1972, pages 1 & 8, a note was added, presumably by Ian Auhl:

‘The towns of Redruth and Aberdeen had only been laid out in August 1849, which explains why the writer does not refer to them.  The population of Kooringa including the dugouts was 4,300 in 1850.]

The next day was Sunday and the Sabbath was strictly observed.  Besides the [Anglican] Church there were chapels for the Wesleyans, Independents and Primitive Methodists and the Roman Catholics and divine service in a private house.

There are several streets and the houses are generally well built.  In some places are rows of substantial stone cottages built by the company.  The chimneys of one of them having as much masonry as would suffice for two of the flimsy building society cottages which disgrace the streets of Adelaide.  There seems to be an abundance of good stone in Kooringa, which the inhabitants are putting to good use.

One of Kooringa’s most singular features is the subterranean habitations of ‘The Creek’.  For a distance of more than two miles the banks of a ravine are perforated with vaulted chambers in which a populous is living in apparent health and comfort.  From above those dwellings (to which some future etymologist, with the accuracy characteristic of his study, will trace the name of Burra (Burrow)), present a squalid, but exceedingly diversified and picturesque appearance.  Some are quite cottage-like in their exterior, having stone fronts, well proportioned doors and windows, with verandahs and fences guarding the approach.  In those cases the earth is cut away to give a perpendicular front and that secures a sort of terrace before the door.  But in many instances there is merely a horizontal cut running far enough into the bank to gain a height for an approach to a door with a similar cut of smaller proportions for a window and the rest of the house is a perforation of the bank continued from these apertures.  In most cases the chimney is level with the surface, or raised a foot or two by a pile of a few stones or partially embedding a headless flour or ale cask.  Accidents sometimes happen when night walkers fall down the chimneys.  Their arms generally arrest their descent, but they remain caught until rescued by an occupant from below, either furious or friendly as the case may be.

On Monday I visited the Mine, which is situated on the side of a hill.  A considerable stream of water flows down the acclivity fed by the steam engine, which works incessantly day and night raising nearly 800 gallons of water every minute.  Diverted into suitable channels, it carries on the work of washing ore and an immense space is occupied by heaps of rich green and blue ore in every stage of preparation, from the immense masses sent up by the miners to be washed and pulverised and carefully packed into canvas bags for removal by bullock drays to the port, or to the smelting works of the Patent Copper Co. on the other side of the creek.  Under extensive sheds men and boys of all sizes carry on the operation of ore crushing etc.

The revolving whims and ceaseless stroke of the immense pump excited at once a dread and uneasy desire to visit the workings underground.  Introduced by Captain Roach to the Captain’s Changing Room, I was equipped with a candle in one hand and a piece of tempered clay in the other.  I followed the guide to whose care Captain Roach assigned me.  We went under a shed near a whim and the top of a ladder protruded from a hole just large enough to allow a man to descend.  My guide lit the candle and surrounded it with tempered clay, which he stuck against my hat and told me to follow him.  We descended about 16 feet to a landing and then took another ladder and so on until we had reached 30 fathoms.  My guide said we were in Peacock’s level and introduced me to several chambers where vast deposits of malachite and other rich ores had been found.  In some places the level had been excavated through solid rock and in other parts the earth was soft and damp and there the passage was strongly timbered and boarded.  No expense seemed to be spared in securing the comfort and safety of the workers.  In places several inches of water, apparently pure and clear, flowed along the level, but above it was a boarded floor, along which the miners walked dry shod.  I frequently came to men at work.  Some said the ore they were getting was poor, but would be called very rich in England.  Others were operating on large fronts of malachite.  They said the mineral was richer and more abundant at the 40 fathom level, but as there was some feet of water in the level and the footway was wet, I had no desire to go deeper.  In the 30 fathom level I met Captain Matthews, who greeted me courteously and led me to several most remarkable places.  On emerging into the light of day I returned to the Captain’s Change Room, where the kindness of Captain Roach allowed me to make a very needful toilet.

After taking leave of Captain Roach I walked towards the works of the Patent Copper Co., but the sight of the flowing furnaces on such a hot day quite evaporated my curiosity and I returned to the Burra Hotel just in time to be present at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Kooringa and the surrounding townships.

The meeting had been called to consider the propriety of demanding municipal institutions for the united townships, but in fact the propositions put did not mention this at all.  I afterwards found that the words intimating this cause were inserted into the requisition calling the meeting to please the few who think with the Resident Magistrate that such is desirable, but the majority fear the expense of a corporation would more than outweigh its advantages and so avoided the subject.

Other matters observed:

There is a flourishing Oddfellows’ Lodge there of the Manchester Unity and it meets in a splendid room recently added to the Burra Hotel.  It possesses a library of 1,000 volumes from which it lends books at a cheap rate to all who wish to avail themselves of such a service.

The people generally think residence in the creek unhealthy, and it is certain that fever prevails there occasionally.  To me, however, the women and children appeared both numerous and healthy and on the Sunday I was in Kooringa it turned out a vast concourse of well-dressed persons who wound their way to different houses of worship.  It is thought there is a population in the creek of about 1,000 and there are at least 200 houses there.  The approaching census will give the correct numbers.  The people complain of the want of a local court of full jurisdiction and are ashamed of the hovel in which their respected Magistrate disposes justice.  There are fears that the engine pump of the mine will exhaust all the wells in the town – several having gone dry since it has been at work.

The return to Adelaide presented the same dust and delays for want of horses.

[When this article was reprinted in the Burra Record 94, 38, 3 Oct. 1972, pages 1 & 8, a note was added, presumably by Ian Auhl:

‘This three day journey to Burra in 1880 cost $2 plus overnight expenses at Gawler and Kapunda.  The trip by Mail Cart went via Gawler, Sheoak Log, Kapunda, Tothill’s Creek, Apoinga, Emu Springs and Sod Hut.  Hornsby’s hotel still stands at Apoinga.  The Burra Hotel was later the Burra Hospital and the last of the old building was demolished in 1967.’]
