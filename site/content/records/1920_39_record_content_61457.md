Burra Swimming Pool

Councillors have agreed that the swimming pool is a good idea.  They endorse the view that swimming should be part of every child’s education and the water from the pool would be useful to grow trees along the creek to beautify the town.  The bone of contention has been the best method of financing the pool.

The Mayor said he believed a 5 h.p. petrol engine would do the pumping work as well as an electric motor, if the Burra Electric Supply Co. was unable to supply sufficient current for the 5 h.p. electric motor.  He asked the Clerk about the water in the Market Square bore.  The Clerk said as far as he could remember the bore was about 300 ft deep with water rising to within 32 ft of the surface and the supply was wonderful, or used to be.

Cr Jennison said the supply from the mains would be as good as anything.

The Mayor said he had not had a reply from the Hydraulic Engineer and had not asked about the cost.  The pool would hold 150,000 gallons and if emptied once a week and refilled at 1/- per galloon all profits would be eaten up.  [This must be incorrect reporting. Perhaps the Mayor said 1/- per 1,000 gallons, which would make £7-10-0 a week and would make more sense than the figure reported.]

Cr Riggs suggested using the Mine Pool water.

Cr Kellaway thought a bore at the pool would be cheaper in the long run.

The Mayor said the matter was in their hands and if they made up their minds they would have to raise £600 to £700.  He thought debentures were the way to go, with Council guaranteeing the principal and the interest.

Cr Dow feared if the venture failed the ratepayers would have the responsibility of paying back the borrowed money.

Cr Kellaway wondered if money could be borrowed from the Commonwealth at a cheaper rate.

In the end it was resolved that the matter be held over till replies had been received about the electricity and the water supply.  In the meantime the Finance Committee was instructed to devise a scheme to raise the necessary finance.  After all that a public meeting would be called to get the opinion of the ratepayers.
