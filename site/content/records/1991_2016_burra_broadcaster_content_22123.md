Easter.  Burra Visitor Centre reports a busy Easter period with most accommodation filled.  The various churches held services and the Anglican Church had an Agape Meal on Maundy Thursday and a dawn service on the Mine Hill on a chilly Sunday morning.  There was also the usual dawn service for Anzac Day at the Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square.
