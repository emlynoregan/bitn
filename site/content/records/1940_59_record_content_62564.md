Earthquake.  The earthquake, which is said to have started in Kangaroo Island and which did considerable damage in Adelaide on Monday morning at 3.41 a.m., was felt in Burra at 3.42 a.m.  It sounded like a large motor truck with solid tyres travelling over a corrugated road.  No major damage was reported in the town and only isolated instances of minor damage.  It is not expected there will be a similar occurrence for another 50 years.  Burra had a worse earthquake in 1901 or 1902.

[XV, 532, 24 Sep. 1902, page 3

An Earth Tremor struck Burra on Thursday at 6.45 a.m. and rattled stuff on shelves.  On Friday at 8.15 p.m. a second and more serious earthquake shook the town and seemed worse at Kooringa than in Redruth.  Some crockery was broken in falling from shelves and a large pane in one window shattered.  People ran into the streets and some stayed outside all night.  Part of a ceiling collapsed where a woman had been sitting till a moment before.  At the Institute a performance of Marionettes was not interrupted, apparently the audience was so rapt in the performance.  There was a sound like thunder which seemed to travel from west to east.  There was a third slight tremor on Sunday afternoon.]
