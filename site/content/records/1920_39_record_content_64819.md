Accident/Obituary. On Friday afternoon last, Walter Lee, second son of Mr & Mrs Walter Lee of Ware Street Kooringa, was killed when he was electrocuted at his parentsâ€™ house.  He was aged 15.  Apparently he hit a tennis ball onto the roof and while recovering it, he tripped over the electric wires.  He was noticed by Master Reg Dow who lives nearby and who raised the alarm.  Dr Stevens and Mr Lee were soon on the scene and the body was quickly recovered.  Artificial respiration was attempted, but failed to revive the boy.

[Walter George Lee born 23 January 1921 Kooringa: died 27 November 1936 Kooringa.]
