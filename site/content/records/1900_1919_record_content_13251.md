Obituary.  The death is announced of the SA novelist Guy Boothby, aged 38.  [Born at Glen Osmond SA, 13 Oct. 1867, died Bournemouth UK, 26 Feb. 1905.  He was noted for quantity rather than quality and produced 50 books in hard back, being a mixture of short stories and novels.  There were also works published only in magazine format.  The stories are mainly sensational adventures with a romantic storyline and a touch of the Gothic.  Unlike some other prolific writers, they are not written to a formula, and vary considerable in their structure, and fit only roughly into genres like thrillers, romances and detective stories.  He had a fascination for the bizarre with deformed and otherwise unusual characters.]
