The Burra Show drew a good crowd on Saturday despite the blustery conditions.  The show was officially opened by Tony Ryan.  $2,144 was taken at the gate.  The Army Reserves were in attendance with their band.  The shearing competitions were popular, as were the sideshows and demonstrations by the Burra Obedience Dog Club.  [A list of major awards follows.]
