Mr F.W. Holder was recently accused in the House of Assembly of embezzling money, though the word was later withdrawn.  12-15 months ago Mr Holder was given a cheque to settle some business for the late Mr C. Drew, but for obvious reasons the amount was not paid over until quite recently â€“ well at least he paid it into his own account and kept it 15 months without authority.  The matter has now been settled.
