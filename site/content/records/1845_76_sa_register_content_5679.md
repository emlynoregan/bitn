Mining in South Australia from the Correspondent of the London Mining Journal. (Continued)

[The writer describes how the Emu Plains mineral lands were sold and how the Burra Burra Company acquired significant holdings there, though they do not intend to develop their portion until more labour becomes available.  At present they could employ another 200 at the Burra Burra Mine, if that number were available.]

Princess Royal is at a standstill with extraordinary indications visible in all directions.  None of the shafts down to the 30 fathoms have cut anything.  The shareholders are disheartened and the various mining Captains sent there to report are at their wits’ end.  ‘To all appearance it is not the present generation who are to profit by this property.’

[The writer goes on to discuss the mines at Tungkillo, Kapunda, Mt Barker/Kanmantoo, Paringa, Strathalbyn, and Onkaparinga.]
