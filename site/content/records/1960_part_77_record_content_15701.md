Burra High School.  Work has begun on a new Â£5,500 laboratory at the school and a new classroom.  Work should be completed within six weeks, though the plumbing requirements may delay opening for a time.  The new classroom promised for 1964 is ahead of schedule.  The old small laboratory is due for conversion to a staff room.  The Jubilee Plaque will be mounted on a cairn of local slag stone at the entrance to the new tennis courts on the Statton Sports Area.
