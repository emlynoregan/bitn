Burra Institute

A special meeting of the Burra Town Council was held on 14 July at which the Mayor & Cr Marston were elected delegates to speak to the Manager of the State Bank in Adelaide about the terms and conditions under which the Council could take over the Burra Institute.  They reported to the Council meeting last night.  The bank has refused to reduce either the total sum of £3159 owed by the Institute or the rate of interest.  Costs of the transfer would see the total increase to c. £3,300 and the bank authorities seemed to agree to limit this to a round figure of £3,200, but subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.  If all was done as soon as ratepayers had given approval the first repayment would fall due of 1 October 1942 and would be met every six months.  The Institutes’ Association said the Council would have to provide accommodation for the Library and the Library Committee would have to have a majority of representatives of the subscribers, not from the Council.

Cr Reed said the ratepayers had prevented a Council takeover on a previous occasion.  His Worship said if that occurred again it would be the end of it.  [That is the end of the Institute.]

Cr Kellaway said there seemed but three choices:

The Council could carry out the suggestion to take over the Institute and pay off the debt.

The Council could strike a special rate to assist the Institute.

They could let the Government step in.

It was now up to the ratepayers.  The Council had done all it could.

Moved Crs Marston & Samuel that the proposal to take over the Institute be proceeded with, subject to the consent of the ratepayers.  That the takeover be from 1 April 1942, free of encumbrances for the sum of £3,200 with instalments to be paid every six months over a period of 30 years.  This was carried unanimously – with of course the understanding that the Bank’s Directors might yet not agree.

A ratepayers’ meeting to discuss the proposal was scheduled for 30 July, with the date for a poll to be fixed later.
