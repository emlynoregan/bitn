Market Square.  The meeting between Councillors and representatives of the National Trust resulted in a decision to install post-top lights.  The design looks like an inverted bowler hat.  They will replace the nine-and-a-half metre high gooseneck installed last October.  Trust Chairman Mrs M. Wright said they would harmonise better with the heritage environment and the cost was in line with the original costing for gooseneck poles.  The Council recently adopted its revised plan for the square.  The changes mainly affected the protuberances in the road and at its margins.  The surface of the main pedestrian area was kept 12 cm below the top of the existing kerb to retain the curvature of the kerb line.  Work was expected to begin shortly.
