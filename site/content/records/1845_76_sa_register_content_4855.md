Local Court, Kooringa, 5 August.

James Farr was charged by Turton Diprose with assaulting him.  Charge withdrawn on defendant apologising and agreeing to pay costs.

James Merrifield was charged by William Robinson with keeping a ferocious dog.  In passing near the defendant’s house the dog had seized Robinson by the leg.  He then followed the dog to its home.  Defendant’s wife said it had only just got off the chain.  The doctor had dressed the wound.  Defendant agreed to pay the doctor’s bill and to compensate the complainant for his time and the matter was allowed to stand over.

Lawn sued Smith for 9/8 for two days’ wages.  He had been hired for a week, but refused to continue after two days, as he had received a better paying offer.  His worship dismissed the case and said if Smith lodged a complaint for breach of contract, Lawn could expect to be punished.

Middleton sued Carter for £4-19-0 for board and lodgings, but after conflicting evidence and an unreadable rent book His Worship dismissed the case with the defendant to pay costs because he had not taken receipts for his payments.
