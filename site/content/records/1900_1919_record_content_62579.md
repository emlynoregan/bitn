Burra Show Society.

A special meeting was called by President I.J. Warnes.  After ten shows Mr Treloar tendered his resignation as secretary and it was reluctantly accepted.  He was voted a £10 bonus.

Financially things were not good.  Despite a donation of £100 from the President, which had practically paid off the overdraft, it looked like the show would sustain a loss of c. £9  The gate takings were unsatisfactory and the alterations to the toilets that were required should have been half paid for by the Racing Club, but it said it had no funds.

The President was disgusted at the gate takings (where the failure to charge vehicles lost considerable income) and at the failure of farmers to become members or to take only the cheapest form of membership.

He would like the general and sheep shows to be combined.  Having them separate reduced crowds at the sheep show and added costs for preparation.  Printing costs seemed excessive.

He was also concerned that some committees were not working well and work devolved upon too few of the members.

Mr Somerville, a leading horse exhibitor suggested a combined show at the end of September.

Mr Warnes was thanked for his work and granted leave of absence for his overseas trip.

Cpl Arthur Winders is said to be doing very well at Bedford Park Military Hospital.
