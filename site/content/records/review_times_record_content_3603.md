Burra National Trust President Mrs Wright said the garden party last weekend had been a sell-out.  The weather was ideal and the grounds perfect.  Mrs Wright said it was the first time a tour of a period building had been organised* and they had no trouble selling tickets.  She said many people did not realise that the building was privately owned and therefore not open to the public.  The event raised about $400 for the general funds of the branch.  It would build up funds, which in the past year had mostly been spent on the Bon Accord Museum project, which had been the focus of the branchâ€™s work all year.

[*This was not true and prompted a sharp letter from Mr & Mrs Ian Auhl: see 73, 2, 27 November 1986, page 4.]
