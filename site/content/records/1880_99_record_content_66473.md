Davies.  The schoolmistress applied for additional desks and a shelter shed for the students.  The Council thinks it is time the parents asked for the school to become permanent instead of provisional.  [Note this late use of the name Davies for Hanson.  Reference at about this time to the Hanson P.O. requiring further accommodation presumably refers to Farrell’s Flat.]
