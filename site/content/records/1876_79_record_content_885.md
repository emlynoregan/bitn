J. Rookwood of Kooringa expresses his disgust at the state of the cemetery at Kooringa.

‘There is in this township an old cemetery, in a foul and disgraceful state – trodden down by goats, rooted up by pigs, crossed over by drays, and if not stopped the floodwaters will soon furrow itself [sic] deep into the graves and wash the bones into the creek and away into space.’

‘In this spot lie the bones of the discoverer of the famous Burra Mine, and many who shortened their lives in developing that which has led to many now resident in the Burra being independent.  Gratitude for these benefits ought to enlist the sympathy of the old and shame the young into protecting a spot where so many now lie at rest.’

He says the cemetery ‘as a disgrace to a Christian community cannot be equalled in the whole of Australia.’
