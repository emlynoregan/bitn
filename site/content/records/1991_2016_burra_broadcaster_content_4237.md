Letter.  T. Swan, BCS English Teacher, writes in response to concerns expressed about the suitability of Archie Weller’s book Going Home as a school text.  It has been asserted that the book promotes immorality, unsafe sex, racism and prurient thoughts etc.  In fact swearing and titillation is more than adequately provided in popular entertainment and what fascinates the students in this text is rather that it deals with contemporary life.  It is not the ‘rude bits’ they find interesting, but they want to discuss such things as victimisation and the place of violence in society.  They focus on relationships in the stories and draw moral conclusions on who was right and who was wrong.  The realism of the text provokes this in a way not many books do.  The situations can be taken seriously because they are not a sanitised version of life.  We should give students credit for being able to make their own moral judgements, to look at social realities and to reflect on their moral and political significance.
