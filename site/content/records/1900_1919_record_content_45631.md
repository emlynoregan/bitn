Burra Town Council

S.J. Harland wrote saying that since he tendered for the suspension bridge there had probably been a rise in the price of materials, furthermore 4” wire rope was now unobtainable, but 3½” was approved by Crown Lands Office.

The Overseer reported that the best road metal was from the hill near the Burra School.  A letter will be sent to Hon. J. Lewis asking the price per acre for land near the school.  The same is to be asked of owners of blocks in front of the Mill.

Hon. J. Lewis has offered to pay 12 months rates on Paxton Square only.  Mr Winnall advised acceptance of the offer as the properties were not on the assessment book till last August and it was doubtful if they could claim more than 12 months rates.  Accepted.

Cr Radford said the fire reel had now been under construction for four months!  Without a reel the hose would soon become useless.  The contractor is to be given 10 days to complete the work or the job will be taken elsewhere.

Given the dilapidated state of the Redruth Court House the Mayor supported moving the court to Kooringa.  The SM, Mr Hinde would support such a move.  Pearce’s Building would be suitable and Mr Pearce would consent to letting one or two rooms as offices, plus the main hall as the Court House.  Council supported the move, as the Redruth Court was entirely out of the way and Kooringa was the centre of business.
