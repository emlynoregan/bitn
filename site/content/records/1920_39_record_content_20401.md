Cr Woollacott asked what guarantee there was that the Committee would not peter out in a few months with all the money wasted.

Fred Collins said no one could guarantee being here next year or even tomorrow.

The Mayor said even if the grass died the oval would have been levelled.

Mr Bednall believed there would be no problem getting the other £30 – he would not mind guaranteeing it himself.

Cr Woollacott was absolutely opposed.

Help had been refused the playground, and the bowls and tennis clubs had to find their own money.  If they spent money here while putting rubbish on the roads it was wrong.  Money should be spent to help the unemployed.  In any case the ground was too rocky and full of small quarries.

Cr Riggs moved the request be granted, as it would be money well spent: not all money should go on roads when many ratepayers had no cars to use them.

Cr Kellaway said the Council gave land to the tennis clubs and many clubs would use the park.  He seconded the motion which was carried and the committee given permission to proceed.
