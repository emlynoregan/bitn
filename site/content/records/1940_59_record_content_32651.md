The mayor agreed that one was needed, but the present limited permission should be granted to get the oval grassed by summer.

Cr Woollacott thought the project too big to be decided by a meeting of 50-60 ratepayers.  Victoria Park should not be handed over to an outside body.

The Mayor said the Council had no idea of selling the ground, but the scheme was decided at a ratepayers’ meeting.

Cr T.H. Woollacott wanted to know if it was merely going to be a piece of ground or something worthy by which to remember those who served in the last war.

The question of a plan was then discussed further and a note on this will be sent to the committee.

Cr Marston moved for an avenue of trees at Victoria Park – each one to commemorate one who had fallen in the war.

The E & WS Department is to be advised of developments and asked to reconsider its response to supplying water to Victoria Park.
