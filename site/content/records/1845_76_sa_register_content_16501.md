Kooringa News, 1 April

Rev. T. Lloyd was given a farewell tea and public meeting after three years here as Wesleyan minister.  He preached his farewell sermon the following Sunday.  He will be succeeded by Rev. H. Chester.

St Mary’s Sunday School celebrated its anniversary last Sunday and Monday.  This was combined with a farewell for the Rev. J. Fulford, who is about to leave for Victoria.  There is at present no one available in the colony to take his place.

The work repairing the main road through the town has commenced and will need to be accomplished rapidly to be completed before winter sets in.  I am given to understand that the whole road will now be repaired, without the hiatus I have recently complained of.  If so, this is a welcome indication that the Road Board is willing to listen to reason.
