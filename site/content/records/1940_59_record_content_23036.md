Peterborough Trades and Labour Council has purchased an ambulance for £300.  It will serve the Peterborough and Hallett districts.  A Peterborough and District Ambulance Committee has been established.

Adelaide Ram Sales.  John Collins & Sons have received 215 guineas for a 2½-year-old ram – the top price at the Annual Stud Merino Ram Sales at the Abattoir.  [Other sales are reported.]

Burra Civil Defence received some funds from the Town Council in the darkest days of the war, when invasion seemed a real possibility.  They have now returned a cheque for £15 as it was not necessary to use the funds and this represents most of the money advanced.
