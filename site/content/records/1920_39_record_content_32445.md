St Mary’s this year celebrated the 50th anniversary of the present church and the 80th of the parish, though there are some records of priestly ministrations in a building in Kangaroo St in January 1847 and after a short period St Mary’s on the hill was erected, just above the present residence of G.H. Dow.  SAMA donated the site.  There was a proposal for another church at Redruth and the foundations of St Luke’s on the triangular block on the road to Hampton can still be seen.  The desire for a more central location in a larger building resulted in the present church being erected in 1879 and later Old St Mary’s on the Hill was demolished.  Two stained glass windows from it were transferred and the altar table now in use in the vestry and an iron cross which adorned the west end of the old church.  St Luke’s was abandoned.  Mr A. McLagan was the architect for St Mary’s which cost c. £4,000.  Later the Parish Hall was erected for Sunday school use.  St Mary’s is notable for its symmetrical proportions and its wealth of stained glass commemorating well-known families in the parish.  There are 12 windows including two large ones of seven and five lights respectively.  Many of the furnishings are gifts and memorials.  Over the years the rectors have given much to the outside districts.  As far back as 1847 long journeys took the ministry to bush families.  A Mission District was established to be overseen from St Mary’s Hallett and Black Springs were established in 1895 for regular services and Gum Creek in 1898.  Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell’s Flat came later.  The list of Rectors: Revs Bagshaw, Fulford, Pollitt, Hibbottson [sic: for Ibbetson] Stanton, Howitt, Wayland, A.G. King, W.G.M. Murphy, Whittack [sic: for Wightwick], H. Ebbs, S.J. Bloyd, H. Hopton, F.B. Hewitson & J.S.W. Coles.  [Fulford actually followed Ibbetson.]

The commemoration services began on Sunday 2 November conducted by the Rector.  On Thursday 7 November the Bishop of Adelaide Rt Rev. Nutter Thomas arrived by the midday train and attended a meeting of the Mothers’ Union and confirmed 14 candidates in the evening.  On Friday there was Holy Communion at 7 a.m. celebrated by the Bishop assisted by Archdeacon Bussell, Rev. S.J. Bloyd, Rev. J.S.W. Coles & Rev. H. Hopton.  Later there was a confirmation at St Edmund’s Booborowie and in the evening St Edmund’s was consecrated.  Ven. Archdeacon Bussell preached at St Mary’s on Sunday at morning and evening services.
