Elspeth Radford of Saltbush Clothing, Burra, has recently been acknowledged with an Inspiration Award, announced in the Friday Magazine.  (Associated with the Stock Journal and Westpac Regional Banking.)

When wool prices crashed more than a decade ago Elspeth Radford decided to start making country clothes for herself and two sons.  This began on Glenora Station and from that small start has grown into a thriving business.  She now heads Saltbush Clothing, a full-time business based in Burra, but with another retail store in Adelaide and available at more than 50 outlets across Australia.  [Photo]
