Burra Show Society

A review meeting was held on 27 October to suggest improvements following the recent show.  There were reports that the Ute Competition was missed, but it had not been possible to find stewards for it.  Suggestions included adding goats, alpacas and children’s pets – all of them good ideas, but requiring stewards.  After a few anxious months the society is now again solvent.
