The Murray Floods

The river is continuing to rise at the rate of over one inch per day.  At Renmark it is approximately at the 1950 flood peak of 20’ 6”.  Last year the ferries at Kingston were thrown out of commission at 23’6”, which was reached about a fortnight after the present levels.  This year’s rise seems to be more gradual.
