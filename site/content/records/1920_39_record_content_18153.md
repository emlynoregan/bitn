Notice.  Mr W.A. Gebhardt, Baker of Thames St, on retiring from business thanks his customers for the support he and his father have received for 70 years and hopes the same patronage will be extended to Symons Bros. who have bought the business.

Fred Gebhardt, who had assisted his brother [W.A. Gebhardt], had worked in the bakehouse for almost 50 years as baker.  Their father the late F. Gebhardt Snr originally owned the business.  The family have lived on the premises and been in business almost 70 years.  Symons Bros, who take over, come from Broken Hill.
