Letter.  D.R. Woolley writes explaining that he has not bought into the Wiltshire versus Council correspondence because ‘there is no point in throwing wood onto a fire which is already burning well’. 

He goes on to say that Doug Wiltshire’s challenges to the Council administration ‘are all legitimate and long overdue’.  He urges voters to bear that in mind at the coming Council elections.
