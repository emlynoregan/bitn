Drew Lane.  The private lane between the premises of Sara’s and Bence’s has been used as a public thoroughfare for longer than ten years and the Council has now declared it a public road.  Cr Bernhardt recently suggested it be named Drew Lane in honour of the late John Drew.  Mr Drew used the lane several times a day for many years, from his residence to Drew & Crewes’ (now Bence’s) and was a prominent citizen who was connected with the Kooringa Methodist Church for about fifty years as Superintendent of the Sunday school.  He was a Town Councillor and Mayor in 1906.
