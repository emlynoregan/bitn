Burra Institute Library AGM

Secretary W.R. Pattrick presented his report.  The financial position has been helped by donations, Guy Fawkes display, books etc. from Mr & Mrs A. Tennant and Mrs J. Fisher’s three months’ honorary service at night through the winter months.  The lack of interest displayed by subscribers at the AGM is disappointing.  Attendance averages 11 out of 150 over the last 5 or 6 years.  An appeal for funds a few months ago brought in £55.  A Guy Fawkes function organised by R.C .Lott, assisted by Messrs P. & J. Carpenter and M. Pritchard raised £18-18-0.  Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant donated books and magazines as well as financial assistance.  When the librarian was ill in the winter the wife of the President, Mrs J. Fisher, took over his evening duties for about three months, without cost to the Institute.  At the beginning of the year there were 	140	adult subscribers

30	juveniles

30	scholarship holders

1 	life member

201

The year ends in credit £63-13-8.

Some months ago the Treasurer J.F. Rowe was transferred to Pt Pirie.  Mr J. Topsfield took on the task and Mr J. Watson was elected to fill the committee vacancy.
