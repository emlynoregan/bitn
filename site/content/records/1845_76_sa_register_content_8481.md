5 July 1853, page 2

Advertisement.  Yatala Smelting Works.  Having been forced to suspend operations during the present mining stagnation, the proprietors are willing to treat for the disposal of the same.  There is a good steam engine with a spare boiler and ample room for adapting the same to a flour mill without detriment to the smelting furnaces.  Apply to John Baker Esq. or Messrs Hart & Hughes.
