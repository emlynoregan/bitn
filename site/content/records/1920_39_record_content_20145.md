Burra Public School Children’s Frolic & Dance at the Institute on 23 July followed by an adult dance was a huge success.  The crowd began to gather at 6.30 and by 7.30 every space was crammed.  The items were presented in the centre of the hall surrounded by two rows of chairs.  Items went by ages and the whole was beautifully organised.  Afterwards every child under 14 got a free supper.  A promenade of children under 8 for the best costume was held.  Best character girl was Rewa Triggs as a gum-nut baby and best boy went to David Spier, a member of ‘that swarthy race’.  Second places went to Clare Penrose as a wax doll and Colin Twist as a golliwog.
