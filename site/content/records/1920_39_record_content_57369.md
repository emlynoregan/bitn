Burra Burra Show Inc.   Special Meeting concerning Centenary Hall

The sub-committee meeting on 30 July recommended building a brick or stone building on the west side of the present exhibit hall, to face the same way as the present halls and run parallel to them.  The new building to be 75 ft x 30 ft inside, comprising a hall 60 ft x 30 ft, a kitchen 20 ft x 15 ft and a copper room 10 ft x 15 ft at the rear, separated from the main hall by a single brick wall.  The hall to have board floors and a small fluted iron ceiling.  The kitchen and copper room to have double doors.  The main hall to be fitted with six electric lights, with one in each of the back rooms.  J.E. Pearce will prepare estimates for the cost.  The present kitchen is to become a secretary’s office and committee room, with a place for stewards and judges to wash their hands.

At a special meeting of the General Committee on 5 August Mr Edgar Pearce submitted a cost estimate.

Mr Riggs said that the money thus far collected had been donated to build a sheep shed and if not used for that would have to be returned to donors.  The present shed would accommodate the merinos and two or three other lots.  Foundations for the proposed building would cost up to £100.  Although it seemed a lot of money he favoured going on with the project.

Mr Bednall agreed and thought there was some prospect of getting help from the Government.  He suggested circulating members soliciting donations of bricks and cement.

The secretary thought the scheme would run the overdraft up to c. £500, but it had been more than that before.
