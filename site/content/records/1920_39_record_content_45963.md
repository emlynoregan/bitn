Norman Ford & P. Fuss have discovered a very beautiful and curious rock at Mulga Hill some 75 miles northeast of Burra where they were prospecting for gold.  There are remarkable tracings in a variety of colours and experts at the Department of Mines have been unable to identify it.  It is harder than granite. When cut and polished it would be more ornate than marble and could also be used for jewellery.  Also found was a type of talc that is perfectly white.
