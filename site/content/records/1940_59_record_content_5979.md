Burra Primary & High Schools observed Empire Day last Friday morning.  There was a creditable attendance by parents and friends, including the clergy of the town, Mr G.S. Hawker, President of the RSL, Mrs Hawker and the members of the School Committee and the High School Council.

The Primary School assembled in the playground in charge of Headmaster Mr Davis.  Mr Jennison as Chairman of the School Committee introduced Mr Hawker, who gave the Empire Address, after which the children marched inside to listen to the service broadcast from Adelaide.

The High school assembly was in their hall, where addresses were given by Dr Steele (Chairman of the High School Council) and Mr A.B. Riggs.

At the end there was a joint assembly in the yard, with the ceremony of the Saluting the Flag and a two minute silence in honour of the fallen.  The children were then dismissed for the rest of the day.
