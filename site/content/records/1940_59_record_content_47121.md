Wilcannia & Points North, Part 5.

[The wild pig hunt is described.  Along the way the group also sought kangaroos and eagles (for which the NSW Government paid a bounty of 2/6.)  They called in at Tongo Station.  Kangaroos there were very numerous.  Their destination, Goorimpa Station, was a 2,400 square miles out-station of Killara Station.  They were unable to reach the homestead, which was behind high levees and completely surrounded by water.  They were taken to the large shearing shed with 23 rooms for shearers, though shearing is usually done at the head station.  They eventually shot 4 pigs, one of which weighed about 250 lb.  Only the hind legs were taken for meat, being dry salted for a week and then steamed.  It was said to taste of ham and wild duck.]
