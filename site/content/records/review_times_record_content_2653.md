The New Dalgety Bennetts Farmers Building in Market Square was opened last week by Mr Ron Pearse, former manager of the now closed Koonoona Merino Stud.  About 200 people attended.    The historic façade and a new bull-nosed verandah are designed to complement Burra’s heritage.  Manager Mr Andrew Butler said the new premises offer a better showroom and greatly improved product display.  The firm’s Northern Regional Manage Mr John Secomb said when he started in Burra with Oates Ltd in 1960 there were five stock agents in the town and now there were two.  The firm’s General Manager Mr Noel O’Brien said the stone from the old demolished Farmers’ Union building had been used to make the new façade.  [Photo of Mr Noel O'Brien and Mr Andrew Butler.]
