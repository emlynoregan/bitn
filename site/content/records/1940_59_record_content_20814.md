G for ‘George’ made only a fleeting visit on Thursday morning, with only two passes over the town rather than the three that were anticipated.  The first pass provided only a glimpse, but the second passed very low over Market Square, with some thinking it would decapitate the monument.

As the plane passed over the cemetery the funeral service for the late Mr Reuben Lloyd was being held and dipped the wings of the huge plane in tribute.  A gesture more appropriate than the pilot knew, since Mr Lloyd was a returned soldier from WWI.

The Mayor and Dr D.M. Steele made an appeal from the Rotunda for subscriptions to the Third Victory Loan.  [The speeches are reported.]
