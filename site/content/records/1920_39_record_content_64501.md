Yes, up he goes: He cannot stop

And he proceeds quite trimly

Hurrah! Hurrah! He has reached the top

He has climbed the Old Smelts ‘chimley’.

Oh what a scene burst on his view

A picture grand and kingly

What pity ‘tis so very few

Have climbed up that old chimley.

Now to descend; he has no fear;

And he clambers down quite slimly

One thing alone to him is clear

He has conquered that ‘old chimley’.

I must go home, there’ll be a row

I will be lectured primly

But none of them can stop me now

I have climbed the old Smelts ‘chimley’.

An older brother driving past

Doing his work so truly

Looks up and cries with fear aghast

‘Tis our Art up that ‘chimley’.

He stays awhile then hastens home

He’s all unnerved and trembling

“Father” he calls, “make haste and come”

Art’s climbing the Old Smelts ‘chimley’.

Meanwhile the boy comes rushing in

One can imagine dimly

How wonderingly all look on him

Who has climbed up that great ‘chimley’. 

Long years have passed, and we regret

Memories are growing gloomy

But some are here who’ll not forget

When Art climbed the old Smelts ‘chimley’.
