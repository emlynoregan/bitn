4th National Native Grass Conference was held in Burra last week.  The conference gathered more than 160 people from across Australia.  Themes were healthy landscapes and profit, on farm management of native grasses, native seed production & establishment and the use of fire as a management tool.  Local speakers included Roger Cross and Ian Falkenberg.

Ian spoke on preliminary results of adaptive grassland management at Mokota Conservation Park – SA’s first grassland park and Spring Gully Conservation Park – the only Red Stringybark grassy woodland in SA.
