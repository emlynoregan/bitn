The Adelaide-Burra Road

It is reported that the section of road from Porter Lagoon to Burra will not be ready for sealing for at least two years.  The District Council will, in the meantime, keep the Koonoona-Burra road in repair.  Its condition is presently very unsatisfactory, but nothing beyond essential repairs can be contemplated in the light of the new route.
