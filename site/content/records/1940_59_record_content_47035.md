Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  The Minister of Railways, Mr M. McIntosh, has explained to Mr Hawke MP why the Government will not work the quarry.

The quarry was used for the construction of the railway line to Terowie as early as 1894, but was abandoned after the line was completed, except for a small amount of ballast for maintenance.  In 1941, following local requests that the quarry be re-opened, the Railways Commissioner arranged a 50-year lease.  It was found uneconomic to open the quarry for the small amount of ballast required between Riverton and Terowie.  This will be apparent when the present system is outlined.

At Mile End a large elevated bin of 500 tons of ballast is kept filled by bucket elevator from road vehicles.  A string of 20 hoppers holding 300 tons can then be loaded in about two hours.  A work train of a locomotive and twenty or more hoppers, a plough truck and a brake-van can then proceed to any section of track where ballast is required, to be joined en route by the permanent way gang, who operate the plough and the discharge doors of the hoppers.  To use the Burra Quarry would require a freight train to shunt to the quarry.  Trucks would then have to be taken by freight train one or two at a time and the ballast spread by hand along the track â€“ operations that would delay a freight train by about two hours.

A work train from Mile End can run out a full load of 300 tons and distribute it and return in less time than the delay involved to freight trains using the alternative method.  There would also be additional labour costs, penalty rates payable to train crews delayed by the process as well as flow-on costs from such delays.  It would be different if whole trainloads of ballast were required for such work as gauge standardisation, when developing the Burra Quarry siding might be justified and with such in mind the Department will continue the lease.
