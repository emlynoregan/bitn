The Charles Klaffus Case.

[Apparently Mrs Klaffus did not appear at the start of the hearing and M-C Benham withdrew the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in favour of one of common assault.]

The defendant pleaded guilty under provocation.

Agnes Frahm gave evidence.  [The evidence is protracted and reported at length.  The defendant put a number of questions in cross-examination.]

On the morning of the 8 December Mr Klaffus came home at c. 6 a.m., undressed and went to bed.  He began cursing her mother and her and said he had a good mind to set fire to the house.  He said he was going to hit my brother.  He took a dish of water from the table and tried to put my mother’s head in it.  She cried for help and I hit him across the head with a broom.  He continued to beat my mother and then let her go and caught me.  He threw me on the ground and commenced hitting me.  Soon he let me go and I ran away.  Some time later he called for his pipe and mother told him to get it himself.  He said he was the owner of the house and she should get it.  She went in and I followed and when I was coming out he picked up a stone and threw it at me.  I fell over a two-wire fence, which I ran to in order to get away.  I became unconscious.

The defendant claimed not to remember his actions after being hit with the bottle by his wife and a broom by Agnes.

Matilda Klaffus repeated her evidence as previously reported, but added that later, at Fletcher’s Hotel, Klaffus had threatened to ‘shoot [Agnes] and the jolly lot of them’.

Mrs Bullen repeated her evidence.

[The detailed evidence is reported much more fully.]

The defendant prayed for mercy and was dealt with leniently, being sentenced to 3 months in gaol.
