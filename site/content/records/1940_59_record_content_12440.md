Overall the paper was similar in its coverage to the previous year: a good coverage of activities in the district for the year, with a heavy dose of syndicated war-related items, advice from the authorities that is also war-related and often humorous snippets ridiculing the enemy.  The space devoted to syndicated war-related items and propaganda declined dramatically after the change of 14 July.

Again sports reports were minimal.
