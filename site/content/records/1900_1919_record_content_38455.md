Leighton Hall was re-opened on 8 July after its remodelling.  There was a good attendance despite the cold wind and showers.  The side wall was shifted out 10’ to give a width equal to the Burra Institute.  The building is ceiled with Wunderlich material.  At the rear is a well-lighted stage and behind that is a supper room.  The lighting is by petrol-air gas.  The opening was by the Chief Secretary, the Hon. J.G. Bice, who was accompanied by the Hon. L. O’Loughlin MP.  They were welcomed by the hall’s Vice-President, A.D. McDonald as the President, I.J. Warnes, was ill.  The hall was opened in November 1909 and cost £400.  That debt had been paid off.  Closer settlement had called for a larger hall.  The hall had been a great boon as a social centre.  There was a dramatic club and a ladies guild.

The additions had cost £380, but Mr McDonald was sure it would soon be paid off.  After Mr Bice had opened the hall afternoon tea was served.  The contractor was Mr Marsh.  A concert followed, including the farce The Wrong Box.
