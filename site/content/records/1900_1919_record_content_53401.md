Dr Smith asked: On the other hand if a paid employee of a Board refuses to do his duty, whose duty is it to resign?

Crewes: There is only one thing to do, pass him out.

Dr Smith: Did you satisfy yourself that Dr Ashton had refused to carry out the written instructions of the Board?

Crewes: I felt the time was inopportune for dismissal and fought unsuccessfully for deferral until another letter had been written asking him to attend.

Mr Mitchell: Several letters had been written by the Board and Dr Ashton had been interviewed and he would not do as requested.  How long do you think the patience of an employer should hang out?

Dr Smith: Do you know that the ex-officio appointment of the Mayor of Burra as a member of the Board is illegal under the Act?

Mr Crewes: No.

Nurse Fuss said she was temporarily acting as night nurse on the occasion when Dr Ashton alleged he had given orders for a patient to be prepared for an operation at 11 a.m.  Dr Ashton had given her no such order.

Mr I.J. Warnes said he had brought the account sent by Dr Ashton to Miss Store to the notice of the Board.  It had been said he obtained the lawyerâ€™s letter demanding payment by unfair means.  It had been handed to him by another member whom he understood to have got it by fair means.

Subsequent statements by Dr Ashton had shed a different light upon the case.

The enquiry was adjourned.
