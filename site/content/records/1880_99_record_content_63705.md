Burra Races organised by Mr Nankervis of the Burra Hotel went off very successfully.  The course was lent by Mrs J. Dew.  The only drawback was the absence of the totalizator.  There were some very close races on Wednesday.  Under SAJC rules prize money at such races is limited to £25; otherwise stakes would have been higher as potentially more was on offer. The biggest prize was for the 1¼ mile Handicap where A.J. Berryman’s black mare Midnight (aged), ridden by J. Kane, won £6.

The only sour note was in the 1 mile for hacks where Mr Garrard’s bay gelding Joe, ridden by G.Garrard, was not allowed to win and the rider made haste to vanish at the end of the race to avoid ‘a little manual exercise’.
