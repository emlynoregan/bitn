Kooringa News, 1 January

During the past year progress here has not been the equal of many other parts of the colony.  The extra stimulus supplied by agricultural and commercial pursuits is wanting here.  Mining is the single pursuit around which all interests revolve.  And that is controlled by the successes or reverses of a single mine.  Even though that mine is the great Burra Burra Mine and fall in copper prices or the production of that mine has an immediate affect on the whole social machine.  In the past year the Burra Mine has found it expedient to reduce employment and as a consequence many people have left the district.  Despite all this we are very nearly as prosperous as any other part of the colony.

Christmas Day was observed as a holiday, at least as far as closure of businesses was concerned, but in other respects it was more like a Sunday than a holiday.  The streets were deserted and people mostly enjoyed themselves in their own homes.  The following day (Friday) had more of the appearance of a holiday.  Many took advantage of the good weather for picnics and similar parties.  Many with less refined tastes, including many young men and lads, lounged around the taverns, playing skittles and wrestling.  The Primitive Methodists had a pleasant tea and public meeting.

The weather yesterday was dominated by a hot wind and much dust, though a cool breeze from the west arrived in the evening.

Today the annual races take place at Copperhouse and at Springbank and the Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists and Bible Christians will hold tea meetings.
