A Youth Travel Committee was formed at a public meeting on 11 August to raise £100 by September to send a boy on the Advertiser Youth Travel Tour for 1955.  The boy must be 14-16.  The tour to the UK aims to strengthen the Empire ties, encourage migration from the UK to Australia and promote the ideals of citizenship.  £350 has to be raised: £100 by the end of September and the rest by December.  20 youths at Burra High School would be eligible.
