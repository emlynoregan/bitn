Mrs Josiah Thomas of Redruth turned 80 on 11 January.  She was born at Redruth SA and was the first female born there, an event that happened in 1851.  She is the daughter of the late Mr & Mrs H. Pinch of ‘Pincarrow’ some four miles north of Aberdeen, which is still held by Mr Pinch’s descendants.  Mr Pinch claimed to have built the first house in Redruth owing to the family having been flooded out of a dug-out in the bank of the creek.  Miss Pinch married Josiah Thomas 15 February 1869 in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill.  They went to ‘Three Trees’ near Aberdeen and remained there till the death of Mr Thomas in May 1929, soon after their diamond wedding.  Mrs Thomas then came to Redruth to live.  Of a family of four children only Maud (Mrs C. Wesley Gare) survives.  Two children died in infancy and one Mr Henry Thomas in 1919.  Mrs Thomas was almost an invalid some years ago, but is now enjoying good health.
