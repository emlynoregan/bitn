Burra High School Speech Night was held on 21 December in the Institute.  Mr Biddle was pleased to report a record enrolment of 47 in 1922 following threatened closure for lack of students.  (The previous record had been 42 students in 1918.)  Consequently Miss E. Grosvenor had been appointed to assist.

10 sat for the Junior Commercial Certificate and 1 for the Junior Public Certificate.  4 sat for the Senior Public Certificate and 1 for the Senior Commercial certificate.

The school dux was Allen Dane with Patty Pledge second.

Stanley Pederson demonstrated the high standard at Burra High School when he transferred to Unley High School and came 3rd in a class of 50 boys with an average in all subjects of 90.2%.

At the 1921 University Examination the following students passed in a number of subjects:

G. Gillett	J. Pederson	T. Lafsky

Elsie Turner	Hugh Dunstan	Dora Rosewall

Bert Scholz

Sports have continued to be a valued part of the school and a school museum has been set up.  The school magazine, established three years before, was being maintained and was issued quarterly.

An Old Scholars Association has been initiated, but a very wet evening prevented a planned reunion from being as successful as had been anticipated.

Mr J.E.H. Winnall was in the chair as Chairman of the School Board Committee and he paid tribute to Mr Biddle on his approaching departure.

A musical and elocution program followed.
