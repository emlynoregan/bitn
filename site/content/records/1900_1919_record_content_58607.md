J.G. Oates.  All that survives on his property is the scorched and blackened house that was somehow saved.  This year he was on halves with Mr Tohl who lost c. 400 acres of feed and fencing.  There was just time to save the stock.  Miss Marjorie Field galloped to Mrs Oates’s assistance and released the horses.  Mrs Oates and her niece, Miss Crittendon, had a lucky escape.  The large forest reserve nearby was swept from end to end.  Damage at Oates’s is estimated at £4,000 – little of it covered by insurance.
