Rev. G.K. Haslam was farewelled from the Bowls Club on Tuesday and at the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall also.  On the same occasion Mr M. Pederson Sen. was farewelled on the occasion of his leaving to visit his native Denmark on 19 April.  Capt. H. Heathwood of the Salvation Army was sorry that Mr Pederson was going away, as he was a consistent supporter of the Salvation Army.  Mr Pederson said it was 45 years since he came to SA and it was time to return to his birthplace and to see his relations.  Rev. Haslam presented him with a travelling rug and straps.
