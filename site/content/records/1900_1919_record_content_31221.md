The Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs P. Lane is reported in ⅔ column.

Mr Lane has been in business in Burra longer than any other resident.  He came to SA as a youth on the Princess Royal in 1847, having been born in Winkleigh, Devonshire, in 1833.  He will be 79 in November.  In Burra he started business as a saddler and harness maker.  He has held more public positions than any other resident.  In the early days he made a brief trip to the Victorian gold fields.  From 1874-75 he was a member of the Burra District Council and became first Mayor of the Town Council, a position he held for 4 years.  [Actually the first term was July 1876 to Nov. 1877 and he subsequently was Mayor for 1880 and 1881 – a total period of approximately 3½ years.]  He was instrumental in getting the public school built and also the Institute.  He has been a JP for over 35 years and a visiting justice to Redruth Gaol for 18 years.  He has been Treasurer of the local branch of the [British & Foreign] Bible Society for over 40 years.  For over 35 years he has been chairman of the trustees of the Institute.  For 10 years he was Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice.  As Mayor he instigated subscriptions for tree planting.  He has been a member of the Benevolent Society for many years and has also been connected with the Ag. Soc.  [The Show Society]  He has several times been asked to stand for Parliament, but has declined.  He has two sons: Philip Lane (Broken Hill) & Stanley Lane (Burra).  There are six daughters: Mrs H. Roach Senior (Burra), Mrs A.J. McBride (Kooringa), Miss Mary Lane, Miss Florrie Lane, Mrs Waldeck & Mrs Hooper.
