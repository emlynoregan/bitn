Burra Waterworks.  The deputation of the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, and Councillors waited on the Commissioner of Public Works, the hon. R.W. Foster, supported by the District Members, Messrs Rounsevell and Holder.  Mr Rounsevell said the position in Burra was grave.  The plant was 15 years old and was originally second hand.  The timbers and pipes were defective.  They requested that the capital account be reduced to enable money to be spent on repairs.  The corporation had paid 5% on a capital cost of £8,100 until 18 months ago when it was reduced to 4%, but still on the same capital value.  The Corporation expects daily to hear that the engine has collapsed, while the mains and supply pipes constantly need repair.  If the Burra Mine restarted the supply would instantly cease.  The water quality was poor and really fit only for stock.  His own impression was that the best thing would be for the Government to take over the scheme.

The Hon. J. Lewis said that the Burra people would probably be prepared to take over the scheme if the Government would accept £4,000 for the plant as it stood.

Hon. J. Warren thought the position dangerous for the town with supplies uncertain and of impure nature.

Hon. M.P.F. Basedow thought the Government had an obligation to ensure a safe and plentiful supply as a matter of public health and supported earlier speakers.

Rounsevell pointed out that other districts got a water supply at one quarter of the cost and Crs West and Williams endorsed the above.

The Commissioner accepted the need for reliable and good water supply and the problem posed by the possible reopening of the mine, but he could not be expected to accede to the £4,000 figure without becoming fully acquainted with the actual value of the plant.  So a valuation will be made.
