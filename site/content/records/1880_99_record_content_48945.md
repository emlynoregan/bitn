Burra Town Council, 16 February.

The purpose was to hear the result of the committee investigating the charge against the Waterworks engineer, Mr Littlejohn.  After discussion it was decided to meet in open session and hear witnesses and not to receive written reports of it.

M. Williams had seen Littlejohn coming from the Bon Accord on 30 December.

Littlejohn said, even if true it did not follow he had been drinking there and whenever he left the works, as his business compelled him to go anywhere and everywhere, he always shuts off steam and leaves the engine secure.

An argument over procedural matters followed.

Basically Crs Linkson & West objected to receiving written testimony since Littlejohn denied some of the content and would be unable to question the testee.

Littlejohn denied that the engine was working at the time he was using the crossing, because he had been reading a meter at the station (sometimes he goes through the fence and sometimes over the crossing) – there were other details and then the question: Will you swear now that you never left the engine while it was working?

On my oath I will swear I have not at any time left the engine while it was working.

Littlejohn swore he was not at the Bon Accord between 2 and 4 on 30 December.

Mr Morton swore he had not known Littlejohn to leave the engine running.

Mr Rule said the same: he said the engine was not running between 2 and 5 o’clock – steam was only got up after 5.

Crs Hardy and Kitchen then tried to have the written evidence received.  After argument Cr Hardy moved the Council adjourn so that Messrs Hunt and Preece could attend.

Meeting reconvened 20 February.

[This is printed as Jan. 23 and corrected by hand, in pencil, on the bound copy.]

Mr Hunt said that Littlejohn had once stated he had only left the works on two occasions to go to the Bon Accord for tobacco and matches – he could not say of anyone was in charge or not – told this in January – couldn’t be sure of the date – he understood Littlejohn to have meant while the engine was in motion.

Mr Preece said the day he went to the station he had met Mr Littlejohn coming from the crossing – he could not give a date.

Cr Parks moved that the Council take no further action in the matter in reference to the statements made by Councillor Kitchen against the engineer.  Cr Kitchen 2nd.

Crs Hardy, Kitchen and Parks for.
