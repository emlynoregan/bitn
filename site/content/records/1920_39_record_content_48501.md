Local Board of Health had no serious outbreaks in the year and the town is in a healthy state.  The hospital cost us c. £170 p.a.

The Main Roads are in good order and the top dressing started 10 years ago has been completed.  The Highways Department has reconstructed the Kingston St Bridge.

Relief work has seen improvements in footpaths and streets with a double crossing from the stockyards to the station.

Johnny Green has been re-erected as a landmark.

The tennis courts in front of the school were graded with the aid of £25 from the Director of Education.

A deputation to the Minister of Mines Hon. George Ritchie has resulted in improvements for Mongolata miners.

The Hon. R.S. Richards Premier of SA was given a civic reception and so was Mrs H. Fairfax the Liaison Officer for CWA Australia.

The Unemployment Relief Council has provided boots and shoes for the unemployed of the town and Mongolata.  Also The News and Obstinate Artist donated £50 which has been distributed to the needy.

The Council horse died and Council will have to consider replacing it with a young and active animal.

The Fire Station has functioned well and response time has been good: the reel leaving the station within two minutes.
