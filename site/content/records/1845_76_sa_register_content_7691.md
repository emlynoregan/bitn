SA Gold.  Some 400-500 men have gathered in the vicinity of Mount Gambier since the announcement of the discovery of gold near there.  We have been unable to get any definite information about the discovery.

Some Germans are vigorously prosecuting the search for gold near the Victoria Mine and are hopeful of earning the Â£1,000 reward being offered.

We understand that more than 100 miners have arrived in Adelaide from Kooringa and that of them 26 are Germans.  Of the total number 45 came by omnibus.
