Obituary.  An unknown man has met a horrible death in one of the abandoned shafts of the Bon Accord Mine.  Last Monday Mr Dunstan, landlord of the White Hart Inn, sent his son to look for some horses.  About 350 yards north of the inn he saw some swallows fly from a deserted shaft sunk 42 feet some years ago by the mining company.  Looking down in search of nests the boy saw a man’s hat and then could make out braces and a man’s back.  The police were informed.  Police-trooper Dix followed a well-sinker named Jonathan Sleeman down to the bottom where they found the body of a man in an advanced state of decomposition, lying on his face.

His legs were doubled under him and the thigh bone of the right leg protruded through the trousers.  When taken to the surface it was seen to be the body of a man of c. 35 years with long black hair and beard, about 5 feet six or 5 feet seven inches tall.  [Details of his dress and clasp knife follow.]

At the inquest no one could identify the man, though Mrs Davey of Redruth Post Office had sold a pair of braces and some trousers to a man of the same description in the early part of the previous month.  The shaft is thoroughly unprotected and though not in a place of general traffic is not far from a short cut taken by bushmen  coming from Mt Bryan.  The place ought to be immediately secured.  Even in daylight a man on horseback could easily miss it in short grass and ride right into it.  The verdict was death through accidentally falling down the shaft.

A small collection was made and given to Mr Sleeman who first ventured down the shaft, as it was a courageous feat; the sides being composed of overhanging rocks, some of half a ton weight and loosened by rain.

It is surprising that both Sleeman and the Police-trooper regained the top in safety.

[See 17 November 1868, page 2 for identification.]
