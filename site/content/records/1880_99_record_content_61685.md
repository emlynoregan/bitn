Foot Races.  A few nights ago at the Burra Oval W. Lasscock met P. Treloar in a 135 yard sprint.  Lasscock gave Treloar 6 yards.  Walter was never seen by Percy.  A second race was then run in which Percy gave Walter 6 yards and hopped away from him.  Walter has given up running and Percy is thinking of entering the Sydney Cup.
