Burra History.  ‘Looking Backward’ by Historian.

Over 30 years ago a walk through the town would have revealed long rows of deserted houses, or rather, such of them as destructive hands had left habitable again, reoccupied.  General appearance was cheerful and businesslike and trade was again flourishing after the temporary stagnation.  I first visited thirty-four years ago.  The first thing to see on approaching the mine was the now desolate-looking Schneider’s Engine House.  The engine, when in order, worked at seven strokes per minute, raising 136 gallons with each stroke.  Great shears above Roach’s Shaft were standing as the shaft was being used to raise ore.  No. 2 engine was being used to crush ore - 50 tons a day - and also to raise water from Ayers No. 2 Shaft.  Captain Roach was in control and adjoining his four-roomed house were offices, the boardroom, captain’s consulting room, changing rooms, pay office, assay office and draughtsmen’s room.  Then Mr Elphick’s house (the assay master), and next the now decaying houses of Dr Mayne (the Mine doctor), several other captains, the Chief Engineer (Mr Congdon) and others.  Nearby the reservoir was under construction.  There were six forges: five working.  Stables for about 50 horses and other sheds around the yard to accommodate 200 more, though at that time there were about 100 horses at work on the property.

A large yard of about two acres for the timber store, along with copper from the smelting works.  On the hills the chimneystacks and powder magazine.  Schneider’s engine was made by Perran & Co. in Cornwall and has an 80” cylinder with a 12’ stroke.  Three boilers made steam for it.  In full work one week it raised 9,682,656 gallons.

[A description of underground workings then follows, taking about ½ a column.]

At the time only about 150 men were at work, but men were arriving almost daily from Victoria.  The surrounding area looked bare and desolate.
