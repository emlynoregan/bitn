Mongolata Goldfield

Work continues slowly, but surely.  On Monday J. Murison took c. 30cwt of stone from Rampton’s Claim to the cyanide works at Peterborough.  Terry’s party has nearly a ton raised.  A fair sample from Byles' Claim is said to have assayed at 2½oz to the ton in Adelaide.

Leonard Allen was fined £1 and ordered to refund £4-5-0 he had received in rations when it was found he had a car valued at c. £50, a bicycle, a phonograph and a set of carpenter’s tools.  He said when he was asked if he owned any property he thought they meant land or housing.

E.A.V. Triggs who has been a resident for some years left Kooringa for Adelaide recently.  He came first to work for Bright & Bright solicitors and stayed on when the office was taken over by Shierlaw, Frisby-Smith & Romilly Harry.  This firm will now make weekly visits and has withdrawn its permanent representative.  Mr Triggs was a tennis player and secretary of the Burra Tennis Association for some time and with Mrs Triggs a member of the Institute Orchestral Class and for some time in the Kooringa Methodist Choir.
