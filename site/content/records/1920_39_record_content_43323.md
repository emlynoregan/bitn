At World’s End between 3 & 4 p.m. 3 inches fell in less than an hour accompanied by hail in sizes from a pea to a marble.  As late as Monday 10 a.m. tens of thousands of tons of ice still lay around in places 18” deep.  Hedley McWaters said in places water cut tracks through the hail leaving banks of ice 18” high.  T. Heinrich brought a compacted block into Burra on Monday at midday.  At Mr Duell’s old home 280 points were registered – a mile away F.J. Duldig registered 4 points.  The storm track is reckoned about 20 miles long and 5-6 miles wide.
