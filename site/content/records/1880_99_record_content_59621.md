Obituary/Inquest.

Edward Edwards committed suicide on 10 March aged 54.  He leaves a wife and eight children.

An inquest was held on 12 March with James Tiver JP as coroner and J.H. Richardson as foreman of the jury.

Ada Edwards, wife of the deceased.

Husband was a labourer living at Nelson Town.  At 8 a.m. on Tuesday he said he was going to have a yarn with Charlie and Sid Forder who were making a dam.  When my daughter came back from watering the cows at Firewood Creek I asked if she had seen her father and she said no.  Checked with Forder’s boys and they said they saw him about 10 a.m. and he had gone up the creek towards Hampton.  I could not find him and told his sister, Mrs Baker.  Noticed nothing peculiar in his manner and he never threatened to destroy himself.  Missed a little bottle marked poison, but the contents were insufficient to kill him.  He suffered from asthma and had money in the bank.

[Elsewhere the paper reports he had c. £500.]  He was not ill on Monday.

Charles R. Forder reported speaking to the deceased about 8 a.m.  He said when Mrs Edwards came looking for him she expressed the concern that he was going mad, in that he was becoming obsessed with talking about work.

Forder further said he believed the deceased was troubled about not getting employment, though he believed Edwards and his wife lived comfortably together.

L-C Richard Noble described how the search party, comprising John Henry Richardson, August Mill and himself, had found the deceased apparently sitting down against a corner post with his head against the wire fence on section 3031 of the Hundred of Kooringa.  He was hanging by the neck be the rope given him by Charles Forder.

[Evidence was given that the rope was returned to him from a horse Forder had shot for the deceased.]

The body was in a state of decomposition and had apparently been dead about two days.

The verdict was that death was by strangulation while in a state of temporary insanity.
