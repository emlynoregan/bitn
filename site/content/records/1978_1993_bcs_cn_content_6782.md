Burra Kindergarten is concerned about a proposal from the Kindergarten Union Council to regionalise meetings.  Delegates from Kindergartens would attend regional meetings once a term and also a State Council meeting once a term.  It would cost an extra $14,000 a year for administration and travelling costs for country delegates and most kindergartens have enough problems finding people for their own committee.
