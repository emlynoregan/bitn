Saw a sheep with an ‘H’ brand on it slaughtered at Tiver & Coles’.  The carcase fed the shearers.  A second case occurred shortly later.  Leeson was present at the first killing, but not at the second.  He was there at a third killing a few days later.  Mr Cole killed the sheep.

[The evidence is reported in great detail.  Cole is said to have been the cook for the shepherds – though the rest of the paragraph suggest he was cooking for the shearers.  Perhaps he was cooking for both.]

Netherey – Was not involved in killing the sheep, but helped to skin and eat them.  The first sheep lasted five or six days.  Messrs Tiver & Cole had asked him to go and clear them, but he said he would not perjure himself.

[From his wife’s evidence Netherey was afraid of being transported and that was his supposed motivation for giving evidence and revealing the offence.]

George Seigart [sic], shepherd.  Can identify the skins as Hallett’s.

Helen Netherey, wife of John Netherey.  In November Leeson had admitted killing the sheep in her presence.  I wanted to leave the employ of Tiver & Cole when the sheep were killed.

The defence alleged that the track from Hallett’s to Burra passed close to Cole’s where the skins were found.

His Honour said that loads of Hallett’s skins were taken along this track and the skins could either have fallen from a load or been placed there by the witness or by person’s unknown.

The law did not allow the convicting of the prisoners by the evidence of a person involved in the offence unless supported by other witnesses.  Netherey’s evidence could therefore not convict unless corroborated by other witnesses.  His Honour could not, in the present state of the case advise them to convict the prisoners.  They could hear the rest of the case if they wished.

The jury decided the case should proceed.

James Tiver was called by the defence.

Had been present throughout the shearing except for Saturday nights and Sundays.  A young bull was the shearers’ meat for about a fortnight, after which they began to complain.  A sheep of Tiver & Coles’ was then killed and two other sheep, their own property and branded ‘T’ were also killed during the shearing.  Netherey did not leave of his own accord.  He was dismissed.  None of the sheep killed during the shearing belonged to Mr Hallett.  Had never asked Netherey to come over to clear him, but to clear the matter up.

George P. Colville.  Was employed by Tiver & Cole during the shearing and can corroborate Mr Tiver’s account.

James Tiver (aged 11) also corroborated Mr Tiver’s account.

John Smith, another employee of Tiver & Cole.

Have known Netherey for four or five years and could not rely on his word or oath.

Hannah Box, wife of the bailiff of the Redruth Court.

Had heard Netherey say he liked Tiver very well, but ‘he did not like Mr Cole.  He would hang him if he could.’

Character references for Cole were given by Thomas Box (bailiff), George Hiles (sheep farmer) and William Dale.

After His Honour had summed up the jury acquitted the prisoners without hesitation.
