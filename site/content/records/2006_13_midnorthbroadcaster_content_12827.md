Wind Farm at Stony Gap

Last year the Goyder Council approved the erection of a third wind monitoring mast on David & Jo Gebhardt’s property by the now dissolved wind farm company ‘Roaring 40s’.  Eight objectors have now taken their case to the Resource and Development Court.  Bob Lamb will present the appellants’ case.  They will argue the mast would be a visual blight among other argument.  TRUenergy has taken over from Roaring 40s.
