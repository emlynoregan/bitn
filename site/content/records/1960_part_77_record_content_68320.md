Vandalism.  At the Town Hall cabaret on Friday night two doors on the recently erected and not yet quite completed toilets were wrenched from their hinges, ruining the door closers at a cost of $35 each.  One of the glass panels in the door in the foyer was deliberately smashed and cake was trodden into the floor for the full length of the hall and into the foyer.  Such mindless destruction is hard to understand.
