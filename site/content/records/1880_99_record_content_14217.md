Notice.  Burra Corporation acknowledges contributions of £108-14-0 to the Tree Planting Fund.

[Donors listed.]

Advt.  Grand Concert in Burra Institute 1 September.  [Program printed]

Editorial on the Treasurer’s intention to move on the proposed taxes: Land, Income & Beer.

2nd Leader on the proposal to end the subsidy to Councils.  The writer favours this move because, while the subsidies are undoubtedly of use to country councils, its principal benefits go to the city and near city councils.  It is money raised from everyone and is a means of collecting from the country and giving to the city and from the poor to benefit the rich.

Aberdeen Post & Telegraph Office has not been recommended by the Minister of Justice and Education.

S.G. Kingston has been sentenced to six months in the Adelaide Gaol for the wounding of the cabman Guerin.

Burra Waterworks.  SAMA has given the land for the reservoir without cost and pipelaying is continuing rapidly.

Silverton Railway.  The NSW Government has refused to construct a railway to Silverton.

Homestead Leases.  The Hon. G.W. Cotton intends to move for the inclusion of Homestead leases for blocks of not over 20 acres to be lived on, in the Agricultural Crown Lands Bill.

‘Common Sense’ writes condemning the decision by the Government to build the reservoir in concrete rather than stone.

Morris Rayner writes urging that as part of the Burra Show Professor Custance be invited to give a lecture on The Agricultural Interests of SA.

A.H. Forder writes urging the establishment of a sugar beet industry in the district.
