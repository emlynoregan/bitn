Letter

I would like to say a few words in self defence, as I had no wish to be brought into this unpleasant controversy.  It seems a pity for medical men to quarrel, as occasionally they are compelled to work together; hence I am surprised Dr Nesbitt should have purposely laid himself out to war with me.  He asserts that ‘my statements are no more to be relied on than my friendship’, but I would remind him that his general behaviour makes it impossible for any straightforward man to be friendly with him for any length of time.

As he has made so much noise about Paxton Square I think I can prove to the public that he first manufactured typhoid fever at his own home and then sent it into the square by his servant, as both his groom and groom’s wife suffered from the disease while in his house.  Dr Nesbitt was asked to remove a large quantity of manure and rubbish from the back of his premises.  Shortly after this his servants fell ill.  As the groom’s wife, Mrs Hewitson, was expecting to be confined every day, he sent her to Mrs Tonkin’s in the Square, next door to Andrew’s.  She was very ill for ten days and was then confined.  Dr Nesbitt could not make out the nature of her illness.  I was called in consultation and pointed out she was suffering from typhoid fever.  A day or two later one of the Andrews took it, then Mrs Tonkin.  I have since found three others in the Andrews family also suffered.  Northey and Morris had it only mildly.

Dr Nesbitt misrepresents my letter to Captain Sanders.

I said twenty cases of malignant scarlet fever, of which one was in Paxton Square; Dr Nesbitt’s patient, who died.  Ordinary scarlatina was scattered through the district with hundreds of cases.  The twenty I alluded to were all very severe, and out of them thirteen died.  Let Dr Nesbitt behave himself as a gentleman and he will not find any occasion to abuse me again.

Alfred Cave.
