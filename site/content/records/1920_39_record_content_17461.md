Burra Hospital Board Meeting

The meeting wasted a lot of time trying to decide on the proper way to invalidate the resolution brought at the previous meeting to reduce the Board to 7.  It was agreed it was unconstitutional, but they could not agree on the steps needed to right the situation.  Mr Warnes gave notice he would move at the next meeting to reduce the size of the Board to 5.
