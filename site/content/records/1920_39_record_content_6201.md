The Chairman of the Local Board of Health reported from Dr Ashton that there had been 15 cases of mild diphtheria in the year in one outbreak.  There had been three cases of enteric fever, four of measles and one each of scarlatina and phthisis – the last from outside the area.

The ambulance with W.R. Lee in charge had proved to be of great benefit to the district’s sick and disabled.

Cr Radford said the Wards had credit balances this year, as it has not been possible to get all the approved work done.  Lighting was expensive and had been better done this year.  Some electric lights were installed, which had also cost a considerable amount.

Cr Kellaway thought the East Ward’s money had been well spent in the two years of his office.

Cr Treloar said the Council this year had turned down a £4,000 scheme to install electric lights because it covered only Kooringa and ran only as many lights as there were now.  He had been the only one to oppose the Fire Brigade because of the inadequacies of the water supply, which often failed.  He was sure the real cost of the brigade would be much higher than that cited.

The Mayor then explained that he had been asked to stand for the Mayoralty for 1921 to see the Soldiers’ Memorial through, but unfortunately delays had meant the memorial was still unfinished.  He decided to ask his supporters to release him from his promise to see the project through as Mayor if he stayed on as Chairman of the Committee.  When this proposal was made the reply was: ‘I might allow him to do that’.  He considered this was ‘not a very nice position’.  On 7 November he said he would not stand, but Mr Radford had come out as a candidate before that decision was made.  He thought Mr Radford might have waited.  He has since been largely asked to reconsider and after an appeal from 163 ratepayers he had decided to stand again and see the monument to its completion.

Mr Radford said he had been pressed to stand and had no apologies to make for doing so.  He denied the remark attributed to him by Mr Crewes.  He thought Mr Crewes had made a false step in hesitating when asked first and then when acceding to a requisition.  The electric scheme mentioned by Cr Treloar was for £1,500 not £4,000 and he would support the first payable scheme that came along.  He thought the sanitary arrangements were a disgrace and the pan system worse – perhaps deep drainage was the answer?

Cr Kellaway favoured remaking the Pig & Whistle crossing and removing the trees in the cemetery whose leaves were staining the tombstones.

Mr Foote was in favour of a playground at Aberdeen in one of the parks and in improving recreation facilities – he had established a gymnasium with 69 members and a swimming class.  He was in favour of a volunteer fire brigade and fearful that the present arrangement’s cost would get out of hand.

J.G. Sara began to reflect on Mr Crewes’ undertaking in 1920 to stand down in favour of Mr Radford at the end of 1921, but was ruled out of order.
