Inquest.  On 17 April Mr W. West sat as coroner at an inquest into the burning of two haystacks at Iron Mine at Mr Norman Morrison’s.

Norman Morrison:

Left to go to a funeral at Burra on Thursday at 1.15 when the stacks were OK.  They contained about 100 tons.

F.A.S. Field, farmer:

Saw smoke about 2.25 on 12 April.  First thought it was stubble, but soon realised it was Morrison’s haystacks.  It was impossible to save anything.

The jury found there was insufficient evidence to show how the fire started.
