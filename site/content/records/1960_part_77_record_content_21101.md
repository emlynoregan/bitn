Mr Harold Raymond and his ‘Gloombusters’ will present their final show at Booborowie on 12 August.  He has been touring and entertaining for some 40 years throughout the country and will now confine his work to the city.  Mr Raymond was honoured with an MBE by the late King George VI.  He has travelled over 700,000 miles to present upwards of 7,000 shows and has raised many thousands of pounds for his cause.

[He raised money for the Blind, Deaf & Dumb Children’s Home at Brighton; later called Townsend House.]
