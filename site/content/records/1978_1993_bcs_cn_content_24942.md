Burra Burra DC

Windybrae Road will be realigned at the Devil’s Hole.

Preliminary flood damage estimate to roads etc. is $100,000.

The slate footpath outside the Commercial Hotel is to remain.

A sub-committee was formed to investigate the future promotion and management of the caravan park.

Four lots at Farrell Flat will be purchased from the STA to formalise their occupation by sporting groups and for drainage.

The Snoswell Family will be given a farewell on Friday 18 December at the rear of the Burra Hotel.

Burra Carols by Candlelight will be held in the BCS Amphitheatre at 7.00 p.m. on 20 December.  Donations will aid the Christmas Bowl Appeal.
