Burra CWA held its AGM.  President Mrs H.L. Riggs welcomed members.  A minute’s silence was observed for the late Mrs F.M. Pearce.  Elected: President, Mrs H. Riggs; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames H. Jennison & S. Scroop; Secretary, Mrs Ford; Assistant Secretary, Mrs Benger & Treasurer, Miss Tiver.

The Secretary gave the 36th annual report.  Membership was 68 with an average attendance of 30.  Regrets were expressed concerning the death early in the year of foundation member Mrs A.L. Kellock and also at the death of Mr H. Oates with whom the CWA was happily associated at the film evenings so much enjoyed by all and again most recently at the death of Mrs F.M. Pearce.  The debt on the CWA Rest Room has been substantially reduced.

[Details of the year’s work follow and in total the report extends for 1¼ columns.]
