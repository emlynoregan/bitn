Thamm’s Whitehart Garage has celebrated the 50th anniversary of its registration.  The registration for Ron Thamm and his late father Cecil took place 6 October 1950.  Previously the business had been owned by Cecil and his father Emil Ernest Thamm, beginning as a wheelwright and coach-building business when Emil Thamm came to Burra in 1914, having been driven south by the great drought of that year.  Four generations of the family have been involved.  Over recent years the garage has been run by Ron and Brian Thamm, but currently it is being run by Ron and Betty, David and Marion.
