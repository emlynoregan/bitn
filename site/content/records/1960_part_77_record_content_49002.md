Last year’s Leaving results were disappointing.  The average result of Grade IV or better was 63.4% compared with a state average of 75%.

The Intermediate Examination was held for the last time and Burra did very well with a Grade IV or better result reached by 85.9% of subjects compared with a state average of 75%.  Especially noteworthy were:

Lynnette Griffen	7 subjects and six at Grade 1 level

Neville Hyde	7 subjects and five at Grade 1 level

Angela Quinn	8 subjects and four at grade 1 level

David Francis	7 subjects and four at Grade 1 level.

In this year’s Leaving Class seven students held scholarships and recently it was announced that Ann Brak has won a Commonwealth Scholarship.

The failures would seem to be less a lack of ability than a lack of drive.

[The Headmaster then went on to discuss the division of students into different tracks corresponding to differing abilities and interests.  He also discussed promotion for the first three years of High School on the basis of continuing assessment.]

Staff changes at the end of the year:

Mr Brand has been promoted to Deputy Headmaster of Willunga High School.

Mrs Day has decided to resign.

Mr Johnson has been transferred to Taperoo High School.

Mrs Fisk (formerly Miss Wilkinson) has been moved to Nailsworth Girls Technical High School.

Mr Fisk also leaves.

[The Headmaster then thanked the Prefects, the Clergy, the Choral Group and the cleaners.]
