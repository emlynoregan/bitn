Fire.  Kingston St was alarmed on Monday afternoon when it became known the premises of Mr Ah Chin were ablaze.  It was a hot day and the roof, mainly of palings, burnt rapidly.  Only a washstand was saved so rapid and fierce was the fire.  Ah Chin was digging a well when his adopted son, aged three or four, found some matches.  Mrs Chin had a day’s engagement at the hospital.  The young boy began in the chaff-house.  Ah Chin found the boy and a companion in the smoke-filled room and saved them.  All household furniture was lost.  Nothing was insured.  An adjoining house to the east narrowly escaped.  The house itself of eight rooms and owned by SAMA was insured for £50.  Ah Chin is much respected as a fruit hawker.  His losses amount to about £75.
