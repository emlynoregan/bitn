Burra Town Council

C.T. Ford was given permission to erect three petrol bowsers near the Burra Hotel.

It was decided to advise the 23rd Light Horse they could not subscribe towards the regimental colours, which should be paid for by public subscription.

Condolences were sent to the family of the late John Pearce.

Cr Riggs reported on the seaside trip.  The Mayor of Port Adelaide had met them and taken them to the Semaphore Town Hall where light refreshments were served.

The Hydraulic Engineer is to be asked to replace the old 1½” mains to ‘Paradise’ with 4”, as supply there was very poor.

Cows and horses have damaged new grass on Victoria Park and men training on it were also tearing it up with spikes.  The wall needed repair and the shed gutters needed renewing.  The Hydraulic Engineer will be asked to increase supply of water to Victoria Park from ¾” to 1½”.

Some stone kerbing in Thames St was removed by Mr Woollacott’s men who were building there.  Cr Kellaway asked some pointed questions about who had taken it and with what authority.  Cr Woollacott took offence and a somewhat heated exchange followed during which the Mayor threatened Cr Woollacott with a £5 fine if he did not withdraw a remark made.  Eventually a sufficient withdrawal was made.

Cr Kellaway pressed on with a motion to investigate who had taken the stones and it was carried.
