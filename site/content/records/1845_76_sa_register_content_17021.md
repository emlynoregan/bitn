Redruth Court, 23 December before Messrs M. MacDermott SM & W.H. Challoner JP.

Aaron Cole was charged with stealing three sheep, the property of John & Alfred Hallett.

The prosecution said it wished to bring new charges that Cole and a servant in his employ, named Gleeson, had jointly stolen sheep from the prosecutors.  After some legal discussion the case proceeded with the new charges.  Michael Hogan gave evidence of finding incriminating skins at the premises of Messrs Tiver & Cole, having received information from a man named Netherey.  Richard Hallett, manager for the prosecutors, identified skins, which he said were from a flock kept by a shepherd named Siegar.  George Feigart was called and identified the skins.  [Is this the shepherd previously referred to as Siegar?]  Netherey also gave evidence of the killing of Hallett’s sheep by Cole and Gleeson.  Counsel submitted that Netherey’s evidence could not be admitted without corroboration because Netherey was an accomplice, having taken part in the skinning.

James Tiver, Cole’s partner, gave evidence that all the sheep consumed at shearing time had come from their own flock.  He said Netherey had been dismissed for cutting the brand off Hallett’s sheep and also outlined failed arrangements to discuss the matter with R. Hallett.  Evidence was given by James Tiver Jnr and John Smith about sheep killed at shearing and Smith said he had known Netherey for five years and would not believe him under oath.  Emma Tiver, wife of Mr Tiver gave evidence of Netherey’s bad feelings towards Cole.  Evidence of Cole’s good character was given by William Godson, George Hiles, David Mackey, William Willicoat [Woollacott?] and W.H. Forder (Clerk of the Court).  Godson and Willicoat gave evidence of Netherey’s bad character.  After deliberation the Bench decided that although the case for the prosecution rested on the evidence of a man who seemed to bear a bad character and the accused had hitherto borne an excellent character, it was not a case for the decision of the Magistrates, but for a jury to decide.  The prisoners were therefore committed to the Supreme Court.  Bail was allowed.

Another correspondent also reported the case to the paper and from that it was gleaned that the name of the younger prisoner was Joseph Leeson, that the case took from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and that the proprietors of several adjacent runs were present, along with respectable Burra tradesmen, Mr Cole MP, Mr E.L. Grundy and other gentlemen from a distance.  The prosecutors and the prisoner occupy contiguous runs.
