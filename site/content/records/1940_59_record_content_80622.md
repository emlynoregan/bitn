Mr Alex Burton aged c. 65 of Mt Bryan has decided to move to Adelaide in semi-retirement.  In his early years he worked on various farms and station in the district and about 35 years ago he married and settled in at Mt Bryan township to become working overseer for the Mt Bryan DC, continuing in this role when the Council merged with the Burra DC.  Mt Bryan residents showed their appreciation with a cheque for Â£21.
