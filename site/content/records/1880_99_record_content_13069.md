This report notes that it was still difficult to get to the Barrier, though Mr McDonald of Terowie was said to have just ridden a bicycle to Silverton in four days over sandy terrain with a 50 lb swag.  The railway then terminated at Terowie and if you could afford it there was a coach for the 190-mile trip beyond that.  The SA Government provided water tanks or wells at about 30 mile intervals.  Reports come in from Silverton and Thackaringa and the new town of ‘Silver City’ six miles east of the old border town of Thackaringa.  Silver ore was first discovered by a shepherd in 1876, but nothing then eventuated, but c. 18 months ago another lot of ore was sent to England and though a poor lot was sent it returned £7 a ton after paying high commissions and charges.  There are 11 claims at Silver City in sulphides of lead or argentiferous galena, making c. £12 a ton.  One shaft is down 130’.  The second group are 28 miles from Silver City and are called the Lakes Camp Group.  They are on purely sulphides.  Two tons sent to England recently fetched £600.  Shafts here vary from 10’ to 75’ and one struck a lode worth £300 a ton.
