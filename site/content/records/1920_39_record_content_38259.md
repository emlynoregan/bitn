‘Monument Floodlight’ writes in response to R.A. Lynch that he considers a charge of 17/5 per night to light the town, even if it totals over £300 p.a., is very reasonable.  He does think however, that some of the isolated lights in distant places would serve the town better in the centre of town where the businessmen pay a large portion of the rates.  ‘At present the centre of the town of Kooringa at night is like a morgue.’
