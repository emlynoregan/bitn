The Council erected a memorial to Edward VII in Market Square at the expense of public subscription.

The cemetery has been improved.

Candidates for election then spoke.  Messrs McLaren & Wise as candidates for the Mayoralty apparently spoke at length, but the paper report at least gives no indication of anything of substance from either.

The candidates for Ward seats are not reported as saying anything beyond a platitude or two.
