Mongolata Goldfield

[There is a report from Parliament of a debate in the House of Assembly.  It is a slightly disjointed extract in which the local Member E.E. George is arguing for the Government to put in the £2,500 needed for a battery at Mongolata.  One thing that has not been elsewhere reported in the paper relates to the earlier report that Mongolata Block 8 would put in a battery of their own.  This report had not been followed up in The Record, but now in this report from Parliament we learn the following:]

‘Mr E.E. George – a private company was going to put a battery there, but my colleague and I used every ounce of weight we had to prevent that being done, because we knew that there would be dissatisfaction if the returns were not up to the asays. [Sic] Not one word of suspicion has been heard as regards the operation of the Peterborough Battery because it is under the control of Government officials.  We had great difficulty in preventing the company putting a battery on the field.

Mr Jones – Do you think you were wise?

Mr E.E. George – It was the wish of the men on the field and we thought we were doing the best thing in their interests.’

The first meeting of Block 8 shareholders was held in the Cheer-up Room in Kooringa last Saturday.  Herbert Morgan took the chair.  The main business was to elect directors in place of the retiring interim directors for the past six months.  Retiring directors were: Messrs Morgan, Bednall, McRostie, Flaherty & Marston and all were re-elected as directors for the next 12 months.

Block 1 (Byles’) has appointed Mr Wilfred Hack as manager.

Frank Harris has some rich-looking ore from Pexton’s claim in his window.

The alluvial shaft is down 140ft and the men expect to go another 20ft at least.  Messrs Kirkham are in charge of the job.

H.W. Morgan as Secretary of the Prospectors’ Assoc. writes to the Mayor thanking him for his efforts on behalf of the miners.
