Burra News, 8 April

Arrangements for mail from the north and northeast of Burra have been improved.  The northern mail leaves Kooringa at 5 p.m. Friday and by travelling by night it arrives at Blinman on Sunday at 3 p.m.

It leaves Blinman on Monday at 10 a.m. and reaches Burra at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, in time for despatch to Adelaide, which it reaches at 2.40 p.m.

Messrs MacDonald & Hosking operate excellent Yankee traps fitted with five powerful lamps and their teams are in excellent condition.

Messrs Cobb & Co. have also increased their rate of travel for their Outalpa contract, leaving Outalpa at 10.30 a.m. Monday and arriving in Kooringa at 6 p.m. Tuesday – without any night travelling.

‘Too much praise cannot be given to this firm for providing the commodious vehicles now running wherever their contracts extend north of Kapunda.’

Rev. W.S. Worth was presented with a purse of 20 sovereigns before he left Burra.

Splendid rains fell since Monday and green feed will soon replace that destroyed by fires.

Farmers are in good spirits and two additional sections on Mt Bryan Flat have been settled in the last month.
