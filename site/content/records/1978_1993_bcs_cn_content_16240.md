Profiles of the candidates:

Robyn Page

Aged 35, married with one son and have lived in Burra for six years.  Currently:

Member of Lewis board of Management

Member of Swimming Pool Management Committee

Editor of the Community Newsletter

Member of Burra Branch of the National Trust

Attended Copper Festival Meetings

Member of the Burra & District Crippled Childrenâ€™s Auxiliary

Part time teacher at BCS

I am anxious to support the retention of full services at the Burra Hospital and to see better day care facilities and aged hostel accommodation.  I believe Council should support local business and industry and make efficient use of Council plant, staff and services.  I would seek the regular promotion of Council matters to the community and favour the development of the tourist industry.
