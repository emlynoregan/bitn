Electric Light.  Another representative of a firm has visited and is preparing a plan to light the whole town for c. £5,000.  The Mayor intends to form a public company to run a scheme.  Burra at present is one of the worst lit towns in the state and one of the problems according to Cr Collins is ‘the jealousy between the two ends of the town’.  The Mayor did not accept that and said it had been a matter of cost.
