There was an engine ready to do the pumping. Mr Dawson wanted water immediately via a trough at the station gate filled by tapping the government main from the Bon Accord shaft. This could be done for about Â£IQ. Last summer the Bon Accord Hotel had apparently got a pipe from the government scheme and paid 6/- per 1,000 gallons. After some debate Mr Ridgway withdrew his motion so that one by Mr Rosman for the placement of a trough immediately could be put. It passed unanimously.
