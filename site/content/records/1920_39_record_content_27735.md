The Camp Fund.  The money donated by subscriptions amounted to £88-8-11½ and the operetta Snow White brought the total to £132-1-10.  Last donations from hotel boxes brought the total to £134.  It was decided to pay £5 now, and then £1 per week to the widow.  A number of firms have also wiped out family accounts owing.
