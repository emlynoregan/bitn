Colin Endean & Anna Szava started planting an olive grove in 1998 at the southern end of Burra.  They are now producing a small amount of organically grown olive oil under the brand name C & A.  They set up a tasting table outside Beaut Fruit last Friday.  They also had Kalamata table olives, in both oil and brine.
