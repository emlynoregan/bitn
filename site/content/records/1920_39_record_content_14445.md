Demolition.  One of the oldest buildings in Burra was demolished on Tuesday.  A few months ago Mr M. Pederson bought the old Wesleyan parsonage in Chapel St.  At the rear were two rooms, which were the original parsonage, built over 70 years ago for the first minister, Rev. Flockhart.  They had 15‚Äù walls.  They have now been removed to make way for more up-to-date premises.
