East Ward Ratepayers’ Meeting

About 60 people attended.

Cr Sampson opened the meeting and asked for an impartial chairman to be appointed - Mr J. Hosking was voted in.  Cr Sampson made a statement.

1.	Last April a resolution was made to construct a footway along the western side of the road from Kooringa to Aberdeen.  Moved & 2nd by West Ward councillors and carried.

2.	A week later the Public Works Committee inspected the site and decided to call tenders.  Cr Sampson at that point felt uneasy and said he would vote against the work being done if East Ward was called upon to bear any cost.  The answer was ‘No.’

3.	The contracts provided the earth cut away be placed on the east side and when payment was made for it Cr West said East Ward must contribute for what was put on the east side.  Cr Sampson protested.

4.	On 4 May on the Mayor’s casting vote East Ward was ordered to pay £47-7-0 for the rubbish placed there to convenience West Ward.

5.	The dividing line is the middle of the road and there was no work ordered up to 4 May on the east side.

6.	He had always said he would agree to nothing on behalf of East Ward with respect to this work.

7.	The specifications for the work said nothing on behalf of East Ward except the rubbish was to be put there.

8.	Though there was no law in the matter, money had always been spent in the ward it was raised in, and controlled by the Ward councillors.  North Ward councillors had long held this view, but seemed now not willing to allow it for others.

9.	The Works Committee had adopted a plan for making the east side gradually slope off with two lines of fence and an avenue of trees and all his attempts to get a postponement for even ten days were in vain.

10.	The plan required at lest 1,000 yards of filling and £270 of fencing.  It would take all East Ward’s rates for 1½ years.  This unnecessary footway would cost every bit of £300.  There was a grand footway on the west for which they had made East Ward pay liberally - what else was required?

11.	He hoped the meeting would appoint a deputation to ask the council to rescind the motion.  He had given the necessary notice and it would come on at 8 p.m. next Monday.

Cr Symons raised the issue of the cemetery road [rather irrelevantly] and said there were other urgent needs in East Ward, such as Mitchell’s Flat.

Mr Phillips asked how much in rates was collected from property along the new footway.

Cr Sampson thought about 17/-.

P.L. Killicoat thought it folly now to make a footway on the eastern side.

Mr Lasscock moved to uphold the action of the East Ward councillors in protesting against this work being done.  2nd P.L. Killicoat and carried nem. con.

Mr Geake thought that with 50 voices in support the Council would be open to reason.  The subsidies would soon end and the places needing attention must get it now while there were funds.

J. Roach thought the footway was not wanted if it cost much and it would be a waste of money if it cost half the £500 mentioned.

Mr Steele moved a deputation consisting of Messrs Killicoat, C. Drew, Geake, Holder, Phillips, Launder, Watt, Kennedy, A. Harris and the chairman, wait on Council to request them to rescind the resolution to proceed with the work.  Mr Harry 2nd.  Carried.
