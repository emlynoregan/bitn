Characteristics of the 1913 paper.

The paper began 1913, looking just as it had done by the end of 1912: looking a bit tired.  The typeface had got larger, so there was less news and little editorial comment.

E.F. Marston took over with XV, 1034, 19 March 1913.  Immediately there was more news, though general topics reverted to the annoying habit of being a continuous flow without significant breaks or headings to mark changes of topic.  The masthead changed with XX, 1039, 23 April 1913 to a much plainer style, perhaps perceived as a more business-like format.  This corresponded with the inexplicable volume change from XV to XX.

On 7 May there was some news on page 1 and by the end of the year this had become usual, but material was not located there because of its importance.  From XV, 1036, 2 April 1913 news etc. also appears on page 4 in fluctuating amounts.

With the arrival of Marston editorials return – not every issue, but not infrequently and the whole paper is rejuvenated.  Photographs appear throughout in the regular advertisements, but not in the news, apart from the sole exception of the bemedalled, but unnamed footballer of XX, 1059, 10 September 1913, page 3.

The oddities of the paper’s numbering continued with the typesetting mistake of 1060 being followed by 1861, which was then carried on from.  By the year’s end page 1 had larger regular advertisements, which were mostly local, and some news or other items.

Page 2 had a few large advertisements, public notices and small advertisements and sales advertisements.  There was also generally room for at least two columns of news.

Page 3 was a mixture of a few large advertisements and news items, together with advertisements in printed form to look like articles of news of general interest.

Page 4 is dominated by large advertisements that are mostly local and also carries a small amount of news and/or news-like advertising.
