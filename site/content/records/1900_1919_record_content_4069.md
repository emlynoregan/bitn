Reminiscences of Early Burra

Notice issued by the Directors of SAMA 25 March 1846.

‘Any person employed on the Burra Burra Mine will be allowed to select at the township of Kooringa a block of land, equal to half an acre, for the purpose of building thereon one or two private dwelling houses and outbuildings, subject to my approval of the plan, a lease for which will be granted by the Association for a time of 14 years, and the rate of £5 a year, with a covenant for re-entry should the land be required for mining purposes, in which case compensation will be made to the lessee for the value of any buildings he may have erected thereon.’

‘The cottages erected by the Association will be let to the first applicants, having regard to those who have been longest in the company’s employ.’

‘Small farmers will be allowed to settle on easy terms near Hallett’s Springs . . .’

[Cutting timber was forbidden.]
