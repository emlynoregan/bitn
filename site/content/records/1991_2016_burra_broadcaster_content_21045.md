Millennium Celebrations

A good crowd assembled at Booborowie [as pictured on page 1.]

Frank Fennell & Graham Duncan pitched a tent on a hill top at Saffron Downs and prepared a roast pork dinner with all the trimmings.

Tom & Debbie Quinn and Kim & Lyn Riggs and their families took swags to the top of Mt Bryan to greet the dawn of the millennium.

Helen Stockman found Rosemary Seaford at the Mine Lookout to greet the dawn in the freezing cold.
