Anzac Commemoration Service.  The 28th anniversary service was held at the memorial.  The Bowden Salvation army Band was a great acquisition to the occasion.  The procession was one of the largest for years â€“ from the RSL rooms to the square.  The Band led RSL President S.C. Genders followed by the members of the 1st AIF with Sister Keynes & Sister Mavis Riggs (2nd AIF), then came some members of 2nd AIF on leave with a member of the RAN and a squad of airmen from the RAAF for the first time.  Next came the VDC under Lieut. F.H. Reed (all in uniform) and Mrs Andrew Tennant and the Red Cross Aids.  Roy Lloyd & Albert J. Bruce of 1st AIF formed as sentries.

Clergy present were Major Jones, Envoy R.C. Winfield, Captain Gannoway and Lieut. Temby (all of the Salvation Army), Rev. H.K. Bartlett (Methodist), Rev. A.S. Barrett (Methodist).  Mr Hilary Fuss represented Rev. M.P. Cowle (Anglican) who was unavoidably absent.
