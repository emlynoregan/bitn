Lisle Pearce has given a piece of cedar to the National Trust.  It was originally part of the specimen shelves in the Assayer’s Office at the Burra Mine.  The Assayer at the time was Mr Andrew Thomas who came from Scotland with his wife in 1853.  Mr Pearce is a grandson of Mr Thomas.  He says it is clear the shelves were built before the walls were plastered.
