F.W. Holder’s Farewell, at the Burra Institute last Friday.

A public meeting had formed a committee to organise the meeting and it decided on an illuminated address and a purse of 68 sovereigns.

Mr Holder has for long worked for the benefit of Burra.  Tree planting, which beautifies the town and the Jubilee Avenue are among his farsighted ventures.

Dr Brummitt stood in for the Mayor, W. West, who could not be present.  Dr Brummitt had known Mr Holder for 14 or 15 years and felt the loss of a close friend and valuable townsman.  When he had been asked to become Mayor he had first spoken to Mr Holder and asked if he would stay on as Town Clerk for without his presence in that role he could not have fulfilled that honourable position.  Mr Holder had been at the forefront of the Flower Show.  He continued to be elected to committees when it was known that he could not attend meetings because members knew he would do more work than those on the committee.  Though there were those who spoke disparagingly of The Avenue when it was formed, it has since become an object of gratitude.

Mr Lake MP was glad to be there even at some personal inconvenience and he endorsed what was said of Mr Holder’s great ability to work hard as far as his Parliamentary role was concerned as well.

Mr P. Lane counted Mr Holder as his oldest friend.  He praised Holder’s foresight which was often ahead of his townsmen’s and this meant he had much to contend with in seeing his vision come to fulfilment.  His reward was that many of his opponents now were thankful of his works and that he had come to Burra.  He was diligent, hard working and self-sacrificing and similar sentiments were expressed in speeches from Messrs Linkson, Nevin & Father O’Dowling.

The illuminated address referred to Holder’s roles in the town as Town Clerk, Mayor, President of the Burra Institute, Member of the Burra School board of Advice, Captain of the Volunteers, Member of Parliament and many other roles.
