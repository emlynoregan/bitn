Mr Holder resigned as Town Clerk at the end of September after c. 6 years and was replaced by J.D. Cave.

Mr Geake asked how the assessment was lower when the assessor says it was £140 higher.  (This has not yet been explained.)

Mr Sampson explained his opposition to the Waterworks, though not to the satisfaction of all.

Mr E.C. Lockyer and Mr A.F. Akhurst are not reported to have said much.

Mr Sampson dwelt on the question of proper yards for sheep and cattle and the removal of the footbridge from behind the Burra Hotel.

There was considerable debate over the free water troughs in Aberdeen.

Mr Launder asked for the candidates’ views on the Salvation Army parading the streets on Sundays with drums and tambourines.  Messrs Coglin, Akhurst and Sampson were opposed while Mr West would stop it by force and W. Pearce entered into a long defence of the Army.
