At 31 December 1943 there were 5,718 books in the library.

Financially the position of the Institute is difficult.  Apart from the picture shows most activities were war efforts for which a 33⅓% discount had been allowed, though this had been discontinued in the latter part of the year.  The Council Chamber rent had been increased to £65 p.a. with exclusive use of the room and three free nights’ use of the main hall.  Hall rental has increased by £54-19-7.  Though casual repairs have been made, the building needs general renovation inside and out.  Elected were President, A.B. Riggs; Vice-President, F.T. Marston; Secretary, Rev. M.P. Cole & Treasurer, J. McGrath.
