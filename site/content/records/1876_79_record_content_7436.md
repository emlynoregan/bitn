Letters to the Editor

W. Peel Nesbitt writes denying he is likely to remove from Burra as Mr Pearce is made to state in the last issue. Mr Pearce's statement does not surprise as Nesbitt believed `the wish was father to the thought' and he further states: -`The report is calculated to do me appreciable injury.

`One of the Public' writes accusing Watson of allowing Corey to win in the champion race at the recent sports. In the 220 yds handicap Corey had a six yard start and Watson beat him easily. The public, he warns, will not long subscribe to meetings if such behaviour is allowed to pass unchallenged.
