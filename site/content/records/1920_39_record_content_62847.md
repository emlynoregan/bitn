Burra Primary School held its picnic at Stone Chimney Creek on 3 September.  The Minister of Education, the Hon. S.W. Jefferies, had notified schools that 3 September was to be ‘Jollification Day’.  The picnic involved some 200 children and 100 adults.  Lorries were organised.  Upon arrival the ladies set to work to prepare dinner.  In the afternoon there were sports.  Tea followed at 4.30 p.m., after which all children were given a bag of sweets and peanuts.  [Sports results are printed.]
