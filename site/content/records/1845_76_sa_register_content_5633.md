Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on Saturday before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate, on the body of Richard Jones.

Thomas Mills said he had been working with the deceased and was about five fathoms distant when the fall of earth occurred.  Jones had called out and the witness went to him and found him lying on his back with about a barrowful of earth lying by him.  Deceased said it had fallen from above and broken his back.  Witness had carried him to the level and with assistance had got him to the surface.  He did not think that part of the mine should have been propped until more ore had been got out.

Dr Chambers attended when the deceased was brought to the surface.  He found a fracture of either the last dorsal or the first lumbar vertebrae.  The lower body was paralysed as a consequence.  He had no hopes of the injured man’s recovery.  Deceased lived till Friday night.

Evidence was taken as to precautions taken to prevent such accidents underground.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.  The deceased was aged about 20 and had been a member of the Oddfellows’ Lodge.  Most members of the Lodge followed the body to the grave on Sunday.  The Rev. Mr Lowe delivered the address at the Wesleyan Chapel, of which the deceased was a member, and upwards of 1,000 persons attended the funeral.

[Died 17 January 1851, aged 24.]
