Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd

The Company’s franchise to supply electricity to Burra expires shortly and the future of Burra’s electricity supply will be discussed with the Town Council in the near future.  Many consumers believe that changing to ETSA will deliver cheaper power and enable the installation of more powerful electrical equipment.  The local supply has been very regular, with very few (and short) blackouts.  ETSA has had frequent long blackouts during the recent coal strike, so the retention of local back-up generating capacity, for use when ETSA fails, should be maintained.
