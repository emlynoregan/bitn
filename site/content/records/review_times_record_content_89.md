Burra National Trust Junior Group held its AGM and elected: President, Michael Ford; Vice-President, Paul Culbertson; Secretary, Steve Angle [sic: Angel?] and Treasurer, Philip Clode.  The group will continue restoration work at the Bon Accord Mine Building.  [Though the paper says wine building.]  It is the only junior group in SA and possibly in Australia.
