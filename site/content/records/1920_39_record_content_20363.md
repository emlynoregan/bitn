Burra Hospital Board, 26 July

Mr Davey moved to rescind the motion of Mr Warnes reducing the Board from 12 to 7.  He regretted that things had been said of a personal nature in the debate at the time (last November) and though he favoured the reduction in numbers he did not believe in taking away the direct representation of ratepayers.

Mr Melrose said that though things had been said that were best left unsaid he trusted all ill feeling had disappeared.  He felt that if ratepayers directly elected all the Board then the Councils that supplied the money would have no direct say.  The other problem was that elections in many council wards were rare and he couldn’t see voters turning out merely to elect the Hospital Board.

The motion was carried with Mr Melrose against.

Sister Rosa May Harvey was appointed charge-nurse of the Maternity Wing.

The Chairman (Mr Collins) had interviewed Mr Blinman who recognised that the Government owed £700 in grant money, but would not pay it unless the Board spent its money every month and sent in a return showing the need.  Mr Melrose said if the Board kept the institution on the poverty line then the subsidy would be paid, but if it were on a good footing it would not be paid.  They [the Government] will not pay a subsidy while the hospital was in funds.
