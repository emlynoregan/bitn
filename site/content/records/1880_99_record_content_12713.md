Mr Ridgway:

He began by going over actions of the recent Parliament and his general tone was to condemn almost everything done: the Nairne Railway, the Northern Railway, the new Parliament House, the Exhibition Bill, the bridge over the railway line at Morphett St in the city, Adelaide’s deep drainage, the Women’s Property Bill and a string of enquiries and commissions, expenditure on defence.  All except wool growing in the colony is in a state of bankruptcy.  What is needed is decentralisation, retrenchment and then productive expansion.

He was a Chartist and favoured payment of MPs.

Local Councils should not be subdivided.

Education he favoured, but not ‘a Government machine’.
