Leighton Strawberry Fete run by members of the Ladies Guild in aid of Hall Funds last Saturday raised over £100.  Over the years the Hall has been added to as funds allowed and now besides the main hall there is a fine stage with handsome curtains and a valuable piano.  At the rear are dressing rooms, committee room, large supper room and a large kitchen.  The committee with I.J. Warnes as President decided a few years ago to secure the lease of a block of land some two miles from the hall and this is now leased by the Mid-North Polo Club and Mid-North Croquet Club.  There is a tennis court and last, but not least a bowling green has been laid out and planted.  It is watered from a well with a windmill and engine attached.  Tenders have been called for a galvanised iron fence.  Mrs A.B. Riggs Mayoress of Burra opened the fete.  The remaining debt on the building is only about £30.
