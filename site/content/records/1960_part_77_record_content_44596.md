The Gale Evening saw each class present an item.  Parents too had a busy year with the Welfare Club providing sports equipment, aids for teachers, curtains, fans, cupboards and a table cloth for the staffroom and an amplifier (not yet arrived).  The Welfare Club ran stalls on Gala Night, a library service roster and donated ice creams and drinks for the children’s parties and the Swimming Carnival.  Mrs Perry was away overseas for a term and a half.  At the end of 1968 Miss McKenzie left to get married and to live in NSW and Mr John Cain has come from Western Teachers College in her place.  This year numbers have decreased to 222 at present.
