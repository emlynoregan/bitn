Burra Town Council

Cr Parks moved the Mayor’s report of 16 January be expunged as it is ‘nothing to do with the Council or the ratepayers . . . as it was purely an attack on the editor of the Burra Record.’  Its subsequent publication was unfortunate, but the Mayor had asked, or virtually demanded that.  2nd Cr West.

The mayor refused to accept the motion.  Dissent followed and a warm discussion.  The Mayor continued to refuse to deal with the matter.

Cr Parks eventually handed the Clerk the motion as previously reported, calling for a call of the whole Council on 6 March.
