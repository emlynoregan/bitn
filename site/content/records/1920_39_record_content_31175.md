The Karkulta Mine kept giving occasional pockets of good ore, but they always petered out.  Most of it was 3-4%.  This was of use as flux and hundreds of tons were sent to the Smelters.  In June 1858 Tiver & Pickering applied for a lease for 21 years on 1 acre of land near the cemetery for brick making and it was later granted for Â£10 p.a. and they made good bricks at 65/- per 1,000.  The good years for the mine were:	1857	11,105 tons raised

1858	12,486

1859	14,094

1860	13,860 at about 22%
