Dr Dharma Dissanayake has been cleared of any misconduct at Burra Hospital after along legal battle with Country Health SA Local Health Network.  In April 2010 Country Health terminated the services of Dr Dissanayake at Burra hospital, citing the absence of necessary credentials as the reason.  Since then Dr Dissanayake and her husband Dr Fernando have continued their Burra practice while tending to legal proceedings against Country Health.  Country health has now issued a formal apology to the doctor.  The apology acknowledges that Dr Dissanayake was not afforded procedural fairness and that the decision to suspend her credentials should not have been made.  Both Dr Dissanayake and her husband are now consulting at the Burra Hospital with the full support of hospital staff and management.  Dr Chapman for Country health says in the apology that Dr Dissanayakeâ€™s credentials were reinstated in September 2011.
