Burra Burra DC.  At the meeting of 11 May Cr John William McMahon was elected Chairman for a term of two years.  Cr Graham Malcolm Kellock was elected Deputy Chairman for the same term.

Council has advertised their intension of changing the method of assessment for 1987-88 from Site Value to Capital Value.  As more than 10% of the electors have objected to this a poll will be held on Saturday 13 June to decide the issue.  Polling Places:

Burra Civic Centre

Farrell Flat Institute

Booborowie Soldiers’ Memorial Hall

Mt Bryan Institute

Capital Value Assessment

Current market value of a property, including all improvements except trees grown for ornamental purposes or shelters.

Site Value

Current market value of the land without improvements.  These include buildings and structures, wells, dams and reservoirs and trees planted for commercial purposes.

Advantages of Site Value

Healthy and orderly development is encouraged as improvements are not subject to a penalty through tax.

Only the ‘unearned increment’ is taxed, leaving the individual’s expenditure on capital and labour untouched.

Speculative withholding of land is discouraged as rate payment is the same whether developed or not.

Redevelopment of urban land does not attract a penalty and so redevelopment of neglected urban areas is encouraged.
