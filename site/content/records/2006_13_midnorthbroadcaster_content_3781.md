Bill Stockman of Burra believes pig producers are being forced out of the business by rising costs.  He farms 1,200 pigs, but is struggling with high feed grain prices, pig meat imports, low returns and previous labour shortages.  Grain prices have almost doubled recently, but costs cannot be passed on.  About 70% of the cost for some piggeries is in feed and any movement in feed prices therefore can greatly add to costs.  Since they are now only getting about $2 a kilo for their pigs they are hardly making anything on them.  Another problem is his reliance on bore water and its relatively high salinity, which reduces the conception rate in pigs.  Salt content of ground water has nearly doubled in the past ten years.  The biggest competitors are Holland and Canada which export frozen pig meat.  [Photo.]
