Burra Rifle Club fired the 19th stage of the E.C. Collins Trophy on Saturday over double 300 yards.  Visibility was poor due to the rain and attendance was poor.  The best performance by far was by Ron Kellock with a round of 39 and then one of 34 [which the paper says gave him a total of 75 â€“ though in the tabulation of scores it is correctly listed as 39 + 34 + 7 handicap = 80].
