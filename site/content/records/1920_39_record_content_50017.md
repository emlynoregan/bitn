Cr Kellaway as a member of the School Board took exception to Cr Bevan’s remarks.  The pump in the girls’ yard had recently been mended and the tank cleaned out.  It was not fair to say the headmaster had forbidden children from bringing their own supplies.  He had not heard any complaints.  Motion carried.
