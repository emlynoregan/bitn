The Season has been very dry, but just as things were looking serious, rain fell last week.  Burra recorded 106

points and Mt Bryan 62, with 56 reported from Booborowie.  The rain did not extend far to the east.

Snow fell quite heavily in the district on Monday.  From about 3.30 a.m. Burra was covered with a mantle of white, which remained in sheltered spots after dawn, but rain had washed it away by then from trees and fences etc.  Several inches of snow were reported from Hallett and Whyte Yarcowie.  The hills around Burra were snow-capped for several hours.
