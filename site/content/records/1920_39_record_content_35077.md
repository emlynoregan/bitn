Burra Town Council, 5 August

Cr W.R. Lee resigned as Chairman of the Public Works Committee, as he was unable to attend to the duties. Accepted with regret.

Police advise they are unable to act on the damage at the cemetery due to lack of evidence.

The Finance Committee recommended that owing to the financial position of Council the three permanent employees (Voumard, Hill & Wilson) be employed for the rest of the year three weeks out of four.

Cr Woollacott thought the Town Clerk should have his salary cut to the 1929 level.  The Mayor said the award prevented that.

Cr Woollacott wondered how other Councils managed to do so.  Later he appears to answer his own question by saying other Councils had cut the amount of rates collected and the Town Clerk’s salary was related to the amount of rates.

The mayor said nothing could be done on those lines till November.

The Town Clerk said that in fact in other Councils the office expenses had been cut back, but not the Clerk’s salary.  The Finance Committee’s report was adopted.

The question of ‘The Guns’.

Cr Woollacott moved the matter be deferred to the first meeting in the New Year on account of finances.

Cr Kellaway amended this to Council voting £10 towards the RSL scheme.

Cr Pearce said he opposed both ideas.  The RSL had advanced no reasonable argument for the move back to Market Square.  Most people were not in favour of moving the guns.  He wanted it left to be an issue at the next elections.  Cr Allen agreed with Cr Pearce and the amendment was lost.

Cr Pearce then moved an amendment that the RSL be informed that the Council had no intention of moving the guns.  Not seconded.

The motion was put and lost, meaning that absolutely no decision was reached.

It was resolved to send a letter protesting the recent imposition of ½d on every sheep yarded and sold at country yards.  This was a step towards centralisation and a detriment to country towns.

The Mayor said that as time goes on our sales get smaller and smaller.

No Councillors available to do so would consent to sit on the Hospital Board.

[Three of them were already members by election and the other three were businessmen who could not attend at the times the Board sat.]
