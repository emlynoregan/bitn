Obituary and Inquest.  William Henry Pitcher, aged 18, was killed in a hay carting accident.  He was working for Mr Thomas Rogers.  The inquest was held at Hanson on Sunday.

The evidence of those at the farm was consistent and the police agreed with them.

The deceased was struck violently when a wagon jolted and the hay frame fell down, catching the deceased on the chest and breaking his back which came into contact with the frame of the wagon.  The deceased had been cautioned to put the hay frame down when the wagon was unloaded, but had ignored the advice.  [Born 14 July 1884; died 15 March 1903]
