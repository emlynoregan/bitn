Ian Falkenberg has moved to Burra to establish an office here for National Parks and Wildlife SA.  For now he will move into temporary accommodation at 20a Commercial St, but later will share office space with the Goyder Animal and Plant Control Board.  Ian will be joined by a Senior Ranger by early October.  Part of his role will be the oversight of the new Mokota Conservation Park to be declared formally in October.  [Photo]
