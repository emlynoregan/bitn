The Fire: Corrections

Mr Harry Yon also capably assisted the firemen.

When we said the dividing walls were of weatherboard packed with sawdust, this only applied to the wall between K. Wohling’s and Bowey & Montgomery’s.  The walls of the Record office are 18-24 inches thick and so is that between Sara’s and Bowey & Montgomery’s.

Old residents gave the age of the premises as 80-90 years.

[Note.  A photograph taken during WWI shows the eastern wall of Sara’s along Drew Lane being built and this shop appears to have been totally rebuilt at that time, though the party wall to the west may still have remained from the earlier construction.]
