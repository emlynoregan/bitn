Burra Show was held last Saturday.  Rain began to fall as the opening ceremony got under way and heavy rain followed.  It lasted several hours.  Many people left and the sideshows closed down.  Most visitors arrived before this and the gate was only Â£29 down on 1948 and the society should not suffer any loss.  Much of the success of the show must be credited to Mr Glen Finch and Mr Bob Angel, President and Secretary respectively.  On the whole entries were up and sideshows were numerous and did well until the rain forced their closure.  The Machinery exhibit was large.  The Department of Agriculture had a model of an ideal farm that took up 30 ft of space in the pavilion.  Ring events were completed despite the rain and entries were out in force.  Arts and photography exhibits were plentiful.  Pigeons were well presented, as were the poultry exhibits.  Cooking entries were good, but the dog section was not good this year.  Flower entries were down.  Grain & Fodder entries were above average.  Eggs and fresh butter were well represented, but cattle were not.  Needlework was outstanding.  Sheep entries were up, especially for Merinos and fleece entries had also increased.  Pig entries improved this year and vegetables were better than usual.  Schoolwork not for competition continues to improve as an exhibit.
