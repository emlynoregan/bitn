Burra Coronation Band AGM

The Mayor was elected President with E.J. Harris as Treasurer and E.J. Davey as Secretary.  The meeting resolved to buy two instruments at a cost of Â£30.  Three subscription books were issued to the Mayor, G. Tiddy and J. Pascoe.  There will be a concert in July with half the proceeds for the Belgian Fund.

A.L. Killicoat, the son of the late P.L. Killicoat, who enlisted in the Lovat Scots, has now received a commission in the 14th Royal Scots Infantry.
