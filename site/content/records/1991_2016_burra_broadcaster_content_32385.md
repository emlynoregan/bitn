Remembrance Day in Burra this year will be attended by Federal MHR for Grey, Barry Wakelin.  Afterwards he will unveil the restored Honour Boards, now re-hung in the RSL/Council Chamber.  The ‘Burra Remembers’ project received $3,658 from a ‘Saluting Their Service’ funding round to allow the work to be done.  The local RSL contributed $1,000.
