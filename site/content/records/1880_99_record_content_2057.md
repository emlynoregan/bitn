Kooringa Wesleyan Church Anniversary.  The preacher was Rev. H.T. Burgess.  Mr Holder read the financial report, which showed that £150 had been paid off the debt, which now stood at £800 (less the £100 now raised).  This included the new Sunday school and classrooms, lately erected at a cost of c. £800.  A new organ had also been bought in the year.  The congregation had raised in the year £641-2-0.

Expenses were: -

Support of the ministry		£171-12-9

Connexional Funds		£44-  0-4

Church Funds

(Debt reduction, lighting, etc.)	£375-  8-0

Rev. Burgess’s address at the public meeting is reported.  He was minister at Burra 32 years earlier (1848), and spoke of the past.

‘At that time the Burra church was not so large as now, but occupied about the middle of the present building.  Then a transept was added, and afterwards the nave was widened to the extent of the transept and so the old building might be said to have been thrown out of windows.  The schoolroom then was a portion of the ruin now standing at the rear of the church, and an idea of the progress made since then could be got by contrasting the centre of the church with the present roomy and comfortable place and the old ruins with the new schoolroom.’

The rest of the address was on the progress of society in the nineteenth century.

The anniversary raised over £104.
