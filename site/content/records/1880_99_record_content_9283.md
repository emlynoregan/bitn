Letter from ‘Athlete’ re the proposal to shift the Foresters’ Picnic from the Queen’s Birthday Holiday to Easter Monday.  This brings it into competition with other events such as the Burra-Jamestown cricket match and the Wesleyan Sunday School tea meeting.  In addition the Princess Royal grounds are better than the Police Paddock, while the weather is also more suitable on the Queen’s Birthday.
