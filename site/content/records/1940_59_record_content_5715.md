Instructions are given for First Aid Volunteers, stretcher-bearers, volunteers with trucks and cars to transport the wounded to clearing stations and the Base Hospital, messenger boys and girls, the Fire Brigade, telephone and water supply operators and the Demolition Squad, which was to be ready to excavate buried civilians.
