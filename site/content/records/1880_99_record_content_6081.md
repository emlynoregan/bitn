The proposal is for the expenditure of: -

£1,600 for roads

£400 for a complete town survey

£500 for enclosing, levelling and planting the Recreation Reserve

This would bring the total debt to £3,500 and deducting the probable income for 1882, to £2,500, which the Finance Committee is asked to suggest a way of raising.

We believe it can be done at 5-6% in bonds redeemable at £200 p.a. commencing in say 1886.  The lack of a whole town survey is a serious disadvantage.

As for the £500 for the Reserve.  This will not be supplemented by the Government so it would be foolish in the extreme to do it out of the ordinary rate.

Nor do we think it right to impose a special rate which would fall most heavily on the weekly tenants.  The town will have to vote on this and we think the proposals will benefit all.  Owners of property will see it increase in value; tenants will find an increased demand for labour and more money in circulation in the town.
