Burra Swimming Pool.  There are rumours about the water treatment of the pool this year.  In fact the water is very clean and has been in excellent condition throughout the season.  There are, however, some dead algae on the floor of the pool, which vacuum cleaning alone cannot shift due to the rough surface.  After consultation with experts it is now being moved using stainless steel brushes, though a stain on the bottom will remain.  The pool is still open and has not been closed or condemned.
