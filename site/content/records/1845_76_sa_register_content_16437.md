Education Report.

[There is quite a lengthy article on the report of the Board of Education for 1862.  For the colony it shows that schools increased by 8 and the number of scholars by 706.  This meant that schools were increasing at a rate of 3½% and student numbers at 6½%.  One school closed at Redruth.  The average stipend of teachers in municipal towns was £46-19-6 and in country districts £51-11-4, compared with £50-2-7¼ for 1861.  The average amount of school fees received by teachers in municipal towns was £75-10-6 and in country districts was £45-15-0.  The apparent increase in the latter item over 1861, which was then £40-18-11, arose chiefly from the townships of Kooringa and Kapunda, which came under a new classification included in the country districts.]
