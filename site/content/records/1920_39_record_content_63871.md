[Note that the above is not entirely accurate.  See Ian Auhl, The Burra Model School 1878-1978, Lynton Publications, Blackwood SA, 1977.  The building was intended for 800-900 children and the final cost was £6,996-8-0.  When the writer says the original part of the Institute he is referring to the structure of 1857 when the tender of Messrs Tiver, Cole and Sinnegear was accepted for £446-16-0 for the masonry work and that of Mr Bruse to do the woodwork for £473.]
