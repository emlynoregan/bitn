David Messenger is very grateful to all who donated the money to purchase the special chair he is now using for kidney dialysis at home.  Some $1,300 has been deposited in a special account and last week the Burra Picnic Race Club made a presentation of $400 to the appeal.  Should the appeal attract more donations than are required for the chair the balance will go to another special project in due course.
