Editorial on the response in Australia to the campaign in Sudan.  On balance it is not in favour of Australian participation.  ‘. . . there seems to be nothing now Gordon is dead, to fight for.’

The line is general that if there were a reason to fight then South Australia would be ready to a man to defend the honour or integrity of the empire, but in this case the cake is not worth the candle.
