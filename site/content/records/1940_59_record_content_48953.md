Murray Water

When the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline was first proposed, there was some discussion about Burra being supplied, but it did not happen.  Now further representation has been made and the reply of the Minister of Works, Hon. M. McIntosh, has been that when the pipeline was laid the local support was lukewarm.  The committee at the time was unable to complete its investigations in respect to the minor considerations regarding supplying Clare, Laura, Jamestown, Burra, Terowie and Peterborough.  It confined its report to the trunk line to Whyalla.  Subsequently the committee enquired into the supply for Laura, Clare and a combined scheme for Jamestown, Caltowie, Peterborough and Terowie.  The Government approved the schemes for Laura, Clare, Jamestown and Caltowie, as these towns had no supply at all.  When pipes and manpower are available the schemes for Jamestown and Caltowie will proceed.  Burra has a reticulated supply, which meets most demands and the only effect of a change to Murray water would be to better quality water at an expense to taxpayers of about Â£25,000.  Since the war a shortage of materials and manpower has forced a concentration on towns and districts with no supply at all.  Thus until such places as Jamestown, Caltowie, Yorke Peninsula, Auburn, Meningie, Milang, Lameroo, Swan Reach, Pt McDonald and Karoonda are served, the diversion of resources to Burra cannot at present be justified.
