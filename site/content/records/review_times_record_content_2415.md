A Baynes Family Book is being written about this family that migrated from Cambridgeshire in the 1850s.  Descendants have spread widely from the original focus of the Mid North and Yorke Peninsula.  The writer is Mrs Roslyn Paterson of Bute.  A family reunion is to be held at BCS on 25 February 1979, when the book will be launched.
