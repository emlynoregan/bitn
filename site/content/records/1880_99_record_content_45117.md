Burra Public School.  The Redruth correspondent considered the number of private schools in Burra could be accounted for because in the Public School ‘there were too many “hobble-dehoy” teachers with their fickle minds who at the least little thing lose their temper, and send the children up to the head master for chastisement thus creating a dislike for their teacher.’
