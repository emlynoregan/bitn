The 5th Annual Burra Yacht Club Regatta will be held 13 October.  A feature this year will be the Copper Man Competition, said Secretary Steve Woolley.  There will also be a Clare-Burra Barrow Push.  Four teams have so far entered.  This will provide experience for the big Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push planned for January 1986.  The Royal Caledonian Pipe Band will also be present.  There will be events for Juniors, Seniors and Ladies as well as Open Events.  The Tracker James Perpetual Trophy will be awarded to the boat and crew with the nest results at the end of the day.  This was first awarded in 1983 to commemorate one of the characters who first started the regatta.  According to Mr Woolley the idea for the event was born in the mid 1970s during ‘one of Burra’s notorious floods’.  Peter Reilly and Tracker James had a discussion about who could sail furthest down the Burra Creek.  They decided to put claims to the test over the long weekend in October.  No one knows what really happened, but it is believed that both the home-made craft sank and quite a quantity of beer was consumed.  As a result the rules of the regatta allow anything from craft made from beer cans to bathtubs as long as they can float.  Boats must carry a sail of at least one square metre and can be no larger than two metres square.  But Mr Woolley dais any entries bearing any resemblance to a real yacht would probably be banned.  Last year there were 160 entries and about 2,000 spectators.  About $2,000 was raised for local charities and for the Yacht Club’s beautification program for the creek banks.  There is a plan for a new gate in the weir so that the creek could be cleaned out regularly.  A cabaret in the Town Hall will conclude the event.
