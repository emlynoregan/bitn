Tony Thorogood of Thorogoods Apple Wines has had a collection of plays published.  He wrote and had them performed in Adelaide in the 1970 and 1980s.  Published as Noah’s Nuclear Niche and Other Crazy Plays: ‘for those who like to laugh, for those who don’t want to take life too seriously, for those, as my mother used to say, who can see the funny side.’
