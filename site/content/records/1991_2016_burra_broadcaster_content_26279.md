Letter.  Verity Robertson of the BSA Owners Club of Sa writes re the clubâ€™s forthcoming visit to Burra.  They will stay at Paxton Square and on Saturday 27 October will travel north to Hallett for morning tea at the Bowling Club, then to Whyte Yarcowie, Jamestown and Bundaleer Forest for lunch, before returning to Burra via Spalding for a Bon Accord Mine Tout.  On Sunday they will depart Burra at 10 a.m. for Clare via Farrell Flat, thence to Blyth, Halbury, Auburn, Leasingham to Mintaro for lunch before visiting Martindale Hall and returning to Burra via Farrell Flat.  The club was formed in 1990 in Adelaide for all interested in BSA motorcycles.  Its first rally was in 1991 to Burra and this its 10th.  About 65 cycles will take part, ranging from a 1930 model to 1997.
