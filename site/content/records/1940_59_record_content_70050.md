Obituary.  The death by accident at Mt Barker on Thursday of Mr Lewis Bluff Rayner of Hallett came as a great shock.  He was born in 1881 at ‘The Bluff’ Hallett and remained on the property all his life.  In 1911 he married Alice Honan and the couple had five children: three daughters and two sons.  One son, Keith, was killed in the last war while a member of the RAAF.  Mr Rayner’s life work was the sheep industry.  The property was opened up by his late father William James Rayner in the 1860s and has been carried on by family members ever since.  In recent years Mr Rayner has been a partner in the stud with his son Max.  He took a keen interest in ‘showing’ stud Merinos and in the big Ram Sales of the eastern and western states.  In his youth he took a great interest in sporting activities throughout the district.  He was well respected by residents and known as a very fine gentleman.  Mr Rayner was a member of the newly formed Hallett Bowling Club and of the Freemason’s Lodge.

[Born 11 January 1881 Canowie.  The SA Deaths CD is clearly in error in giving his date of death as 29 September 1956 at Butler’s Crossing, residence Whyte Yarcowie.]
