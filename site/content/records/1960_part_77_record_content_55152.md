Dr Grant Inglis Protector of Historical Relics as observer.

Mr Roberts said Samin was not yet producing an income and was there fore not in a position to spend shareholders’ money, but they were prepared to offer mechanical help – making available machinery on the site and to help in the demolition and transport of masonry to sites for proposed rebuilding.  This was considered a valuable offer.

Mr Auhl outlined the reason for having submitted his plan.  Success depended on the State Government and public support.  Dr Grant Inglis considered there had in the past been a lack of adequate liaison between the National Trust, the District Council and Samin.  All agreed that this was important.

The proposed sites for relocation were then discussed.

An offer from Mr G. O’Connor of a site close to the Mine Entrance was noted and acclaimed.

The Burra Burra DC also was considering making another site available.

All parties agreed the first priority was the chimney stack.  Second came Graves’ Pump House and 3rd Peacock’s Pump House.  The Director of Mines in summing up stressed the need for action in the next few weeks.  Mining developments would make it difficult to remove buildings within the next month or so.
