Royalties – The SA Mining Company Protests.  (From the SA Gazette, 3 October.)

On 23 September the local directors of the SA Mining Company, Messrs J. Baker, G.A. Anstey & Captain Hart, with Mr Gwynne the legal adviser for the company, proceeded to the Registry Office to protest against the imposition of royalties and the conditions of their land grant offered to them for the special survey at Reedy Creek.  They only accepted the land grant under protest, for fear of losing the survey to another party.

[The reporter then goes on to describe the ‘most outrageous violation of the rights of the colonists.’]

The point of their objection was that the company had paid £20,000 for 20,000 acres believing in good faith that it included all ‘timber, minerals and appurtenances.’  The payment of their purchase was effected in England on 11 July 1845, but on 5 March 1846 the SA Government Gazette announced that the Lieutenant Governor had imposed a mineral reserve of royalty of one fifteenth portion of all metals and ores containing metals on or under the waste lands of the province: effective immediately.  In accepting the land grant they registered their denial of the legitimacy of this act as not being authorised by an Act of the Imperial Parliament.  [Their protest in all its convoluted and protracted legal terminology is printed.]
