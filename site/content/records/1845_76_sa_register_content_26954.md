[A letter to the editor on 21 from John Charles seeks to clear him of any involvement in the events of the 13 December.   He says he left the bar at 10.45 p.m. and had nothing to do with the drink consumed after that.  Those in the bar were sober when he left.  He also defends the licensee Mr Thomas Edwards.

A letter on 22 December from Thomas Edwards seeks to defend him from any improper behaviour.  He says the evidence at the inquest proved the deceased was sober when he left the bar and he was not responsible for what happened thereafter.  Also, had he been informed that the deceased had been left on his doorstep he would have got up and seen to him, even though he was suffering from asthma and it would have been at some danger to his own health.]
