Agriculture.  Harvesting is over and the yield has been good despite hot winds, with many getting 20 to 25 bushels per acre.  The northern lands are rapidly being opened up.  A few years ago this district was deemed unsuitable for tillage, but experience has proved the land equal to that of our neighbours, especially since rust is unknown here.  Dray-loads of wheat are arriving continually at the Burra Station and much has already been forwarded.
