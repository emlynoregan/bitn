Goyder Council

The ‘Burra’ car, which has provided ‘cheap’ advertising for Burra for several years has been traded in and the new car will not feature any signage.

Goyder Council is seeking written assurance that the MFS will not be withdrawn from Burra.

A committee will look into signage on the Burra-Morgan Road and at the entrances to Burra.

Council recognised the need to update the Burra Office, but as yet has made no budget commitments – Douglas Alexander of Flightpath Architects has been asked to provide alternative layouts for the Civic Centre for a fee of $2,950.

O’Connor’s Shed [Drew & Crewes’ Bulk Store] – Council has decided to accept an offer of $80,000 for the O’Connor’s Shed property, to be developed as an interpretive site of Aboriginal heritage for the Mid North Region.  The acceptance of the offer depends on the confirmation of a grant from the Indigenous Land Council by the 20 June and development approval from the Development assessment Commission.  The purchaser is a Mr Warrior and/or nominee representing the Ngadjuri people.

BCS.  Eight students attended the Rostrum Voice of Youth Competition in Jamestown on 12 May.  [Title of event from Issue 313, 11 June 1997, page 3.]  Burra speakers did well without getting into winning places except for Rachael Vogel, who won a $40 cash prize and the chance to speak in Adelaide on 1 June.
