Flood.  A cloudburst at Pine Creek Station, some 55 miles northeast of Burra, had a spectacular result on Monday last week.  Without any warning between 2 inches and six inches of rain fell on parts of Pine creek and Stuart’s Well Stations from 2 p.m.  As a result a wall of water over six feet high rushed down Pine Creek carrying fences, large trees and other debris before it.  It tapered off towards the edges to form a mass of water about three quarters of a mile wide, filling all the dams in its path and depositing in them fence posts, tree trunks and the like.  On either side of the storm there was insufficient rain to settle the dust.  Lou Gare reported the event and Ivan Gare, his brother, said in his years of experience in the district he did not know of a similar incident.
