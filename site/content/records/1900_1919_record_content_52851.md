He says he sympathises with Mr Winnall in his difficult position.

‘His legal vampings must be viewed with tolerance, but I am afraid he has not improved the dire situation.’

‘I ask you to allow me to traverse some of his remarkably elastic liberties and deductions.’

I am a Board member of some 20 not 15 years.  My attendance was never very regular, but I was always in keen touch with the affairs of the hospital.  Things went smoothly for years until a ‘new element’ came in with a policy of management.

‘Part of this policy was to use an axe where a pen knife would have answered the purpose.’

He then takes on the issue of Matron Mosey’s requested leave of absence and takes the view she was treated very badly for one with 17 year’s service.  He denies seeing her before the Board meeting.  When she left she did indeed have a social, a presentation and well-wishers, but where were the Board?  Where were the appropriate speeches from Board members?  As far as most of them were concerned ‘it was a dull soulless gathering’.

While denying that Dr Steele was told to mind his own business over this matter Mr Winnall does attempt to gloss it over by saying ‘although some such expression was on one occasion used by Mr Bartholomaeus to Dr Steele.’

Would ‘such an expression, or anything approaching it have been allowed under the old Board.’

Mr Winnall says: ‘That in all our dealings with the doctors we have tried to be gentlemen.’

They have been the reverse, not only in concrete cases, but also in distrust, suspicion and indirect thrusts more difficult to pin down.

One specific case – they gave notice to the doctors severely restricting their rights to admit patients and handing that prerogative largely to members of the Board.  This was a clumsy and stupid departure that had to be rescinded.  The humiliating motion against Dr Ashton that he had been unfair to nursing staff was not conducive to discipline and obedience.  As for offering the Doctor the position of honorary surgeon: this amounts to saying ‘You are discharged for bad conduct, but we expect you to come and help us when we are in extremis and the blame is on you if you don’t.’

‘I believe this motion was made by that courageous and youthful expedient Mr P.A. McBride.  The letter I drafted was but an embodiment of the Board’s views, not all my own views by any means.  It was the Chairman’s letter.

Mr Winnall endeavours to involve me in an attack upon Mr George Lawn’s occupation, but I honour every man’s legitimate calling equally as much as either of these two gentlemen. [Winnall & Warnes]

To suggest that the work of the Board was hung up because of a question over my reappointment was simply nonsense.  How many vacancies are there at present – and why have they not been filled?

‘Mr Winnall’s plaintive appeal on behalf of his Board, and his shedding of crocodile tears, has not helped the position.’

‘I understand that the Board’s hope is in the return of Dr Steele, a hope we all most cordially endorse.’

‘Their experience may protrude upon their minds the fact that a hospital might be run without a Board, but never without doctors and nurses.’
