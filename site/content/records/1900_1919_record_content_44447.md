Burra Mine.  An article reprinted from the Register of 23 October 1915.

The Burra Mine is to be sold on 27 January 1916 by public auction.

On 16 April 1845 the SA Mining Association came into being to develop the colony’s mineral wealth and prevent it all falling into the hands of one or two of the wealthy.

It issued shares to £5,000 in £5 shares with liberty to increase them to £20,000 worth.  Its aims were:

To purchase or sell mineral lands

To carry on mining operations when they were advisable

To let on royalty or otherwise

In response to an advertisement placed by the Secretary, H. Ayers, a shepherd named Stear produced a valuable copper specimen he said he had discovered on unsold wasteland to the north of Mr F.H. Dutton’s Princess Royal sheep run.  The part of the Burra Survey which comprises the Burra Burra Mines was not known to be metalliferous till a few weeks after Stear’s find when Thomas Picket, a bullock driver employed by William Robinson, then of Gum Creek, had his attention taken by an outcrop of red oxide of copper.  A special survey of 20,000 acres was made embracing the two finds and on 20 Sep. 1845 it was divided into two parts.  The northern moiety which turned out to be the really valuable one fell to SAMA.

Ten Cornish miners, a blacksmith and a Captain were sent north and arrived at Burra on 29 Sep. 1845.  They blasted out the red oxide and sent it back on the drays that had carried their supplies north.

After purchasing the freehold of the 10,000 acres SAMA had just £1,800 of working capital, but in the first seven months they made £20,000 profit and the ensuing eleven months produced a nett profit of £70,000.

For the 29½ years of the mine’s operation between 1845 and 30 Sep. 1877:

Ore produced 	234,648 tons

Realised nett.	£3,110,911

Cost of production	£2,284,325

Profit	£826,586

Wages	£1,400,988
