Burra Town Council, 19 March

The Council resolved that the gum tree at the Rectory would be lopped.

SA Housing Trust forwarded plans for the timber framed houses proposed for Burra, to be retained by the Council in an effort to stimulate interest from local builders.

Mr Ellis wrote saying there was no foundation in the statements [concerning the SA Housing Trust] he was alleged to have made.

A quote was received for two fluorescent lights for the Library for Â£7-2-6, from Burra Radio & Electrical Service.

H.M. Scott tendered his resignation from Council from 14 April, as he was leaving the district.
