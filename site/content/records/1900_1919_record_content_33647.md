J.M. McBride has donated £4,000 towards establishing a Chapman Alexander Bible Institute.  This is but one of many philanthropic donations.  It is estimated that in the last 20 years he has given away at least £3,000 p.a. ‘and he does it so unostentatiously that comparatively few people know anything of it, fewer still realise the full extent of his donations.  A hundred pounds here and there, and sometimes a couple of hundred or more is quite a common matter with him.’
