Victoria Park Improvement Committee

The surface of Victoria Park has deteriorated so far as to be detrimental to good sport.  Last year Fred Collins and Charlie Hill tried to improve the ground for cricket, but got little support.  A meeting was called for 11 August to do something about the place and it now seems an infusion of new blood might achieve something.

The Mayor took the chair and said he and others had gone into the matter of ploughing and grading and had consulted competent men and the necessary work should cost £40.  About 120 yards of piping with fittings to water the grass would cost c. £11.  20lb of seed was needed to plant the 4 acres.

Mr Kellaway moved those present form a vigilance committee.  A deputation will wait on Council to get their approval and assistance and a £ for £ subsidy to the value of £30.  The present expenditure of £25 would not have happened if it were not for the Back to Burra activities.

There was discussion about how to charge users for maintenance.  Football had some income; cricket did not.  F. Collins said Booborowie Committee used to charge clubs £2-2-0 p.a. each.

On Monday a deputation waited on the Town Council seeking £30 for the scheme.

Cr Woollacott asked what guarantee there was that the Committee would not peter out in a few months with all the money wasted.

Fred Collins said no one could guarantee being here next year or even tomorrow.

The Mayor said even if the grass died the oval would have been levelled.

Mr Bednall believed there would be no problem getting the other £30 – he would not mind guaranteeing it himself.

Cr Woollacott was absolutely opposed.

Help had been refused the playground, and the bowls and tennis clubs had to find their own money.  If they spent money here while putting rubbish on the roads it was wrong.  Money should be spent to help the unemployed.  In any case the ground was too rocky and full of small quarries.

Cr Riggs moved the request be granted, as it would be money well spent: not all money should go on roads when many ratepayers had no cars to use them.

Cr Kellaway said the Council gave land to the tennis clubs and many clubs would use the park.  He seconded the motion which was carried and the committee given permission to proceed.
