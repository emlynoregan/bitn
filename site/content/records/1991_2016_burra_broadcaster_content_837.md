Railway Lines Disappear.

A contractor has been engaged to remove the railway line between Hallett and Burra.  It is reported that Australia National wanted to use the 75 kg rail elsewhere.   It is said to be in excellent condition.  The contractor gets to keep [and dispose of] the sleepers.  Mr Russell King, speaking for Australia National, said the removal would cease at Burra.
