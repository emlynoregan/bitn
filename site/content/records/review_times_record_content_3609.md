SA’s 1987 Mid North Merino Field Days will be condensed to three days, 16 March to 18 March, with 53 studs participating.  Several Jamestown studmasters have said they felt disadvantaged by the four day format because many visitors were unwilling to travel further north after calling at the larger studs earlier in the week.  Some will now move their rams south on Tuesday and Wednesday for better exposure.  [The field days program is printed.]
