Near Drowning.  Yesterday afternoon at quarter to five a son of Mr Charles Fuss, returning home from school, fell into the creek while attempting the ford near Roach’s Mill and began to float downstream.  He was rescued by a young man named Rosewall who jumped in fully clothed, having been going home with other young men from the quarries.  The lad was taken home by C. Grow.

[This would seem to have been Robert Lawrence Fuss as his elder brother Raymond Lloyd, apparently went to Copperhouse School until June 1896.]
