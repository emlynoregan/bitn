Nathaniel O’Brien was selected to go into ‘boot camp’ with 100 others after his initial audition for the X-Factor.  He survived the first day, after which half the group was sent home, but was eliminated in the next round.  He was by then the last South Australian representative.  There had originally been more than 50,000 entrants for X-Factor 2014.  [3 photos.]
