Burra Literary Soc. met on 2 September with the President, W.T. Rabbich, in the chair.

Dr Sangster gave a lecture on ‘Morality’.

The first half of the lecture was on the human body, illustrated with charts.

Two songs and a recitation followed in the interval.

The second half of the lecture dealt with the consequences of animal passion, licentiousness and abuse of nature’s gifts leading to the wreckage of souls, lives and homes.  He referred to seducers, excessive drinking and corrupters.  There were four great aids to those decisions of leading a good moral life:

Prayer

Healthy recreation and physical exercise

Avoidance of stimulants and a luxurious diet

Cultivation of the intellect
