Burra’s population has gradually been moving – many to Broken Hill, but also to WA.  The other night in Argent St in Broken Hill no fewer than 30 Burra boys were to be seen quietly talking together and another bunch were a bit further on.  It is thought at least 300 Burra persons have had to cut out for the Barrier.
