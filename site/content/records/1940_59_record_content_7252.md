Burra Town Council, 1 September

A delegation from the Burra Progress Association waited on the Council to ask how it could assist the Commission investigating the possibilities of the Burra Copper Mines.  It felt it had a good case to present.  Cr Kellaway said that representatives of the Association should be invited to attend the meeting of the Council and the Commission and the Mayor agreed.

Mr R. Fuss offered to construct the swing bridge at Burra North at the same price he had tendered some time ago, the price being subject to any increase in the price of timber.  The minute concerning council employees doing the work was then rescinded and Mr Fuss’s offer was accepted.

National Day of Prayer.  The Burra Institute was comfortably filled on Sunday night in answer to H.M. King George’s call to prayer.  On the platform were the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott Esq., Envoy Winfield (Salvation Army), Revs. Potter and Usher and the Combined Choirs.  Members of the local RSL, VSD, and the Girl Guides took places reserved for them in the hall.  Rev. Potter gave an inspiring address based on the trial of Jesus in Gethsemane: ‘Father, if this cup cannot pass away except I drink it, Thy will be done.’  The collection of £5-12-0 will aid the YMCA.
