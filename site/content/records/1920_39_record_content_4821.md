Burra Football Association meeting of 13 July

Umpires J. Birrell and Stan Kellaway tendered their resignations.  Mr Kellaway’s letter of resignation is published – he was in dispute with the delegates for lack of support when he felt he had upheld the Association’s rules when some of the other umpires apparently had not.  The resignations were accepted.  Mr Waters tendered his resignation as field umpire, but later withdrew it.  The withdrawal was accepted.  Reg. Kellaway was offered a position as field umpire for £2-2-0 a match: he had sought £3-3-0.  The Mt Bryan Club withdrew from the Association because the Association had failed to provide satisfactory umpires.  The acceptance of this would render the entire meeting null as Mt Bryan delegates had taken part.  A special meeting to thrash it all out was called for 20 July.
