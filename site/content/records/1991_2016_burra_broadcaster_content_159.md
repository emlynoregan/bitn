Graham Kellock writes as a candidate for election and as Chairman of the Burra Burra DC for the past year:

I feel the articles published in the paper regarding Council Elections were not in the best interests of community unity.  There are no wards and therefore no ‘town’ Councillors.  The Council in the past year has represented both town and district in an unbiased manner and I trust the Council elected on 4 May will do the same.
