Streetlighting.  Burra Town Council is beginning to see the need for better streetlighting.  It has agreed to a proposal from Cr Ockenden for a lamp on the corner of Quarry and Kingston Streets to add to the 8 or 10 already in position.  [As already noted, these two streets do not intersect.  If it was in Kingston Street perhaps the intersection with East Street was meant, as that would be near the Salvation Army Citadel, but that is sheer speculation.]
