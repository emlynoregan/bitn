Obituary & Inquest.  George [Wilson] Roberts died 7 September [aged 34] at Wildotta.  P. Lane JP, coroner and Arthur Motley, foreman of the jury.

William Sara, of Sara & Dunstan - Had employed the deceased c. 3 months as a mason’s labourer.  Was advised on Thursday by John Harvey, another workman, that Roberts was ill.  Sent Harvey to get a doctor and to inform the deceased’s wife.  Went out to Wildotta, but Roberts died within five minutes of my arrival.

Jane Roberts - Her husband had complained of chest pains for the last two years and had done so quite recently.

John Harvey then gave details of the deceased’s last day.  He had not felt well and had not worked on Thursday and by Thursday afternoon was coughing blood.  Roberts had died immediately after the arrival of Dr Brummitt at Wildotta c. 9.15 p.m.

Dr Robert Brummitt - a post mortem revealed that death was due to an aneurism, which burst in the gullet.  It seemed to have been of considerable duration and death was inevitable and life could not have been prolonged by earlier medical aid.

Verdict was death by natural causes.
