Burra Show Soc.  A special meeting was called to discuss the opinions of sheep breeders on trophies offered by W. Hawker (of Anama, Clare) and T.H. Pearse & Sons (of The Gums), to stimulate interest.  Details of the entry conditions are printed.  After discussion the Hawker Trophy was accepted on the conditions named and the Pearse Trophy accepted subject to clarification concerning the number of days' growth of fleece.  There was also a discussion concerning the feeding of exhibited sheep, but that was eventually adjourned.
