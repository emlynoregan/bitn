Letters from Ron R. Wilksch (Robertstown), Peter Kelly (Burra) and Anne Hornsey (Kapunda) express concern over the implications of the recently released South Australian Health Plan.

Letter.  R.P. Brodie of Burra writes to complain about the recent rate increase for Burra.

Burra pays the highest rates for any council in SA.

Rates have risen at three to four times the inflation rate.

A house of the same design by the same builder incurs more than twice the rates in Burra than the exact same thing in suburban Adelaide.
