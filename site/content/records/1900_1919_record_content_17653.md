Burra Mine: Burra Burra Copper Co.

There have been no further developments regarding a possible sale.  It is amazing that with copper prices so high nothing is being done with the property.  Modern treatment processes have costs that are half those of the old mine.  In the last couple of years the opportunity to ascertain the potential wealth of the mine has been wasted.  At present little or no development is being done and that in hand is not remunerative.  Some men have been put on to treat material that was handled in the past.  Why some men doing this are on day work and others on tribute to treat precisely the same dump seems strange.  The pump is still working periodically.  Its potential is not realised as the pumps are not deep enough and the inrush of water is not strong enough to keep it going all the time.

Eastern Mining & Prospecting Syndicate failed to get its money in its call of Â£1 per share recently.  The board have called a meeting for 21 July when a balance sheet and list of assets will be produced.  The claim is about 30 miles east of Burra and some good examples of gold were won.

Martindale Sluicing Co. is making slow progress towards being floated.

Harry Goodwin leaves for Norwood and will be given a farewell social at the Exchange Hotel tomorrow evening.  He will be missed in the sporting fraternity.
