[The description continues with considerably more details.]

The jigger has been erected to receive the stuff from ten head of stamps, and to replace one known as a Moonta jigger, which was found to be unsuited to the class of ores obtained at Burra, the fine stuff from the stamps completely choking it and making no separation of ores from the waste.  The new jigger will handle four tons of stuff per hour.  Captain Sanders has taken no steps to protect his invention, saying he would gladly see anything done to effect a saving in mining operations.  On going through the mine I was much impressed with a new and powerful crushing mill, which I am informed, puts through about 70 tons of stuff per day.  The ores from this are put through to the floors the same day, the waste going to the stamps and through the jigger as before mentioned, being thus made ready for the market; in fact the whole of the stuff raised in the mine during the day being treated, all the ore that it is possible to extract from it by mechanical means is taken out, and is ready for the market in the evening.
