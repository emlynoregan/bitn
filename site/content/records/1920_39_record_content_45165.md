Mongolata Goldfield

On Thursday 2 March the Premier Hon. R.S. Richards opened the Mongolata Battery.  Over 300 people attended.

About four years ago it is stated that an old prospector called Teddy Bywaters pegged out a claim and started prospecting.  He found gold, but apparently went no further and left the spot.  Harry Byles then took up the claim and after hard work found more gold and so began the enterprise that has grown to today’s field.  Many people were derisive as to the value of the field.  Many drawbacks were cited, especially the lack of water, but a diviner had found a supply and a bore put down and a catchment was recently made.  The lack of food was overcome by Mr W. Carpenter’s Eating House.

There are now numerous quaint little dugouts in the gully-sides along with many tents, shacks and huts.  Some men have wives and children with them.  Some buildings are quite comfortable, including Mr Carpenter’s and the residence of the manager of Byles’ Mongolata GM.  The feeling of the field is of a bright future.

The first crushing from Byles’ GM Co. was 52oz 19dwt 29gr from 50 tons.

The second crushing from Curlew claim some ¾ mile south of Byles’ returned 239oz 16dwt 6gr from 15 tons 15cwt.

[A list of some of those present is then printed.  Some were old Burraites.]

I.J. Warnes spoke first as Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC.  He welcomed the visitors.  He said he was one of the first members of the DC 35 years ago and Chairman for 30 years.  The first meeting had been near Mr Oates’ house.  There had been a strong disagreement in Council and one of the disputants was F.T. Jones who lived near where they stood.  As a result Mt Bryan was the only DC in SA with only one Councillor in each ward.  Mt Bryan was named for a pioneer named Bryan who had disappeared with his team in the early days and never returned.
