Burra Library held its AGM last week.  Mr J. Topsfield reported on a difficult year.  The year finished financially secure, but the committee was hampered by the Councilâ€™s failure to supply three committee members as required.  Membership was 53 full members and 7 juvenile.  This year it became possible for a person to borrow by paying a refundable deposit fee.  Thanks go to librarian Mrs Fennell and to the Secretary Mr Ben Kotz.  Elected: President, J. Topsfield; Vice-Presidents, Jean Kotz & W. Nankivell; Treasurer, E. Carpenter and Secretary, B. Kotz.
