Burra Burra DC ratepayers will vote on the basis of the assessments on Saturday 15 September.  The District Clerk T.G. Perry has set out the circumstances leading up to the proposal.

When the old District Councils were amalgamated in 1935 a new assessment of the district was made.  Every seven years since then it has been necessary to appoint a valuator and have a new assessment made.  Each time this seems to have been done by increasing assessed values by as little as could be arranged, which has resulted in the use of a high rate on the pound to generate sufficient income.  On effect of a low assessment and subsequently low income is to reduce the assistance from State and Federal Governments.  Last year it was found hat a new assessment would be needed and Councillors were divided, but finally decided to appoint a valuator to carry out the work under the annual values system, which is the one in operation at present.  When this assessment was not available for the July 1956 meeting, Councillors resolved to put the case to the ratepayers to ask approval for a change to the land values system of rating.  Under either system the income required will be about the same as in previous years.

If the ratepayers vote NO

The present annual value system will remain.

A new assessment will be necessary at a cost of about £800 for a valuer.

Assessments will be brought to a level of within 70% of present day values including all improvements.  It is believed values of assessments will be at least treble and the rate in the pound will be able to be dropped a corresponding amount.

Every seven years the assessment will need to be renewed.

If the ratepayers vote YES

The land values system will be adopted subject to a petition being presented to the Governor.

The assessment of the State Land Tax Department will be available for adoption at no cost and as this is reviewed every five years, it would always be up to date.

Land would be rated on unimproved value and ratepayers will not be forced to pay rates on improvements.  The figures for your property are available at the Council Office.

The standing of the Council would be improved because of its sound financial background.

The majority of Councillors approve the change.

Stray Stock are a problem at Hallett.

The Buffalo Review on Saturday night at the Town Hall drew a large crowd with door takings of £73.  The nett proceeds from this will aid the Town Hall Improvement Fund.

River Murray Flood Relief Appeal has reached £1,009-2-0.
