BCS.  Staff Profiles: Robyn Thomas

I have lived in the Burra District for a number of years, having been appointed Home Economics teacher at Burra in 1979.  I have now returned as a Part Time Permanent teacher after six years leave to teach Home Economics, Health and Personal Development with R-12 Students.  [Photo.]
