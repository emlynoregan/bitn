Mr Perth Collins passes on a little information compiled by the late Miss Alice Collins, concerning the late Henry Collins of ‘Lucerndale’ Mt Bryan.

Henry Collins came to SA with his parents in 1839 from Devonshire.  He was then aged 6.  His first job was to mind a mob of sheep.  When the family came to Burra they had to construct dug outs in the bank of the Burra Creek.  At an early age he went to work in the Burra Mine and when his father went to the Victorian gold rush he was the sole support of his mother.  Later they were able to buy a couple of bullock teams and began carting between Burra and Port Adelaide.  Henry was so small that he had to use a stool to enable him to place the yokes on the bullocks.
