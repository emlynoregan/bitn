J. Lawrie writes about the ‘Death Trap Road’ south of Burra.  He considered the road quite safe if driven with the necessary care.  The editor however, said he believed the road could hardly be safe when new, old and middle-aged cars have tipped over on it, when under the control of good and bad drivers.
