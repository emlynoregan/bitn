M & BHA will henceforth be known as the Child, Adolescent & Family Health Service (CAFHS) after the amalgamation of these various groups in November 1981.  Each branch is now responsible for maintaining its own clinic.  In Burra, while in excess of 50 mothers make use of the clinic, as few as six attend meetings, which are held bi-monthly.
