Another Bridge Accident

Last Wednesday morning another truck struck the old railway bridge at Burra North.  The bridge was moved several centimetres and a large block of concrete weighing well over a tonne fell to the roadway.  Council staff cleared away the debris and SES attended.  The bridge did not pose any danger to traffic and the road was re-opened.  The bridge is 20 cm higher than the maximum allowable height for loads on trucks and so should not prove an obstacle for traffic.  Despite this, it has been hit several times in the past couple of years.  [Photo]
