Mongolata Goldfield

(Reprint from the Economic Traders Gazette)

SA looks as if it will have a good goldfield.  The Mongolata Goldfield is 116 miles from Adelaide and 16 miles from Burra, though few people in Australia have heard of it.  It was discovered about four years ago and has been SA’s greatest producer for 1933-34 & 35.  It seems it will also be for 1936 too.  Much work has been done by Byles’ Mongolata GM Co.  Some said the Government Battery placed there 6 February 1933 would not work for two weeks, but it is still going strong.  Several of the mines are self-supporting: Baldina Mongolata, Curlew Mongolata, East View Mongolata and Takati Mongolata.  The field has produced some £60,000 worth of the best gold ever to go through the Australian Mint.  Yet Mongolata does not receive any encouragement.  In the press on 10 January the Department of Mines reported on the mines of SA, but there was not a mention of Mongolata, even though for December Mongolata produced more gold than all the other State batteries put together: 98 tons of ore for 258 oz of gold.  Yet these officers, paid by the taxpayers and miners, write columns of information every month and they never mention the best field in the state.  Some Mongolata returns:
