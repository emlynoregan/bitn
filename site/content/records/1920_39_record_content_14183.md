Cycling.  The Burra-Adelaide Road Race of 108 miles was run last Saturday.  It departed Market Square at 10 a.m. and was arranged by the SA League of Wheelman.  W. H. Figg was official starter and it offered £160 in prizes.  There were 60 competitors.  Winner was P. Osborne of Victoria, 2nd Johnson, and 3rd S. Grivell.  Among the competitors locally were H. Kuchenmeister & C. Garrard of Kooringa, and C. Forrest of Welland, late of Shafton.  Hubert Oppermann, the young Victorian Champion started from scratch.  His grandmother was born in the Burra Mine property 75 years ago and is still hale and hearty.  Her father was Carl Bock, the mine blacksmith, who went to live in Victoria during the gold rush.  Oppermann’s father served in the Great War.  20 minutes before the race Oppermann discovered a cut in his tyre which was hastily mended, but probably cost him the race as he had a series of punctures after Gawler.  Osborne did the trip in 5 hours 32 minutes and Oppermann in 5 hours 15.10 minutes.  He made himself known to his Burra relatives while here.
