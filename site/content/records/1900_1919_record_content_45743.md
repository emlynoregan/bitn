E.J. Davey writes in reply to Mr McLaren’s letter.  The meeting referred to was not a regularly called special meeting, but a hastily summoned one called together verbally to suit Mr Lewis, who was that day in town.  He [McLaren] says he has heard there were no minutes taken.  He was the Mayor, and should know.  He should have ensured minutes were taken and that they were correct.  The only reference in minutes is that an agreement was to be drawn up by Mr Lewis’s solicitor and submitted to Council.  This has now been done, but because one clause would practically give Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis a monopoly over the route, the present Council has objected to this clause.  The Council desires the route to be kept open for all travelling stock.
