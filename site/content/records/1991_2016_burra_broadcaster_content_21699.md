Wool Industry Development Board.  Two recent appointments to the Board have local connections.  Julia Clarke grew up on a merino stud near Burra and after gaining a degree in journalism worked on a variety of wool-growing properties.  She has also worked as a radio journalist and for a technology-based wool marketing company.  Chris Parker is a graduate in veterinary medicine and surgery and has worked as a private practitioner concentrating on sheep, cattle and herd management.  He is Vice-President of the SA Farmersâ€™ Federation Burra Branch and a member of SAFF Wool and Meat Executive and was a delegate to the Wool Council of Australia in 1997.
