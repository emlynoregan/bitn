Editorial on 1884.

There are signs of the depression easing.

Wheat and copper have been lower than ever.  Farmers must turn their attention to products other than wheat.

The winter here came late.  More than average sickness prevailed with smallpox in the eastern colonies.

France has been at war in Madagascar and China and there have been the complication for Britain of Egypt and Sudan.  Russian colonisation continues in Asia and Germany has expanded its control in Africa and the Pacific.

The English government has behaved capably at home and despicably abroad.

Australian politics have been more settled.  The eastern colonies have been stable and there was a general election in SA resulting in a somewhat improved Parliament with the passage of a Taxation Bill, an Agricultural Lands Bill and a Pastoral Lands Bill.

Locally the year was marked by several achievements:

£217-8-0 was expended on tree planting

The long considered Waterworks have been carried into effect and have proved more successful than anyone anticipated.  Under the present state of affairs ‘we enjoy perhaps a more liberal arrangement than any other place’

Cr Sampson initiated a fairer division of the Town into Wards

2nd Leader on Municipal Matters.

We are happy that the Aberdeen Reserve matter has been left as it is.  Cr Ridgway’s speech did not throw much light on the issue.  The Council has always proceeded on the assumption it was theirs until W.D. Scott, solicitor for YPMA formally protested.  To say it should have been gazetted along with the Redruth Reserves is absurd.  The Council didn’t do this: the government, who owned them, did so and that dedicated them to the town.

As to salaries the total now paid from all funds is £215 less than £100 of which comes from money which could be subdivided [sic] [Surely a misprint for subsidised.]
