Mt Bryan.  A public meeting is called for 16 February at 8 p.m. to consider forming a Community History Book Committee.  The high costs of publishing mean that the amount of money required could not be committed by the school and this meeting will gauge the public interest in continuing the project.

Ruth N. Stolte, Co-ordinator.
