The Great Flood at the Burra Burra

From a letter to Henry Ayers from the Mine, 9 June:

Yesterday we were again visited with lightning, hail and rain to a fearful extent.  Great efforts were needed to keep drains clear to prevent ore from being washed away and to stop the water from entering the mine.  In these efforts we were successful.  The weather broke at 6 p.m. and the surface of the mine was then flooded.  At about 9.30 p.m. people came from the creek and begged for horses and carts and I started with five or six carts to assist removing families and furniture etc.  Every place in a shed or other covering is filled with people.  One poor man by the name of Box, a lander at Paxton’s Shaft, was killed by the falling in of his hut.  He has left three children now motherless and fatherless.  The bridge going to the smelting house is washed away and at present there is no crossing the creek for either man or horse.

[Obituary: William Box died 9 June 1851 aged 40.  The rest of the family is not readily traced, but probably his wife Caroline died 11 July 1850 aged 30, soon after giving birth to Charles Henry on 14 March 1850.  This child seems to have survived and married in 1882, though his age then cited does not quite match.  The other two children are not easily traced.]

The Register correspondent also wrote on 9 June:

The flood has subsided and the havoc is revealed.  William Box was killed last evening by the falling in of his hut in the Burra Creek.  He was a widower and leaves three small children.  Fortunately no other lives have been lost, but the destruction of property has been great in the miserable holes in the creek.  Nearly all the huts in the creek bank have fallen in and will be uninhabitable, so there is little fear of another calamity under similar circumstances.  At about 11 p.m. last night the bridge leading to the smelting works of Messrs J. Schneider & Co. gave way and the immense volume of water dammed behind it suddenly rushed down the creek at a frightful rate, carrying all before it.  Men standing around it immediately raised the alarm, which spread with the rapidity of electricity.  Some families were in bed at the time and so rapid was the rise of water that they were compelled to turn out in their night clothes and make their way to the top of the bank through water that was in many places three or four feet deep.  The night was dark and dreary; the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed in rapid succession.  Rain fell in torrents and the cries of the distressed were heart-rending.  No assistance from the township could be afforded those on the opposite bank of the creek, which was quite impassable for man or horse.   Many were as a consequence forced to spend the night with no other covering than their night clothes.  Though only the one death is so far reported, more are expected from the effects of the piercing cold and pitiless rain, which prevailed throughout the night.  Many sums of money varying from £50 to £500, concealed in the creek huts, are said to have been lost.

Storekeepers in Kooringa had scarcely got their cellars in order after the last flood and happily for them they were not much exposed to the ravages of this flood, but they will be hard hit be the further reduction in trade this flood will cause in a town already suffering general depression of trade due to the last flood.  A large quantity of flour is said to have been destroyed in the creek and it is now selling for 58/- a bag at Kooringa, with but little of it on hand.

The smelting works is at a standstill for want of fuel and workmen’s wages are considerably reduced at the Mine.  Many of the bridges lately erected by the Smelting Company to facilitate the conveyance of wood from the Murray Scrub are washed away, together with some drays of wood encamped on the road.  It is to be hoped the provision of comfortable and suitable cottages for workmen by the two opulent companies at the Burra will see to it that there will be no repeat of this disaster in the future.
