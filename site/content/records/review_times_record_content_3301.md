Burra National Trust has doubts about the proposed ORRV reserve at Redbanks.  They would like to see the complete banning of bikes from the area to allow the regeneration of vegetation.  The report on the area says that 91% of the Hundred of Baldina is cleared.  Redbanks is probably the only uncleared area and this is rapidly becoming cleared due to the increase in ORRV use over the last few years.  The Trust thinks it would be easier to keep all vehicles out rather than trying to manage them in part of the area.  They fear the vehicles would not be contained.  The Trust feels that the ORRV users do not fit in with the image of the town they have been trying to promote to tourists.  Another concern is that the area designated for ORRV use is further in from the main road and would be difficult to reach, if not inaccessible for the ambulance to reach.  There are still two people unconscious in Adelaide hospitals from accidents at Redbanks Mrs Wright said.  She also said that the report made scant reference to common flors and fauna; commenting only on rare types.

‘"Redbanks was one of Burra’s favourite picnic spots once – now none of the locals go there," she said.

"It’s a bit like being tossed out of your own backyard."'
