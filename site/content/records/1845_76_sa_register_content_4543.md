The Burra Burra Mine

The following statistics show the past activity at the Mine from its inception on 29 September 1845.

The capital originally subscribed by shareholders was only £12,320.

The following dividends have been paid:

Grand Total Dividends in 4½ years 	£172,480

After allowing for all liabilities there remains on hand a clear balance of divisible profits in excess of £64,000, or between 500 & 600% on the capital.

[The article then compares the Burra Burra Mine with the best mines in Devon and Cornwall and concludes that:

‘The average success of the Burra Burra is nine to one in excess of the average of the great English Mines.’

The writer does, however, conclude that a comparison of share prices suggests that Burra Burra shares are greatly overpriced, or else the prices in England are greatly depressed.

He goes on to suggest some errors in the management of the Burra Burra.  The poor wages paid to Cornish miners in SA have resulted in many deciding to move to California, while others have taken employment in the agricultural and pastoral industries.  Employment might be found for many more miners at the Burra Burra if the Directors paid more liberal and enlightened wages.]

The engine at the Burra Burra Mine, of which so much has been made, is only of some 80 horse-power.  This will be quite insufficient as the mine goes deeper.  Many engines at abandoned mines in Cornwall are of 150-250 horse-power and could have been obtained for £500-£1,000 each.  For instance the engine at the Hallenbeagle had a 70 inch cylinder and 200 horse-power and was for sale in 1848 for £600.  It was in good condition and cost £2,200 when new.  ‘The local board seem bent upon pursuing a narrow-minded, grudging economy in the payment of their servants, and exhibit a determination to be regular grasp-alls of every mineral acre worth working…than to conduct a great public undertaking in a manner worthy of the age and the land we live in.’
