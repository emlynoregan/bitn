Burra Youth Club was successfully inaugurated by Mr Bednall and an average attendance of 45 young people enjoyed a varied program.  This year a student committee has been elected and the Apex Club has offered support.  The main need of the group is a place to call home.  The group has raised enough to buy a double kayak and has donated $100 to the Buy-a-Brick campaign for the hew Gymnasium [Hall].
