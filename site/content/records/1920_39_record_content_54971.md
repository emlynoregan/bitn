Mongolata

Rev. Donald Redding and party came out on Tuesday for a service and community singing.

On Thursday Brigadier Rust and Commandant Mead of the Salvation Army came out for a service.

The tank is running low.  Since last yearâ€™s cleaning the quality is good if a little on the dark side.

(Since this was written 50 points of rain eased the situation when it fell last Monday.)
