Depart Adelaide by the 3.45 train and depart Gawler the following morning at 6 a.m., arriving at Kooringa about 5 o’clock.

Any better plan would be welcome, but some change is needed, as at present four and sometimes five days must elapse before an answer can be received to a letter despatched from here.  Steps should be taken now, as the tenders for the conveyance of the mails will soon be out.
