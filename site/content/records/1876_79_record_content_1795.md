Accident/Obituary Garrett Smith, farmer, found lying dead near the railway turntable apparently having been struck by the cowcatcher of a locomotive while drunk. The accident was not detected when it happened. When the body was found there were eight £10 notes, seventeen £1 notes, 11/3 in silver and 6d in copper nearby on the ground and three £5 notes in his pocket. [£102 was a huge sum and must equate to over $25,000 in 2000 values and yet this draws no particular comment from the paper! A 'good man' is cited in the paper as earning perhaps £2/2/- a week.  Died 7 February 1877 Burra Railway Station aged 45.]
