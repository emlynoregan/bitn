The Local Board of Health has said it will close down the house portion of the Burra Hotel unless a new septic tank and drainage is installed.  An undertaking to do so has seen no action for a considerable period.  The present outflow enters the creek.  If the house portion of the hotel is closed, it is likely the Licensing Court will close the bar.
