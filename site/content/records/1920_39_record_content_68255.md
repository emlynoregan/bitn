Weather.  At the weekend there was driving rain and hail making it very bleak for all.  To the east the wind did great damage, as no rain extended there.

On Monday a cold south wind blew and snow fell with the rain. There was quite a heavy fall of snow at Abberton Park on the outskirts of Redruth before lunch, in the vicinity of Sugar Loaf Hill and thick falls were recorded at Mt Bryan, Mt Bryan East and in the Hallett Hills.

Rain this month has been 332 points and the only wetter years have produced 474 in 1908, 411 in 1932, 409 in 1910 and 400 in 1913.
