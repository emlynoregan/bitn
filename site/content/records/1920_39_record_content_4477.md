Burra Town Council

The Chief Secretary wrote that there was no vacancy on the State Children’s Council at present, but if one occurred the Council’s suggestion would be considered.

Cr Kellaway moved the minute charging the Football Assoc. one third of the gate takings after tax be rescinded.

Cr Radford opposed this strongly and Cr Treloar agreed with him.  The Mayor thought no reasonable person would object to a portion of the rates being spent on the Recreation Grounds.  Cr Bartholomaeus said he opposed the motion, as a great deal of money had been spent there this year and last.  Motion lost.

An inspection of flood damage and the creek in West Ward will be made.

The deputation from the Burra Ambulance Committee met the Council.  Mr Lane said that 12 months ago Dr Steele had suggested the necessity for a motor ambulance.  The idea was taken up and an ambulance was bought and a garage built for c. £360.  There was £10 in hand and a few bills outstanding. The deputation asked the Council to take over the ambulance.  Dr Steele thought that about half the annual cost would come from hire and the rest could be raised by an annual appeal.

The Mayor accepted it on behalf of the Council.

Cr Radford moved the acceptance and Cr Kellaway seconded.  Carried.

Cr Radford said the % of trees that survived was not very high.  More care of them was needed.  It was decided to order 300 pines, 100 red gums, 100 carobs and 50 willows.  A temporary crossing will be put over the creek near Bowens.

The Railway Commissioner’s attention will be drawn to the obstruction of water flow caused by the bridge carrying the railway line to the Ballast Quarry.
