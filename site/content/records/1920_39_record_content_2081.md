Burra Town Council, 20 September.

T.H. Woollacott writes expressing amazement at the attempt to hold him responsible for the trouble with the cemetery road bridge.  Council arranged all the specifications.  Foundations were by the Council and all was supervised by the overseer, Mr Rosewall.  All Mr Woollacott did was supply the men and plant.  The problem is most likely caused by providing foundations and walls too weak for the pressure of material behind them.  Mr Woollacott absolutely refused to take any of the responsibility and demanded the same publicity for his letter as the discussion in Council had obtained.

[The agreement with Mr Woollacott was then read and cited in the paper, but they do little to clarify the responsibility for a considerable mess.]

Ct Treloar moved that the owner of the old bridge be asked to lease it to Council as in the event that the new bridge couldn’t be used the road to the cemetery would be closed.

Cr Kellaway reported there were four big cracks in the main walls of the bridge.

Cr Radford called for an inspection and thought the lease unnecessary.  Cr Treloar said Mr Grow was dismantling the old bridge.  [Though it lacked any sides the arch of the old bridge was still there in 2006.]

The overseer is reported to believe the new bridge is quite sound and would last 100 years as far as the main walls are concerned.

Letter from George Hann, Hon. Sec. of the Bowling Club, asking if the Council would be prepared to allow the club to buy the present Council Depot next to the bowling green, as the club desired to enlarge the croquet green and put in a tennis court and club house.  C.B. Warnes was prepared to sell a portion of land next to the Kooringa Hotel for Council use, or to let it for £15 p.a.  The removal of the depot from Thames St would raise values and hence rates there.

Cr Radford favoured moving from Thames St, but felt the Council would need to own Mr Warnes’ block: neither a portion nor a lease would do.

Cr Kellaway thought another piece of land should be sought.

Council will consider their options – as long as it is not a cost to ratepayers.
