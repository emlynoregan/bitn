Kooringa News, 5 March

Last Friday evening the Rev. J. Standrin delivered a lecture entitled Today and Fifty Years Ago; or Now and Then.

A public meeting was to have been held at the Court House Hotel on Monday to discuss the Central Road Boardâ€™s proposals to change the route of the North Road, but so few people attended that the meeting was postponed to next Monday.  In the meantime a committee was appointed to examine the matter and Mr A. Motley, as secretary, was to write to the Board requesting tracings of the local surveys.
