E.W. Crewes writes to correct a mistake that appeared in the Advertiser 19 March in which he is reported as saying that Mueller stayed until his funds ran out and then borrowed Â£1 to clear out.  Actually he said that owing to scarcity of money and other causes Mr Mueller decided to leave.  On mentioning the matter to Mr West, the manager, that gentleman gave him a pound to pay for his fare.
