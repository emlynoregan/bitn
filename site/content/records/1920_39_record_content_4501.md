Dr Steele responded in a lengthy letter, essentially arguing that since economy was presumably the motive it would be just as effective to advise the local doctors to treat and isolate infectious cases at home whenever possible and to admit only those demanding expert nursing or where home isolation was not possible.  The absolute insistence on the Health Board decision could lead to dangerous delays in treatment â€“ Laryngeal Diphtheria cases are an example where even a brief delay could be fatal.  He developed his point quite cogently.  Consideration was deferred till the next meeting.

Burra Hospital Board

On 14 April 1921 the Board wrote to Dr Ashton asking what he wanted further than was stated in the joint letter with Dr Steele.

On 10 May 1921 Dr Ashton replied he wanted re-instatement to the post as well as the privileges he formerly held and of which he was deprived (despite the financial advantages the hospital was then gaining from private patients introduced by him).  He asks definitely the status of the hospital.  He says no fresh statute or proclamation has been made superseding the finding of the Board of Inquiry in 1917 that it was a proclaimed Government Hospital under the Hospital Acts and consequently a public charitable institution under the Public Charities Acts.

This finding, he says, should have precluded every doctor from attending his private patients in the hospital except in an honorary capacity.  He says this was enforced only against him.

If this is the status of the hospital the regulations should be enforced allowing the nursing and medical professions to establish private hospitals in Burra as needed (as is done elsewhere) to treat non-charitable cases.  If it is a subsidised hospital as Dr Ashton believed until the inquiry found otherwise, this status needs to be put on a legal footing.  Every doctor should share in attending indigent and needy cases gratuitously and he would be prepared to do so if all medical men were doing so.  But if one be paid it is only fair each should be and it cannot be expected that another be expected to give his services gratuitously.

On 14 May 1921 the Board replied that he had been appointed in accordance with the joint application of himself and Dr Steele and as he had now been informed of the conditions relating to the new appointment the Board desired to know if he was prepared to accept the appointment,

On 6 June 1921 Dr Ashton replied that the Board had not answered his queries in his letter of 10 May 1921 and he reiterated his question on the status of the hospital and went on to elaborate the difference the status made in the operations of the institution.  He also denied that the position granted was in accordance with the joint application made with Dr Steele.  It was, he said, quite a different position.

At the meeting of the Board on 9 June it was resolved that Dr Ashton be informed that the hospital was being conducted as a subsidised hospital and with this information they asked him to kindly give a reply to their letter of 14 April.
