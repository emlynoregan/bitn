[At least from the establishment of the playground there in 1923 this area was known as Lowe Park.  It was named after Mr Charles Lowe 1854-1925.  Until 1921 he lived at Redruth where he had a bakery near to the park.  He was also a member of the Town Council, representing North Ward from December 1907 to November 1913.]
