Burra Hospital.  The Chief Secretary said in his opening remarks that the Burra Hospital was obtained from SAMA, but Mr J.A. McBride said the hotel was bought by Mr White, a private schoolteacher, whose business collapsed when a public school was opened.  He bought it from Mr Paxton.  Knowing nothing of hotel keeping Mr White did not prosper and he asked Mr McBride’s advice.  Just at that time there was a move to establish a hospital and tenders had been erected for the erection of a building opposite the present mill.  Mr McBride suggested that the hotel would make a good hospital and the building committee bought it for £1,000 and even though they had to compensate the contractor a large sum was saved in building.

[This account is clarified by reference to the papers of 1877.

The original proposal was to use the old Mine Hospital known as Bleak House.

The contract for enlarging and converting this building went to G. & W. Sara for £1,791-14-0.  (See paper of 12 Jan. 1877)

Expenditure on the eventual hospital up to the time of opening was £1,893-0-11.  (See paper of 2 March 1877.)

The conveyance of the hospital from SAMA to the Council was signed later: see the paper of 18 May 1877.

SAMA asked the Council for £583-10-8 as purchase money for the hospital and interest, with the deed to be handed over on payment.  Payment was passed by Council: see the paper of 20 July 1877.

There is no mention of payments to White.  Presumably White had bought the business and a lease, since it is clear that SAMA held the freehold.]
