Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting.  Thirty attended.  The Mayor E.T. Baulderstone revealed a reduction in the Council’s overdraft from £1,200 to £300 in the last 12 months.  Record grant money had been received.  Owing to the large number of creeks in the town bridges were costly to maintain and through grant money it had been possible to reconstruct the Smelts Road Bridge and also that on the Eastern Road near Mr H. White’s.  The cemetery came in for much criticism, but care of graves was the responsibility of the people and for the paths, of the Council.

There were many parks in the town and a good beautification scheme could be submitted.  The Caravan Park is now obsolete as far as parks of today are concerned.  A plan for a new park has been adopted and it is hoped a pound for pound subsidy can be obtained for the coming year.  It had been hoped to open the mine area as a tourist spot in March or April this year, but this had not been possible.  A public meeting was called, but with only five or six people attending, it was not known whether people in the town were in favour.

Street lighting appears to be OK.  The War Memorial Committee continues to work at the oval and a new basketball court is being erected.  The Small Bore Club has improved the area on the south of the wall and thanks go to them for the effort.

The Mayor was proud of the financial care, which had reduced the overdraft from £1,200 to £300 this year.
