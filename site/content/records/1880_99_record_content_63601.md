Martindale Jockey Club meeting at Manoora on Wednesday was very successful.  Previous meetings had been on the Martindale Course, but a decision of Parliament forced the change to entitle the club to the totalizator: clubs have to be twenty miles apart.  The Carlsruhe Brass Band was in attendance and locals turned out en masse as well as visitors.  [The whole meeting is reported in detail in 1½ columns.]
