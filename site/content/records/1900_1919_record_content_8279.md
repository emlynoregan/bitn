M-C Aiston, now stationed in Kooringa, was a member of the 1st Contingent from SA for the Boer War.  On Friday he received a silver clasp of five bars bearing the names of Belfast, Diamond Hill, Johannesburg, Orange Free State and Cape Colony, to go on his Service Medal awarded when the Duke of York was in Adelaide in June 1902.  Having served its time the 1st Contingent was disbanded on 29 November 1900 and M-C Aiston joined the Permanent Artillery.
