Cr Sampson thought this meeting was a special call.

Cr Coglin 2nd the move to dismiss all currently employed.  [To enable a change to 5/6 per day.]

Cr Ridgway said with about 5 days to work, men shouldn’t be treated like this.

Cr Tiver moved an amendment the men be retained on 6/6 per day.

The motion was carried.

Cr Sampson then moved the Overseer of Works be allowed to employ 10 men per ward in the next fortnight at 5/6 per day.  He contended that though 5/6 was not enough to keep a family it would be better than going away to work for £1 a week and tucker.  5/6 was equal to 6/- from the Council’s point of view, as they would have to pay interest on the sum expended.

Cr Sampson moved that the daymen this year be paid 7/- a day. (Not 7/6 as in the past.)

Carried.

Cr Coglin moved the wages be 7/6 a day as at present

Cr Symons moved an amendment that tenders be called.

Carried on the Mayor’s casting vote.

Cr Coglin moved the scavenger get 10/- per day.  Carried.

Cr Sampson moved applications be invited for Town Clerk, Secretary to the Board of Health, Secretary to the Waterworks etc. at £50 p.a. and Inspector of Nuisances, Weights & Measures, Overseer of Works, Inspector of the Board of Health and Surveyor at £110 p.a.  The officer to give all his time to the Council.

The Mayor thought they would be better to pay one man to do all the inside work and one all the outside and to pay each £100 to get competent men.

Cr Ridgway said Cr Sampson’s move was impractical and moved it be left to the Finance Committee.

Cr Sampson’s motion was carried.

Rates declared at: General, 1/- in the £; Health, 2d in the £; Parklands 2d in the £.

Town Clerk was told he would be paid for work done after 31 December 1855.

He said he did not intend to apply for the position in 1886.
