Burra Town Hall

‘Burra is holding its celebration of 150 years of the site of the Town Hall this Saturday evening from 8 p.m. until 11.30 p.m.’  Sister Jean Johnson, conductor, is bringing the Peterborough Choir, a branch of Sing Australia, to Burra for the occasion.

[Further details about the choir are included and a photo of Sister Jean Johnson.

The 150 years of the site is a somewhat obscure way of saying what was being remembered.  In 1857 the original Burra Burra Miners’ & Mechanics’ Institute was built on the site.  This was greatly enlarged in 1874 to create the general appearance of the building that is now the Burra Town Hall.  As far as can be determined, it would seem that the original building survives in at least part of the walls of the present foyer.]
