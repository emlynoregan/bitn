Obituary & Inquest.  James Herbert Humphries died on Sunday after an accident the previous night.

On the Aberdeen Road, not far from the railway station at about 9.45 p.m. on Saturday a car driven by Mr James Herbert Humphries collided with a spring dray driven by Mr H. Parks.  The car was going towards the station and the dray coming from it.  Parks was well on his side of the road, but the car was not.  In the collision the offside shaft of the dray penetrated the glass windscreen and struck the deceased on the chest.  R. Hunt, A. Isaac and H. Parks were in the dray and were thrown heavily to the ground, but were little hurt.  T.W. Wilkinson acted as coroner the next day after Humphries had died at about 1 o’clock in the Burra Hospital.  Dr Steele gave evidence of the severe chest injuries sustained.  Evidence indicates the deceased had been drinking, but his state of intoxication was not clearly established, though there was clearly an attempt to suggest he was less than completely sober.  With the deceased in the car were James Gallagher, T. Gregg, H. Austin & W. Rule Senior.

The three on the dray all gave evidence.  James Henry Gallagher’s evidence revealed they had been to the Exchange Hotel, Burra Hotel, Commercial Hotel, Kooringa Hotel and then the Bon Accord over a number of hours, including dinner [i.e. lunch] at the Bon Accord and then a drive and then tea and then to the Commercial Hotel and Court House Hotel and then the Bon Accord Hotel, Kooringa Hotel, Burra Hotel and were then going towards the Bon Accord.  He said they did not go to Opie’s Hotel before noon.  The accident occurred a little after Fuss’s shop.  The occupants of the car all gave similar evidence to each other.

The jury said death was due to injuries resulting from the collision with the dray and attached no blame to the driver of the dray and they thought the car was travelling at moderate speed and the deceased had been confused by the approaching lights.

[Identification not certain, perhaps the Herbert James Humphries born 28 June 1876 in District of Grey, but this does not quite agree with an age of death of 34 as registered.  Died 15 December 1912 at Kooringa, residence Adelaide.]
