Booborowie Experimental Farm visiting day ‘was held on Tuesday November 28th’.  [Which, given the date of the paper must be incorrect.]  About 100 farmers attended.  First plantations of wattle and gums were visited and then the dairying section.  After lunch they inspected cement posts, the wheat plots and rotation crops before afternoon tea.
