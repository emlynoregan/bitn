Burra’s Jubilee Copper Festival

Plans are on track according to committee secretary, Ellie Nicholls.  The festival will begin on the Sunday of the long weekend with a procession of bands, vintage and veteran cars and local people in costume.  The Yacht Club will hold its annual Regatta on the Burra Creek.  On Monday Mr Kym Bonython will start the re-enactment of the historic journey of the bullock dray, which once carried the copper ore mined at Burra.
