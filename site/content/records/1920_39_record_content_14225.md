Burra Town Council, 6 October

Rubble is to be spread on the road from the White Hart Ford to the Showground.

The 1923-24 assessment with necessary alterations has been adopted for 1924-25.

Notice of retiring Council members on the first Saturday in December:

Mayor	[Maurice Collins]

North Ward	Cr [Alfred B.] Riggs

East Ward	Cr [Francis] Harris

West Ward	Cr [William J.C.] Ewins

A move was made to give notice in the Record that the road between James’ and Morton’s was closed, because it was actually not a road, but private property.

The Town Clerk said it had been open as a road for 40 years and was a public thoroughfare after 20 years.

The advice of the Municipal Association is to be sought.

The new tennis courts were going to become part of a beauty spot and it was decided to ask the Tennis and Bowling Clubs to meet with the Council to discuss the beautification of the area.
