Redruth Court, 9 February

Malcolm John Marchant v. Clement Humphrys, both farmers of Hanson.

Marchant claimed £15 damages for trespass of 300 of the defendant’s sheep into the plaintiff’s wheat crop on 2 December 1925.  The counter-claim by Humphrys was for £10 damages for trespass of the plaintiff’s turkeys into the defendant’s barley crop on numerous occasions over the last three seasons.  The evidence runs for over 2½ columns and ends with a finding for Marchant upon both claim and counterclaim.
