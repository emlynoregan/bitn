Accident.  A car driven by Mr Herbert Ross Johnson, of Pannawilla Station via Wilcannia, failed to negotiate the bend on the Bon Accord Bridge when travelling south on Wednesday morning last.  The car crashed through the railing and dropped ten feet to land on its hood, flattening the hood to dashboard level.  There were three passengers: George Henry Watts, station manager of Wilcannia; Albert George Woof, fitter of Albert Park and Raymond Keith Maddison, painter of North Adelaide.  With the exception of Mr Watts they crawled from the wreck.  Mr Watts’ arm was pinned under the steering wheel and the car had to be lifted to free him.  None were seriously hurt and after treatment were not detained at the hospital.  In the crash one of the iron pipe railings penetrated the radiator and knocked off the distributor and other engine parts, stopping at the dashboard.  Had it gone further very serious results could have followed.  Damage to the car is put at £800 to £1,000.  The bridge had only had the posts repaired on Tuesday afternoon.
