Council Amalgamations

Eudunda Council District Clerk writes to dispute the assertion that most of its ratepayers would prefer an amalgamation with Morgan.  Since a circular to ratepayers after the May meeting the Council received very little negative comment of the potential to amalgamate with Burra Burra, Hallett and Robertstown, which was the Councilâ€™s preferred option.
