Hardy v. Davey.  Further reporting of this ‘Very Amusing Case’

‘Plaintiff in the Box for Four Hours.’

The report this issue deals with a good deal of Hardy’s own writing in letters to Davey and those published in the Jamestown paper and elsewhere.  Much of his writing is quite vitriolic and insulting.  In between these passages the roasting of Hardy continued.

Mr Symon asked Hardy whether he had got Cr Linkson to move in Council for the reduction in charges for advertising in the Record.

Hardy, ‘I don’t know whether I did or not; I don’t think so.’

But he would not swear that he did not.

The Council voted for a reduction in charges for advertising, but Symon said that Hardy had gone further when calling on the defendant, and had tried to get jobbing charges reduced also.

Once again Hardy was unable to swear that it didn’t happen.

Hardy admitted writing two further letters to W.J. Davey.

[The first accused the paper of misreporting remarks by T.T. Shortridge to the effect that things done ‘behind the curtains’ had resulted in the defeat of Cr Sampson.]

The second letter was written in red and black ink and repeated the assertion that T.T. Shortridge had denied making the statement attributed to him:

‘Which proves the ‘Record’ reporter!! Is on fire with

Animus, Spite and HATERED ____ ’

‘I HAVE MORE faith in T.T.S. and I would

make you suffer if I were him. ____ Yours &

Truth’

Mr Symon then read the relevant report from the Record and asked Mr Hardy to account for the letter in the Record of 9 March 1892, from Thomas Thorman Shortridge, denying emphatically that he had ever apologised verbally or in writing to Hardy and never intended to do so.

‘If the remarks published in the Burra Record have caused him personal uneasiness then let him wear the cap if it fits him.’

Symon then produced a paragraph from the Jamestown Review of 16 March 1892 which was written by Hardy, but in the third person as if by another hand.

‘Hardy advertises that “he believes his veracity will hold its own with that of Shortridge” ____ I think so too.’

Mr Symon said such a comment from the person interested was ludicrous.

The other passage from the Jamestown Review of 20 April 1892 was Hardy’s response to the Record’s report of the Stacey Co.’s  production of Hans the Boatman and Mr Stacey’s speech in the interval which in turn was a reaction to the scathing report on the show by Hardy.  Hardy challenges the Record or Stacey to prove the truth of ‘the most inconsistent false and brainless stuff imaginable’ besides accusing Davey of publishing ‘a garbled statement made by Stacey on stage.’

Hardy also wrote a letter on this matter to the Record accusing Stacey of making statements that were false and unworthy.  Hardy admitted calling the performance ‘a Vulgar Leg Show’.  He accused Stacey of lying when the latter said Mr Lake had kept Hardy’s remarks out of the Review out of respect to me etc.

Another letter produced from Hardy to the paper accused the paper of false and slanderous statements in a garbled attack.

Hardy said the Record had claimed that ‘The Burra Scribe to the Catholic Paper sarcastically remarks that Mr Holder is the Leader Writer to this Journal’

‘I say this is a wilful lie.’

A further letter on 20 April complained that his previous one had not been published.

He had objected to a paragraph which said a lady had threatened to horse whip him.

Hardy: ‘Yes, he made a mistake when he said it was a “lady”.’

Hardy did admit that the lady had come to his office and gave him a bit of her mind.

Symon then turned to the incident of the burning of Hardy’s effigy.

Hardy said he was present for part of the time.

He admitted hearing part of the Captain’s speech on the occasion and admitted he had published in the Register a letter denouncing the Broken Hill strike.

Symon then produced the Register of 9 July 1892 with the article:
