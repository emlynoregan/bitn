Miss G.M. Jordan, whose brother is renowned for climbing the Smeltsâ€™ Chimney, visited Burra this week from Broken Hill after an absence of 67 years.  She went to Broken Hill in 1898, having attended Burra School.  She later became a teacher and at her retirement was a headmistress.  Mr Jordan, now 92, is presently in the Hutchinson Hospital, Gawler.  Miss Jordan resides in Sydney and is staying in Gawler for the time being.

[Gertrude Mary Jordan 1882-1973.  Her brother, Arthur Dawson Jordan died 28 October 1965.]
