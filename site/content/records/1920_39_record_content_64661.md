Obituary.  William Francis Brown died at Burra Hospital on 8 November.  He was the eldest son of Mrs & the late Mr G. Brown of Burra.  He was born 11 February 1888 at Leasingham and the family later came to live at Redruth.  When the Great War broke out he enlisted on 30 September 1915 for active service and was attached to the 13th Field Battery until his discharge in 1919.  He was one of five brothers who all saw active service.  For many years he suffered severely from war disabilities, but we regret to report that like many others he received no recognition of his war service and although his health suffered on account of the war, he was unable to obtain a war pension, although totally unable to work.  On 31 October he was admitted to Burra Hospital suffering from pleurisy and pneumonia and died on 8 November.  In 1922 he married Miss Vera Dunning of Jamestown who is left with six young children.  He was buried at Kooringa 10 November when the coffin was covered with the Union Jack and the bearers were RSL members D. Keynes, K.M. Drew, T.J. Canny, A.L. Bence, M.T. Fuller and F. Spencer.  Mrs W.F. Brown emphatically denies rumours that she is leaving the town to reside in Jamestown.  She has no intention of leaving Burra.
