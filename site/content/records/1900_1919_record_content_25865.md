H.C. Farley writes saying the mine pool is the only place our boys can learn to swim, but at present it is dangerous.  He wonders whether the Mayor can get permission for it to be equipped with ropes and other aids to make it a safe place to learn.

The editor comments that the Mayor agrees with this and will look into the best way of going about it.
