Burra National Trust thanks seven young Trust volunteers who came last week to assist in the restoration of the two remaining miners’ dugouts.  Between 1845 and 1851 the dugouts stretched over 5 km along the Burra Creek and accommodated up to 1,800.  The visitors stayed in Paxton Square cottages.  They worked on Saturday digging out soil build-up on the floors and replastering eroded walls.  On Sunday they took advantage of the Burra passport to explore the town’s heritage sites.

Radio 5UV will soon launch a four part series ‘Ear to the Ground’ featuring Burra and the Flinders Ranges.  The Burra programs will feature local residents Ivan and Irene Hirschausen, Gilda Anderson and Chris Reed and historians Ian Auhl and Rob Linn.  Maureen Wright was instrumental in the recording process.

The 15 June program is on ‘Burra, the Monster Mine’.

The 22 June program covers Cornish miners, Chilean muleteers, pigeons in the mine shafts, shearers, drovers, heritage battles and the transition from Company Town to Wool Town to Heritage Town.
