Years 9 & 10 have been working on their own vegetable plots.  Year 8 students have been tending an area of mixed vegetables and a laying hen project.  Year 10 students have been taking weather readings.  Two paddocks have been seeded for pasture and at a later stage sheep and calves will be introduced to them.
