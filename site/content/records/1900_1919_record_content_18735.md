Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Men are clearing up for the holidays and preparing for the handover to the new company.  It is believed this will occur at the start of January 1907.  The tributers expect to send away the ore they have on hand and so draw down the curtain on one of the most curious attempts in the world to work and develop a mine.
