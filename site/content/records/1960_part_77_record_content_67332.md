Samin Ltd is presently making copper oxide.  With the commissioning of the Stage II plant at the Mine in the near future this will become the basic ingredient in the making of a premium grade copper sulphate.  This venture links Samin Ltdâ€™s mining resources with the manufacturing and marketing techniques of Adelaide Wallaroo Fertilisers Ltd.  The output, it is understood, will satisfy Australian demand as well as provide a product for overseas. Copper has reached a five-year peak in price, rising from $1,240 per tonne at the start of July to $1,400 10 or 12 days ago.  At the end of 1972 it was $904 per tonne.
