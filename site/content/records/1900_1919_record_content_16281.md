Council Vacancy.  At 11 a.m. on Friday, not much more than an hour after Cr Launder’s death a candidate for his position came forward and started a vigorous canvas with the assurance he was first in the field and therefore entitled to the confidence and support of East Ward.

‘He was assured that there was not another individual in the town who would venture such a speculation until, at least, a few days had elapsed out of sympathy for the bereaved.’

[Though this person is never identified further, the tone of the writer and the nature of the action both suggest that it was most likely to have been W.H. Hardy.]
