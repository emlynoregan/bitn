Burra Institute AGM was held on 25 January.  A.B. Riggs as President took the chair.  Messrs R.T. Bowles, F.L. Worth, H.J.B. Jennison & W.R. Lee were called up during the year and H.K. Bartlett & L.P. Davis filled the first two committee places with the other two to be filled at this meeting.  On 31 December 1942 the library held 5,536 books.  Currently there are 204 members.  Financially the Institute has difficulties.  Revenue from the pictures is 20% of the takings, but attendances are down.  Most activities in the hall are patriotic events 33⅓% is allowed, which keeps income down.  A donation of £50 from the Burra Burra DC greatly aided the payment of interest due to the State Bank last April.  Attempts to get the two Councils to take over the Institute have so far failed.  The Corporation now has sole use of the Council Chamber for £65 p.a.  The Institute cottage has been renovated for £18-4-6 and windows and doors at the front of the Institute and on the northwest side have been painted for £11.  The Institute cottage has now been sub-let.
