Football.  The Military Band greeted the Hothams at the railway station: the train was half an hour late.  11.30 lunch was provided at the Burra Hotel by John Pearce.  The teams were then photographed in costume by W. Bentley.  Details of the game follow.  Hothams 6.7 defeated Burras 2.3.  There was a crowd of c. 250 of which ‘not a few’ were ladies.
