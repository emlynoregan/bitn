Recruiting Meeting at the Institute last Thursday.

Attendance was not large.  Mr Crewes thought that the district had contributed 606 volunteers, but there were still some eligibles.  Capt. Bowers spoke of the need for reinforcements.

Thomas Brady, who had enlisted from Todmorden Station in the far north, has been invalided home shell-shocked.
