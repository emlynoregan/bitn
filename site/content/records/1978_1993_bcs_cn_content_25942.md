The Burra Show drew a good crowd despite the cold day.  President Andrew McInnes is to be congratulated on introducing a number of new events that proved to be popular.

The Yard Dog and Dog Jumping Competitions drew good audiences, as did the Wood Chopping, Roustabout, Sheep Counting and Three Way Drafting Competitions.  Other new attractions included Santa Gertrudis cattle, alpacas, a working blacksmith, blade shearing and a display of native animals.  There were a number of sections designed to appeal to the children and many were enthralled by the puppet theatre or attracted to face painting.  Miss Show Girl proved a crowd pleaser:

Miss Senior Show Girl	Mandy Drew

Miss Junior Show Girl	Jessica Schell

Miss Sub-Junior Show Girl	Jane Lehmann

Miss Mini Show Girl	Kylie O’Connor
