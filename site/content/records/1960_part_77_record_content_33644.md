Bill Wasley has been fruit picking at Cadell and has managed a hundred buckets of grapes a day.

‘Not bad when you’re 88.’  [Bill died 27 June 1970 aged 92.]

Mr Harold Shakeshaft, the Burra Postmaster, has been notified of a transfer to Peterborough in a few weeks, after a relatively short stay here.  [He took up duties in Burra 3 June 1965.]
