Burra Rural Youth has had a busy week, centred upon the Australian Stud Merino Tour, which was an outstanding success.  The tour gave 33 boys and 3 girls an opportunity to compare and inspect the local stud sheep breeding industry.  Most of the visitors were from the eastern states.  There was a social on Monday night in the Show Hall.  The event continued through Tuesday with farewells on Wednesday morning.
