Ah Lung sued Joe Ford for £21-1-5 for wages, having been paid little for his 40 weeks work which was supposed to be at £1-5-0 per week.  Luke Day translated.  Ah Chin corroborated.  The verdict was for Ah Lung for the full amount.  A counter claim for £70 from Ford as Ah Lung was an unsatisfactory worker was dismissed and he was reprimanded for keeping Ah Lung on if he couldn’t do the work.
