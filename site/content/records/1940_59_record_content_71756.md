Mr & Mrs Frank Sumner of Hallett had a tame kangaroo around their house.  It came up to be fed and they even presented him with a red bow tie.  On 22 July 1955 it disappeared to their disappointment.  Mr Sumner was therefore much surprised when the kangaroo reappeared on 13 February 1956 and resumed its old habits.  It was still wearing its bow tie, even if it was a little crumpled.
