Thomas Rosewall has been around town for 48 years.  He worked in the Burra Mines at one time and visited the Victorian gold diggings for three or four years.  The only public house he remembers was the one now occupied by Mr Tom Vivian, but he is under the impression that the old Burra Hotel (now the Hospital) was in course of erection.  He is 73.
