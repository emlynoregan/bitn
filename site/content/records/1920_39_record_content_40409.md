Federal Elections last Saturday.  District of Wakefield for House of Representatives:

M. Collins	Ind. Country Party	11,132

C.A.S. Hawker	Emergency Committee	20,714

Absent, postal and declaration votes yet to be counted cannot affect the outcome.

Mr R.A. McBride has won in Grey for the Emergency Committee with 12,492 to Lacey ALP 10,547.

There are 12 boxes and absentee etc. votes yet to be counted, but McBride is assured of a comfortable win over Lacey who was the sitting member.

The Scullin-Theodore Government suffered a humiliating defeat.
