Burra Mine

The Minister’s reply to a question in Parliament.

Drilling operations by the Department of Mines and the ‘present company’ have not been encouraging.  Drilling has proved difficult because the porous nature of the ground has made it hard to keep water on the drill.  Both the company and the Mines Department drillers have found this a difficulty, which has threatened the diamond drills when they run hot.  At present only one drill is operating to test deeper possibilities.  Results so far have not been encouraging.  Several million tons of low grade copper have been indicated in the oxidised ‘leavings’ and a feasibility study into the commercial possibilities of treating this is expected to be completed soon.
