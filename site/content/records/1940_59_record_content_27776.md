Messrs Freer & Scott’s passenger bus was being driven along Queen Street on Monday morning when the driver, Mr Lehmann, saw flames burst out from under the bonnet.  The two passengers alighted and the fire brigade attended, but a good deal of damage was done to the engine before the fire could be extinguished.  The bus will be out of service for some time.

Freer & Scott’s buses have become popular with young people to get to dances and they have nicknamed them after well-known race horses.

The big one with a square body and verandah-like effect at the back is ‘King Jolly’.
