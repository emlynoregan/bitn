Leighton Hall AGM on Saturday 2 June.

Elected: President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-President, J.Q. Hogan; Treasurer, A.D. McDonald; Secretary, E. Cock.

12 Boys were farewelled to the front this year.  As well as collecting hundreds of pounds for patriotic funds we have collected over £50 for the Hall and £35 for a Roll of Honour to be placed in the Hall.  Repairs worth £31-16-0 have been carried out.  Debt has not been reduced due to free use of the Hall for patriotic purposes.  We have joined the Institutes Association.
