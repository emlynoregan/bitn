Burra Show.   Most people are of the opinion that the show should be held at the racecourse.  This seems impossible without a great deal of co-operation and financial help.  The alternative is to make the best of the present grounds.  A suggestion is to remove the wood and iron fence on the southern boundary and replace it with a cyclone or substantial wire fence.   A skeleton-roofed sheep shed should be built over the new yards and the sideshow area needs to be levelled.  A portion of the parking hill ought to be removed and slightly terraced.  The ring needs to be extended and altered in shape to eliminate the need for riders to turn so sharply.  Levelling off the ring and grassing it has also been suggested.
