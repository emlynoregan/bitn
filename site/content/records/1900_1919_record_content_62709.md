Mayor’s Report 1919.

The year thankfully saw the signing of the Peace on 19 July, which was duly celebrated in Burra and District.

Agriculture this year is looking quite good with a reasonable yield and good prices.  Pastoralists continue to do well.

The seaside trip was abandoned at the last minute on account of the influenza outbreak.

Anzac day was commemorated on 25 April.

The League of Loyal Women closed their tea rooms in February, having realised over £100 for Trench Comforts.  The League continues other activities.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band has been active at all patriotic efforts and greeted hundreds of soldiers as they returned home.

Violet Day on 4 July was held in excellent weather to honour the fallen with a service at 3 p.m.

About £300 was raised.

Burra Red Cross Soc. from June 1915 to June 1919 has raised £2,043-5-4 and still meets to give aid to various hospitals.

Red Triangle Day in May raised c. £56 for the YMCA.
