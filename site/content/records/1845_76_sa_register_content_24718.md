Burra Mine.  Today the SA Mining Association pays its dividend of 50%, being £2-10-0 per share.  As in accordance with advertisement proprietors will be able to exchange each share for five new shares, which will make the stock much more convenient as an investment.  Directors Samuel Tomkinson, Henry Rymill and John Beck with Secretary the Hon. Henry Ayers left town Friday morning to visit the mine.  Operations there are being pushed on with vigour.  The 25 h.p. engine recently purchased is in course of erection and when this is operational it will greatly increase the hauling of both orey stuff and addle.  A whim has been put up at Peacock’s Shaft and good ore already obtained.  Hancock’s dressing machine should be ready for trial shortly.  If successful it will have a fine field of activity in the creek alone where there is estimated to be from 50,000 to 55,000 tons of orey sand averaging 3-4% copper.
