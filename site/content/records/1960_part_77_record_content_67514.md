Burra Burra DC

The general rate has risen to 1.6 cents in the dollar to bring in $11,720 more.  Rising wages will add $8,000 a year in costs.  New plant is also needed – approval from the Minister will be sought to purchase a new D6 Dozer, 212 Power Grader and Low Loader.  (Hiring out of these will offset the costs and negotiations have already begun for hire of the ‘Dozer’ for work at the Mine.)

With a further $6,400 Rural Relief Scheme grant to be spent on uncompleted projects, work at the Town Hall is proceeding.  The roof is on the toilets and ceiling and wiring is installed.  Floors and plastering is to be done this week.
