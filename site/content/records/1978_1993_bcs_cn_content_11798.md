Teams will assemble in Broken Hill 21 January

Drawing for post positions will be held at Broken Hill Legion Club at 5.30 p.m.

So far twelve teams have nominated.   The only Burra team nominated so far is the Burra Barrow Birds, but it is expected that by the closing of nominations on 2 December Burra Breathers and Super Mac from Burra  along with Rat Racers from Booborowie and Clare Crushers.

A team from Kerrville in Texas is a possibility.

3rd	$500

There will be four $1,000 prizes for each of the following teams: 1st aged over 40, 1st aged under 17, 1st all female and 1st Service Team.

The Prime Minister the Hon. R. Hawke has been asked to present the prizes at the end and if he is able to accept he would be the first Prime Minister to visit Burra since Billy Hughes in 1924.*

[*This claim is incorrect.  W. Hughes visited twice as PM, on 28 August 1920 and 29 March 1922.  After that there was a visit by S.M. Bruce in March 1925 when he was PM and from J.B. Chifley when he was PM in 1946.]
