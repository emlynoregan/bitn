Obituary.  Mary Thomas relict of the late William Thomas of Ironmine died at her residence in Cooper St Aberdeen 2 May aged 89.  She was born in Tasmania 5 December 1842, the third daughter of Mr & Mrs William Nickles.  Her father was killed when she was a child and her mother remarried and the family left Tasmania at the time of the Victorian gold rushes.  While in Victoria her mother died and she came to live with her grandparents at Kapunda.  She began working quite young and at Kapunda married W.J. Thomas and they went to Mintaro before taking land at Ironmine where they farmed successfully.  She was very hospitable and a great worker for the Ironmine Primitive Methodist and Redruth Methodist Church after Methodist Union.  She came to live in Aberdeen about 22 years ago.  Until very recently she was active and alert.  Three of five children survive: Edith Mrs Alex Finley [Finlay], Charles Thomas (WA) & Maud Mrs J.S. Williams (Broken Hill).  The late Mrs Herbert Morgan of Mongolata and the late Mrs J. Austin of WA were also daughters.  There are several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  [Her husband is everywhere named simply as William the reference above to W.J. is probably a mistake for William Jones Thomas who had died 23 April 1932.]
