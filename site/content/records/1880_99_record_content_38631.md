Municipal Elections.  Candidates announced so far:

Mayor:	W.T. Rabbich

East Ward	W.H. Hardy

North Ward	W.H. Linkson

Progressive Land Tax is again being discussed in Parliament.

Redruth Primitive Methodist Church held its half-yearly special effort on Sunday and Monday last and it was well attended.  Proceeds were satisfactory.

Burra Town Council.

The Conservator of Water has visited and a diver will be sent to take up the Waterworks pumps and refix them.

Arrangements for retimbering the well will now be made.

The service to the school will be done and charged to the capital account.

There was a question over hawkers’ licences.  The Wertheim Agent said he did not need one and challenged a summons.  The Singer Co. is also active.  It was resolved that if the solicitor’s opinion is favourable action will be taken.

Sport.  Out-of-town reports cover the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival and the Australian cricketers in the UK.

‘Ajax’ writes a critique of the term of Mayor T.W. Wilkinson in the form of an open letter to him.  It is highly critical and in places particularly personal with references to his physical appearance.  At best it condemns with faint praise and in places is insulting.

‘Of course, your natural irritable disposition would largely account for this.’

‘As a chairman, you are prone to be much too one-sided, with a wish to jump at conclusions before those over whom you preside are ready for the end.’

You cannot be accused of running the whole show, but at times ‘you gobbled holus-bolus unknown to your Council’.

‘Society can scarcely be displeased with your decisions as Chief Magistrate during the year, because you have generally taken good care to abstain from that position.  I can quite understand this, from the fact that banquets and liquor-ups in general are not in your line.’

‘Ajax’ thinks he did too much of the tree planting and at a cost in excess of what could be comfortably borne.

[Taken overall it is an article with an uneasy tone which at times seems to be trying for humour, but is too personal and unpleasant for this to survive.]

Piltimitiappa.  Mr Louis Dare reports that a fire broke out the day before yesterday within six yards of the stable.  Miles of good grass and bush were destroyed.  We cannot account for it but by someone throwing down a lucifer.  Mr Dare, who has not walked 100 yards for nine months, walked about and gave directions after the severe shock of it.

[Note: This year there was no mention in the paper of any celebration of Guy Fawkes’ Night.]
