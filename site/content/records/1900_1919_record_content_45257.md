The Police Ambulance left the barracks at 7.10 p.m. and returned at 10 p.m.  The train arrived at 7.22 p.m. and at 7.45 p.m. the Central Board of Health was asked by the Adelaide Stationmaster to make arrangements.  At 8 p.m. Nurse Wylie of the Central Board left home and arrived at the station at 9 or 9.05 p.m. and the patients were transferred to hospital.  The Local Board had to make all arrangements as the Central Board had no power to act.  The Mayor had understood this matter with respect to responsibilities, but had relied upon an understanding by the Superintendent of the Adelaide Hospital to organise the transfer from the station.  The central Board also advised that the Burra Hospital could not recover costs of infectious disease cases sent there by the Local Board of health unless some agreement had been reached.
