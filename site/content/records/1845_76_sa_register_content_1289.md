Latest from England

The emigrant ship David Malcolm arrived from London and Plymouth (30 October).

Emigrants:	43 married couples	86

Single men	39

Single women	22

Children 1-14	43

Infants	7

3 aged 1-2 died en route and 6 were born on the voyage.

The men were mostly miners: 28 married and 14 single.

10 married and 13 single men were agricultural labourers.

The shipment advice from SA had created considerable interest in the UK – [i.e. of copper ores.]

350 tons on the Malcolm to Swansea

220 tons per Regia

210 tons per Cleveland

Mary White with 400 tons or 500 tons of Kapunda ore and the Phoebe with 600 tons of Burra Burra ore were also noted.

By the David Malcolm came news of the sale of copper ore at Swansea:

2 September	5 tons Kapunda ore £21-10-0 per ton of 21 cwt

16 September	91 tons Burra Burra ore £14-18-6 per ton of 21 cwt

41 tons Burra Burra ore £26-15-0 per ton of 21 cwt

6 tons Burra Burra ore £16-0-6 per ton of 21 cwt

Swansea smelters speak in highest terms of the Burra Burra ores as the most tractable and productive ore they had operated on and were desirous of receiving large supplies.
