Senator R.W. Pearson, No. 1 LCL candidate at the coming elections on 9 May, visited Burra on 10 April.  He spoke of the achievements of the Menzies Government in ending tea, petrol and sugar rationing and of the use of secret ballots in union elections, which ended the role of many top line Communists.  Production of basic commodities had risen.  Defence had been a focus.  Primary producers benefited from the end of Land Tax and from other tax changes.
