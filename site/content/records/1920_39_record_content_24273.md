RSL Farewell Social for S.M. Lane.

About 50 ‘diggers’ assembled on Thursday evening last to bid farewell to S.M. Lane.  The President of the Burra Sub-Branch Len Gordon proposed his health.  Mrs Lane would also be much missed, as for years she had been the convenor of supper for the annual dinners and dances.  He presented Mr Lane with a gold cigarette case and a brass decanter and cut crystal vase for Mrs Lane.

Mrs Lane was farewelled on 20 September by the ladies in the Parish Hall.  She was presented with a case of cutlery.
