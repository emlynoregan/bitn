Accident.  On Thursday a 10-year-old cyclist travelling north on the Mt Bryan Road got something caught in his wheel, causing him to swerve suddenly into the path of an oncoming semi-trailer loaded with 30 head of cattle.  The semi-trailer driver was quick to react and swerved off the road, colliding with a telegraph pole.  The boy ran into the rear of the trailer and suffered bruising and slight concussion.  Sgt Teague and Constable K. Terry of Burra attended the scene and praised the driver for his effort, which had averted a more serious result.  PMG linesmen soon repaired the damaged lines.
