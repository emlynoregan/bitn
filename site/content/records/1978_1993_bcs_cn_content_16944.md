Burra Picnic Race Club – President John Maidment reports:

Thanks to the Kellock Family for their support and use of their land.

Thank also to Peter & Matt Reilly for the use of water trucks.

A profit of $3,288 was realised and shared equally between the RFDS and the Burra Aged Persons Hostel, with a portion kept for improvements and for starting next year’s meeting.

The club hopes to build a large shed to house our Bush Wingding on Saturday night and for food stalls on race day.

Burra Red Cross Calling raised $758.

Burra North Red Cross continues to meet at the Clubrooms.
