Ten Hoboes arrived on town by train one day last week and went to Sgt McDonald for ration tickets.  He gave them tickets, but ordered them to move on.  Eight seemed to do so, but two remained.  On Thursday Miss Bentley of Aberdeen reported an attempted break-in at her shop.  M-C Webster and Sgt McDonald found some old spikes apparently from the mine nearby and found that the men had been camped at the mine, but had moved on.  They were arrested at Hanson on the charge of being idle and disorderly.  Eric Hay (19) of Sydney was sentenced to 1 month in Adelaide Jail.

Charles Foster (18) of Sydney was sentenced similarly, but the warrant was withheld if he left the state.  Hay was also sentenced to 2 weeks concurrently for possessing an unlicensed pea rifle and forfeited the rifle.
