Special Article on ‘The Gums’

[The article includes four poorly reproduced photos of sheep and a poor quality photo of the homestead.]

At one time farmers tried to cultivate the vast stretches of land between Burra and the Murray.  For a year or two barns were filled with wheat, but soon the climate prevailed and one after the other the farms were abandoned and the story of how T.H. Pearse built up ‘The Gums’ is typical of others in this respect.  After its recital one must eliminate all suggestions of ‘luck’ in connection with its success.

The property is now like one immense grassed prairie.  ‘The Gums’ may be reached from Mt Mary or Morgan on the North Eastern Railway or from Burra on the main Northern Line.  Mt Mary is the nearest rail point and the post town.  [The article continues as the report by a visit of a reporter.]

I was met by Mr Harold Pearse, the youngest son of T.H. Pearse, who drove him from the Morgan railway station to the homestead at 20 m.p.h. in a 7 h.p. Swift, covering the 25 miles in 1¼ hours.  There I was welcomed warmly.  Shearing was in progress.  The mail had started an hour before us, but arrived an hour later.

The homestead is on a rise north of a magnificent belt of gum trees, from which the property takes its name.  The trees mark a big swamp, which is watered when the Burra creek overflows.  The garden and lawn are objects of Mrs Pearse’s care and attention.  A permanent supply of water has allowed a great range of flowers to be grown.  Climbers and standards flourish.

T.H. Pearse has been on the property for 26 years.  In 1884 in conjunction with Mr W. Cockrum he bought it from Mr R.J. McBride.  The partnership lasted until 1895 when it was dissolved by mutual consent.  Mr Pearse stayed on.  He has three sons; B.W., N.H. and H.L. Pearse.  B.W. Pearse was for some time the owner of Caroona Station some 40 miles northwest of ‘The Gums’.  The second and third sons went to Roseworthy Agricultural College and now assist in the management of ‘The Gums’.

Mr Norman is in partnership with his father in the firm of Thomas H. Pearse & Son and lives at Corra Linn, about two miles away and the two homesteads are connected by telephone.  The station covers some 95,000 acres of saltbush country, 15,000 acres having been bought in the last few months from Mr Harold Pearse, the youngest son.  This vast area has in its time been practically devoid of feed and Mr Pearse can relate awful tales of droughts endured.  In one such in an eighteen month period only 1½ inches of rain fell and thirteen thousand sheep died – that was in 1889.  The 1901-02 period was another terrible drought.  The average rainfall is 9 inches.  In the last year or two the gauge has measured c. 16 years.  [Sic: presumably a misprint for inches.]

As the struggling farmers in the Hundred of Bundey fell, he gathered their properties one after the other – adding 33 such holdings to the original station.  The South Australian Legislature was slow to acknowledge this change and short term tenure offers no inducement for expenditure on fences, water supply etc.  Only in the last dozen or so years were those who persevered given comparative security of tenure with perpetual leasing and long leases, with right of purchase.  This has encouraged investment in improvements.

Except for about five miles the whole of ‘The Gums’ is now protected by vermin-proof fencing and that gap will be closed this year.  Paddocks range from 1,500 to 7,000 acres and are arranged to take best advantage of feed and water.  Foxes are present, but keep down rabbits and the loss of 5-7% of the lambs to them is a bearable price to pay for that benefit.  There are more than 30 dams on the property with a capacity of more than 20,000,000 gallons and dispersed so that no paddock is unsupplied.  Water on hand now will serve for about eighteen months.  Dams range in size from 175,000 to 2,100,000 gallons and two wells give an inexhaustible supply of good stock water.  Burra Creek touches one corner for about 4 miles.  Further bores are being put down to test the idea that the waters of Baldina Creek flow underground across the property.  One bore at 164 ft is in operation in support of this theory.

Almost the whole of Mr Pearse’s efforts have been directed for some years to the raising of big framed strong-wooled merinos, which he has proved can be raised on saltbush country without special protection and are inured to the trials of a hot dry climate.  The had observed that wool in the east had a tendency to become light and thus lose character and he aimed to retain that character.

In 1890 he shore 38,000 for 500 bales and in 1909 he shore 16,000 for 420 bales.

For all the conservation of feed, less management work and labour and better supervision of the smaller flock he gained greater commercial value of the sheep for a cost of 80 bales of wool.  The average weight of shorn fleeces has increased 50%.

Last year 12,000 sheep averaged 12 lb each and the lambs a little over 4 lb.

This year they expect 13 lb and more than 5 lb respectively.

In establishing this flock Mr Pearse has secured the Koonoona and Murray merinos – large framed, grass-fed and strong wooled.  He has culled anything indicating deterioration and now rears his own rams with occasional imported stud rams from the Koonoona-Wanganella strain and aims always to breed true to type.

The flock of stud ewes of 450 should average 18 lb fleeces this year.

In a drive around the property we saw lambs five months old that were almost as big as their mothers.  These sheep are well suited to saltbush country and the lands opening back from the River Murray and the fame of the Pearse Stud is spreading.

Lambing at ‘The Gum’s takes place in March and April and this year there was a drop of 4,600 at a rate of over 90%.

Early on he suffered from overstocking, but has learnt that a safe rate is one sheep to 5 acres and now runs 15,000 to 20,000 sheep depending on the year.  This year he could have run nearly 50,000, but prefers to look at keeping twelve months’ feed in reserve.  Since the 1902 drought broke bare patches have been filling up and while the ground is not yet entirely covered, it does not bear the barren look, which is the despair of the pastoralist.

In the area fed by the overflow of Burra creek green feed persists to Christmas every year that has anything like a flood.  Rich clover, succulent spinach, geranium and a wonderful variety of indigenous grasses and bushes grow in profusion.

This has been a marvellous season for the east and there is an abundance of cotton, salt and blue bushes, barley, silver, canary, prairie and spear grasses.  The sheep have become choosey, being able to pick the choicest morsels.  We drove through 6,000 acres of black spear grass 3 ft 6 inches high and yet in one drought year 3,000 lambing ewes were kept alive there on sandalwood that ‘all hands and the cook’ broke down for them.

The timber consists mainly of little mallee, myall, sandalwood, black oak and bullock bush, with magnificent stands of gums along the creek near the homestead.  Rank growth of the tobacco tree is a problem that has spread over the swamp.  Mr Pearse thinks that the seed must have washed down the creek in floods from the Burra area.

This year ‘The Gums’ will shear some 18,000 animals.  The shed has eight stands and is fitted with the Moffat-Virtue Sheep Shearing Machines, driven by a 4 b.h.p. petrol engine.  The Federal Sheep Shearing Company has the contract and they supply the shearers, overseer and book-keeper.  The wool classing is done by students from the School of Mines under a foreman from the same.

The station has also bred splendid horses, suitable for the remount service.  The name of T.H. Pearse & Son is well known in the half-yearly shows held in Adelaide by the royal Agricultural Society and at other shows.
