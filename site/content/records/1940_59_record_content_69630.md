Burra Racing Club held its AGM 7 September

Chairman Gerald Gask reported on a very satisfactory year.  Two race meetings were held: a six event program in October and a seven event program in March.  The combined surplus was £173.  Membership was 154, which is an improvement, but still down on the record of 194 for 1951-52.  The gate takings were also down to £338 from an expected figure of about £400.

Alterations to the track estimated to cost £700 attracted a grant from the Betting Control Board of £570.  The new part of the track has been planted and there should be little dust from it in October.  A new watering service has been installed with 1,000 ft of two-inch pipe on part of the track and water laid on to the grandstand.  The Members’ Bar has been enlarged and with a Committee Bar the congestion has been greatly eased.  Additional horse stalls have been erected.  Thanks to the CWA Ladies who provided excellent luncheons and afternoon teas.  The regretted death of Mr E.L. Steer removes a very willing helper at our busy bees.  Elected: Patron, Andrew tenant and Chairman, Gerald Gask.

[Obituary.  The reference in the preceding Burra Racing Club report is the only one to the death of Ernest Leslie Steer born 24 January 1886 Goolwa: died 30 August 1955 Burra North.]
