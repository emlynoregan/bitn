Rev. D.L. Redding preached his last sermon as Rector on 1 January.  Large congregations came to both Sunday services despite the temperature of 105°F for the day.  He endeared himself greatly to his parishioners during his stay on Burra.  With the numbers and the heat the farewells and presentations were held outside.  Speeches were made by the wardens G.H. Dow & M.W. Bednall and a cheque for over £20 was handed over.  P.L. Rosman spoke for the choir which presented a handsome reading lamp.
