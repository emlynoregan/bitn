One of the attractions will be the visit of an historic Dehavilland DH 84 Dragon VH-AQU.

These aircraft were used by virtually all Australia’s pioneer airlines.  This one was built in Australia in the early years of WWII and used by the RAAF as a training aircraft.  After the war it served as a Royal Flying Doctor Aircraft.  It is one of only three of its type still flying in the world and has just been used in the re-make of the film A Town Like Alice.  On Sunday it will be on display in Market Square.  [Photo]

Burra apex Club will sponsor a family fun run for the Sunday morning of the Copper Festival.

The Tiddy ’Oggey Tearooms will be opened on Monday 13 October at the old Court House Hotel.  Marble and knucklebone championships will be contested.

The Market Square General Store & Post Office (i.e. the National Trust Museum) will be open for business over the long weekend.  [Photo of Colin Fidock at the store’s counter.]
