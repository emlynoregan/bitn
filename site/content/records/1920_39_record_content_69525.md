Floods.  Further to the earlier news Mr N.H. Pearse says the floods at ‘The Gums’ were the biggest ever seen and Mr Hentschke agreed at his place.  All fences in the way were levelled and while it will ultimately benefit the land there will be a solid week’s fencing on ‘The Gums’.  The telephone line to Glen Bower was washed away.  A.G. Heinrich of Dutton’s Trough said the source of the flood in particular was Reed’s Creek and a tremendous downpour in the Hallelujah Hills.
