Mr Hassel, who had enquired of the Town Council about the strength of the town bridges to carry a traction engine and loads of phosphate rock, has not been seen for some time and no work is being done on the claims that he somehow got hold of.  A letter has been sent to the Minister of Mines and if he does not carry out the requirements to work the claim the leases will again be open for selection.
