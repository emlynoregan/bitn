Caravan Park.  The Mayor said this week that it was time Burra had a Caravan Park.  The project had been under discussion for a long time.  Councillors seemed to favour a site among the trees near the Children’s Playground [later to become the motel site.]  The Mayor said it would induce tourists to stop and increase the trade for the town’s businesses.  The site was close to the post office and the business centre.  The Town Council could not do the work of building the park, due to shortage of labour, but would appreciate the help of civic minded citizens.  The suggestion was to call the site the Woollacott Caravan Park in honour of Mr T.H. Woollacott, who worked to benefit the area for so many years.  The estimated supplies needed were: a cooper, stand and bath, 12 bags of cement, a load of gravel, 100 ft of ¾-inch pipe, 50 f t of ½-inch pipe, sheets of flat galvanised iron 2-12 ft, 10 inch by 10 inch posts, 4 yards of 3 ft cyclone fencing, a rain-water tank and two cyclone gates.  The total cost was estimated at £126.  Most towns of any size in Victoria and NSW have caravan parks and they charge anything from 2/- to 7/- per night.
