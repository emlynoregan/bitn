Once pouring begins it is necessary to continue in 12-hour shifts with 25 men employed on each shift.  The large mixer handles half a cubic yard of mix every three minutes.  The forming, about four feet high all round the complete shape of the silo, is automatically lifted in a working cycle of three-quarters of an inch every four minutes.  About 30 hydraulic jacks are attached to the one inch rods, which continue up through the walls, forming part of the reinforcing.  Parallel reinforcing rods are also placed every five inches for the first 50-60 feet and then every three inches, reverting to every five inches near the top.  The concrete is tipped from the hopper into a holding bin and is distributed manually around the forming using a wheelbarrow and then consolidated with a vibrator.  Given good conditions 15 to 16 feet can be poured in a 12-hour shift.

The contracting party is C.H. Martin Ltd.  When completed the silo will hold 111,000 bushels of grain.
