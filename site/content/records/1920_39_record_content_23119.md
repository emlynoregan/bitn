Cricket.  [There was evidently considerable disputation over who the premiers were for the year and just how that was decided.  This emerges from a column of correspondence.]

W.M. Bednall, Captain of the Kooringa Cricket Club writes:

Soon after the semi-finals started Mr Weatherill, Secretary of the Mt Bryan Cricket Club said in his view the rules said Mt Bryan had already won the premiership regardless of the finals, due to a failure to alter one of last year’s rules when the new rules were made.  I approached Mr Radford as Chairman of the Association and his opinion was that points counted in finals and semi-finals and so with Kooringa 3 points behind Mt Bryan a 4 point win over them would give Kooringa the premiership without the need for a challenge match.

[Bednall then goes on to complain of the spirit in which Mt Bryan played and lost the final match to Kooringa.]

E.M. Weatherill then wrote to Mr Radford saying Mt Bryan sought to play the challenge match at South Booborowie on 9 & 23 April.

Bednall points out the nomination of grounds and dates contravened Association rules.

Mr Radford then changed his former ruling, but by then some Kooringa members were engaged to play at Robertstown and others to go to Adelaide and so Kooringa suggested 23 & 25 April.

Mt Bryan objected to this as seeding operations would be in progress and they wanted 9 & 23 as before.

Kooringa replied that seeding operations appeared only to affect two players, neither of them prominent and Kooringa said they were not able to play on 9 April, despite which Mt Bryan travelled to Aberdeen and back again on that date and then wrote a letter complaining of the non-appearance of Kooringa and asking for this to be dealt with under Section IX of the Constitution – considering the match as forfeited.

The Kooringa Club accepts the Chairman’s rulings absolutely.

‘In our private views and in those of most cricketers technicalities and fine points in rules are not good cricket.  The Mt Bryan Club therefore has the great honour of retaining the premiership on a forced forfeit, after having been very soundly and decisively beaten in the final game.’

W.M. Bednall, Captain of the Kooringa Cricket Club
