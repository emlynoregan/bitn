Weather: Storms

Four separate and severe rainstorms affected the World’s End area last Friday and Saturday and some parts received up to 5 inches for the week.  Damage to fences and roads was considerable.  Severe storms were experienced widely in the east, but Burra recorded only 99 points for the week, with most of it on Wednesday when 65 points fell.

Even with this much rain, follow-up falls will be needed or the new feed will burn off.  Much of the potential grass seed blew away on Black Sunday 2 January.

Most dams in the east are now full and some were even destroyed when walls gave way.  At ‘Studholme’ the flats were covered in swift-flowing water from one to two miles wide.  The creek in this area running into Gordon’s Lagoon was in places 8 ft over the banks  and the lagoon, about 17 miles from Burra, is filled to capacity, with water a foot deep over the roadway.  It has never been known to fill so quickly or to be covered to such an extent.  Where the Burra Creek crosses the Burra-Robertstown Road it ran 8-9 ft deep.  The later falls came down the already strongly-flowing creek in a wall 4 ft high.

A.G. Heinrich and Rex Warnes at ‘The Gap’ both reported 3 inches for the week.  The rains were extensive, but the heavy falls were localised.  Many falls were in the 30-60 points range, but:

Oakbank	257 for the week

Oak Vale	208

Morgan Vale	200

Narkunda	400

Mallett		100

Gum Creek	150

As we go to press we are getting reports of torrential rain on Sunday in the Mt Bryan area.  At about 4.30 p.m. a squall struck and 2 inches fell in 45 minutes.  Dust Hole Creek came down in a real flood, but the fall was very localised, with places a mile away recording only 46 points.
