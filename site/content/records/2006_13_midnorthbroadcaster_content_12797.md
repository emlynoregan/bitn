Burra Out of School Hours Care

About 39 people attended a meeting at the school on Monday night to discuss the impending suspension of OSHC.  The governing council decided on the suspension due to low attendance and financial difficulties in recent months.  Craig Honan chaired the meeting.  Parents were angry because they were not forewarned of the move and said they could have boosted attendance, had they been aware of the threat.  The current debt is $5,574.  Speakers said winter was inevitably a time of lower usage.  A minimum number of five children per day would ensure that the service remains viable for the meantime.  It is highly likely there will be a moderate increase in fees.  Executive member and school Principal Tony Maio proposed a four week window of opportunity, in which the service would remain open to provide the community with the opportunity to do what they could to assist the service.  This move was carried and an effort will be made to establish a committee.
