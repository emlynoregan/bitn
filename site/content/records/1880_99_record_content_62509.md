Diamond Jubilee Celebrations.  The Hon. Sec. Mr R.M. Harvey says receipts to date are £69-7-1 and the cost of the treat for the 667 children and prizes for the races came to only £36-11-3.  The balance will be handed to the Jubilee Benevolent Society.  Donations amounting to £4-4-0 have yet to be collected.
