Burra Hospital

Several members of the Burra Racing Club were shown over the hospital by the matron Sister Mosey, especially the new W.H. Duncan Wing and the operations theatre, which has been completed and put in use.  They were agreeably surprised at one of the best operation rooms outside Adelaide, with every convenience at hand and a splendid set of instruments available as the result of a bequest of the late Mr Thomas Parks.  The new theatre is the outcome of a fund started by a substantial legacy from the late Mr W. H. Duncan.  The members were there to present a folding invalidâ€™s chair on wheels.  Mr George Lord made the presentation and Mr J.F. Moore accepted on behalf of the Hospital Board.
