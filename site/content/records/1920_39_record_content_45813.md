Anzac Sports last Saturday 29 April were the best sports carnival for at least 25 years.  They were organised by the local RSL.  It produced one of the largest crowds ever at the Burra Racecourse.  About 2,000 attended with c. 400 cars parked at the south end.  About £70 was taken at the gate.  A detachment of the 18/23 Light Horse under Major T. Kenyon led the procession at 12.30.  Sylvester Preiss was Marshall of the procession from the Burra Hospital, led by the Burra Brass Band.  As in the war years Jack Allen Sen. appeared as John Bull and then came Major Kenyon and the 18/23 Light Horse.  H. Jennison and A.L. Bence had decorated cars; the latter’s as a pirate boat.  A trolly picked up the band half way.  There were serious races for horses, motor bikes, pedestrians and motor cars.  And fun events like the Military Obstacle Race and the draught horse race, which was the star event.  The latter event was held up when a car battery was found on Lightning, but the jockey proved his innocence and was not disqualified.  In the end it was J. Villis’s Mongolata ridden by G.H. Dow that won.  [This result was corrected in the paper of 10 May to W.G. Ellery’s Leg Theory ridden by G.H. Dow.]  Five minutes later Ralph Hill arrived on his horse Lightning, to the Band’s rendition of See the Conquering Hero Comes.  Results of all events are printed.
