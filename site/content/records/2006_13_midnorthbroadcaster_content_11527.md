The 2010 Burra & Community Christmas Fair was held on Friday last and attracted a colourful variety of floats and Christmas items.  The Sing Australia choir led by John Fuss were joyful in their carolling in Market Square.  Children were keen to see Santa in the rotunda after he arrived on Burraâ€™s 1922 Model T Ford Fire Engine.  The Burra Cricket Club ran the barbecue.  Prizes were awarded for the best decorated bikes, floats and the Christmas Lights Competition.    Jasper Weatherstone had the best decorated bike, The Burra Ambulance entered the best float and the Irlam family of East Street won the Christmas Lights Competition.
