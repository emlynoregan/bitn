‘Whip’ reports that the cricket Club lecture was a financial failure.  He says the Friendly Societies are preparing for a sports day to include bicycle contests as a special feature as well as the Sheffield Handicap.  He comments that bicycling continues to grow in favour with ladies around the world, Mr Grundy notwithstanding.
