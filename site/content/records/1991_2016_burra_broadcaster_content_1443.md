AdChem’s bullion production recently passed $1 million.  Newcrest Mining Ltd has scheduled to ship 20,000 tonnes p.a. of gold-bearing copper concentrate to Burra.  From this Burra’s copper leach and gold extraction process produces 3,500 tonnes of copper cement and 2 tonnes of gold bullion.  The latter is sent to the Perth Mint for further refining.  Tony Tindale, AdChem’s Burra Works Manager, said they were halfway through the first shipment of 5,000 tonnes and the second shipment is due to start arriving in late July.  It comes from the Telfer Mine in inland WA and is shipped via Pt Headland and Pt Pirie.  Mt Gunson, which has been Burra’s main source of oxidised ore for some years, has almost run out, making Burra dependent on Newcrest.  Dennis Thamm will remain as caretaker mine manager at Mt Gunson for the foreseeable future.  Bill Munro has been transferred to Burra as leading hand on the day shift, relieving Les Gardner, who has extended leave.
