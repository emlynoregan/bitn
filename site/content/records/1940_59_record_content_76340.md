Burra Town Hall.  The tender has been let and the work started.

The Library has been transferred to the old CWA Room.

The old Library is being converted to the CWA quarters and should be ready for the opening meeting for 1957, early in March.

Plans and specifications are almost complete for the new supper room and kitchen and the tender will be called as soon as possible.
