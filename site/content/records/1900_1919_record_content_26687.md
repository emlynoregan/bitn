Mt Bryan is going ahead rapidly.  The railway station is a hive of activity, with the continual movement of farm machinery, manures, oil and petrol.  The National and Australasian Banks have set up branches and there are three stores operating, with talk of saddlers, butchers and bakers setting up businesses.
