Burra Town Council, 6 November

W.D. Thomas resigns as Ranger.

F.L. Worth Hon. Secretary of the Burra Institute Committee writes seeking to clarify the Council’s free use of the Institute.

The Mayor said the Council had always had three free nights per year and had used them either for patriotic meeting or for meetings for the welfare of the town.  He suggested the matter be put in writing and an agreement defining the Council’s free nights be entered into.  Carried.

The solicitors advise that the AWA award seems likely to be £3-15-0 a week for a 44-hour week.  If employed for less than 8 weeks then at 15/8 a day or £4-6-2 for a 5½ day week and casual labour at 1/11 per hour or £4-4-0 for a 44-hour week.  The Mayor did not see how they could employ casual labour at such rates.

Kooringa Lawn Tennis Club season opened last Saturday.

St Mary’s.  A letter from S. [Solomon] Williams of 10 Moseley St Glenelg who listened to the jubilee service broadcast from St Mary’s.

He says he left Burra 72 years ago, having spent the first twenty years of his life there.  He attended the day school in the first St Mary’s on Limestone Hill run by Mr & Mrs Oakford.  He lists some of the pupils as Dick Collins (later of Hallett), Bill Pearce (late of Bath & Pearce), Tommy Sampson & Billy Symons (both of whom lived near the old bridge opposite the Bible Christian Church), Charlie Dryer (who lived ‘up in the paddock’), Jack Billing (who lived with old ‘Maester’ Gordon near Dr Mayne’s in Commercial St) – that was in 1854.  He was there when Rev. Pollett was Rector, but doesn’t remember seeing him.  [Rev. Pollitt 1846-55.]  He does remember Rev. D.J.H. Ibbitson.  [Rev. Ibbetson Rector 1855-61.]  He was influential in establishing the Institute.  He wonders if there is anyone left in Burra who he knew or to whom he was known.  If so he would like to correspond.

Burra Progress Association wants hawkers banned in the town.  The Town Council will seek advice about what its powers over hawkers are.

[At the time the Council appeared to be able to charge £2 a day for hawkers who came into the town and hired premises or 5/- for the use of certain street sites, but could not charge those who travelled from house to house.]
