Burra Hospital Board,  15 December

Rev. Daddow said services on behalf of the Hospital would be held in the Primitive Methodist Church on Christmas Day.

A sub-committee was appointed to get a skillion put up in substitution for the old bathroom adjoining the operating room.  A re-arrangement of rooms for the night nurse and porter’s family was made.

In view of the possibility of putting up a new cottage for the porter it was decided to ask SAMA through Mr West for an allotment at the west side of the present premises.
