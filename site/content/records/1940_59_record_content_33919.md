Burra Town Council, 3 November

Council resolved not to allow Burra North Service Station to use part of the footpath as a driveway to new pumps in Best Place.

Burra Football Club forwarded a cheque of £33-15-0 towards liquidating the Town Hall debt as a result of the recent football carnival.

Extensions to Duldig’s Café and Bakery were approved.

Highways & Local Government Dept. granted £200 additional fund for repairs to Smelts Road with the Council to contribute £100.

A tender of £13-13-0 for seven cedar chairs is to lie on the table.
