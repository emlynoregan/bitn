Burra Town Council, 19 August

There was a lengthy discussion concerning drainage pipes laid in Justice Lane near the Hospital.

The argument focused upon the fact that the work to construct the drains to the pipes was not specifically authorised by Council.

Cr Kellaway, as Chairman of the Public Works said he would have fallen down on his job if drains had not been made to the pipes.  He called for a vote of confidence or non-confidence and without it he was not prepared to carry on as Chairman of Public Works.

Crs Kellaway & Carpenter were keen to keep the matter out of the press.  The Mayor said they were not in committee and therefore had not the power to ask the press to delete the discussion.

[The paper does not report on how the matter was resolved.]

The clerk reported that Council had the power to order the removal of unsightly structures or could get a court order to remove them itself.
