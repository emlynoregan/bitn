Miss Helbig to Murray Bridge

[The Headmaster then thanked the school prefects and house leaders and other students who carried out a range of services.]

Thanks also go to the chief organizer Gary Heinrich and the participants in last Fridayâ€™s Swimathon, which has raised about $300.  Thanks also to staff who have put in the extra work for organizing individual study programs as an experiment in the last fortnight.

Religious instruction has continued for two groups this year: Anglicans with Rev. Stephenson and Roman Catholics with two Sisters from Georgetown.  Last year we were shocked by the sudden death of the school cleaner Mr Hawkins on the day after speech night.  He had been a cleaner at the High School from 1958 and for both school for some years before that.  Mrs Bagg said she could not continue alone and so another cleaner was found.  Mr Brak has done a very efficient job.  The Burra Record is thanked for printing news concerning the school and Mrs Carpenter & Mrs Cockington for continuing the singing tradition at the school.
