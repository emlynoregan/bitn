Utica Coppermining Co.  Second annual Report.

A pumping plant has been successfully installed at £264.  In the very hot weather we have had to cease work due to bad air.  Winze sinking has only got 16’ – at which there is splendid ore.  Tenders will be called to sink the winze to 100’.  We have, with the Government subsidy, £340.  The future of the company looks satisfactory.  G. Lord is retiring as a director to be replaced by A.J. McBride.
