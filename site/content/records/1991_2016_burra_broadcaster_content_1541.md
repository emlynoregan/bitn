Redbanks

About 50 people attended the public meeting called to discuss the Redbanks area.  DC Chairman Graham Kellock outlined a brief history of the area and of attempts to tackle the matter in the 1980s.

Mr Paul Tullock, District Manager for the Environment & Land Management Department, said he would await the Council’s response on the future use and management of the property.

Mr Dennis Cock of the LGA Mutual Liability Scheme outlined strategies required for active use of the area, such as off-road vehicle use.

Paul Tullock said the case presently in the appeals Court and the potential for future incidents has ruled out motor bike use of the area.

The Department did not want to take on the area as a reserve as they have neither the money nor the rangers to staff it.

Bob Major of the Field Geology Club of SA described a report suggesting the western quarter should be a reserve to protect a couple of old gold mines, Aboriginal artefacts and the watercourse of the Baldina Creek.

Steve Pike, a previous squatter on the area, said a diprotodon had been taken from the area by the SA Museum and the area had definite archaeological significance.

Rob, a bike rider from Hackham asked why it couldn’t be run as an off-road park like Port Gawler, but it seemed from bike riders present that their case was spoilt by a hooligan element.

On a vote ten persons favoured an option involving some in favour of off-road vehicle use.  Most favoured the whole area becoming a reserve under Council care with no off-road vehicles.

The option of grazing with no off-road vehicles and a reserve had no support.

The Council will give the matter further consideration.
