National Trust.  The visitors from the city had a very interesting weekend as guests of the Burra Branch.  When they arrived in two buses at 12.30 on Saturday they were given a tour by Messrs Auhl and Woollacott.  Mrs A.D. Radford showed them around the Museum.  The tour covered the town and took them out to Breakneck and Moonlight Hills to give them some idea of the eastern plains and the Murray Scrub.  A special display was arranged at the Museum of maps, old newspapers and other items of interest.  Burra CWA prepared a buffet style evening meal at the RSL Hall.  Mr S.J. Woollacott welcomed the guests as President of Burra & District National Trust.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone welcomed the visitors on behalf of residents and spoke of the role of the Town Council in the preservation of the mine precincts and he predicted a great future for the tourist industry.  Mr Ian Auhl was guest speaker for the evening.  Films taken by Mr John Kingsford–Smith some months ago at Burra were shown.  On Sunday morning a visit was made to the Brewery Cellars and some of the group attended the 9.30 a.m. service at St Mary’s, having been shown through it by Rev. Sibly the previous day.  Adelaide and Waikerie members of the National Trust gathered with Burra members at Princess Royal at 11 a.m.  Misses Josephine Morphett and Alison Wood conducted visitors through the ground floor of the stately home and the garden was enjoyed by all.  After lunch at their respective hotels the guests departed for Adelaide at 2 p.m.  Waikerie visitors were shown over the town in the afternoon.
