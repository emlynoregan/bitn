Railway Extravagance.  A one-column article reports on extravagant spending in the Railways Department.  Of particular local interest was the cost, drawn from railway funds, of supporting the YMCA at Peterborough between 1926 and 1930, which appeared to total Â£21,136.  Some local benefit of this was received in Burra where the YMCA at this period received some support from Peterborough.
