Hallett Electricity Supply

For the whole of last month Hallett has relied on Mr John Murrayâ€™s tractor.  The repaired engine was returned, but after only a few hours was found to have a cracked head and had to be returned to Adelaide.  It returned on 15 April and the outlook seemed brighter, but last week it broke down again, requiring further adjusting by ETSA experts on Thursday and Friday.  Hopes are held that this has fixed the problem.
