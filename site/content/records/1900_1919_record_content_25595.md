R.J.J. Ockenden writes as a one-time shop assistant.  He thanks businessmen for agreeing to close their shops from Saturday 25 December to Thursday 30 December and on Saturday 1 January.  He then goes on to argue the case for a half-day holiday on Saturdays.  The Wednesday half-day is a boon without question, but Saturday would be a much better choice.  It is the usual day for recreation and enjoyment.  He hopes that traders will fall into line and grant the boon now sought.  The argument that Saturday night trading is necessary has had the bottom knocked out of it long ago and any inconvenience at its loss would be trifling.  Only a few inconsiderate customers and a few greedy traders stand in the way of the change.
