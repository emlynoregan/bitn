Burra Town Council, Special Meeting, 17 April.

Meeting held to swear in W. Neville to replace W.T. Rabbich.

The Mayor read the notice in the Govt. Gazette of Mr Nevilleâ€™s election along with Clause 60 of the Corporations Act 1890.

Mr Neville asked for a written guarantee indemnifying him against any fine that might be inflicted if he was sworn in and was later found to have taken his seat illegally.

His Worship said they were unable to do that.

Mr W. Neville then refused to take the oath, giving as his reason that the Council had not complied with clause 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1890 re the unseating of Cr Rabbich and that therefore there was no vacancy to be filled.  He would assist the Council in any way possible, but by taking his seat under the circumstances he would render himself liable to heavy penalty.

The meeting was then adjourned.
