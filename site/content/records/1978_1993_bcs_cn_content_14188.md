BCS.  Staff Profile: Nic Bambacas

My secondary education was at Plympton H.S. and teacher training was at Salisbury CAE, where I specialised in English, Drama and History, completing a Diploma and Bachelor of Teaching.  Spent the latter half of 1985 at Mt Gambier H.S. and 1986 at Keith Area School.  At Burra I am teaching English, Drama and Media Studies to Level 4.  I am interested in Astronomy, squash, art and car restoration â€“ currently working on a Sunbeam Alpine and I have been a volunteer for disabled youth.
