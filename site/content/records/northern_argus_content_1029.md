D. Rayfield for the Burra Preservation Organisation writes a letter of some 1¾ columns.

He protests about a letter in the Argus of 2 April from L. Evans.  He says that L. Evans, as far as he can determine, is a figment of someone’s imagination.  The story of the Rotunda and rose garden being moved did not originate from the BPO, but from ‘our illustrious White House’.  A public meeting last December gave Council a vote of no confidence on the lights and the re-development and called for a poll on the issue.  This was ignored.

At a meeting in Burra in late January Mr B. Rowney of State Heritage, Adelaide, said that the radiused roadway in front of the Tourist Office should stay as it was and not be tampered with.  Mr Don Hele of National Trust, Adelaide, expressed the same view.  At the meeting on 21 February in Adelaide the State heritage Director Mr Jon Womersley ruled that the radiused road would be closed and modified protuberances be constructed, State Heritage over-riding objections to this.

[He then goes on at length to justify the validity of the petition and to express his disappointment on behalf of the BPO at the actions of Councillors’ in the whole saga.]
