Editorial on a Recreation Ground for Burra.

Another effort is to be made to obtain a recreation ground for Burra.  We have long thought it desirable.

‘A very pleasant ground might be laid out and suitably planted - to the eastward of the Model School, - which would not only be an acquisition as a place for recreation, but which would add to the appearance of our now too treeless town.’
