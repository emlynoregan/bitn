The 2015 SA Hiking Challenge saw about 300 tutu-clad hikers on the Heysen Trail to raise funds for the Jodi Lee Foundation â€“ to raise awareness for the prevention of bowel cancer.  Participants were in and around Burra for three days and the hikers celebrated with a special dinner at the Burra Mine at the conclusion of the event.  $376,840 was raised.

The foundation honours 39-year-old Jodi Lee, who died from bowel cancer in 2010 and it was established by her husband, Nick.  Jodi loved a little black dress and since her death Little Black Dress Parties have been held in many cities and they gave rise to the black tutus worn by the hikers.
