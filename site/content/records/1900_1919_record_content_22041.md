The late J. Ford’s sale is reported in some detail, though the lack of section or allotment numbers makes it hard to pin point the blocks sold.  The polo paddock went for £9-17-6 an acre for 79 acres.  The 2½ acres of the Bon Accord Mine went to the SA Government for £255.  Truscott & Harris’s shop, office and butchers premises drew £560.  Mrs Rogers bought the Black Waterholes garden of 25 acres for £13 per acre.
