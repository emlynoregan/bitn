Burra Town Council, 13 December.

The financial state of affairs is printed.

Among other things the South Ward spent £318-5-6 on a bridge.  [Presumably this is the Thames St Bridge.]

Available for expenditure in 1881 is: -

For North Ward	£119-14-5

For Middle Ward	£108-13-9 + the special grant of £400 for the road past the Institute etc.

For South Ward	£204-14-11

The Mayor declined to accept any allowance, even if such were to be offered.

The salary for the combined offices carried out by the Town Clerk was set at £135, up £15.

The Inspector was reappointed at the same salary.

The scavenger was given 10/- a day with horse and cart. [Assuming a six-day week this equals £156 per annum.]

Station men were awarded 7/- a day

D.S. Packard was asked to continue as Council solicitor for the same fee, though he had asked for a larger retainer.
