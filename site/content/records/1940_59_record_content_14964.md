Obituary.  Mrs Alfred Woodman died in Burra Hospital Friday 16 September aged 81. [Friday was the 17th.]  [‘The Family History of Thomas Sargant & his wife Ellis/Alice Packham’ says Bridget Maud Evans married Albert Woodman 14 November 1891 at the residence of Mrs Foster Kooringa.  Bridget Maud Woodman died 17 September 1943 at Burra according to Deaths CD.  BUT the SA Marriages CD says Albert Woodman married Bridget Bertha Evans on 14 November 1891 at Mrs Foster’s Kooringa.  Albert Woodman died 14 March 1921 at Burra.  There seems to be no record of births in SA for Albert Woodman, Alfred Woodman, Bridget Bertha Evans or Bridget Maud Evans and no marriage or death for Alfred Evans.]
