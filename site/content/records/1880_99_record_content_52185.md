Editorial on Municipal Affairs.

A meeting was held on 4 December to swear in the new Council and immediately afterwards a meeting to elect committees.

In the last year the chairmen of committees have tended not to consult their committees as they should and we hope for better.

Last Wednesday the Town Clerk, W. Davey and Inspector J.R. Gray were re-appointed at their former salaries as were the cemetery curator and the scavenger.  Re-appointment of the Overseer of Works was deferred for a month as there is no urgent work and only £2 remains in the Ward funds.  Any money saved may be needed later for unemployment relief work.

Snakes are very numerous this year.

Montgomery & Moreny’s Circus drew only a very poor audience on Monday.  The acrobatic acts were first class and the performers deserved a bumper house.  They had been advertised for Saturday, but circumstances over which they had no control caused the change.

Rev. S. Knight’s lecture on The Nineteenth Century, at the Wesleyan Lecture Hall on Thursday evening was well attended and much enjoyed.

Mt Bryan Concert tonight in the Council chamber.  Mt Bryan Fife and Drum Band and the Burra Juvenile Oxidentals will appear.  Proceeds will aid school prizes.
