Kerosene Tins

An article laments in ½ column the passing of the kerosene tin, which is a shame because it was such a basic item with unlimited uses in the bush, such as:

To boil the water for baby’s first bath.

To form the bathtub for the baby.

A hut might be composed of flattened tins.

Children mixed their mud pies in one.

They used one to carry water from the dam or tank.

The poddy calf could be fed from one.

It was the wicket for innumerable games of cricket.

Cut lengthways it formed a wash pan for dishes.

It could take the place of kettles and pots.

It held the water supply in the kitchen.

It served to water the horse.

It held mangles [sic: for mangels] for the cow.

It served as a bucket at milking time.

It caught the honey from wild bees’ hives.

Surplus eggs were preserved in it.

It could serve as a dustbin

Or a baking dish

Or a cake tin.

It was sometimes a watering can.

It could be a bread crock

And now it is passing into history.
