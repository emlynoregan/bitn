Burra Town Council

The Council has paid £350 for a motor truck and will have to strike a special rate of c. 6d to pay it off, but in the long run it is a wise and economical move.  Savings should be appreciable.  The dray carried 1 yard of road metal and the truck will carry 3 as well as moving at six times the speed.  The scavenging using a horse takes a week to do the town.  A truck and two men can do it in 1½ days.  (Also horses and new equipment were needed as an alternative and this would have cost at least £120.
