Burra RSL

The Sub-Branch has nominated Mr John Dighton (the Hon. Secretary) as a member of the State Council of the RSL at the forthcoming League Elections.

The Sub-Branch members unanimously consider that Communists are a disloyal and seditious body and have instructed their Secretary, Mr J. Dighton, to write to the Prime Minister, urging the Federal Government to declare the Communist Party an illegal body.
