The Woolcock Murder Case

‘With our last Summary we published an account of the trial and conviction of Mrs Woolcock for the murder of her husband by poison.  It is stated by a Moonta paper that Mrs Woolcock was born at the Burra.  Her parents’ name was Oliver, and while she was a child they proceeded to Victoria, taking her with them, where she resided some years.  It is stated that when about nine or ten years of age an American black committed a criminal assault upon her, for which he was convicted and hanged.  A few years since she arrived with her mother at Moonta Mines, the father being reported to have died in Victoria.    The accuracy of the report was questioned; but whether correct or not, the mother, soon after her arrival at Moonta married a man named Johns.  He died a few years subsequently; the mother returned to Victoria.  At Moonta Mines the daughter became intimate with the Woolcock family, consisting of the husband, wife and two sons.  About seven years since the wife died, and Miss Oliver was engaged by Woolcock as housekeeper, in which capacity she remained for several months, when he married her.  Woolcock lost by death his eldest son also, which event, we are informed, occurred before his second marriage.  As to Mrs Woolcock’s general character, a person who lived next door to her on the Mines for about six years after her marriage to Woolcock tells us that at all times she appeared at all times to conduct herself with propriety, her behaviour not differing from that of ordinary respectable women.  Sometime prior to the death of Woolcock the family removed to Yelta, and were residing there at the period of Woolcock’s decease.  Mrs Woolcock’s age is stated to be about 27.   The extreme penalty of the law was carried out at Adelaide Gaol on Tuesday morning the 30 December.  The convict has been attended since her conviction by the Rev. J. Bickford, and after his first visit manifested great penitence, and seemed to be perfectly resigned to the fate which she knew awaited her.  In the spare leaf of her Bible, between the Old Testament and the New, it was found she had inscribed a few words to her memory, mentioning her name, her age, and the date of her death.  She also made a full confession of her guilt, stating that she had not been very well treated, and had been tempted by Satan to carry out the act.  The hour fixed for the execution was 8 o’clock, and at that time she was taken from the condemned cell, accompanied by the Rev. J. Bickford and the Governor of the Gaol.  She walked to the place of execution and ascended the scaffold without saying anything.  The Rev. J. Bickford, having offered prayer, the rope was adjusted, and after the usual formalities the bolt was drawn.  Death did not immediately ensue.  Fully five minutes elapsed before the convulsions of the body ceased, but it was afterwards ascertained that dislocation was produced when the drop fell.
