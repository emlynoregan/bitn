Editorial on the result of the Committee appointed to investigate the feud between The Record and the Council.  This comprised five former Mayors (Dr Brummitt and Messrs E.C. Lockyer, P.L. Killicoat, T.W. Wilkinson and P. Lane.)  They were to compare the Council minutes with the reports in the paper.  The papers from January 1893 to the present were examined and the results appear on page three.  The Committee has found the papers reports to be substantially correct.  In particular that of the meeting of 17 July published on 19 July which seems to have been the origin of the present troubles ‘does not contain anything which need have been seriously noticed by the Council.’

And was ‘undeserving of serious criticism.’  The Committee did note a change in the tone of the reports after the antagonistic resolution by the Council [following the publication of 19 July].  They conclude it is most desirable for the Council meetings to be with open doors and for reports of the business to be published.  The Committee concluded that recent press reports have been objectionable: ‘the action of the Council has led up to and excited animosity.’

We are now free from the charge made against us.

‘It is to be hoped the offending councillors with the Mayor will take the verdict calmly although it may seem hard.’
