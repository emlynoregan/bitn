Redruth Court, Thursday.

Two Broken Hill lads aged 14 were sent to Magill Reformatory till 18, having stolen Rev. H.L. Ebbs’s bicycle, valued at c. £8 on the previous Sunday.  Anything was preferable to their treatment at home.

David Rees Jones, labourer of Redruth, was fined £2 or 14 days for being unlawfully on the premises of the Royal Exchange Hotel.  [i.e. seeking alcohol after hours.]

Daniel Horan, an old age pensioner, was apparently unlawfully on the premises of the Burra Hotel on 25 December and was asked to show reason why his pension should not be suspended.  He did not appear and neither did the ‘person who made the report’.  The magistrate decided to take more time to consider the matter.
