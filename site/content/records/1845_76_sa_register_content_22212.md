Black Springs News, 20 July

A District Council has been formed here and it is hoped roads will now improve.

The Central Board’s attention should be drawn to the main road opposite the hotel, which is impassable.  Teams formerly made a road through Mr R. Glasson’s section, but this has now been fenced off and the only route is therefore through private property.  No one cares to repair it and as a consequence drays get bogged, resulting in much cruelty to animals and a great deal of profanity.

It has been very cold.  Yesterday morning pools of water had half an inch of ice on them and wash tubs three quarters of an inch.

Men with loaded wagons are a constant sight on Sundays.  Last Sunday a wagon was stuck in front of the Wesleyan Chapel at Glendore during the service and the driver beat the horses shamefully.
