Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Driving is continuing in Bunts’s Shaft, but as yet to no real purpose.  Work is proceeding in other places, but with no apparent fixed purpose.  Pumping continues.  A consignment of ore left the mine in the last few days, but with better management more could have been done.
