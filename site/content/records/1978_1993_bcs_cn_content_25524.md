Barry Wright

With my wife I have lived in Burra for ten years and own and run Sara’s in Burra North.  I am experienced in business, tourism, book publishing and rural affairs and am on committees of the Lewis Board, Mine Management, Burra Tourist Association, Mid North Development Board and the National Trust; all of which are great experience in dealing with Government Departments etc.  I would greatly like to serve Burra as a Councillor and solicit your number 1 vote on Saturday 1 May.
