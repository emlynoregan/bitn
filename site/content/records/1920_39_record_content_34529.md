Tom Canny writes disassociating his dress at the masquerade ball from the local branch of the RSL.  He takes personal credit for it and considers that judging from reports in the Record the Mayor ‘considers being elected to the Town Council gives one the privilege of immunity from criticism and ridicule, if one chooses to be ridiculous.’  He also wondered if the guns were in the place now approved by the Council minute.
