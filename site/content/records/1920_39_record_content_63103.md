Obituary.  Mrs J.H. Gallagher died 10 September at Gawler.  She was born at Cal Lal, Lake Victoria, River Murray in 1866 and with her parents Mr & Mrs Terry came to reside at Copperhouse in 1881.  She later married the late James H. Gallagher, the well-known pastoralist, at Copperhouse.  She went to live with him in the pastoral country east of Burra.  She became one of the most successful pioneer women of the outback country.  During the war she and her husband contributed large sums to patriotic efforts, as by that time they had left the management of their stations to their sons and moved into the town.  She entered fully into the work of the Soldiers’ Aid Society, Aberdeen.  On the death of her husband she went to live at Glenelg.  Lately she has been living at Gawler on her eldest son’s property, as Mr George Gallagher is now resident at Pualco Station. She had been in indifferent health for some time.  She is survived by three sons: George, William and Leonard, the last of Quondong Station.  There are a number of grandchildren.  Mr William Terry of Kooringa is a brother.
