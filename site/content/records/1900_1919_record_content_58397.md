Burra Hospital Board.

Charge-nurse Cranston has left, having received a military call.

The mortuary roof needs mending and the interior painting.

The Board agreed to accept soldiers at 7/- a day, all included.

The Chief-Secretary wants plans and specifications of the proposed electric light scheme before any expenditure is incurred.

Mr Warnes moved the agreement with the Local Board of Health to treat infectious cases for 30/- a week be annulled.  In 1916 the cost for special nurses for infectious cases was £39-15-0, in 1917 £28 and in 1918 £87-10-0.  Receipts were £14-14-8, which resulted in a loss of £141-9-8 for nursing alone and with other costs this would rise to between £200 & £250.

Mr Radford thought the Government should pay as the loss is caused by poor people and is mostly due to the shortage of nurses [which in turn had much to do with nurses being called up for military duty].

Mr McLaren moved that legal opinion be obtained as to whether they could charge patients able to pay full fees and charge the Local Board of Health for poor patients.

Mr Warnes thought they could not in conscience charge £3-3-0 a week to stay in ‘that oven which is called the isolation ward’. 

Eventually it was decided to seek legal advice and defer action till then.

Miss Kate Williams is to be appointed charge-nurse.

Probationers were being paid 5/- a week in the first year and 2/6 more each subsequent year.  Mr Warnes said these were starvation wages and moved that the rates at other hospitals be obtained.  Carried.
