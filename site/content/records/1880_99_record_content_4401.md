General Temperance Society.  About 30 persons attended the meeting at the Institute last Thursday to form the General Temperance Society.  Three groups of members were admitted.

Total abstainers

Those who drink only with their ordinary meals.

Those who drink only when thirsty.

(This category was strongly advocated by Rev. F. Richmond.)

This last category was much debated and a move is afoot to delete it as destructive of the whole movement.
