BBH Football Club

President David Kellock’s report for 1992

A new committee set about recruiting players from the district and arranging for school leavers to play football.  A & B Grades training sessions saw some 60 lads attending and about 25 boys attended Senior Colts.  The Junior Colts struggled for numbers, but coped well.  It was disappointing to see numbers fall during the season.

The recent AGM appointed office bearers for 1993:

Patrons, Robert Ashby & Bruce Stockman; President, Brian Brooks; Vice-President, John Lehmann; Secretary, John Jones and Treasurer, Shane Ramsey.
