Adelaide Share Market

Burra Burra £5 shares are being traded almost exclusively for cash.  Today’s sales have been at £178 and £177-10-0.  A few have been purchased at £185 on a three months’ bill with the purchaser paying the commission.

The meeting of shareholders tomorrow is anticipated with interest.  Some are apprehensive of a diminution of the dividend.

‘In reply to one correspondent, it would hardly be practicable to “restrain Directors from dealing in shares while in office,” as their transactions might be effected through other means.’
