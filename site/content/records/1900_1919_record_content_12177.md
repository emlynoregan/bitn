Arthur Abbott, who was badly injured in a fall from his bike last week seems to have wandered about dazed before being found and was on his hands and knees when Villis found him.  The odd thing is that when he left Mr Jonesâ€™s on his bike he had 20 lb of mutton, a Bayard rifle and a bottle of strychnine.  The bike was found with a broken fork, but no trace of a portion of the rifle or the strychnine has been found.
