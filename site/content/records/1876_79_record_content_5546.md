Editorial on the Health Rate.

At the last meeting, Council made no decision re a Health Rate. The editor urges the need for one and says that however imperfect the expenditure has been, an improvement has been made in the town's arrangements and further improvements are needed rather than abolition of the rate. The only ones who have not benefited by the rate are those (very few) who have gardens or possess a horse and cart and can by either of these means dispose of their own waste. Our plan is to have a man with horse and dray at say, Â£140 p.a. to be employed fulltime and having fixed days for certain streets and with the time not so dedicated to clear vacant lands, waterways, etc. He would take everything, ashes, dust, bones, rags, manure etc.

The Waterworks. The intimation of the Commissioner to the deputation on Friday that wherever the Govt. supplies house-to-house water they will impose a water rate, will make our townsfolk the more determined to oppose such a scheme as such would not be required by at most a bare majority and should not be paid for by all. We hope a similar plan to that already indicated by us may yet be adopted. [i.e. a user only pays scheme]

The Rabbit Act will be strictly enforced on and after 1 Feb.

Kingston St Bridge. It is gratifying to learn that the Govt will supplement the whole of the expenditure on the new Kooringa Bridge; else it would have swallowed the whole of next year's funds.
