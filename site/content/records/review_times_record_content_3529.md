The Coppertown Festival in Burra at the weekend saw the streets overflowing with visitors.  Police reported no problems.  The Burra Show was the most successful for years.  It featured blade shearing demonstrations.  The Cavalcade of Cars was a highlight and was won by Mr Barry Allen of Wallaroo with his 1926 Chrysler.  Many people dressed in period costume for the street procession, which finished near the bank of the creek where the annual regatta of the Burra Yacht Club drew the crowds.  On Monday the Gulf Road re-enactment started its three week journey from Burra to Pt Wakefield.  The performance of Sheâ€™ll Be Riot by Flinders University Drama students in the Redruth Gaol was a success.
