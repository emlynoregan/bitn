Seaside Trip to Henley last Saturday.  Some 800 took advantage of the cheap fares to spend a day at the beach or in the city.  The weather was excellent.  One boy was left behind, but E.W. Crewes made arrangements to pay his fare on Monday morning if necessary and a gentleman gave him accommodation.  The numbers leaving from Burra prevented passengers from south of Farrell’s Flat joining.
