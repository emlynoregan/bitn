The Anzac Commemoration Service at Burra War Memorial was attended by a fair number on Sunday afternoon.  Many stayed in their cars due to the bad weather.  Rev. John Stephenson conducted the service. The Pt Pirie Pipe Band led a march of some 20 ex-servicemen.  Wreaths were laid by Mayor E.T. Baulderstone, Cr. G.R. Finch for the DC, Mr T.R. Rogers for the RSL and Mr P. Williams for Demobilised Soldiers.  The Anzac Church Service this year was held at St Mary’s Anglican Church.  Mr Geoffrey Dare conducted the service with Rev. Stephenson playing the organ.  Mr Norrell Baynes and Rev. Milton Edwards read lessons and Rev. Edwards preached the sermon.
