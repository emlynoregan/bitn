Mr Young followed this speech with some encouraging remarks.

The Mayor responded.  He was sure there was plenty of ore to be found.  He had arrived in Burra in 1847 and was the oldest resident; he had been in Burra during the strike and thought that Bunt’s shaft would be a good place to start and that Beck’s would also be profitable.

Mr Gall thanked the Mayor.

The main problem was raising capital in SA.

The official party left by the 3.30 p.m. train.
