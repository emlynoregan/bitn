Burra School Welfare Club held its 7th AGM.

President Mrs Jennison reported 35 members with an average attendance of 20.  Mr Davis as head teacher was replaced by Mr Rice after the latter had served several years’ military duty.  During the year the Club bought some sporting equipment for the school and a nice set of encyclopaedias.  So many patriotic functions were held last year by other groups that we decided against an end-of-year concert.  The usual party for students was organised for 16 December.  The financial statement by Mrs Dollman showed a credit balance of £13-9-6.  Elected were President, Mrs Jennison; Vice-Presidents Mesdames A. Ford & S. Scroop; Secretary, Mrs R. Bernhardt; Assistant Secretary, Mrs A.L. Clode and Treasurer & War Savings Secretary, Mrs G. Dollman.  A school concert is planned for early in the year.
