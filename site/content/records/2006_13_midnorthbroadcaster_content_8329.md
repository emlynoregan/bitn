Burra Tourism Precinct

Goyder Council has voted to support the proposed Burra Tourism Precinct as presented at the last Council meeting.  The plan was presented by Chris Reed and developed by a group of Burra residents.  It aims to develop the Council-owned tourism assets and bring them under the umbrella of a community-based board.  The current situation shows no strategic direction for such assets as Paxton Square, the Burra Caravan Park, Morphett’s Engine House and the Brewery Cellars.  The assets also suffer from a fragmented approach to long term maintenance.  This has not been helped by Council amalgamation, which has tended to disengage the local community.  The proposal would see the management of the above assets and the Burra Visitor Centre centralised to the old Bible Christian Chapel and controlled by a ‘Burra Foundation’.  This body would then seek investment across government, private and corporate sectors.  Long term lease arrangements for the properties would be established and an appointment process for the board would be set up.  A more sustainable management program for the town’s tourism assets would be developed.  A public meeting of ratepayers would ensure members of the community were able to express their views and to be informed.  There is a need to solve the problem of the outstanding $200,000 debt on Paxton Square Cottages, as the Burra Community Group would not accept responsibility for its repayment.
