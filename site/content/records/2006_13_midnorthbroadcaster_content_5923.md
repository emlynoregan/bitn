Goyder Council

Two Burra Ward Councillors have spoken out against the Council’s handling of Burra’s future; especially the destruction of Burra’s tourism assets by selling off items to private enterprise.  The proposed sale of Burra Caravan Park and the handling of the Paxton Square Cottages question has angered Cr Adrian Gill who says the fate of the town is being decided by Councillors representing wards outside of Burra.  He is contemplating resigning from Council.  Cr Peter Reilly echoed Cr Gill’s sentiments.  The sale of the Burra Caravan Park was supported by Crs Mattey, Mosey, Partington, Pfitzner and Bradley and opposed by Crs Peter Reilly and Adrian Gill.

The Caravan Park operates at a profit, but there is pressure to upgrade facilities and services.  CEO John Brak said Council had taken the responsible decision to review its business operation and determine its value and market position prior to making any long term decisions.  This had included calling for expressions of interest in the transfer from the Council of the business assets (or part thereof), though not the ownership of the land.
