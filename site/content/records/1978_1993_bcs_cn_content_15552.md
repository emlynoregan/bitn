After congratulating teams, coaches and award winners President David Kellock noted with some concern that membership had fallen by 34 to 135.  The costs of running the club were astronomical.  The club had a turnover of $47,000 in 1987 and had a current balance of $6,600, which was barely enough to start the 1988 season.
