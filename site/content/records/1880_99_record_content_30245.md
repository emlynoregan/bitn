Burra Town Council.

Mr Henderson will be billed £1-12-9 for the tree guards destroyed when his horse bolted in Kingston St recently.

Letter from W.H. Hardy asking whether Council has given the Cricket Club authority to charge ratepayers 6d admission and also asking whether Council can legally do so while the ratepayers pay for maintenance etc.

Cr Davies objected to the ratepayers being charged.  Cr O’Leary would rather the Council paid for the pitch etc. and make no charge to allcomers.

The Town Clerk said he had given the Cricket Club authority to charge 6d until the pitch was paid for.

There has been no response from the government re the Waterworks.

Two accounts were sent in from the Deputation to the Commissioner and after some discussion they were passed for payment.

Council has refused to take over responsibility for the Jubilee Fountain from the Committee of the Jubilee Fountain Fund.

Retiring Councillors.

Cr Davies was balloted to retire from North Ward.

Cr Harris retires from East Ward.

Cr Pearce retires from West Ward.

Cr Morris also retires from East Ward as he is leaving the district.
