E.W. Crewes writes on 22 March to correct a mistake that appeared in the paper report of 21 March on the death of Richard Tyler where it said he had a cheque on him for £37-17-6.  This was actually the amount owed in wages and was handed to Constable Cyvis* the following day at Mt Gipps Station.

[* Note that the report in the paper of 21 March has ‘Pyvis’ as the constable’s name.]
