E.A. Fox of Melbourne & Mr Wilson of Sydney are aiming to open an asbestos factory at Robertstown.  The mines are on the property of Mr A. Ruediger at Robertstown and are large deposits.  The deposit has been worked before, but not in the correct way.  It is blue asbestos.  A factory of 10 acres is possible to make millboard, brake linings, gaskets etc.  Considerable capital has to be raised first.
