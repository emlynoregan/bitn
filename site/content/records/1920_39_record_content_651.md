Burra Bowls Club.  The green was opened last Saturday by S.J. Jacobs, President of the Sa Bowling Association.  The Mayor, S.M. Lane, and acting Mayoress Mrs E.F. Marston and the President of the Club Mr A.G. Gebhardt attended along with other dignitaries.  Bowls has taken on, especially with businessmen in the town.  The game seems to have taken on quickly and is a major topic of local conversation.  At 6 p.m. every evening people troop to the green.  On the western side are two beautiful croquet lawns and the Burra Ladies’ Croquet Club is as established as the bowls club.  Mr Gebhardt said he and Mr C.D. Wilkinson had contemplated a bowling club six years ago, but the war had broken out and the whole matter had been shelved, but as soon as it was over they set to work.  A site was procured – then covered with ruins.  500 loads of stuff had to be taken away.  He hoped soon that lights could be installed for night games.  Mr Jacobs said there were now 22 city clubs and 13 in the country.  Mrs E.F. Marston set up the first bowl with an excellent shot only a few inches from the kitty.  Mrs E. Bertram hit the first ball for the croquet club.  The results are printed in a report of just less than 1 column.
