Central Board of Health [Mainly re Copperhouse & Nelson]

Inspector Thomas Farrell of the Central Board visited the District Council of Burra, also constituting the Local Board of Health.  J.D. Cave is the District Clerk and Inspector.  Slaughtering premises have been visited and improved where needed.  Copperhouse is the only populous centre in the DC.  It contains 30 houses and has a population of c. 130.  The privy cesspits are holes sunk into the ground from 24” to 6’.  Nightsoil is disposed of in gardens attached to premises.  There are 15 wells used for drinking water and domestic purposes.  The wells average 40’ deep and are timber lined.  The nearest cesspit is 40’ away and most are 65’.  Some improvements are needed in the paving and draining at the premises of John Nickles, a milk seller at Copperhouse.  30 Children attend the school.  The privy cesspit there does not conform to the Health Act and there is no urinal for boys.

Premises occupied by Forder Bros [At Nelson] are also in need of improvement.  40 cows are kept and milk sent regularly to Broken Hill by rail.  The milking shed should be properly paved and drained with a receptacle for manure and animal refuse.  The surroundings of premises occupied by Henry Mill, milk seller of Firewood Creek, were also unsatisfactory.

Most piggeries and slaughterhouses were clean and well kept though at the slaughterhouse of Richard Austin the blood pit had been left full of offensive liquid.  The premises of Matthew Symons, butcher, need to be cleaned of bones and other garbage and tainted fat removed at least twice a week in summer.  Similar improvements are needed around Rabbich & Sons premises.  [Both these places had a piggery.]  The position of the latter slaughterhouse is low-lying and poorly drained.
