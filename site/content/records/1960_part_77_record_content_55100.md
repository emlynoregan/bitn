Obituary.  Former Burra Hotel licensee Mrs King Grubb has been killed in a car accident near Horsham in Victoria.  The Hamilton Spectator reported the accident on 23 February.  Two Hamilton people were killed in a car smash near Horsham on Friday.  They were not wearing seat belts and were thrown from the car.  Two others in the car were wearing seat belts and survived.  Killed were Terrence Atholstone Cowley (45) and Aileen Jean Grubb (50).  The car collided with one driven by Harold Roy Bailey of Goroke, the occupants of which escaped with minor injuries.  Mr & Mrs Grubb held the licence for the Hotel Hamilton, but it is understood it changed hands recently.
