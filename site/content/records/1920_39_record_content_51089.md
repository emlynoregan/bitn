Empire Day Observations at the Primary & High Schools, ending in the usual half-holiday for students, are reported in about ¾ column.  The day was an opportunity for parents and friends to visit the school and observe student’s work and the school program as well as to hear the patriotic speeches that went with it.  The Mayor was disappointed that so few took the opportunity to do so.
