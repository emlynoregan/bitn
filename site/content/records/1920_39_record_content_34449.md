Miss E.R. Bubb who has been a resident for 14 years is leaving Burra at the end of the month to live in Sydney.  She came to Burra as Matron of the Redruth Girls’ Reformatory and held the position till it was closed.  She then purchased ‘Owenyilla’ in Kooringa which she has run as a guest home.  She has also been busy in patriotic, philanthropic and church affairs.  She was President of the Soldiers’ Aid Society, later the General Aid Society and has headed a loyal band of workers aiding the Royal Institution for the Blind.  Unless some public spirited lady comes forward the General Aid Society is likely to be disbanded.
