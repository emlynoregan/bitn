Two New Sanctuaries

Mr Robin Store, Wildlife Officer from National Parks & Wildlife visited Burra last week and erected two ‘Sanctuary’ signs on areas of native grasslands.  They signify that the owners are interested in conservation management.  The signs went up on Thorogood’s Cider Farm and at Ford’s Corner, the home of Bob Skinner and Glenys Christopher.
