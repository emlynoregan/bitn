Migration.  More Burra people will be in Broken Hill than in Burra if the current trends continue.

Broken Hill & Mt Gambier Railways are both to be handed over to the Government by the contractors on 1 June.

Jubilee Exhibition.  Express trains will run each way between Adelaide and Terowie as well as ordinary trains, during the exhibition.

Floods.  It is estimated that 12,000 square miles of SA is under water south of Birdsville.

A letter calls for work, not charity, as the latter often does not get to those that need it most.
