Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk is to get details of the operation of the Balaklava Fire Brigade.

Cr Treloar was doubtful of the adequacy of the water supply and felt people in the back streets would be taxed to support the brigade with little chance it could save their properties.

Cr Radford pointed out the need for a sinking fund.

The Town Clerk said a 1d rate would be more than adequate.

The Overseer recommended a concrete spoon drain at the Kooringa Hotel.

Burraâ€™s field gun has been despatched from Melbourne.
