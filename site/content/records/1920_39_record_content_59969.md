Burra Cycling & Athletic Club held its AGM at the Fire Station on Wednesday evening.  In the past year the club had been quite active, with several road races. Their Boxing Day Sports had been successful.  A handsome trophy had been given by H. Mumme for the rider gaining highest points and another by Alex Bevan for the rider with the fastest time.  Mr Rex Opperman won both and by mutual consent of the two donors it was decided to present one good trophy.  This (a walnut clock with a luminous face) was then presented to Rex Opperman.  Income for the year was £73-18-0 and expenditure was £60-2-7.  There was a little over £14 in hand.  Elected were: President, C.V. Preiss, Vice-President, M.J. Morton; Secretary, R.A. Bevan and Treasurer, Mr Thomson.

The club has undertaken to assist in every way with the sports to take place in October next in connection with the State Centenary celebrations.  It will also take charge of the Anzac Sports on 2 May.
