Rent, Drought & Squatters’ Profits

‘X.Y.Z.’ writes from Ketchowla, 1 December

This run is assessed to carry 21,600 sheep and the rent and assessment is £354-13-4.  For the best season we have seen it carried 11,500 sheep.

The 1864 lambing was a fair one and 15,200 sheep of all descriptions passed through the shearing shed and then the number was immediately reduced to 12,000 – what I consider to be the carrying capacity.  From 1 September 1864 to 1 September 1865 1,850 sheep died or were killed by wild dogs and with what we used for rations the number was about 10,000 at the 1865 shearing.

Immediately after the shearing the number was reduced to 4,650.

From 1 September 1865 to 1 November 1865 another 780 died, so the total loss 1 September 1864 to 1 November 1865 was 2,630 besides the whole of the year’s increase.  Despite the low numbers left deaths are continuing at about 20 per week as this hot dry weather continues.

Averaging the sheep numbers from September 1863 to September 1865 the rent for each sheep is nearly 7d p.a. and the sheep will yield 3½ lb of wool at 7½d per lb.  The rent is thus about 30%.

But with only 4,300 sheep left at present the rent is about 1/8 per sheep – equal to the entire income from wool after paying shearing expenses.  In fact in seasons like this the expenses of carrying on the station are quite double the value of the wool produced.
