‘An Old Burra Miner’ writes to the editor:

With news of the stoppage of the Burra Mine many readers may be under the impression that this source of wealth is exhausted.  Most of the ground in the richest portion of the mine has undoubtedly been worked, in some instances over and over again.  Still, there are many places where there is payable ore and so it is surprising to hear of its being closed down, especially when in new areas the lodes have not been followed in the lower areas of the mine.  At 70 fathoms a splendid lode bears away towards the Burra Hotel and Princess Royal Mine.  The excuse for the stoppage is the expense of keeping the mine dewatered.  ‘The mine could only be kept clear of water at the 70 fathoms level by two large engines, involving the outlay of £100 a week each.’

One engine was stopped and the water allowed to rise to the level maintained by one engine.  Considering the large dividends paid it is surprising how few trial shafts have been sunk – not more than three or four in an area of about ten square miles.

The Princess Royal Mine is now at work and yielding excellent returns to a small party of miners.

The wells of the Burra Hotel and neighbourhood have lost their water as the mine has been deepened, indicating the lie of the land.  Cost saving could be effected by the use of machinery in ore dressing – the machinery at the mine being very meagre.
