Accident/Obituary

Arthur Killicoat was killed in an accident at Gepps Cross level crossing when run down by a train.  He was the son of Mrs M. Killicoat of St Peters and the late Philip Killicoat of Abberton Park Redruth.  He was born at Burra and educated at Burra School and St Peter’s College.  Later he became an engineering apprentice at May’s Works, Gawler and then for BHP at Broken Hill.  He was at a course in Greenock, Scotland, when the Great War broke out and he enlisted in Lord Lovett’s Scouts and then got a commission in the Royal Scots attached to the Irish Fusiliers in Mesopotamia.  After the war he married a Scots lady, returned to SA and joined the firm of Silver & Killicoat in North Adelaide.  His wife and two little sons only recently left for a holiday in Scotland.  J.C. Killicoat of Kooringa is a brother and Mrs N.H. Pearse of ‘The Gums’ is a sister.  The crossing is near the Abattoirs [Pooraka] and Mr Killicoat was in a closed Morris-Cowley car watching one train coming in and did not see one coming from the opposite direction.  The car was completely wrecked.

[Arthur Lander Killicoat born 29 November 1887 at Redruth: died 12 July 1927 at Dry Creek, residence St Peters.  His wife was born Helen McMaster Hutchison.]
