At the last meeting of the Mid North Football League the President Mr Stan Noske was granted Life Membership.  The clubs reported on their individual consideration of the future.

Robertstown wished to stay with the Mid North League.

Mintaro-Manoora had not changed its decision to seek affiliation with the North Eastern League.
