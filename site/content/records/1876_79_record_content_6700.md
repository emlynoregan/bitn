Letter to the Editor from Robert Sanders, Cooper's Creek, Gippsland, Victoria, 23 June 1879. He endorses the idea of boring for water to supply Kooringa. He warns of the possibility of missing water even though close to a supply. The eastern side of the Mine he says is full of water at shallow depths and fully 1,000 gallons a minute was constantly entering the Mine from the east and to the north of the stable yard. He believes it would be injudicious to place the bore west of the Burra Creek. [Mainly because he thought that if the Mine was reopened and unwatered the well would go dry.] His favoured site would be near Mr Symons' fence above the springs on the cemetery creek. [He then gives geological data to support his reasons for that site.]
