The Opening of the Northern Extension Railway to Burra

The date of Monday 29 August for this celebration was largely chosen for the convenience of MPs whose legislative duties would have prevented their attendance on the four succeeding days.  The arrangements for the celebrations was entirely in the hands of a local committee of some 30-40 members chaired by Mr W.H. Rosman the manager of the National Bank in Kooringa.  A considerable sum was raised to make the occasion a success.   The railways provided a special train and the Commissioner of Public Works provided for free travel for invited guests and their lady companions, which ensured a greater influx of women than would otherwise have been expected. In the morning two trains were provided.  The one was a special and the other might be termed a select. The demand for seats on the first was so great that eight new and old carriages had to be pressed into service and the public was stowed away in them without respect to class.  The start had been announced for 7 a.m., but it got away at about 7.30 with between 300 and 400 passengers.  [A handful of them are named.]

The select train with the Vice-Regal and Ministerial party got away soon after 8 a.m.  [A list of the official party is printed.]

The Engineer-in-Chief drove the engine, which had been decorated with bunting and evergreens.   The state carriage had been brought out to accommodate the Vice-Regal party.    In the first two hours no accident occurred, but both trains were slow.  The special reached Gawler at 8.40 and left after ten minutes at a sedate speed.  It left Tarlee at 10.10 and was at Riverton at 10.30.  At 10.55 the select train arrived at Riverton and after a moments discussion it was decided to send the special on ahead.  Large crowds attended intervening stations to see the Governor and the Kooringa committee had pinned much of their hope for a grand occasion on his attendance.

At 12.45 p.m. the special reached the terminus.  The buildings here include a station, carriage and goods shed and their erection has imposed no great drain upon the loan for the line.

‘For the sake of the levels the locomotive track has been laid some four or five feet below the natural surface, and this where still remaining afforded admiral standing ground for the spectators.  Of these there was an amazingly large number assembled.  The Burra and neighbouring townships had by mutual consent proclaimed a public holiday, and the people were determined to make the best of it.  Whoever had been labouring under the delusion that the whole of the glory has departed from Kooringa should have an opportunity of seeing its aggregate population as it exhibited itself on Monday.  It was not a few feeble sallow-complexioned men, women, and children who turned out to pay their regards to the Governor and take their change in the gratification of private curiosity; but a host of strong, healthy-looking men, hearty matrons, rosy-cheeked damsels, and a reserve of children such as only a mining community can boast of.  Of course all the villages and locations within many miles of the place contributed to the crowd; but its chief explanation was to be found in the deserted aspect of Kooringa, Redruth, and Aberdeen.  Dilapidated as these townships now look, the closing of doors and shutters, and the banishment of the population from the streets, gave to them an unusually desolate air, although even this was relieved somewhat by the decorations spread out in prominent situations.  Veranda fronts were well nigh hidden under pine branches, and the housetops yielded a handsome crop of flags, many of them palpably new rigged for the occasion.  In Market Square stood a triple arch, inspiringly decked with foliage, and breathing through half a dozen different transparencies words of welcome to the Governor and loyalty to the Queen and country.  Across the main road in Aberdeen a second erection of similar character stood; while opposite his new railway store, Mr Tiver had hung out a line of streamers to dry.  In Ludgovan-street [sic] Redruth, Mr Davey, of the Court-House Hotel, had at his own expense built a really tasteful arch handsomely festooned with evergreens, and adorned with banners and mottoes.  It was intended as a rival to the Aberdeen Arch, and in point of looks was decidedly its superior, although its dimensions were smaller.  But to return to the terminus.  Not only were all the platforms and available standing ground near the station adorned with pine and wattle boughs, but the various buildings were set off with a bewildering display of evergreens, which might have been Birnam Wood come back to Dunsenane, [sic] as in the days of Macbeth.  The Goods Shed had clothed itself in evergreen till it looked a monster bower – size 100 feet by 40 feet, and the Carriage Shed had blossomed into festive vegetation on a smaller scale.  Its decoration had absorbed half a dozen good truckloads of material sent up from Wasley’s [sic] Station, while the Goods Shed, besides receiving its contingent from this distant forest of small trees, had occasioned havoc among the trees for 15 miles round.  Fair hands had not been excluded from the pleasant task of preparing a welcome for the visitors extraordinary.  Flags and streamers testified to their industry and all the colours of the rainbow vouched for the catholicity of the local taste.  Inside and outside adornments were to be found, all resolving themselves into an effort to produce the most tasteful effect with the materials at command.  There were wreaths of pine foliage, standards of pines and wattle boughs on the exterior, and flags and other decorations on the interior.  The responsibility of the decorations belongs to Messrs Roberts and Ridgway whose zeal has been rewarded with great scenic effect.  It has already been stated that the special train drew up at the station at a quarter to 1 o’clock.  At 1 precisely the select carriages arrived and through one section of the crowd, which, all told, could not have fallen much below 3,000, His Excellency and party were conducted to a special reserve adjoining the cattle platform.  After the spontaneous loyalty of the people had relieved itself in a round of cheers, and the local ordnance had fired an irregular salute Mr W.H. Rosman read and presented . . .’

[The following address.  To which His Excellency replied.   Mr W.H. Challoner JP presented an address on behalf of the Justices to which His Excellency also replied.]

‘The luncheon took place as arranged in the Goods Shed, which was most elaborately decorated for the occasion with flags and evergreens, and around the walls there were a number of appropriate mottoes suspended, including: “A Loyal Welcome to Sir James and Lady Edith Fergusson”, “Advance Australia”, “Science, the Handmaid of Commerce”, Capital and Labour Develop Our Resources”, The Flag on which the Sun Never Sets”, Our Staple Products – Wool Wheat, and Copper”, “There’s a Good Time”.  The Concordia Band was stationed close by and during the progress of the meal, as well as at intervals between the speeches, played a variety of musical selections.  The arrangements for the luncheon were entrusted to Mrs Lamb of the Burra Hotel, and they gave general satisfaction.  At the close of the luncheon His Excellency was driven round to take a hasty view of the townships.  At 20 minutes to 5 o’clock the select special train left Redruth [sic], followed, at no long interval, by the main train.

[On the journey to Adelaide a most unfortunate accident occurred and it is reported in detail in another section of the paper.]
