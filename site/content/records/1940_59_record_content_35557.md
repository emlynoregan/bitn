Burra Cricket Association, conclusion of the semi-final between Burra and Koonoona.

Koonoona 120 & 281 defeated Burra 67 & 168

Koonoona and the Buffs will now meet in the final next Saturday.

A general cricket meeting called for last Thursday to consider arrangements for a new cricket pitch and the Easter Carnival had to be abandoned as so few attended.  It has since been decided that a new pitch will be put down by voluntary labour and all cricketers are asked to lend a hand at the working bees.
