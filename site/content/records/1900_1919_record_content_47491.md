Ray Carter, Hon. Sec. Of the Black Springs Hall writes to say that Red Cross had enjoyed free use of the hall for about 10 months and he had offered to pay £2-2-0 towards the cost of the hall, leaving them to find just £1-3-0 for the use of it till 1 July 1917.  As for the Red Cross ladies support of the hall before the war – they had supplied supper on two occasions in four years!  He goes on to explain the situation further.
