Burra Show was held on Saturday in excellent weather.  Sideshows were numerous, but mostly on similar lines, because the boxing troupe’s conveyance broke down en route and there were none of the more exciting sideshows like merry-go-rounds etc.

Machinery and car exhibits were very numerous.

1,600 paid at the gates and there were 365 members’ tickets admitting three people each to give a total attendance of over 2,500.

Entries were a record 2,135.

Cookery entries were up nearly 100%.

Art and craft entries were down.

Fleeces were about the same as last year.

Produce was very attractive.

Bouquet and fodder entries were about the same while cut flowers were better due to the better weather conditions.

Needlework was of superb quality.

Sheep entries were numerous with keen competition.

Sheaf-tossing attracted nine entries and was won by Bruce Stockman with 33 ft.

Ring entries were popular and in excess of last year.

Sideshow men complained of poor business and one said he had made a profit of £100 in 1952, but would be lucky to break even this year.  A similar lack of profits has been reported from other shows.

Entries in sections: Art 29, Poultry & Birds 708, Cattle 31, Cookery 168, Dogs 26, Flowers 297, Bouquets 75, Fresh Fruit 7, Grain & Fodder 36, Horses 350, Needlework 170, Produce 42, Sheep 170, Vegetables 42, Wool 47.
