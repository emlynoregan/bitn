Local Board of Health

Cr Jeffery raised the issue of the disgusting practices of certain individuals in the shelter shed on the road to Aberdeen, saying the stench was dreadful and an absolute disgrace.

The usefulness of a notice was discussed, and dismissed as was the suggestion that Councillors keep watch.  Council ordered a clean-up with stringent action to be taken if further offenders were caught.
