Mid North Group Training Scheme began operating in December 1989.  Manager Gary Donaldson says it was designed to help young people gain skills through apprenticeships and traineeships.  Three locals are currently benefiting:

Jodi-mai Allard of Booborowie is working in administration at the Burra Hospital as a clerical trainee.

Shane Brouwer of Burra is an apprentice fitter and turner with off-the-job training at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Salisbury.

Nick Jones of Mt Bryan has a farming apprenticeship and is currently employed by Barry Holdings at Willowie.
