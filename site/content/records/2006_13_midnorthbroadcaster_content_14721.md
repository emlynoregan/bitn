Camping at Princess Royal

A large group of members of the Australian CamperTrailers Group will enjoy a weekend of camping at Princess Royal 18-20 May.  About 40-50 campers will attend.  The group is a non profit organisation started in 2001 and provides a place for members to chat free of commercial advertising or promotions.  On average members mostly live in Queensland, NSW and Victoria and most have full-time jobs.  They are members of a 4WD club and have been camper-trailering for one to five years, having upgraded after camping with a tent.  They prefer to bush camp with minimum amenities.  Here they will be hosted by Mike and Leonie Fretwell, who are two of only a few SA members.  They purchased their first camper trailer 22 years ago and at the time were very much the odd ones out.
