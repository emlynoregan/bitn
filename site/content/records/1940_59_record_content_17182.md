The Mayor said they had to face the fact that sooner or later they would have to take over the Institute.  Councillors were generally in favour of taking over the Institute provided reasonable terms could be obtained and it was resolved that the Town Clerk ascertain from the State Bank whether the rate could be reduced to 4Â½% it the Council took over the loan.
