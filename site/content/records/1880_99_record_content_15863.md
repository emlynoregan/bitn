Rechabite Sports Demonstration, Boxing Day, 26 December.

There was a somewhat dusty northwest wind.  A procession in regalia led by the Burra Brass Band went from the Institute up Commercial St and back to Market Square and thence to the grounds about 5 miles south of the town by all sorts of vehicles.  Catering was by W. Geake.  A large marquee was provided.  C. 700-800 attended.  A Grand Entertainment followed in the Institute in the evening.

Sports results are printed.
