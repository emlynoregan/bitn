Burra Burra Show Inc.  Show held on 30 October

Perfect weather increased the gate.  The railcar from Adelaide was fairly well patronised.  The grounds and surroundings were in excellent condition. The numerous sideshows were popular.

Art and photography improved this year.

In Birds there was a record of over 600, but most were from visiting poultry fanciers.  This far exceeded the capacity to display and judge them and conditions need to be improved.

Cattle were not numerous, but some fair entries were seen.

The quality of cooking entries was high.

Dogs were few.

The flower display was large and filled ¾ of the large pavilion.  Of special note were the sweet peas from Mr R. Harris and J.G. Carpenter.

Fruit was a small section dominated by outside entrants.

Local entries in grain and fodder were few, but the quality was high.

Draught stock was good, but in Blood Stock only T.H. Villis had entries.

The ring events were good as usual.

Needlework was excellent and smallgoods from Aberg & Son were very creditable.

Sheep exhibits did not reflect the district’s importance.

The competition in fleeces here is the best outside Adelaide, though the judge said many fleeces were out of type or entered in the wrong class.

The schoolwork was commendable, though there being so few entries from Burra Primary School was a disappointment.
