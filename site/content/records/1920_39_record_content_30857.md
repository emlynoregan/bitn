‘Ratepayer’ writes saying that despite the motion passed in Council both guns were placed at the south end of Commercial St ‘to the astonishment of the council and to the great sorrow of the relatives and friends of the brave boys who gave their lives for King and Country’.  Who was responsible?  The writer then calls for their return to Market Square.
