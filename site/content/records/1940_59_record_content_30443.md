Burra Rifle Club.  After nearly six years in recess the club had its first practice shoot last Saturday with a 10 shot match from 300 yards.  Ron Kellock top scored followed by Tom Heinrich.  A number of new members came out.  The secretary R.G. Bernhardt asks all VDC members who had .303 rifles issued to them to contact him as soon as possible.  There will be a shoot over 200 & 300 yards next Saturday.
