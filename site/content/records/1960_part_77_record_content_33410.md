Halbury School students visited Burra last Friday.  The President of the Burra National Trust Mr Stan Woollacott showed the party over the Museum, after which they visited the Bon Accord Shaft and Engineerâ€™s Shop, at the invitation of Mr Joe Edwards.  They then went on to the Mine area, the old Redruth Gaol and other places of interest.  Mr Ian Auhl outlined the story of the Mine and of the historic buildings.  Teamsters from Burra were often bogged near Halbury en route to Pt Wakefield and later a corduroy road of split pine logs was laid across this boggy section.  Some 40 adults accompanied the students and some of the farmers among them said the old bullock tracks across their properties are still well defined, as wheat does not grow as tall along the 100-year-old tracks as in the rest of the crop.
