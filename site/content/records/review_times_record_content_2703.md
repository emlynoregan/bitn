Burra SES Branch had fallen to six members when a meeting was called last Wednesday.  Fifteen people attended and the unanimous decision was made to continue.  A recruitment drive will now be held.  Interim Director is Steve Woolley.  Female members were encouraged.  There would also be a drive for funds.  The SESâ€™s Landcruiser was fairly old and a new four wheel drive vehicle was needed.  Other emergency rescue equipment had also fallen into disrepair.  In the future there would be regular meetings on Thursday nights.
