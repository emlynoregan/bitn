I will not say no one has done more for SA, but I will say no one has served it more sincerely and devotedly.

‘It is now within a few days of six years since I first stood on this spot, entrusted by the Directors with the responsible duty of fixing the boundaries of the Special Survey.’

No director has devoted more time and attention, or worked more zealously to promote the prosperity of the men than the humble individual now soliciting your suffrages.

[He then goes on at some length to attack Mr Lang, who had come out as his opponent until discovering that he could not be simultaneously a legislator and a magistrate.  He also attacks Lang as a magistrate, calling attention to his inconsistencies in sentencing; ‘today, a burglar’s violence in the dead of night is punished by a fine of a few shillings; to-morrow, a misdemeanour is visited with imprisonment and hard labour.’]

Then came Mr Mildred, who has tried his fortune in almost every constituency; Port, East Torrens, Gawler & Stanley, Barossa and Port Lincoln.  Rejected in his own neighbourhood, he came to seek the votes of electors in Kooringa.  His own district of East Torrens has this last week been in need of a candidate, but no one there has proposed Mr H. Mildred.

[Kingston then goes on at length to describe how Mr Mildred infiltrated by means of an alias, the group of gentlemen who formed an association meeting at the Adelphi in London in 1834, to promote the establishment of SA.  He says Mildred did nothing to help the cause, but positioned himself to benefit when the obstacles to establishing the colony had been overcome.  He says he was a speculator.]

The requisition calling on me to stand bears the signatures of the Directors Messrs Paxton, Sanders, & Beck and of Mr Ayers.  These men would hardly do this, or elect me to a seat on their own Councils if I was the weak and talentless individual the opposition would have you believe.
