Accident/Obituary

While the special train conveying the Governor and party was on its way to Adelaide, and not long after leaving Farrell’s Flat, the engine-driver saw a man lying across the line, about 150 yards ahead.  Utterly unable to check the train in time, he sounded the whistle repeatedly; but without effect.  The passengers heard the signal, and looked out to discover the cause, but it was not until the engine had been brought to a standstill at a distance of three or four hundred yards from the body that the real state of the case became known.  The train was at once driven back, and followed by His Excellency and the greater part of the male passengers Mr Mais proceeded to the scene of the accident.  The body, which was now lying off the rails, presented a frightful appearance, one side of the forehead being absolutely smashed in, and other wounds being visible.  Blood was flowing copiously, and the poor fellow, although alive, was utterly insensible.
