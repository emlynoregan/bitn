District Roads.  Answers to question in Parliament.

Traffic densities justify the sealing of Main Road 140 from Burra to Booborowie.  Preconstruction activities will mean this is not expected to commence before 1969-70.

The Burra-Morgan Road will be developed to open surface standard over a period of years.  $20,000 has been provided to begin work.  This is not a high priority and work on the Morgan end will now commence in 1970-71.

When the Burra section is complete work on the Robertstown section will begin, but this is not likely before 1970-71.  Over the next five years it is expected $20,000 will be available annually for work in the Burra District.  From 1969-70 $50,000 p.a. should be available for the Morgan area.

Burra Caravan Park.  The Minister of Tourism has advised of a grant of up to $162 on a dollar for dollar basis for six additional power points for caravans in the Burra Caravan Park.

Burra Town Hall Floor.  It is anticipated the new floor surface will be completed by the middle of this month.

Bryan Keatley showed slides of his experiences of National Service in Vietnam to Spalding Rural Youth.  Bryan was formerly active in Spalding Rural Youth.

Bungaree Ewe Sale.  The 6th Annual Ewe Sale was held at Burra on Wednesday 28th August.  [Prices are listed.]
