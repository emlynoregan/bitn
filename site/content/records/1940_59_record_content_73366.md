Weather.  With a recording of 428 points June was the wettest June for 40 years, since 559 points in 1916.  Creek have been running strongly and peaked on Thursday evening.  The small creek that crosses the Adelaide Road near the end of the bitumen ran a banker and stopped traffic.  The crossing at Gully’s Wharf was also running strongly and was still running well on Sunday.  On Saturday afternoon a driver got into difficulties on the way to Terowie at the Gully’s Wharf crossing and Mr Stan Irlam was asked to help move the car through the water.  Once it was across to the other side the driver went on without so much as a ‘thanks’.
