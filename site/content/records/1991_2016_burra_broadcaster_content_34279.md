Letter.  Sue Ryan of BRTBA writes on Peter Kelly’s application for an industrial site.  BRTBA strongly supports the introduction of a wider range of businesses in the town.  They congratulate Peter Kelly on his initiative and are confident it would be successful, but BRTBA believes it could be better placed.  BRTBA has written to the Council to ask them to investigate the establishing of a light industrial zone.  While acknowledging this is not a simple matter, BRTBA does not believe it should be placed in the too hard basket.
