Unveiling the Honour Roll

The Burra & District Honour Roll is a handsome piece of polished Tasmanian Blackwood surmounted by a heavily moulded canopy supported by round carved pillars.  There are seven panels and the roll is 9ft high and 11 ft 6 ins across.  The contractors were C.J. Pearce & Son of Kooringa.

A large number gathered on 19 March to see the Governor Sir Tom Bridges unveil the roll.  The Vice-Regal Party arrived by the midday train and was met at the railway station by the Mayor, Mr M. Collins and Mrs Collins.  The Governor was accompanied by Flight Lieut. G.C.A. Armstrong & Mrs Armstrong.  There was a mounted escort of the 23rd Light Horse under Lieut. Tom Fuller.  The party first inspected the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial then returned to the Institute where a guard of honour of about 100 returned men was assembled under Surgeon Major D.M. Steele and Lieut. L.M. Gordon.  There was then a civic reception in the Council Chamber.

The speeches of the Mayor and the Governor are then reported.

The Governor then unveiled the Honour Roll which held 600 names, 100 of which were starred to signify those who had died.  A minute’s silence for the fallen was observed.

Mr Hawkes then spoke to thank the Governor, making reference to Sir Henry Galway and Sir Archibald Weigall who had previously visited in connection with the war and its aftermath.  The Governor then met each returned man; introduced by Lieut. L.M. Gordon.

At 1 p.m. a grand banquet was held in the Institute Hall.  At the Vice-Regal table were the Mayor and Mayoress and the Chairmen of the District Councils of Mt Bryan (I.J. Warnes), Apoinga (W.G. Hawkes), Burra (N. Hiles Pearse), Hallett (T.E. Richards) & Hanson (F.G. Scholz) and also Mesdames Warnes, Hawkes & Pearse.  Mr E.W. Crewes, former Mayor of Burra, Lieut. L.M. Gordon (President of Burra RSL) and the secretary of the Honour Roll Committee, Mr G.H. Dow.

Toasts and speeches followed.

The Mayor presented the Governor with a jarrah paperweight surmounted by a polished cone-shaped piece of Burra malachite.

Lady Bridges received a brooch in malachite mounted in gold.  Both pieces were the work of Frank Spencer.  The Vice-Regal party also visited the Burra Mine and R.D. Pascoe’s stud sheep photograph collection before leaving by afternoon train for the city.
