I understand tenders have actually been called for repairs to our street, though the specifications suggest the job will be only half done.  The Board intends to start the work at the Burra Hotel and go as far as just beyond the creek opposite the Catholic Chapel, where it will stop, short of some 400 yards of the worst road in the whole township.  It commences again at Parks’ store, where the natural road is firm and dry, and then goes over the side of the hill past the Telegraph Office to Redruth.  It is a pity the Government persist in bungling such matters.

‘Here is a piece of road in the very centre of the main street, and which in winter is one yawning slough, left untouched by the Road Board, who, following the maxim of showing “how not to do it,” seem careful to bestow money and labour where least requires, while those places which seem actually begging for aid are entirely forsaken.’
