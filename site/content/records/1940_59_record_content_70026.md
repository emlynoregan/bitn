Burra War Memorial Committee, 26 September

The President H. Jennison presented the first report of the Committee, even though it had begun in 1947.  The then President was Mr L. Hawke, Secretary Mr C. Morrison and Treasurer Mr Reg. Davey.

The project was to remodel Victoria Park and its surroundings as a War Memorial.  Plans were drawn up by the late Mr Gunthorpe to alter and level the oval.  A subscription list was opened in the Record and many functions were held to raise the finance required.  The aid of the Town and District Councils was sought.  Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. were approached as to donating a portion of land near the Drill Hall, which they did and which was transferred to the Corporation and on this land we hope to have tennis courts at a later date, as finance permits.  A proposal was put to ratepayers at a meeting on 9 March 1948 to borrow £1,200 and that the Committee aimed to raise £3,000 for the War Memorial.  This proposal was authorised.  Tenders were then called for levelling the oval and forming a cycle track.  The successful tenderer was Mr F.L. Hogan of Booborowie for £850.  Many of the trees then at the oval were topped and others removed to widen it by five feet.  The dressing shed had to be halved to allow for the new cycle track and this was done by a working bee under the supervision of Mr Don Halliday, assisted by Messrs W. Carpenter, L. Kellaway, C. Pearce and members of the Committee.  The Burra Town Council supplied and planted an avenue of trees outside on the west side of the oval and these are coming on nicely.  The new oval was planted in cluster clover and couch grass.  Unfortunately only the clover took and we have again planted Kentucky Blue and hope it will take.  The general appearance of the oval today is quite good.

Mr Hawke resigned on 4 July 1950 on his transfer from the town.  Mr H. Jennison then became the President from 19 July 1950.  New trees and shrubs were planted on the inside surrounds of the oval by Mr E.T. Baulderstone and his Committee.  One thousand feet of ¾ inch pipe was laid by Mr J .Fisher to bring water to the oval and a new fence was erected around it.  I.J. Warnes & Sons kindly donated the top cables for this.  W. Carpenter & Son painted the posts, cables, gates and lavatories.  Seats were erected and a grandstand to seat c. 100 was erected on one side of the dressing shed.  The Corporation gravelled the track surrounding the oval and a plaque was cast and erected at the entrance gates.  The Burra Football Club fitted out the interior of the dressing shed, which is in two sections and has electric light and hot and cold showers.  Skylights have improved its lighting.  A basketball court was constructed by Mr S.J. Woollacott at no cost to the Committee.  Pipes were laid to the new court.  A suitable shed to serve afternoon teas etc. was purchased from the Mines Department at Mongolata for £60, dismantled and re-erected at the oval by Mr D. Jacka, S. Scroop and helpers.  It has been equipped by the Silver Spur Dance Club and Mr E.T. Baulderstone.  It is 32 ft by 9 ft.  Trees and shrubs have been planted by W. Carpenter around the new basketball court.  C.W. Pearce & Son spray painted the new shed with donated paint and a 400 gallon tank was purchased and erected.  There is still much to be done as finance permits.

[A long list of people who were thanked for their assistance is printed along with a balance sheet.]
