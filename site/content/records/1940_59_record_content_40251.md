Johnny Green.  The adoption of Johnny Green as a symbol by Minespa drinks has revived interest in the character whose image stands on a pole at the corner of the paddock near the Mine Bridge.  The figure used to stand on the poppet head at the mine until the building etc. was burnt down as a result of boys trying to smoke pigeons from the shaft beneath.

[Actually the boys were trying to smoke out rabbits from under the floor of the adjacent engine house according to the courts case evidence that followed.  See XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3.]

The late Mr Fred Pascoe later found the image and handed it to the Council.  Johnny was repaired by the overseer Mr H. Wilson and another employee and bolted in the present position on the property now owned by T.H. Villis.  It has recently been discussed in Council that Johnny Green could be made to earn money in the way the ‘Dog on the Tucker-Box’ does at Gundagai.  Consequently at the last meeting of Council it was resolved to take him down and place him in a suitable place with a wishing well in front.
