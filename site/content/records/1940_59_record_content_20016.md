Burra High School held its speech night just before Christmas at the Burra Institute.

The Headmaster, L.J. Easson said:

This year’s enrolment was unusually small, with only 14 new students compared with the usual 24 to 30.  It is estimated that there will be about 24 new scholars in 1945.  Social Science was a new subject introduced in First Year this year.  No exams were set, but this in no way detracted from the interest and enthusiasm shown by students.  Visits were paid to the Burra Record, Post Office, Burra Library and the Water Works Department.  Physical Education is limited by the lack of facilities.  We would be very restricted except for the permission from the Town Council allowing the use of Victoria Park.  Sports Day near the end of second term was a great success. In the Basketball Association formed this year the school team were premiers.  The annual trip to Riverton for Inter-High School Sports was an enjoyable outing, even though Burra did not secure the shield.  School Patriotic Fund Work was pursued steadily and there was solid investment in war savings certificates.  Murray Baulderstone gained a special award from the Salvage Commission.

Since the beginning of the year we have learned that Ken Fuller and Dudley Armstrong have been killed in action and Laurie Walker and my predecessor, Mr Lloyd Draysey, are both reported missing in action.  We extend our sympathy to relatives.

The House shield this year was won by Blue House.

Mr Easson outlined the benefits of moving from the Qualifying Certificate to the Progress Certificate from 1945.  The syllabus was less rigid and teachers could progress at more suitable rates for their students.  The work done through the year also counted.  There was less pressure on students and less dependence on success on one day of the year.

Dr Steele as Chairman of the High School Council spoke of the progress of the war and also of the rapid pace at which children today were growing up – too rapidly he thought – he hoped the youth would still have time ‘to act the goat’ before succumbing to the trials of the adult world.

Prizes were distributed.
