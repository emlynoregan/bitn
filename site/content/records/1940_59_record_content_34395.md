St Joseph’s School Annual Report

Enrolment on opening on 11 February was 39.  Much sickness reduced attendance in second term.   Father Kevin Dower visited on 22 April.  He was educated at St Joseph’s and in April Sister Lucy Dower made her Final Profession as a Carmelite Nun at the Convent Glen Osmond.

The Diocesan Inspector Rev. Dr Walsh visited on 17 & 18 June. On 20 September Dr Walsh the Diocesan Director of Catholic Education and Rev. Father Casey and the Mayor & Mayoress attended the 2nd Annual Sports Day on the school grounds. The annual inspection by Mr McDonald on 23 October was very satisfactory.  Progress certificates were awarded to John Samuel, Mary Priest & Joan Fisher.

Music results are printed.
