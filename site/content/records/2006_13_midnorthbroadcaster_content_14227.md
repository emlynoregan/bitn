Fossil Festival Turns 10

As part of the celebrations a team of palaeontologists from the SA Museum will visit Burra.

On Monday 25 March BCS students will participate in workshops with three leading palaeontologists: Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University, Dr Aaron Camens of Flinders University & Dr Trevor Worthy of Adelaide University.  The discussion will explore Burra’s fossil heritage and contemporary issues such as climate change and extinctions.

On Monday evening there will be a free public Twilight Palaeo Talk at the Burra Town Hall at 7 p.m. and while there will be no set script, the talk will have reference to Burra’s fossil heritage and discoveries made by the three palaeontologists.  The session should run to about 8.30 p.m.

On Tuesday the visitors will call in at Farrell Flat School to talk to students there.  For ten years now the SA Museum has been hosting its own ‘Fossil Festival’ to celebrate the rich fossil history of the state and to foster awareness about why it matters.
