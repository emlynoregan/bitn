Weather.  Owen Smith of Oakbank was forced to abandon his car and walk to his homestead when 93 points fell in one short shower on Sunday afternoon.

W. Young was visiting Pualco at the weekend and on Monday he struggled in through muddy roads, driving for 11 miles in low gear at one stage and finding the 3-chain road between Duffer Dam and Murkaby Gate under water all the way with only fences visible.

Locally rain began last Wednesday about 2 a.m. and a soaking fall continued for 24 hours.  Saturday and Sunday saw more heavy falls followed by fog.  Both wheat and wool areas benefited.

[The two periods of rain seem to have delivered at least 50 points everywhere and well over 100 in many places.]
