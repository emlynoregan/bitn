The Bon Accord Museum is to be opened on the October long weekend and work on it is progressing well.  About $30,000 has been spent and a display case to house the model of the mine in 1860 by Mrs Pam Marlow is currently being installed.  The National Trust has provided the $5,000 for the case, which was designed by Mr Peter Stitt from Moonta.  Mrs Marlow now lives in Pinnaroo, but will return to the Bon Accord in the May school holidays to build the hills and landscape for the model.  Chairman of the National Trust Mrs Maureen Wright, said they were seeking old telephone books because their paper made excellent papier mâché.   Once the landscape has been completed the 33 groups of model buildings will be installed in time for the October opening.  The museum will also contain a social history of the Burra Burra and Princess Royal Mines.  The original shaft of the Bon Accord Mine has been covered with a glass viewing panel and a safety tail has been installed, so that visitors can now look down the 20 m shaft.  Work was also being done at the original police station and lock-up.  This has been financed by a grant of $12,000 from the National Estate and $3,000 from the National Trust.  Local stone mason, Daryl Pearce, and plasterer, Peter Bailey, have been working on the site.  They were currently building a dome-shaped roof on the old toilet.
