Help for New Mothers.  A short article discusses services to help new mothers in Burra.  The ‘Get to Know Your Baby Group’ recently received a donation.  This group runs about twice a year depending on need.  Mrs Sumner of Youth and Women’s Health Service runs a clinic every fortnight in Burra and can provide support during the week, on a range of baby health and development issues and parenting skills.

Friends of Child and Youth Health initiated a group called Coffee Chat that meets fortnightly to let mothers catch up with friends and meet new people.  [Photo.]

The Get to Know Your Baby Group gave a donation to St Mary’s Anglican Hall for its use of the building.
