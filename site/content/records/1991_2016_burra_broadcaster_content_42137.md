Open Gardens

The event was greatly affected by the preceding storms, but three gardens were open in Burra and two out of town: Brooke Stockman’s on the Farrell Flat Road on both days and Felicity Martin’s in Hallett on Sunday.

The guest speaker could not get through and organisers apologised to stall holders – some of whom were able to sell their goods locally.  Thanks to the Show Committee the scarecrow competition was still held at the show, where Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP was the judge.  Open section winner was Pip Edson and the school section winner was Nick Haddow.
