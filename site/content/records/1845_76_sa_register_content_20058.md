Kooringa News, 9 January

A burglar entered the premises of Mr George Morris, grocer, of Market Square on the night of 6-7 January by means of a skeleton key in the front door.  The premises of Mr Thomas Richards, which adjoin, were entered a few weeks ago and some boots were stolen.

The recent changes to the mail make it possible to get an answer by the return mail.

The road through the Sod Hut Ranges is nearly finished.  As many men are out of work, it is a pity the valuator has yet to value the land in Broad’s section, through which the road has to pass, thus enabling all the work to be finished at the one time – especially as the money was voted for it in 1865.

In the local court today William Pearce brought an action against Julius Victorsen for two weeks’ rent of a draper’s shop in Kooringa.  The defendant claims a verbal notice terminated their written agreement, but the Court found for the plaintiff for £3.

A charge by James Pearce against John Bagg for abusive language was dismissed.
