SA Health Commission initiatives to regionalise certain services could see some specialist surgery services transferred from Burra to Clare.  In a recent advice $5,000 was transferred from the Burra Hospital budget to Clare.  Also it has been stated that no funds will be provided for travelling expenses for specialists attending Public Hospital Surgery cases at Burra, further reducing the hospitalâ€™s ability to provide such services.  The Hospital Board has responded strongly, protesting both the initiatives and the lack of prior consultation.  The public are encouraged to voice their concerns.
