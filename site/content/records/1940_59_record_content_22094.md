Mr & Mrs Alfred Collins celebrated their Golden Wedding at a family dinner party at ‘Wandilla’ Marlborough, on 3 June.  The couple were married in the Methodist Church at Millicent, SA, by the late Rev. W.J. Mortimer in 1895.  Mrs Collins was the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Samuel Skewes of ‘Nantithet’, Millicent, SA. And Mr Collins the fifth son of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Collins of ‘Lucerndale’, Mt Bryan.  After spending some years in farming and pastoral pursuits at Mt Bryan East, Mr & Mrs Collins went to the Singleton district of NSW, where they carried on farming on an extensive scale.  Later in 1914, with their six sons, they selected land at Marlborough, Queensland, where they are still actively engaged in the grazing industry.
