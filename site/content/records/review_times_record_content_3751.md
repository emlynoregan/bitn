Model T on Display

Burra’s Model T Fire Engine is on display at Jennison’s of Burra.  Mrs R. Page, secretary of the Burra Branch of the National Trust said it was definitely the oldest [motorised] fire engine in SA and possibly in Australia.  After leaving Jennison’s, it will be on display at Richardson’s garage for about two weeks.  As yet the Trust had no permanent site to store the vehicle.  The Model T was restored by Mr John from Adelaide.  A series of pictures of the restoration process was also on display along with some equipment supplied by the Metropolitan Fire Service.  The MFS used the Fire Engine during its Fire Prevention Week program in October.
