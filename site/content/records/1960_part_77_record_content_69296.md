Mrs Tom Canny of Dongara WA wrote to the paper.  She says in 21 years in WA she has not seen a better season.  She says they have sold their farm at Mingenew and are living at Dongara.  Tom is unable to travel comfortably far by car after fracturing a hip some three years ago.  As a result they had an extensive holiday largely by air early in the year, to SA and the NT and had been home only three weeks when Tom had a stroke, which paralysed his right side.  He has been in St John of God Hospital, Geraldton ever since and is making a slow recovery.
