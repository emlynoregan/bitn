Native Grasslands preservation groups were addressed at meetings at Burra and Spalding recently.  There are significant remnants of grasslands along the Hallett-Terowie rail corridor and at Banbury.  The tussock grassland was a habitat for the pigmy bluetongue.  Such areas are important habitat for threatened flora and fauna.
