New Line of Road Burra to Kadina

A meeting last Tuesday at the Travellers’ Rest Inn in Clare reported to the public on an expedition to Kadina.  E.B. Gleeson JP was voted into the chair.  He commented on the benefits of a direct line of toad from Burra via Clare to Wallaroo & Kadina.

Mr Archer read his report.

The party was led by Messrs Hannaford, Gleeson, Ninnes and I.  We left Clare on Monday morning 16 June and reached the Bung Bunga Gap at the south end of the salt lake the same evening, where we met the drays and men who were to do the heavy work needed to open up the new line of road.  (This was 31 miles from Clare.)

The next morning from the top of the Hummocks the chimney at the Bay and the houses at Kadina were clearly visible.  We started south along the top of a large hill lying about a mile west of the gap.  We could see some small plains a short distance into the scrub to the southwest.  We began knocking down the scrub, keeping in as near a straight line as possible.  After about three hours we sighted the plains about a mile and a half away.  We called them Wright’s Plains.  We camped for the night in dense scrub, having made about 5½ miles.

[He then describes the Wednesday work of getting on towards the west southwest to what they named Ninnes Plains. On Thursday they continued west for some 5½ miles to some further small plains where they were delayed by having to send the bullocks back to the Hummocks for water.  On Friday they cut a line nearly west for about three miles.]

On Saturday we continued to cut the line in the same direction for about 4 miles from Blight’s Plains.  Then Mr Gleeson, having gone on ahead, discovered the plains east of Kadina were to our north.  We altered course to the north for about 1½ miles.  When we emerged from the scrub we were about 17½ miles from the top of Bung Bunga Gap and 5½ miles from Kadina.  We walked into Kadina and the drays came in on Sunday.  On the following Tuesday we left for the head of the Kulpara Plains, from which we went north to cut the new line of road about 1½ miles west of Blight’s Plains.  We returned to Clare on 27 June.

[Archer then further explains the advantages of the new route with details about watering places and public houses near the line.  Mr Hannaford then confirmed the superiority of the new road over the old line of travel.  Mr Wright, who had accompanied the party, agreed with Archer and Hannaford.]

A discussion followed about what work would be needed to make the new route serviceable.  Mr A. King then moved that the present committee decide what amount of clearing would be required and then call for tenders to achieve that.  Dr Davies seconded.  The motion was carried.

Mr Victorsen proposed that the committee begin communications with those likely to benefit from the new road, with a view to raising subscriptions and also petition the Government for a sum to be placed on the estimates to make the new road available.  This was seconded by Mr Filgate and carried.

The Treasurer said there was already almost £60 in the subscription list from Clare.
