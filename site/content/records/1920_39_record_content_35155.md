Tornado

Last Wednesday between 7.30 and 8 a.m. a tornado took a path through the district.  The first place reporting damage was J.G. Hanlin’s at Willalo where part of the woolshed roof was torn off with the timbers reduced to matches and the iron twisted.  The Booborowie hotel lost its verandah, a chimney and a windmill.  At Leighton the old homestead of Steward McWaters lost old almond trees and large gum trees, while at Wahroonga Mr I.J. Warnes’s trees were on the edge of the wind and escaped with having their leaves stripped from them.  Douglas Keynes lost the roofs from his implement shed, chaff house and harness room.  The gables were torn off the walls.  Alf Morgan at Ironmine lost shed roofs and trees.  T. Williams at what is known as Fairchild’s Farm had trees snapped off and one of them was driven through a 1,000 gallon tank 15 ft off the ground, as if it were a skewer.  He also lost shed roofs and the flying iron badly punctured the house roof.  At ‘Blink Bonnie’ Roy Humphrys was able to tie down the big stable roof with hay ropes just in time, but the chaff shed went and the air was full of iron, timber and trees.  At Westbury Farm the residence of the late W.H. Field the verandah and part of the roof went along with some grand old trees.  Roy Lloyd at Flagstaff Hill lost a windmill and fowl house.  At Pincarrow sheds were unroofed with the iron carried a quarter of a mile.  At Mr A. Gebhardt’s Mackerode a 60ft gum was torn apart and fell on the woolshed.  The wind there had been preceded by hail the size of moth balls, some of which went straight through the shearing shed roof.  In the town Kooringa escaped with strong winds, but at the north end of town trees, telegraph and electricity poles fell like ninepins.  The iron fence at the showgrounds was flattened in four sections.  Several sheds lost roofs and one or two chimneys were demolished.  The Police Station lost two big gums.  Mr Jennison had his wireless poles, each held by six stays, demolished.  A.B. Riggs’s dog kennel, a heavy wooden structure which was wired down, simply disappeared.  At Basin Farm Alick Ford lost 100-year-old trees and shed roofs.  About 9 a.m. just after the wind there was a heavy hail storm followed by showers throughout the day that brought 71 points in Kooringa since the last paper.  To the east dust storms continued, but there was very little rain.
