Burglary.  On Friday night burglars entered the premises of Drew and Crewes and also Luke Day, but met with little success.  It was a clumsy and unskilled attempt.  At Drew & Crewes they appear to have concentrated on desks in the office, looking for money.  They then turned to the van loaded ready for a country round.  Here they took about 500 cigarettes and £2 worth of tobacco.  This is the third attempt in three months.

At the Aberdeen store chaff and wood is being stolen wholesale.

At Day’s the lock had been prised open.  No significant money was taken.  It is thought that one of the thieves fell down the open cellar door leaving his hat behind.  The safety till was opened and 5/- to 6/- in coppers removed, but nothing else.
