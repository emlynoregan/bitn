Aberdeen Clubrooms

The extension to the kitchen and other improvements were opened by Mr Bruce Stockman, past President of the Aberdeen Football Club on Sunday last.  The Secretary of the Aberdeen Clubrooms’ Women’s Auxiliary, Mrs Florrie Scroop gave a short history of the rooms and thanked those involved in the reconstruction process.  Mr Stockman also unveiled a clock dedicated to the late Mr Arnold Heinrich who was the Secretary-Treasurer of the club for 14 years.
