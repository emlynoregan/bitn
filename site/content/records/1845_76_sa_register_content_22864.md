Booborowie people are reported as satisfied with the new postal arrangements from Daveyston [Hanson], though Kooringa is complaining of the loss of business.  The Hundred of Ayers, with the arrival of small farmers, expects to produce 40,000 bushels of wheat next season, even at the low rate of 10 bushels per acre.  The northern portion of the Hundred of Hanson will probably produce much more.  The Hundred of Andrews is partly under crop and by the end of the second year of the mail contract 100,000 bushels could be looked for.

Agriculture.  The area around Kooringa seems to be heading into drought.  Showers within the next fortnight would not come too late, but time is running out.

Rev. L.W. Stanton gave an entertainment in the Burra Hotel Assembly Room on Monday.  The room was well filled.  [The musical items are listed.]  Mr Stanton gave clever readings of the following pieces:

The Mourning Mother

A Piece of Assurance

A Ghastly Deed

Workman’s Ball at Paris

A French Fête

Death of Absalom

The Power of Beauty and Courage

The Mermaid

The Attorney General intends to ban the hawking of colonial wine.  This move will be much approved of by squatters.  It is well known that many shepherds, while isolated in the bush and unable to get intoxicating beverages make useful and careful men, but when hawkers place alcohol within reach (they often sell colonial brandy under the pretence it is wine) the result is a loss of control and sometimes with very serious consequences.

Primitive Methodists held their Anniversary services at Kooringa on Sunday and Monday.  Rev. J. Standrin preached to large congregations on Sunday.  The public tea was held on Monday.  £29 was raised.
