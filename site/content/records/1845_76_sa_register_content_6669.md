A Third Flood at Kooringa

From the Register correspondent, 10 June at 11 p.m.:

At about 6 p.m. this evening when everything was miserably tranquil in the town, a considerable body of water suddenly rushed down the main street and in a few minutes all the houses along Commercial Street had, for the third time this season, an abundance of water at their doors and in some instances at their fireside.  This abrupt appearance of water was a surprise when there had been no material fall of rain for a day.  The sky then became cloudy and seemed to threaten rain, but fortunately that has not eventuated and at present the sky is again clearing.

Those unfortunates washed out of their creek accommodation are entirely dependent on their friends.  Many are said to have suffered severe financial loss and it is reported that several hundred pound has been washed away or buried in the collapsed huts.  This is another reminder of the want of banking facilities in Kooringa.

The Smelting Works have not escaped unscarred.  They are situated in an amphitheatre on the eastern side of the Burra Creek and suffered from the inrush of waters from the hills flowing to the main creek.  The ash pits were, of course, filled with water, but as the works were at a standstill from want of fuel, the damage was not so great as it would have been were they in operation.  It is reported that 13 drays belonging to the Smelting Company have been washed away from the encamping ground at Balwin [sic: for Baldina], where the blacksmith’s forge, situated on the high bank of the creek, was knee deep in water.  Damages sustained by the company are estimated at £1,000.

The Burra Mine has not suffered in such a serious way.  Some of the shafts and pits have acquired extra water, which will cause some delays in operations.  Given the distress of those who have been forced from their creek huts, it is hoped that the Burra Mine Directors will take swift action to erect cottages to rehouse them.
