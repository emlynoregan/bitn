Sgt Cain [sic: for Kain] recently left the town without any public recognition.  We have been asked to receive subscriptions for a practical appreciation of his services.  Subscriptions will also be received by Mr C. Fuller at Bence’s Ltd and at Messrs Sara & Co.’s store at Aberdeen.  St Cain dealt with all matters with kindly tact, whether in the preservation of the law, the handling of the unemployed or old age pensions.
