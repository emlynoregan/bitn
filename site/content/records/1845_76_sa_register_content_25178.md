Malachite.  In referring to a recent paragraph reporting malachite at the Stanley Mine near Clare, Mr J.B. Austin reports that he has got malachite at three other localities in the north; from Wheal Frost about 200 miles north of Pt Augusta, on another section then believed to belong to the Daly and Stanley Mining Association and at Blinman.
