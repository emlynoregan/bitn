Here the RSA strongly urged the Council to reverse its decision and carry out the original plan or something similar.  They were not asked to decide absolutely on any particular scheme.  They told the Council that they were confident they could raise £25 towards the cost if necessary.  The Mayor had asked for something in writing, but being somewhat puzzled as to what was required he put it off for a few days and it had slipped his mind.  As far as the latest request from Council the RSA was simply awaiting a yea or nay from Council which already had its wishes before it.  Until the Council’s scheme was made known the RSA could not decide whether to support it financially or in any other way.  Mr Hammond said the request from the Mayor for something in writing was informal and not the responsibility of the branch.  Three schemes had been put before the Council at the conference.

The original (and most expensive) plan

A fence around the rotunda and memorial

The guns to be built into the rotunda and fenced, leaving out the memorial.

The scheme to move the guns to opposite the Institute would cost more than 2 or 3 of the above.

He had expected to hear from the Council giving a decision on the scheme selected and was astonished to read the Record report.

Dr Steele was astonished that one Councillor was so opposed to closing the gap between Rotunda and Memorial, which he though should have been closed long ago.

E.C. Hammond said he believed it was a source of danger and when he was on Council had moved for its closure, but was defeated.  They could not promise support without knowing what the Council was proposing.

The President said it was their duty to try to get the original plan completed. And Mr Pollard agreed.

The meeting agreed to reiterate their earlier motion to that effect and it further promised that with any scheme the Council devised to carry out these wished the RSA would welcome a conference to consider means of finance on being acquainted with details and costs.
