Burra Primary School.  A new prefabricated school room is expected to be in use in a fortnight.  The first occupants will be Grade VII pupils with Mr P. Lannan.  Grade VI will move into the room vacated by Grade VII and Grade IV will change rooms to leave one of the smaller classrooms empty.  It is hoped to convert that room to a larger staff room with some space taken up by the book cupboard, now standing in the corridor.
