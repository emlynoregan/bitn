Numbering of issues in 1946.

The numbering of issues in 1946 was somewhat chaotic.

The year began with:

Volume 68, Number 1 on 8 January and this sequence continued to

Volume 68 Number 9 on 5 March.

Then there was a change of Volume

Volume 69, Number 10 appeared on 12 March

On 2 April Volume 69 Number 13 appeared as expected, but

On 9 April page 1 carried the inscription Volume 69 Number 13, 2 April, and this date also appeared on page 4.  Pages 2 & 3 carried the correct date of 9 April.

The Volume Number changed again on 14 May:

Volume 70, Number 19, 14 May and this sequence ran to

Volume 70, Number 24, 18 June before reverting to:

Volume 69, Number 25, 25 June

Volume 69, Number 27, 9 July was followed by

Volume 69, Number 27 (2), 16 July, though this was dated 9 July on pages 1 & 4 and 16 July on pages 2 & 3.

There was no Number 28 in this sequence.

Issues then became regular from:

Volume 69, Number 29, 23 July to

Volume 69, Nember 50, 17 December.
