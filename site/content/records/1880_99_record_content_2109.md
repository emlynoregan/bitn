Burra Town Council 29 October.

Cr Ridgway objected to the Record’s publication of the attendance of councillors, but the Town Clerk pointed out that access to such information was publicly available and therefore it was not privileged information.

Legal advice was that the Council had the power to change footpath heights etc. in Commercial St.  The final acceptance of the heights proposed by Cr Batchelor, with very slight modification, came after some irregular and heated discussion and against the opposition of the Mayor and Cr Drew.

Ratepayers’ Meeting.  The South Ward ratepayers met on Saturday with the Mayor, P. Lane, in the chair.  Mr Drew said he would not stand again.  His business meant he was often away from the town for Council meetings.  He was still of the opinion that the cemetery road should be paid for by the whole town.

John Sampson jun. announced that he would stand.  He would be an independent and supported Cr Drew’s stand on the cemetery road.

William Geake would also stand.  He felt the division of the wards was unfortunate.  The number of creeks and other expensive works were largely in the South Ward, but the most valuable property was in Middle Ward.  Church St would be a much better boundary than Commercial St.  He also supported Cr Drew’s stand on the cemetery road.
