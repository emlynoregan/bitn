Obituary.  Mat. J. Griffen of Mt Bryan died in the Burra Hospital on Thursday 13 March after a very short illness.  He was the son of the late Pat Griffen of Victoria and Mrs W. Dare of Mt Bryan East.  He was born at Dunstown Victoria in 1882 and came to SA 30 years ago and resided with his mother and step-father.  In 1916 he enlisted with the 27th Battalion.  Apart from a slight gassing he came through unscathed and was among the last to return home.  Upon his return he took up land at Mt Bryan.  He is survived by three brothers: Jack & T.P. Griffen of Birkenhead SA and Mick Griffen of Claretown Victoria.  [Born Martin Joseph Griffin (Mat.) 1882 probably in Victoria: died 13 March 1930 in Kooringa, residence Mt Bryan.]
