Kooringa Methodist Church celebrated its 78th anniversary on Sunday.  Congregations were very large and though the church can hold 450 it is estimated that 500 attended.  There was a 40 voice choir directed by G.E. Dane.  Miss Trix Pearce played the organ.  Her father Mr John Pearce was organist for 35 years retiring in 1900.  His eldest daughter the late Miss Alice Pearce succeeded till ill health forced her to hand over to her sister Miss Trix Pearce.  The choir were aided by Mr Alva Penrose and Hilda Barnes of Adelaide.  Mr Penroseâ€™s father, Richard Penrose, was also present; he was born in Kooringa 65 years ago.  A tea meeting on Monday was a time of great reunion.  Lady Holder was present and delivered an inspiring address.
