Burra Public Toilets.  For some time the toilets in use at the rear of premises on the west side of Market Square have been the subject of discussion by the Local Board of Health.  These toilets may be condemned and if shopkeepers agree to contribute to cost and maintenance, a new block of up-to-date toilets will be erected.
