Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  At last something has happened.  A Melbourne-Adelaide syndicate has paid a small deposit on purchase of the mine and is said to be determined to set to work almost immediately to develop the mine in a proper manner.  For pig-rooting the recent work has taken the cake.  Long ere this the mine should have been dressing thousands of tons of ore and competing on world markets.  The human machinery has been wrong and the financial part of the venture has gone backwards.  The company sold a few tons of ore for the year at a good price, but it was a trifling amount.  Even given the slipshod way things have been done we cannot understand why better progress has not been made.  Twelve months ago the directors promised if a concentrating plant were not erected the mine would be pumped dry.  The pump is an excellent machine, but not suitable for unwatering the mine to any great depth.  Has any satisfactory work resulted? No.  Unless radical changes are made by the new management they will meet with dire disappointment.  That in bygone days much ore-bearing material was neglected can be seen when by proper treatment tributers in the past six months have made better wages than when the mine was in full swing and that from abandoned stuff.  We have gone into this and have tested the output by the tributers and the returns received.  This will surprise many and we can give the public something more astounding directly.  We have not traversed the drives and shafts without taking notes for future reference.  Things were so peculiar that we were convinced long ago that no headway would be made and we said so.  In the face of past folly we welcome news of a revival in town and do not doubt that with efficient management and the old workings left alone and a greater depth exploited there will be a much better result.  The concentrating work should be abandoned and a smelter erected.  Then every particle of ore would be saved.  Present inspections have led people to be at a loss to know how the mine could have been allowed to remain idle for so long, especially when the ore exposed is of such a character as to impress anyone of its importance.  Now the prospect of the sale of the mine is a major topic of conversation.  We can only hope for a return to prosperity to be the result.
