Burra Show

Overall entries were down slightly, but birds and ring events were in record numbers.  The gate was $656; down about $25.  The show was officially opened by His Excellency the Governor in perfect weather.

[The headline wrongly describes this as the 96th show – an error repeated by the President.]

Mr Roy Humphrys, who unfortunately was in hospital, was thanked for his untiring efforts in cleaning up the grounds.  The Governor arrived on Friday afternoon by train from Peterborough and in the morning had a look around the town.  The official party was entertained at luncheon.

Shearing was a major attraction.  The open event was won by S. Pittaway and the novice by K. Bruce, who also won the ‘Local Shearer’ prize.

Miss E. Russell was Miss Show Girl.

Ian Auhl and Samin Ltd arranged a series of photographs of the old mine area from 1870-1875.

The Rural Youth display had the theme of Farm Safety.

School displays were a credit to students and staff and the industrial displays were varied.

The motor cycle trials were run for the first time this year and were a great success.  The winner was B. Diener of Mt Bryan.

The Rural Youth hosted the Show Night Dance in the RSL Hall.  ‘Sound and Image’ supplied the music, ensuring that the dance appealed only to young people.  The behaviour of a few in attendance was not very ‘becoming’. 

[Main prize winners for the show are listed.]
