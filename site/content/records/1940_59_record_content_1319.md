Boxing.  ‘Red’ Mitchell brought up a group from West Croydon Gymnasium on Thursday.  He gave a demonstration of boxing and sparring with his pupils.  Allan Harry, from Burra, was one of the pupils brought along.  He sparred with SA Fly Weight Champion, J. Thomson.  Jack Young defeated local Syd Johnson of Leighton in the first round of a scheduled 12.

A 3-round match was then fought between Ray James of Burra & Wilkinson of Gum Creek.  James won on points.  Wilkinson and Sellars had fought a draw in a 3-round bout earlier.

Dr Steele spoke on the Art of Self Defence, recommending boxing as a sport for every boy and young man.

8th Annual Anzac Sports & District Fete.

As a result of the efforts of the RSL & FFCF nearly £500 was taken.  Much was due to the efforts of the RSL Hon. Sec. Mr H.E. Fuss and his assistant Mr C.V. Preiss and also to those of Mr & Mrs Stanley Hawker.  The success of the fete owed much to the work of Mrs Hawker and Mrs Andrew Tennant of the FFCF and the RSL Wives Group.  The local CWA entertained Sir Hubert & Lady Hudd at luncheon. (He had been invited to open the day’s activities.)  A list of responsible workers and of results is published.  The fete is described in considerable detail as well.

[It is not clear whether the £500 is gross or nett.]
