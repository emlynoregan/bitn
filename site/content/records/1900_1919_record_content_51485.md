Enlistments.

In 1914 the average (for 5 months) was	10,400 per month

1915					13,825 per month

1916					10,362 per month

1917 (January to May)		4,740 per month

1917 (June & July)		4,124 per month

The cause will be aided by the recruiting film A Soldierâ€™s Life in the AIF and a series Why Britain Went to War has been effective in the past.
