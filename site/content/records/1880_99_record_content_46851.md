Cr Hardy then moved:

‘That this Council disapproves of the action of the Chairman in taking upon himself the transaction of public business with a total disregard of the standing orders of this Council, and that the business in question to wit the illegal acceptance of tenders for road metal from Messrs C. Herberle & J. Williams be not entertained by the Council and that the tenders received be referred back to the Public Works Committee.

‘I have been chiacked a lot about this affair.’

Cr Rabbich then took up the argument again claiming not to have known of the meeting and insisting that the lowest tender had to be accepted and several other quibbles.

Cr Parks said most of this was unnecessary.  The advertisement clearly said ‘neither the lowest nor any tender necessarily accepted’.

Cr Rabbich certainly knew the meeting was to be held on Saturday, if not the exact time.

Cr Watt observed that it was interesting that the principal person [Cr Hardy] in working up the furore was not a member of the Public Works Committee.  The debate then turned to some confusion over what was meant by ‘supplying’ and how that differed from ‘raising’ metal.

The motion was lost.

Cr Rabbich moved Rawlin’s tender at 2/3 a yard be accepted.  Carried.

[How this last fits in with the rest of the debate is unclear.]
