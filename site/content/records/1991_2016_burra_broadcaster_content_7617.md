Burra-Morgan Bike Ride

This has been organised by Mrs Ruth Strachan and Ivan Venning, the Member for Custance, as a fundraiser to assist with the education of children in isolated areas and also to maintain public focus on how important the road is and the high priority of its upgrading and sealing.  Fourteen riders are expected to take place.  Institutions to benefit will be BCS, Pt Augusta School of the Air and Marden Open Access R-10.
