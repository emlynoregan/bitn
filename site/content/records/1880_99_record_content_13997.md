The Silverton Mines.  First in a series of articles.

The recognised track from SA to the Barrier has been along the ‘pegged line’, a track surveyed by the Government and marked with mileposts and running as nearly in a direct line as allowed of striking water at convenient distances from Burra to Thackaringa.  It has long been used by cattle and sheep coming to SA markets from Queensland and NSW.  It is still the best route as it is less cut up than the line from Terowie used by the mail coaches.  The pegged line goes through Baldina, past Caroona, touches North Dam Station at 60 miles, Anabama at 100 miles, Duffield’s Well at 150 miles, and then either via Mootra and Burta (About ten miles further round) or past Higher Mingary to Thackaringa, about 18 miles over the border and 208 miles from Burra.  There are several large dams along the line between points mentioned.  The route can be done readily at this time of year in four days from Burra with night camps at North Dam, Anabama, Duffield’s Well and Thackaringa.  Avoiding deviations for water could reduce the distance by 20 miles.  This is the route which it is sought to have for the Burra-Silverton railway.  After the first four miles from Burra there is not a single obstacle, just plains of saltbush and bluebush and areas of black oak and sandalwood.  The ground is rubbly limestone and the water supply good.
