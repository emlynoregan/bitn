Mongolata Gold

At least 10 parties are at work with a total of about 20 men and some claims are down 20ft.  In most places the going is difficult, requiring blasting.  Some good coarse gold has been obtained on Bylesâ€™ claim by dollying.  Experienced prospectors expect alluvial gold to be found.  The men are getting up stone to send for cyanide treatment at Peterborough.
