The Monster Mine

[The article begins with another set of production figures.]

Fifteen miners out of 40 employed, have raised 500 tons of ore in seven weeks.  The visible quantities of ore are cited as worth an aggregate of £68,600.  Reported disagreements between the German Superintendent and the miners seem to have arisen solely from mutual misunderstandings based on language difficulties between the two.

The present supply of potable water is abundant.

The proprietors of the southern half of the Special Survey are providing comfortable accommodation for their present and future workers by numerous erections and they are well assured that the richness of their territory will afford them the most ample remuneration.

Nothing is yet known of the exploration party, which has gone so far north as Messrs White’s Station, some 150 miles from Adelaide.
