Tennis.  On Saturday afternoon the new Tennis Club at Kooringa was opened, adjacent to the bowling green.  Two new courts have been put down, a shelter-shed erected and a 12’ fence built.  The whole cost was c. £350, of which £125 was a debt, but this was cleared by the generosity of the Patron, Mr J. R. Barker and of Messrs L. W. Gebhardt, & R. M. McBride.  The President, Mr P. J. Pickering, welcomed guests.  The Mayor, Mr M. Collins, assisted in the opening by Mrs John Tennant, declared the courts open.  The old court, on the other side of the creek, has also been done up.
