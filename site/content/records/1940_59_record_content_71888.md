Weather: A very severe thunderstorm at Kia-Ora.

Mr S.A. Irlam was at Kia-Ora on Sunday morning to bring a load of wool to Burra.  He had taken five of his children with him for a day’s outing.  Just before 3 p.m. a sudden storm was noticed when clouds began rolling in a frightening manner and with a terrific roar the rain was upon them.  Three inches of rain fell in 30 minutes. Within a few seconds the wool carters were standing in a foot of water.  With the rain came jagged lumps of ice as large as hen’s eggs.  One struck Teddy Irlam on the head, momentarily stunning him and leaving a large lump on his head.  The single bladed Freelite exploded in a shower of sparks and became a mangled heap of iron.  Dams that were half full were overflowing within 15 minutes.  The stream through the flume into the dam was shooting half way across it with terrific force.  The homestead gutters were completely blocked with ice, which then built up on the roof.  The blockage caused water to get through into the ceiling and some 2 to 3 inches of water covered the floors, damaging carpets and furniture.  Trees in the area were stripped of leaves and small twigs and some were uprooted, while large branches were torn from others.  Windows were smashed in the house and shearing shed.  The phone lines were down and the truckload of wool completely bogged.  Mr Irlam returned to Burra by motor cycle to notify his wife of the children’s safety.  At Hogback, 8 miles away, only 15 points were recorded.
