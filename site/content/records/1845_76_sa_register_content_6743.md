SA Elections: Mr Kingston at Kooringa

Mr Kingston and his Adelaide friends have been busy canvassing the Burra in the last week.  It was widely rumoured that Mr Kingston would address a public meeting in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Saturday evening.  A large number of people turned up, the room was lit and every appearance of an impending meeting was there, but nothing could be seen of the aspiring candidate.  A messenger was then sent to request Mr Kingston’s attendance, but he met with a polite refusal.

Burra Miners are showing little inclination to rush to the NSW goldfields.  The lessons of California seem to have been learnt.  Should the early reports be confirmed, however, it is likely that many will be induced to leave.  At the Mine flour has risen to £3-10-0 a bag and a 4 lb loaf costs ½.  Mutton and beef are 3d to 4d per pound.

As soon as fine weather sets in the Mine is expected to be able to employ all the hands at the Burra and probably many more.

The Joseph Weir has just arrived with the large engine for the Burra Mine.  This enormous engine for the SA Mining Association is virtually the sole cargo for the vessel, except for 100 tons of coal for the Patent Copper Company.
