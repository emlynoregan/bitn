Letter.  Sheila Elder, who used to be a hairdresser in Burra in the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, with a once a week trip to Orroroo to set up her dryers etc. in a hotel there, reminisces about Burra in those times:

We came to Burra in 1946, just after the war and the partition of India – having left Kashmir and the lovely hill station of Darjeeling.

The first sight of Burra was of ‘a God forsaken place’, but they stayed long enough to have three sons and discover kind people, who never treated them like strangers.

Burra had been full of days of struggle after a life in India with servants and relaxation.

Burra brought pumping water from an underground tank on cold frosty mornings.

An outside toilet.

The children walking uphill with a billy to get milk.

On a return visit 28 years later Market Square and the rolling hills looked beautiful and the people were just as friendly.

They had a tour of the mine with Mr & Mrs Scroop.

And a lesson in painting from Mr Len Bence.

And visits from Mrs Jennison to see if I was OK.
