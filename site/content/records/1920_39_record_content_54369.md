Mongolata

A downpour on 2 January delivered 55 points, most of it in about 15 minutes.  A further 55 points on Friday from a steadier fall was more useful.

A treasure hunt for children was held last Saturday through the generosity of Mr & Mrs Tom Brown.  A gorgeous tea was followed by the excitement of the hunt and for the older folk a dance followed.
