Council Amalgamations

Hallett has withdrawn from the group of seven that included Crystal Brook and Rocky River, but continues in talks with Burra.

Burra has had ongoing talks with councils to the south and west – most recently with Clare, Saddleworth-Auburn and Riverton.

Burra Burrs DC is seriously looking at recycling waste – beginning with paper and cardboard.

A questionnaire will soon be sent to people calling on them to express their opinion.
