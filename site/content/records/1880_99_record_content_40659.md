Salvation Army.  The efforts of the visiting Colonel McKie and his A.D.C., Staff Capt. Plank, from London, were rewarded with large attendances at the Salvation Army barracks last Tuesday.  They are touring the colonies to hold Salvation Revival Services.

Boys’ Field Naturalist Society, Burra Branch, had an outing on Saturday.  Messrs Wittber, Opie & Bentley, from Burra School and Rev. R.J. Daddow attended.  The group went to the Burra Creek for soil analysis, St Mary’s cutting for contortion in limestone and The Mine to look at exposed rock types.
