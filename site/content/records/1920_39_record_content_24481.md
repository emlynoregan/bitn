Hanson Hall.  A meeting was held in the Council Chamber on Saturday 15 October and was well attended.  Mr H.R.M. Schumacher (Hon.

It was resolved after discussion to build a hall 60ft x 35ft in wood and iron and to call it the Hanson Memorial Hall.  Elected were Patron, W.G. Duncan MLC; President, W.G. Hawkes; Hon. Sec. & Treasurer, H.R.M. Schumacher.
