Des Woolley writes expressing concern about the possible closure of the Visitor Centre and condemning the Council due to:

Its lack of response to correspondence

Its pointless delays with building permits etc.

Unsatisfactory gutters and rural access roads

The squandering of money on offices

The excess numbers of highly paid staff.
