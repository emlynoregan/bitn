Obituary.  Richard Finch died 1 July at his residence in St Peters.  He was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs E.N. Finch of ‘Pincarrow’ and was born in 1881.  He was educated at Burra School and then took to farming at ‘Blink Bonnie’ now the home of Mr Roy Humphrys.  He took a keen interest in wool and was a well-known classer.  Later he went to Victoria and was for a time farm manager at Dookie College.  On returning to SA he carried on wool classing and was later employed by Gregory Wool Mills.  He married Miss Elsie Oates, daughter of Mr & Mrs John Oates of Aberdeen, who survives with one son.  There are four brothers: Walter, Eddie, Bert & Glen who acted as bearers.
