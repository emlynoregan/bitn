Booborowie Recreation Committee has approved South Booborowie Cricket Club placing a cricket pitch in the centre of the main oval and that a bore with an electric pump be sunk near the Hall to provide water for toilet use.  This had previously depended on a 1,000 gallon tank, which sometimes proved inadequate.
