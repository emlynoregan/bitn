Letter from W. H. Hardy, who writes at great length [over 1 column] on the British Government’s foreign policy.  He accuses the Government of ‘lowering British prestige and inviting contempt ‘which will lead in time to the real danger of a combination of great powers to despoil England of her outlying possessions.’
