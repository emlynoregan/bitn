Burra Swimming Pool Committee met on 25 January to consider a letter from the Town Council.  After collecting for some time the services of an Adelaide architect were obtained and plans for a pool, wading pool, dressing sheds etc. were obtained.  Tenders ranged from £1,686-6-6 to £2,722.  After a query from the Under-Secretary a few months ago a conference was held with Council and it was agreed that costs ruled out a concrete pool and wading pool.  The Mayor indicated he had plans for a stone swimming pool and evidently this was the plan put before Council last meeting.  Before making a decision, after long discussion, the Committee decided to wait and see if the Government would grant a 12-month extension of time to enable further funds to be collected.  If this is refused they resolved to hand the present funds to Council for the construction of a pool under the supervision of a competent architect or certified engineer.
