Ruth Norris, with the help of locals and some tourists, has rescued an abandoned horse at Burra North.  The previous owners of the horse left the town some years ago and were under the impression it was being cared for.  It was in fact starving and needed other treatments â€“ especially for arthritis.  The horse has now recovered and is doing well.  [Photos.]
