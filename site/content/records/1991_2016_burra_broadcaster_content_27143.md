Australia Day Breakfast at Pickett Reserve drew a large crowd.  The Burra SES cooked a hearty meal and Steve Kerrigan, Goyder Council CEO welcomed visitors and residents.  A key feature was the donation of $7,000 by the CWA to the Burra Cultural Centre Committee.  Burra CWA President Eunice Baker said it was the last of the funds from the sale of the CWA premises.

Meals on Wheels Service Awards were also presented to Len Simpson, Clare Taylor, and Avis Webster for 15 years’ service.  To Marg Dunstall and Nancy Simpson for 20 years’ service, to Eunice Baker for 25 years’ service and to Betty Thamm, Jan Tiver and Anne Finch for 30 years’ service.

The Citizen of the Year Award was presented to Sharyn Roberts.

The Centenary of Federation Committee received the Award for Event of the Year.  [4 photos.]
