Milk Supply.  With the dispersal of ‘Koorama’ Dairy, Rob Garrard is the town’s only milkman.  He has to import milk from Adelaide to meet the demand.  ‘Koorama’ had 30 cows and only six were purchased by locals.  Many dairymen across Australia find the work too hard and profits too low, even at 7d a pint.  [The paper says the dairy was for many years Ken Drew’s, but when sold it was A.M. Sawley’s, as stated in the report of the sale on page 3 of this issue.  See 76, 39, 3 Oct. 1950, page 1 for the transfer from Drew to Sawley.]
