Drew & Crewes held a Christmas competition to guess the name of a huge doll securing a gigantic Christmas stocking.  But not one of the more than 200 entries guessed the name was ‘Mavis’ so the stocking has remained the property of the firm.  We would suggest distributing the contents to the children.
