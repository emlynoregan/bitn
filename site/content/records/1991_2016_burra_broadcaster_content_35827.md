Burra Scouts?

A meeting is to be held in the Burra Guide Hall in Grainger Street on 16 March to discuss the possibility of reforming the Burra Scout Group.  There was a very active group here a few years ago, with some members going on to earn their Queenâ€™s Scout Award.  Quite a few scouts also greatly enjoyed attending Scout Jamborees.  A Joeys and Cubs Group could be started first.
