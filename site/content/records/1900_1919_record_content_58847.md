Burra Races, Saturday 8 February.

Hot weather and fear of influenza reduced attendance, but the course was in good condition, having escaped the bushfire.  The Tote House had been rebuilt after being partially burnt and Tote takings of £1,280 were up from £1,097 in 1918.

The main race was the Burra Handicap over 1¼ miles with 1st prize of £35, 2nd £3 and 3rd £2.  It was won by Mr A.E. Priess’s Miss Restful ridden by H. Redden.
