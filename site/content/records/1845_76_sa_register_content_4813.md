Local Court, Kooringa, 24 July.

Mr Clare claimed £4-19-6 was due to his son as wages from Mr Hoiles, for whom the boy had been working in his house on the Gulf Road.  Septimus Boord gave evidence that he was paying a boy of about the same age 5/- per week plus his board.  His Worship said the problem would not have arisen had the parties made a proper agreement.  The verdict was for the complainant for the amount claimed with each side to bear his own costs.

Rev. James Pollitt charged that John S. Maling, carpenter, had attempted to remove some shingles, the property of the complainant and also with an assault.

The defendant had contracted to do some work on the parsonage at Redruth, but had then refused to go on with the contract.  On Monday he had attempted to remove some bundles of shingles that had not been used.  He refused to desist when asked and had forced the bindle against Pollitt’s knuckles, removing some skin.  Pollitt’s servant had come out and Maling then went away.

James Edward Woodforde corroborated the above and said the defendant also was very abusive.

John Seymore corroborated the evidence of the preceding witness.

Defendant claimed the shingles were his property; part of 16,000 for which he had paid.

Complainant said he could produce the bill to satisfy His Worship they were his.

His Worship said ownership of the shingles was something he could not decide.  Even admitting the shingles were the property of defendant that did not give him the right to remove them by force.  He should have summonsed the complainant to show cause why he detained them.
