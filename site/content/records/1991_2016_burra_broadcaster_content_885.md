Burra Show

This yearâ€™s show was well attended and the weather held out for most of the time.

A feature this time was the Yard Dog competition that helped to keep the good crowd interested for the day.

Others were attracted by the show bags, motor bike rides, side show alley and stalls ranging from Countrywise Computers to leather craft.
