Burra Town Council.

Council decided not to accept the conditions of the Railway Commissioners for the piece of land near the Bon Accord for road purposes.

Council has decided not to recognise the claim for £2-2-0 from Mr P. Pendlebury (lawyer) as costs for handling the assessment appeal cases, in excess of the £1-1-0 already paid.

It was resolved not to offer reduced water charges for the Hospital.

Florieton Races will be held on 14 March.
