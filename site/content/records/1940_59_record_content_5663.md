The Burra Hotel.  A former proprietress and manager-in-chief, Mrs Phelan, has recently returned.  One of the older hotels in Burra, it is spacious and gracious in its pleasing setting and style.  Mrs Phelan also manages to find time to interest herself in most affairs of public endeavour in the town and is by general acclamation a very popular woman and an excellent hostess.
