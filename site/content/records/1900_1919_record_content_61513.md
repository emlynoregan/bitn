Burra Town Council

In future mail will be sorted into private boxes at night in Kooringa, but a second delivery in the town is not considered justified.

G.E. Dane of the Local Repatriation Committee advises that only two returned soldiers require work and one of those is not yet medically fit.

W. Martin jun. & E. Hopkins wrote confessing to the destruction of a cedar tree in Kingston St.  The Mayor suggested consideration be postponed to a full meeting of Council.

A water-table to be made against footpaths abutting the premises of Farmers’ Union.
