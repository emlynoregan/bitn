Salvation Army – visit of Commissioner Richards

This took place last Wednesday.  He was accompanied by Col. W. Gist and Col. H. Sharp.  He was the guest of W.G. Hawkes of Koonoona and on Wednesday afternoon was tendered a civic reception by the Mayor as his last civic duty in that office.  He presented the Commissioner with a paperweight of polished Australian Oak on which was mounted a solid gold cup inlaid with a piece of polished malachite.  In the evening there was a good attendance at the Institute for an address by the Commissioner touching on the workings of the Salvation Army.  [The report of the visit extends for 2½ columns.]
