In 1902 A.B. Hiddle was appointed to represent the club at a public meeting to welcome returned soldiers from the Boer War and Corporal R. Gully, Trooper C. Sangster & Cpl Sappho Halls were elected honorary members.

Correspondence mentions the Distinguished Conduct Medal being given to Cpl Gully and a letter was sent to Captain Watt congratulating him on his DSO.  A donation was made to a ‘Souvenir’ to be presented to Lt. Col. Castine.

Life membership has been conferred on B.W. Pearse & C.B. Warnes (1907), T.H. Pearse (1915), J.A. Riggs (1916).  R.D. Pascoe is the only member of the 1900 committee still living in Burra and George Herbert the only active member shooting in that year.

The earliest Captain (then called President) was Sir Frederick Holder.
