Burra Burra DC, 2 December

Mr A. Tennant sought permission to erect a telephone line along the Main Eastern Road from Burra to Redcliffe Station.

Riverton Dc sought support for a Tuesday train service.

SAR advises that instructions have been issued that no Leigh Creek coal is to be used in locomotives on main lines in the summer months.

G. Bails, the liquidator of Byles Mongolata Gold Mining Co. N.L. advises he has forfeited and sold certain gold mining leases and is prepared to pay the rates on same, but not on certain others.  Referred to Mr M.W. Bednall.
