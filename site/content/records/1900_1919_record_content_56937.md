Burra Town Council.

Building applications were approved for Boy Scouts, Mr Norrell James & Mr E. Baynes.

A.E. Maher provided plans for an electric light system costing £6,180 with the first year’s revenue estimated at £815.

After a petition from 57 ratepayers it was decided to remove the turnstiles from the bridge by the old Bible Christian Church (to allow perambulator access) and to replace them with rails, leaving apertures either end (to prevent wandering cattle).

The Boy Scouts sought permission for their steps at the front of the building to encroach on Council property.  Cr Radford thought it an unfortunate eventuality and wondered about liability in the event of an accident, but the request was granted.

The Hydraulic Engineer is to be asked to underground the water pipe presently carried on the Bon Accord Bridge: its leaking creates maintenance problems for the water department and also rots the bridge timbers.
