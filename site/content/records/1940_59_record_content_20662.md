Burra’s Centenary Year

The paper askes how the town will celebrate this event.

It assumes the Town Council will discuss it first, followed by a public meeting and the appointment of committees.  Whatever is decided, any profits are made from the celebrations should go to the benefit of ‘Burra’s own fighting men, through the medium of town sporting, beautifications or recreational facilities, which can be used and enjoyed by them when they return home.’

The writer suggests that a swimming pool would be high on the list.  War Memorial Gardens along the banks of the creek would be another good idea.

Clare has inaugurated a Trotting Club and Victoria Park in Burra would offer a site for a first class turf or grassed oval with a saucer track for bike races around it.

Burra Hospital Board has two new members: Messrs J.R. Barker and E. Finch.

Shirley Bartlett has won the best essay submitted on Burra Primary School’s Grade VII visit to the Record office.  [The essay is printed.]

Burra Salvation Army held its Harvest Festival Services last weekend.  They were conducted by Adjutant Hanson, WAAAF Officer.

Letter.  Roy W. Humphrys writes in appreciation of the £2,000 legacy to the Burra Hospital from the estate of the late Mr C. Gebhardt.
