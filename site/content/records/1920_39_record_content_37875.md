Rev. & Mrs Lawson who have been transferred to Bute were farewelled at the Methodist Lecture Hall on 1 April with the Mayor presiding.  Mr J.G. Sara spoke for Redruth Methodists.  Clem Pearce spoke as acting Superintendent of the Sunday school, Mr R.R. Bunney for the congregation and Mr A.J. Bruce for World’s End.  Rev. F.J. Barnes spoke as chairman of the Middle District, Mr James Thomas as President of Burra Benevolent Society and the Mayor for the townsfolk.

Mr Lawson was given ‘a well filled wallet of notes’.  Mrs Lawson received a handbag with a substantial sum of money.  Mrs Lawson also received a silver cake basket and Mr Lawson an inkstand.  Both made suitable responses.  Rev. Jarvis succeeds Rev. Lawson.

Mt Bryan Athletic Sports on 4 April drew only a fair attendance, due in part no doubt to the Burra Tennis tournament.  Results are printed.  A concert followed.  The club will incur a small loss on the day.
