Ngadjuri

The Minister for the Arts, Diana Laidlaw has announced a $12,000 grant is to be made for the creation of a Ngadjuri Cultural Exhibition in Burra and a further $12,000 is to be made available for the SA Museum from its indigenous outreach program.  The Ngadjuri once lived from Gawler to Orroroo.  Elder of the Ngadjuri Fred Warrior has been working for a number of years to have some interpretation and exhibition of Ngadjuri culture.  The Council BCD, the National Trust and the Burra Regional Art Gallery support the proposal and the old library room [previously the old Lodge Room] at the Town Hall has been chosen for the exhibition.

[It is to be hoped that this $12,000 – or potentially $24,000 – was not simply wasted, because no such room eventuated and neither did an exhibition in an alternative venue.]
