Consecration of St Mary’s.  A Church of England was erected in Kooringa as a slab building in Kangaroo St c. 1847 as a schoolroom and church.  Rev. Bagshaw was the incumbent.  The manse of slab and brick was behind T.W. Pearce’s residence in Commercial St and is now occupied by Mrs Turner.  Two years later St Mary’s on the hill was built when Rev. J. Pollet was incumbent, followed by Revs Ibbetson, Stanton and others.  In 1856 Mr Ibbetson presented plans and specifications to the committee for the Institute - two small rooms.  A Church of England schoolroom was soon built on the allotment now occupied by Messrs M.H. Bruse & Son.  Plans were laid to buy land north of the Kooringa post office, but SAMA kindly donated it.  Plans were drawn up by George McLagan and the building constructed by Sara & Dunstan.  Bishop Short laid the foundation stone on 3 July 1879 and he also opened the church on 18 January 1880.  The total cost of the building was £3,300.  The late Mrs McCulloch of Princess Royal donated £500 while her husband Mr A. McCulloch lent £500 for five years interest free.  Rev. Howitt was the first incumbent of the new church, followed by the Rev. Stuart Wayland.  There is presently £100 in hand towards a schoolroom.  The consecration took place on Friday 25 March, the Feast of the Annunciation of St Mary.  Present were Bishop Kennion; The Registrar, Mr A. Sturcke; Archdeacon Dove; Rev. R.B. Webb, rural dean; Rev. J.H. Williams of Riverton; and Rev. A.G. King, the incumbent.
