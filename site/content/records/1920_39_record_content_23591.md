Mr Thomas Geach had a bad accident at Frank Reed’s property 5 miles north of Burra on Monday 4 July.  He was working at the bottom of a 100ft deep well when a bucket-load of stone and tools fell from the top.  He leapt to one side, but it caught his left arm severing two arteries and breaking it in three places.  He got into the bucket and was hauled up and taken to the Burra Hospital where he is recovering.
