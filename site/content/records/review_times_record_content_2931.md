Burra Burra DC will investigate the possibility of buying land in Burra North as a parking space for heavy transports carrying stock.  Local carrier Mr A. McBride suggested to idea.  Acting District Clerk, Mr R. Walsh, said the idea had the merit of keeping the vehicles off the town streets, increasing their safety and reducing the parking problem.  Council would discuss the matter with the stock firms who owned the land in question.
