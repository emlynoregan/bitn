The Burra Automobile Club took their usual annual trip to Morgan on Friday last.  22 cars started.  The usual stop was made at Mr & Mrs Pearse’s at ‘The Gums’.  In the evening about 20 members of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge attended the consecration of the Nor’ West Bend Lodge and its first installation.  (W.B. Poore)

Others held an entertainment at the Terminus Hotel.  On Saturday morning there was a river cruise on the S.S. Ruby past New Era.  On Saturday afternoon cricket and rifle matches were staged.  On Saturday night the visitors gave a concert in the new Institute and raised £6-10-0 which was divided between the Institute and the local brass band.  They made the run home on Sunday.
