Letter from J. Cooksley re the TSR meeting.  He did not say squatters had had their day, but that the roads had served them up till now and they couldn’t reasonably expect them forever.  He stresses that he supports the cutting up of land left within the line of rainfall [i.e Goyder’s Line] to induce the removal of unfortunate farmers [from beyond it].  Between Porter’s Lagoon and Baldry there are surveyed over 100 blocks averaging 100 acres each which will give 60-70 families an opportunity and there are lots of roads elsewhere.  He does not believe in retaining TSR’s so squatters holding large areas of the backcountry and areas of farming country can move stock between the two.  As for sheep sales: they should be held in the interior country and not require sheep to be brought in for sale.  Trains and three chain roads will suffice for genuine stock movement.
