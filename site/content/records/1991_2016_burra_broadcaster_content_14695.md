Terowie Institute was built in 1879 and has been undergoing restoration.  In 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years $25,000 was spent on replacing the roof, re-wiring and repairing and repainting the interior.  The cost was split between Council and the local community.  The present financial year has seen work focused on the exterior walls and plaster work.  This required $1,110 to be raised locally, plus $1,250 from Goyder Council and a loan from Council of $1,250.
