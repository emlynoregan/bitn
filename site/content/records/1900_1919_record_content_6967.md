Kooringa Methodist Church will stage a Limelight Evening in lieu of a bazaar in the Lecture Hall on Thursday night.  The plates have taken 12 years to collect by Mr Anguin and use an expensive toning system now discontinued due to its cost.  [Advt. on next page gives price as 1/- or a few chairs at 2/-.]
