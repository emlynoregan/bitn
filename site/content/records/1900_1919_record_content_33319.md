Christmas Tree Festival

The Misses Cave have organised a grand Christmas tree at the hospital for several years.  This year the festival took place on Boxing Day.  The tree was erected in the courtyard and was loaded with presents of all descriptions.  Inmates able to be moved were wheeled out and a first class program of songs and music was rendered and gramophone selections were played.  Mr Winnall presided.
