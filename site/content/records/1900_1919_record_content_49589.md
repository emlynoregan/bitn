Mr Sampson Montgomery.

He resides with his son-in-law and daughter, Mr & Mrs Henry Tralaggan of Aberdeen.  He celebrated his 98th birthday on Thursday.  He is active and has never consulted a doctor.  He spends much of his time in the garden and is a great smoker.  He was born in Cornwall in 1819.  His father was in the British Army in the artillery and fought against Napoleon.  He came to SA as an employee of Mr George Fife Angas and is believed to be the last survivor of those who came out on the same boat, the Henry Porch [check this], arriving 1 July 1838.  He became a gardener for a Mrs August in the vicinity of Walkerville before becoming an engineman and fireman for Mr John Dunn.  Mr Montgomery took up land at Dry Creek and after five years moved to the Upper Wakefield District where he stayed until retiring about 25 years ago.  He has lived with Mr & Mrs Tralaggan for 24 years.  In 1849 he married Mrs Harding, a widow whose husband had drowned in the River Torrens.  She died several years ago.  The family are: Robert Montgomery (Jamestown), John Montgomery (Brookton WA), James Montgomery (Aberdeen), Thomas Montgomery (Quorn), Mrs H. Tralaggan (Aberdeen), Mrs James McGowan (Aberdeen) and Mrs W. Dunstan (Broken Hill).
