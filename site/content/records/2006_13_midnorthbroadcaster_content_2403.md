Margaret Walsh is artist of the month.

She has been living in Burra since 2004.

She met Muriel Bence on a visit to Burra and she started to sell Margaret’s work in her gallery.

She makes films, writes poetry and paints and creates jewellery from gum leaves and bark.

She first became interested in art at school.

She has recently been working on a project focused on shopping behaviour and what people throw away.  With others, she has developed a piece of work built from recycled objects.  It is called ‘The Tremendous Tree’ and will be featured on a website and in a publication that Zero Waste SA is planning for late 2007.
