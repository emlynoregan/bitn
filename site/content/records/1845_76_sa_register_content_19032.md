SA Mining Association

The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held in their office on Wednesday 18October.  There was a very large attendance of shareholders including the Directors and Secretary (Hon. Henry Ayers), numbering 40 persons representing 112 shareholders, holding 1929 shares.  The Hon. G.S. Kingston presided.

The reports, having been circulated were taken as read.  The reports were received.

The next matter for consideration was the portion of the report embracing the two proposals for the reconstruction of the Association.  Since the Directors had put forward their proposition they had received from England a letter containing an alternative proposition, which in their opinion was better than the one they had furnished.

Mr Glyde MP asked whether a rough estimate had been made of the value of the buildings etc. erected by the [Kooringa] tenants.  The Chairman said this had not been done and Mr Glyde said he thought it desirable.

The Chairman said that as he viewed the matter it would make no difference that would interfere with the proper consideration of the subject before them.

Mr Glyde said he gathered from conversation with others that there was some confusion with respect to the object in view.  Were they to understand that those shareholders who did not wish to continue in the company would be bought out at £61 per share?  The Chairman said that was correct.

The secretary said that under the scheme in the London offer there would be no additional liability to be incurred and that the offer to any person wishing to retire from the Association the offer was as had been stated.  A question had arisen whether a shareholder contributing in the colony would be entitled to the same privileges as those subscribing in London.  Letters from Mr Beck and Mr Graham had both indicated that shareholders would all be on the same footing.

The matter had been taken up in London because the shareholders there were on the same footing as themselves.  For the last six months although they had 6,000 tons of copper ore the Association was estimated to lose £3,000 in operations.  The Directors thought therefore the time had come when another course should be pursued.  They thought it would be unwise to allow the men employed on the Mine to go elsewhere, but it was more to the interest of the company that the men should be kept on during these times of low copper prices and an endeavour made to develop the portions of the Mine that would yield ores until the price rose to its former position.

The ore discovered in the shallow levels incurred great expense in dressing.  When raised it did not yield more than 4 or 5%, but with rather expensive dressing might be made to yield up to 22%.  If they continued in this way in exhausting the old pitches in a few years they would be left with an empty shell.

Mr Stead asked whether the Mine would be developed without going to the additional expense of purchasing machinery.  The Secretary said further development would require extra outlay.  They had the machinery, but would have to erect it and would have to sink a new shaft and communicate it to Morphett’s Shaft.

Mr Samuel Tomkinson said that after the explanation given by the Secretary it was clear that it would have been advantageous if operations had ceased for the past 12 months because apparently they had been raising ore and giving it away.  He was therefore pleased to receive the original plan proposed by the Directors.

The difference with the proposal from London was that it allowed an opportunity for shareholders who wished it, of retiring from the Association.  He thought the sum of £150,000 was too low, taking the Mine together with the great quantity of valuable land in connection with it.  While it was true the value of the Mine might diminish, nevertheless, £350,477 was not a very large amount if it was a mine at all.  He believed the Karkulto property would permit of development in its present state.  He thought the shareholders needed time to think it over and to communicate with those whom they represented.  This would also allow time for communication with London – say four or five months – to see whether the London promoters would raise their offer to something like a proper amount.

Mr Blyth MP sought clarification.   He understood the London promoters undertook to provide a sum of £70,000 with the view to the formation of a new company.  It was fair to assume then, that under the arrangement proposed the new company expected to realise some degree of profit over and above that which the development of the mine would afford and that they would secure additional profit by putting in the London market so valuable a property as these mines, the reputation of which had become a matter of notoriety.

Was it intended that the profit so arising should be divided among the shareholders who joined the new scheme.  As to the offer of £61 per share for those desirous of retiring from the Association, he thought that by waiting a few months they might get a good deal more than £61 per share.

The Chairman said there was no question that the profits would be divided equally.

Hon. W. Peacock said it must be so or he, as the largest shareholder in the colony, would not consent to the plan.  The Secretary agreed that he was quite sure all shareholders were to be treated equally.

It was resolved that the Directors proceed with the development of the Mine as suggested in the proposition of the Association of 2 October 1865.

Mr Glyde said the price of shares last week was £65, but that had decreased as a consequence of the offer.

Mr Peacock said the London proposal was better for those desirous of retiring from the Association.

Mr Thomas Graves thought it would be an advantage to have gentlemen at home [i.e. in England] to look after the interests of the company.

The Chairman thought it was the intention of the gentlemen in England to issue for every £60 share four of £20 each.  The secretary said it was believed £20 shares would be more suitable for the London Market.

It was resolved that the Directors would communicate with the London gentlemen with a view to their increasing the amount of the offer and that a draft prospectus of the intended new company be transmitted to Adelaide.  In the meantime the representatives of absentee shareholders would consult their principals.
