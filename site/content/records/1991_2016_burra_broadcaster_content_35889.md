Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club

46 dogs are registered for the 2005 training season.

The Club’s head instructor Jo Van Gasteren says this is very pleasing with people coming from as far afield as Blyth, Brinkworth and Gladstone.

Life Membership was given to Instructor Pat Svensdotter last year in recognition of ten years’ service.

Burra Uniting Church Pancake Day effort raised $304, which included a donation from BCS’s Pancake Day.

The proceeds will aid Uniting Care.  [Photo of Helen Dunow and Ron Smedley.
