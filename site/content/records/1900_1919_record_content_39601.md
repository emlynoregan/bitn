‘it is quite time that all Germans holding public positions in this and other States were compelled to vacate those positions and allow men of British Nationality to occupy same.’

Letter from ‘Courtesy’ regarding recent actions of the District Clerk as unpatriotic.

[The paper of the 11 November had reported that the District Clerk had objected to doing what he regarded as the work of the Military Authorities in distributing forms from them to men who wished to volunteer – or at least that seems to be the meaning of the exchange of views as reported.]
