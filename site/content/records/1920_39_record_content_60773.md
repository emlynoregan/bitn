Mr & Mrs Newton King of Melbourne visited Burra on the weekend.  Prior to the Great War Mr King was employed at the National Bank in Kooringa for two years, when Mr Thompson was manager.  On the outbreak of war he enlisted from Burra in the 10th Battalion as a private and rose to become a Captain.  With him was Mr W. Opie whose father was Captain Bennett Opie, who was employed at the Burra Burra Mine with Captain Roach.  He was born in Burra.

[Note that SA Births CD suggests that William Opie was one of a pair of twins born 11 January 1874 at Pittenweem (Hundred of Wallaroo).  Other birth data for the family suggest that only the eldest son was born in Kooringa in 1860 and that by 1862 Captain Opie was at the Yorke Peninsula mines with births registered at Kadina, Wallaroo, Wallaroo Mines, Moonta and Pittenweem.]
