The code word when phoning in was ‘Queen Baker three’, but after two years it was changed to ‘Uncle Oboe eight’.  The most common planes they identified were Tiger Moths and Wirroways (fighter).  After the war they were presented with a certificate as a record in appreciation of their Patriotic Response to the Call of Country.
