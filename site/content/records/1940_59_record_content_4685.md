Pte Charles Kelly received a watch and a parcel of comforts on Friday at a function in the motor sales room of Central Motors, kindly loaned by Mr Cliff Lott when rain and unexpected wintry conditions made the Rotunda an unsuitable venue.  The Mayor presided and also announced that news had been received that Sgt Keith Butler had successfully come through the action at Bardia.  Mr Jennison spoke in support of the Mayor as did Mr H.E. Fuss as Secretary of the RSL.  Wally Lee and Envoy Winfield added their good wishes.
