The Burra Church choir was directed by Mrs Reta Jennison with Mrs Olive Oates at the organ.  Soloists were Mrs Ruth Stolte, Mrs Heather Affolter, Mrs Edith Carpenter and Mr Jack Oates.  The duet part was taken by Mrs Phil Klem and Mrs Elsie Hore with Norman Maxted as narrator.  It will be presented at Burra Church at 11 a.m. next Sunday.

Matron Fyfe thanked everyone for their support.  The major items purchased in the past eight years were a Heart Machine ($3,000), Air Conditioners ($3,520), Sterilizer ($558), Oil Heaters ($470) and Watson Victor Equipment ($6,000), Bedsteads ($4,500), Over bed Tables ($665)and Furniture ($2,000).
