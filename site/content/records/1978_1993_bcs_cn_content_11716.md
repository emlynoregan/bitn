Les Stewart was born in Burra, but went to Adelaide when aged 8.  On 14 January 1941 he was in the RAN and visited Burra to see some relatives while on leave.  He was presented with an inscribed watch.  He made his first return visit last week, along with an aging copy of the Burra Record reporting this and the watch – still in working order and inscribed ‘Presented to L.C. Stewart by Burra Citizens 14-1-41’.
