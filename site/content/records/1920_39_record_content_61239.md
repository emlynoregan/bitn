Burra Town Council, 18 May

The Unemployed Relief Council advises it has blankets for distribution.  Left in the hands of the Mayor.

Saddleworth DC writes seeking support for a sealed road to Burra via Giles Corner, Riverton, Saddleworth and Manoora.

The Mayor said he had also been asked to support the sealing of the route via Kapunda, which seemed to him the better option.

Cr Jennison liked the Kapunda idea, but the other route was better served with garages.

Cr Dow said much had been spent on the Adelaide-Kapunda road, but the Manooran track was nearer.

Cr Jeffery said the Manoora route practically followed the railway line.

It was resolved that at present they could not meet the request without further consideration.

It was resolved to write to the Government seeking a sealed road to Burra as a Centenary project.

The Lord Mayor of Adelaide asked the Mayor to call a public meeting for the purpose of soliciting funds for a memorial to the late King George V.

Cr Dow objected to raising funds for a memorial in Adelaide.

Any action was left up to the Mayor.
