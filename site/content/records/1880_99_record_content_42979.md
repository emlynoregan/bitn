W.H. Hardy writes complaining of the new railway timetable in which the afternoon train which used to go to Adelaide at 4.23 p.m. is now an hour earlier to the great detriment of business in the country.

The editor agrees, especially on sale days when business could not be transacted in time for the stockowners etc. to return home after the sales.  As the colonyâ€™s biggest livestock market Burra deserves more consideration.
