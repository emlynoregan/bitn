Burra Town Council

Cr Lott moved that the Institute Trustees be advised that Council would be prepared to discuss Institute liabilities with the bank, the Minister of Education controlling Institutes and representatives of the Burra Institute – with a view to calling a meeting of ratepayers to put the case and terms to the bank and would be prepared to accept subject to the ratepayers’ approval.

Council is prepared to offer £50 to A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd for the dump that was the subject of a letter from them.

The question of whether to have a deputation wait on the Government with respect to the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry was raised.  The Mayor said State and federal elections has held up a decision and Mr McDonald had undertaken to do as much as possible in the matter.  Cr Lott thought they should be more active in the matter and also in getting a drilling program to test for sulphide deposits at the Burra Mine site.  He said it was believed the owners of the quarry had offered it to the Government at a fair price and it was up to the Government to accept it.  If Burra people kept quiet, so would the Government.  It was resolved that Mr McDonald be written to, to arrange a deputation to see the Minister of Public Works.

Cr Lott on the question of putting a bore in the Mine to test its capabilities sparked a hot argument with the Mayor, who said the Mines Department had done all it could in that direction.  Cr Samuel sided with the Mayor and Cr Lott’s motion failed to get a seconder.

Tenders are to be called for a bridge at Redruth.

Sgt. J. & Mrs Edington and Miss Joan Oates were tendered a social at Redruth Memorial Hall 21 April.  Sgt Edington has been appointed to Murray Bridge.  Joan Oates is to train as a nurse at Glenelg.  She was presented with a travelling rug.  Sgt Edington was presented with a beautiful electric lamp stand.  This had been made by Mr Norrell Baynes from wood from the old Burra Mine. Mrs Edington received a crystal vase.  [Details of speakers etc. are given in ⅔ column.]
