The Mayor’s Report 1905

The change to the financial year to make it coincide with the municipal year will give a better idea of the financial state of Council at the end of a term of office than previously when it ended on 31 December.

At the end of 1904 the general account was in credit £45-16-3 compared with £92-1-10 at the Ratepayers’ Meeting that year.  It is now £47-19-2, showing that the year’s income has been expended.

Work done by ward:

North Ward	£88-11-3	leaving £4-3-11 in hand

East Ward	£109-5-5	leaving £7-6-2 in hand

West Ward	£64-15-9	leaving £7-7-1 in hand

Major salary expenditure was Town Clerk £64-3-4 and Inspector £36-13-4.
