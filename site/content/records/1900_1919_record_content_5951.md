On Methodist Union in 1900 the Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth was closed.  The Union involved some reluctance and it has taken the Jubilee celebrations to complete it in people’s hearts.  The addition of Iron Mine and Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Churches to the circuit has strengthened it.  In the 11 years before the Union the Wesleyan Circuit had a deficiency of £267 of which the Home Mission fund made up £142 and ministers salaries fell short by £125.  The circuit since Union has been in credit.  After Union the Primitive Methodist Church was to be the Sunday school, but this was not at once done and disrepair and interest owed both grew.  Action last January saw new trustees take action and the west wall was taken down as unsafe and the building extended 10 feet to accommodate the Sunday school and it was renamed Jubilee Hall.  A tender by Messrs Launder, Griffiths & Pearce was accepted.  On 7 April not 1d was on hand and it was seen undesirable to increase the debt of £200 on the building.  On 7 May six memorial stones were laid and £52 was raised.  Since then £30 more has been raised and the trustees are anxious to receive the balance speedily.
