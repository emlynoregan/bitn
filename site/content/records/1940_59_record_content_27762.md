The Council has voted to support the attempt by Messrs Freer & Scott of the Burra Passenger Service for permission to run a Sunday road service to and from Adelaide.  It would depart Burra at 2 p.m. on Sunday and leave Adelaide on the return run at 7 p.m.  This would help visitors who could come on the Friday night train and return on Sunday by coach.
