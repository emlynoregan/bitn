Booborowie Railway.

A public meeting was held at Booborowie in the large woolshed, chaired by I.J. Warnes, about a railway to the town.  The meeting considered the three railways under consideration:

Riverton – Clare – Spalding

Saddleworth – Clare – Spalding

Farrell’s Flat – Booborowie – Spalding

The last named was favoured and is 30 miles instead of 50 and it could use the stock route for half the distance and South Booborowie land for the rest.

A second meeting on the same subject was held on Thursday night at Leighton Hall.  Not surprisingly it too favoured the route Farrell’s Flat – Booborowie – Yakilo – Spalding.
