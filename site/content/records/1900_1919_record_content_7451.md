Editorial on The Burra Mine.

Those who recently invested were assured that action would quickly be taken to get the mine producing.  It is months since the bargain was closed and there has been silence.  Copper prices are up and the market outlook is good.  Shareholders need to bestir themselves or the ores will never be disturbed.  The Snow process to treat the ‘dumps’ is not yet a success and it will be some time (if ever) before there is a dividend from that scheme.  Something must be done to foster the mining industry.  The town is becoming poorer every day.  It is only the small capital that prevents action, but that will not grow and we might as well make the best of a bad job and develop the mine as far as possible with the money on hand.  The shareholders will then be content, though perhaps not satisfied that they have got something for their money.
