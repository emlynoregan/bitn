Burra Christmas Shopping

A meeting of local traders on Thursday decided to trade from 7 to 9 p.m. on Friday 23 December and to leave Saturday morning hours to individual choice.  It is believed that most Burra shops will trade on Saturday 24 December and will close on Tuesday 27 December; i.e. will be closed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and re-open on 29 December.  Traders will fund Father Christmasâ€™s arrival on 23 December.
