‘Short & Sharp’

Paull’s shares suffered a great blow on Friday and Saturday, falling as low as £4-5-0.

Fred Robertson Jnr had an unpleasant experience last week when his load of wool capsized due to the bad state of the roads.

The Cinderellas had a ‘rorty-torty’ time at the Institute on Wednesday evening.

Ben Rounsevell is reported to be on his last legs and does not intend to go for Parliament again.

[W.B. Rounsevell survived till 1923!]
