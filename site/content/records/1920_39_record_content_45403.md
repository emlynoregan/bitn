Salvation Army.  The Harvest Festival was held on 12 March conducted by Captain and Mrs J.H.S. Faulds.  It was excellently attended despite Rev. Jarvis’s memorial service being the same Sunday.

The festival continued on Monday 12 March when the Aberdeen Choir under Mr L. Thomas attended.  The festival raised £19.  [Personal interest: Mr Clarrie Fuss entertained with a piano solo all the more appreciated because of the slight indisposition of the piano and later in the program Mr R. Fuss sang The Sinner and the Song.
