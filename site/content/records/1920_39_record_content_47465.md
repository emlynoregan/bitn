Mongolata Goldfield

We hear an option has been taken over 80 acres in the alluvial section and operations there will commence within the month.

The inspection mentioned last week took place.  The party was met by Byles' Mine Manager Mr C.J. Butler at the Bank of Australasia where they inspected a bag of valuable quartz recently obtained.  Mr Warnes estimated the bag contained 140oz.  Mr Butler said 852oz valued at Â£5,710 had come from Mongolata and gone through the bank.
