Seaside Committee met 27 February and reported a credit balance of 171/8 (£8-11-8).  Mr Marston in the chair suggested a longstanding deficiency of £10 due to C.J. Pearce on the Honour Roll be paid off and Mr Fuller so moved.  Carried.  £3-6-4 paid by Mr F. Harris for cleaning the [Kooringa] playground is to be reimbursed.  [It is not clear how £8 was going to do all that!]
