Obituary.  Mabel Caroline Augusta Stolte 19 September 1910 to 2 June 1994.

Mrs Stolte was the daughter of Alfred & Jane Phillips.  She lived all her life in the Mt Bryan District and devoted herself to doing good for everyone.  She attended Mt Bryan School and was later involved in many activities in the town and district.  In younger life she was a capable tennis player, winning a number of trophies.  In October 1934 she married Frederick Charles Stolte in Mt Bryan Methodist Church (now the Sunday school).  They had forty-five years of marriage and raised four children, Beth, Heather, Murray and Jill.  As well as helping her husband on the farm, she cared for her mother in her declining years.  Her culinary and dressmaking skills aided many organisations over the years.  She cooked and sewed for trading tables to raise money for building the Mt Bryan Church and was a long-time member of the Methodist (later Uniting) Church Guild.  She knitted and packed parcels for the FFCF and after the war was a member of the Red Cross and the CWA.  She was a member of the school Welfare Club for many years and a prize winner at many Burra Shows in baking and sewing.  She was a widow for almost fourteen years.  She had eleven grandchildren and fifteen great grandchildren.  [Born and died at Burra.]
