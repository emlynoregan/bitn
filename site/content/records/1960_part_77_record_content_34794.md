Kooringa Flood

This occurred on 8 June and destroyed much property and the loss of a life.  On Whitsunday at about 3 p.m. it grew very dark in the southeast and there were occasional peals of thunder till 6.15 p.m. when a terrific peal broke as if over the mine.  Rail and hail fell in torrents and continued till about 10 p.m. when the heaviest weather passed to the northwest, but the rain continued.  About 3 in the morning huts in the bank were washed in and inhabitants driven out.  About 11 a.m. the Smelting Company’s bridge was washed away and in succession every bridge across the creek.  (They were all wooden bridges in 1851.)  Where the homeless will shelter is a puzzle.  A great many heaps of ore are lost and worst of all one life.  William Box aged 45, a widower with three children: the eldest aged 5 and the youngest a baby in arms, was killed.  His housekeeper says she went to bed about 11 p.m., but the baby was troublesome and she was worried about the floodwaters.  She awoke him and after putting her and the children in a higher house in the bank of the creek, he and a neighbour began removing the furniture.  By 2 a.m. the water was about two feet deep in the hut and while they were removing an article the roof fell in, knocking his comrade on the face.  He managed to crawl away, but Box was thrown onto his back with a large quantity of material on him, so he could not move.  It was daylight before he was got out and the body was taken to the nearest hotel [The Miners’ Arms: now the Burra] to await an inquest.  He apparently had about £400 in the hut.  There are few huts remaining, chiefly near the [old] cemetery.  In Kooringa shops were swamped with the street a complete river.  Last night the street was more than three feet deep by the post office.  A quantity of flour was destroyed and flour was selling for 58/- a bag.  The Smelting Works were stopped for want of fuel.  [It was later rumoured that the £400 had been recovered.]
