Thomas Bath’s Letter

A letter written 116 years ago by Thomas Bath to his mother in England was recently discovered among family treasures in Bournemouth, Hampshire.  Mrs G.G. Halliday, a granddaughter of the writer gave permission for its printing.  Mrs Halliday recently donated to the school the silver trowel used by Thomas Bath to lay the foundation stone of the school in 1877.

Bath St. Kooringa

Oct. 25 1851

Dear Mother,

[Thomas apologises for not writing more often, but says a long letter of July 1850 must have miscarried and the fault is not one-sided, as he has not received a letter for nearly two years.  He then continues:]

A person, who came out in the unfortunate vessel the Naraion, by the name Jennings, told me he had brought a letter for me, but he lost everything but the clothes he was wearing when the vessel ran aground in our gulf.  All hands were landed safely though spread along 200 miles of coast.  One woman died when she fell from a dray on the road to town.

I heard from Jennings that you had heard from brothers John and Henry and that was the first I had heard of them since their arrival in San Francisco, though a great many people are coming back here that went to California about the same time as my brothers.  I hope you will write to me immediately on receipt of this and give me every information about my brothers etc.

I herewith enclose half a £5 note of Bank at East Cornwall.  The other half I will forward by next mail as a precaution in case one of the letters might miss.  I am still at Kooringa as the heading of this letter indicates and the town has gone ahead wonderfully with now a population of 6,000.  We have a church, 2 Wesleyan chapels, an Independent Chapel, Baptist, Primitive, Bible Christian, German Lutheran, Roman Catholic etc.

The Burra Burra Mines are still holding on as well as ever, though not quite as profitable to the shareholders, being unable to declare the usual quarterly dividend of 200% this time due to the long and wet winter.  There are 30,000 tons of ore accumulated at the mine with an estimated value of £120,000.

We have extensive Smelting Works in successful operation, but these too have been idle in winter on account of being unable to get firewood, the roads being in such a wretched state.  Now with the dry weather they are again in full work.  They have 16 furnaces at work.  They principally use coal, part of which comes from England and part from Newcastle NSW.  It is landed at Port Wakefield 60 miles from Kooringa and is carted here at 33/- per ton in winter and 25/- in summer each way, up and down – they take down copper and copper ores.

This summer they will employ all the drays they can get which will be I think about 400 besides their own drays, which is about 150 more.  Their circulation amounts to upwards of £161,320 p.a.

Kooringa has been much affected by the discovery of gold in NSW.  Some 300 persons have gone.  One party of five men left for the gold diggings and returned after ten weeks without any success.  On Friday I saw a man called Hall who left the smelting works when earning 30/- a week and on his return was glad to get the same place at 25/- per week.  Letters from men at the diggings appear very contradictory.

[He mentions as at Sydney diggings: William Dunstan, Willy & Benny Dunstan from Burra, Edward Moyle and William Dower.]
