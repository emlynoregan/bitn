Burra Town Council, 16 July

The Mayor said £10 worth of water had been used on Victoria Park, representing 207,000 gallons and the Football Club paid only £1 for the season.

Cr Kellaway could not see how such a quantity had been used.

Cr Bevan said he had been told the water had been running for some time and had been used to soften the ground for a match.  The expense should not be incurred and he wanted the water shut off.

The Mayor suggested locking the main so that when the club wanted water they had to apply to the Overseer.

The Town Clerk said it was no use placing a locked box there, as it would simply be broken open; they would have to actually lock the tap.

It was resolved on Cr Bevan’s motion that the waste of water be pointed out to the club and they be asked to pay the bill.

It was also resolved to write to the Department objecting to the reading, as it was not possible to have used so much.

The Mayor then reported on the recent visit of the Premier.  In reference to the proposed grant for unemployment the works to be carried out would have to be definitely decided upon.  Application will be made to the Water Supply Dept. to have the reservoir enlarged by 150,000 gallons.  It was resolved to contribute £5 towards the cost of the civic reception, which Cr Jeffery understood to have come out of the Mayor’s pocket.

The Finance Committee report estimated a deficit of c. £250 by the end of November.

Cr Dow said that overall they had done well to end the year with an overdraft not much different from last year and though there was nothing to spend for the rest of the year there was the almost certain grant of £300 from the Government to help them get through.
