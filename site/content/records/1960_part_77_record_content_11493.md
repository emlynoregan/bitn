Burra High School.  A Jubilee Committee has been formed at the school to arrange the celebrations.  The Jubilee Project is the improvement of the playing area.  An expenditure of Â£1,200 is anticipated.  The project includes laying two tennis courts with cyclone wire enclosure (to be used for basketball in winter), and also two half cricket pitches and a sprinkler system to water a grassed area for football, softball and athletics.

The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1931

The staff was E.A. Haese Headmaster, Beryl Dunstan, Olive Prior, Mabel Dunstan & H. Robinson.  On 7 March in a cricket match against Clare Alan Phillips, a left handed bowler took four wickets from four successive balls.  The Government was considering closing country high schools and on 21 July a deputation from Burra High School Council waited on the Minister of Education at Parliament House.

1932

There were no staff changes.  Enrolment was 57.  On 13 February a working bee was organised for improving the Mine Pool.  A path was cut to the edge of the pool and dressing sheds and a safety fence were later erected.  A cricket pitch was prepared for the girls.  On 26 April Lyall Turner broke his arm when he fell from his horse while riding to school.
