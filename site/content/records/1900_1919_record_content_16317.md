J.M. McBride was ‘At Home’ on 12 January to celebrate his 75th birthday.  Five sons and six daughters and their families responded from all over the state to the invitation to attend.  A large picnic tent was erected with a table to seat almost 70.  A sumptuous feast included a large birthday cake.  The five sons and then the sons-in-law sat on his right and the six daughters and four-daughters-in-law sat after Mrs McBride to his left.  42 grandchildren were also seated.
