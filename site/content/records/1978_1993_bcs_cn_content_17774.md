Note.  A reference to Burra Hospital Auxiliary having catered for the State Bank Opening suggests that the new premises were opened in this year.  [There seems to be no other reference, but the State Bank is reported to have bought the site, formerly Matthews Emporium, in October 1987 and by September 1988 the Stationers were moving in next to them.]
