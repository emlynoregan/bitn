Redruth Court.

Drew & Crewes v. Mary Allen for an unsatisfied judgement for £3-10-0.  The case is reported in ¾ column.  Mr Crewes sought imprisonment for disobeying a court order [which had been to pay 1/- a week].  The defendant claimed she was in no position to pay – having no possessions.  She had five children at home – the youngest aged 3, and a husband.  The SM ruled he could not send her to jail.

Mr Crewes also sought £7-12-6 from F. Wheatley as executor of the estate of the late Mr A. Wheatley, with rather more success.

Lucy Gully was charged with the larceny of a bar of soap by Thomas Williams, but the case was dismissed when Williams failed to appear.
