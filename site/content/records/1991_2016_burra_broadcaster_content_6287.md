Come Out ʼ95

‘Over the Top’ was the theme for the local schools’ Come Out ʼ95 Parade through Market Square last Wednesday.  Students from Kindergarten to Year 9 took part in costumes that in some cases were certainly ‘over the top’.  Back at the school the program included:

‘Bad Act’ – A Talent Quest performance by students of Balaklava Primary School.

A shared barbecue lunch.

A clowns’ performance by students from Balaklava H.S.

The week also had visits to BCS by Patricia Mullins, a well-known illustrator of children’s books and Jonathon Harlen, a writer of children’s books.
