Letter.  G. Edwards (Angry Resident) writes complaining of the wanton vandalism in the town and the cowardly acts of malicious damage â€“ the blame is directed at teenagers wandering the streets at all hours, combined with underage drinking and a lack of parental concern and/or supervision.  The town needs to pull together to stamp out such anti-social behaviour.
