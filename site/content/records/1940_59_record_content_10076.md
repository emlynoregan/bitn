Obituary.  Mr Thomas Philip Halls died on Friday.  Halls’ bus service between Kooringa and the Burra station was established well over 50 years ago and until his health prevented it Mr Halls successfully carried on the business he took over from his father.  His death at 56 closes another old established business.  He died at a private hospital in Adelaide.  He was born in Kooringa 24 December 1886 and was the only surviving son of Mrs Isabella and the late Mr T.P. Halls.  He was educated at Burra School and on leaving school assisted his father who at that time owned livery stables.  His late brother Mr Lindsay (Joe) Halls, who passed away in 1928, also assisted.  Prior to their father’s death many years ago, the two brothers carried on the business and there was no better known personality on the Burra Railway platform than ‘Tommy’ Halls.  He will be greatly missed by the travelling community, especially stock owners.  He was always cheerful and obliging and his genial, kind nature was not kept only for the travelling public.  Many acts of generosity and kindness have been done by him, known only to a few.  He would canvass quietly for the poor and needy and hand the proceeds over to a trusted friend to use on their behalf, taking no credit to himself.  All kinds of sport had his support and interest.  The local Red Cross will miss him, as he took all their parcels, and they were many, to or from the station free of charge.  His rival and friend Mr Alex Bevan has carried on this service since Mr Halls’ illness and intends to continue.  His final illness has extended over some months and he faced his end with courage and without a murmur.  He is survived by his mother and sisters, Mrs Charles J. Pearce of Strathalbyn and Mrs P.W. Lindsay of Croydon.  He left a grown-up family and his son Robert attended the funeral, which was largely attended.  Members of the Buffalo Lodge formed a guard of honour.

[Born 20 December 1886, Kooringa: died 1 May 1942, Northfield, residence Kooringa.]
