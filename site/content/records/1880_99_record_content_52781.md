Tramps.  Several tramps are causing trouble in town at present.  One tried to gain access by knocking on a door at 2 a.m. last Sunday morning and was with difficulty repelled by a woman who answered the door.  On Sunday night the same or another fellow sought admittance at the house stating he was a policeman.  Police were called, but the miserable creature had escaped.
