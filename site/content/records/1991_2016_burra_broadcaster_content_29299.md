David Merrill & Tracy Starr as proprietors of the Kooringa Hotel write expressing their concern that on 26 October a person bought alcohol and supplied it to a group of teenagers outside the hotel.  On this occasion the alcohol was taken back and the money refunded to the purchaser, who was then reported to the police.  The people involved will also be barred from the hotel.  Any future instances of this nature will be reported to the police.  Teenagers loitering around the hotel will be asked to move on and provisions of the Liquor Licensing Act 1997 will be enforced.
