Burra Hospital Board is concerned that by mid-August they had no indication of the basis for deciding what the 1994-95 budget would be, let alone how much.  The Board is reviewing the administration of the hospital following the resignation of John Chilton as CEO.  In the interim Mrs Lesley Phillips, Director of Nursing will be the acting CEO.
