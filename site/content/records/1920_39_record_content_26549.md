Frank Treloar writes expressing surprise at the Councillors’ reactions to the combined letter presented at the last meeting.  Crs Allen & Collins gave the impression that it had come out of the blue and took offence at its sudden and unjustified appearance.  In fact Cr Collins had seen it at Mr Treloar’s office and it had been explained that it intended in no way to belittle the Councillors.  He promised to explain this to Cr Allen and a few days later Treloar met Cr Allen and explained the matter to him.  He says that shortly after Cr Collins’s appointment they had inspected streets together and yet each Councillor had at the meeting denied any knowledge of it.  The mayor’s remarks were entirely uncalled for.  Apparently the correct procedure is to line up with kneelers en masse and ‘in a supplicating attitude; presented our letter and waited patiently through their deliberations until allowed to retire, glad to be alive’.
