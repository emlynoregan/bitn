Burra Hospital, like others in the state, is finding it difficult to survive financially in a time of rising wages and other costs.  Mr F.T. Marston, the Council’s representative on the Board, said to Council that he believed the present system of financing hospitals was out of date.  The matter needs to be taken up by the Local Government Assoc.  The Federal Government hasn’t increased its payment of 8/- a day towards patient costs for many years.  Councils need to be empowered to strike a special rate for hospitals, which should be subsidised £ for £ by the State Government.  It is a scheme that would provide a much needed stability for hospital finances.
