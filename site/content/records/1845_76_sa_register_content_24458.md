SAR Main North Line Trains

‘Convenience and Economy’ of Riverton complains of the inconvenient timetable on the line.  The writer suggests a timetable that would give convenient two trains a day each way without accommodation costs and suggests also that they be mixed trains as on the Kapunda line, which would do away with the goods train.
