Burra Town Council, 7 May

Burra Electric supply wrote agreeing to light the Rotunda without charge if the Council bore the cost of connection.

Burra Golf Club was given permission to erect a galvanised iron structure on the Burra Sports Syndicate Ground at Aberdeen.  [A club house.]

It was agreed to donate £1-1-0 to the News Blanket Fund.

Cr Kellaway moved the Council sell the Kooringa Tennis Courts to the club for £25.

The Mayor and Cr Riggs thought two motions were necessary: one to sell and one to fix the price.

Cr Jeffery seconded the motion.

Cr Bevan repeated his objections to Sunday sport and said he saw the Club’s request as a move to move in that direction and he believed a 99-year lease was quite sufficient, as at the Aberdeen courts.

Cr Kellaway objected that Cr Bevan’s remarks were irrelevant.

The Mayor pointed out that the Aberdeen courts were on park land and so could not be sold.

Cr Sampson was opposed to the sale; seeing it as a plot to override the wishes of some of the Councillors.

Crs Dow, Jeffery & Kellaway supported the motion; Crs Bevan, Riggs and Sampson were opposed.

The Mayor explained his position at some length before casting his vote against the motion.
