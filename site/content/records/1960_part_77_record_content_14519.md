Weather.  December 1962 was the wettest on record with district falls ranging from 2 inches to 6 inches.  Burra had rain from the Sunday before Christmas to the following Sunday.  Christmas day was wet and cold and many people sat around fires.  Burra rain: 24th 18 points, 25th 0, 26th 124, 27th 30, 28th 64, 29th 151, 30th 0, 31st 58 points for a total of 445 points for the week and 456 for the month.  The previous wettest December was 426 points in 1929. The yearly total was 20.11 inches for 1962; about 2 inches above average.

This rain damaged wheat crops, where some grain gas shot in the heat.  Some bagged wheat has also shot and will need to be re-bagged.  Considerable reaping is yet to be done and damage there is yet to be assessed.  From Burra to Saddleworth farmers report bleaching of wheat, with one bag in nine lost on account of weight.  In the pastoral country the rain was welcomed.  Some areas had not had significant rain for three or four years.  Falls to the 31 December: Oakbank 525 points, Pine Valley 411, Kia Ora 340, Poonunda 584, Oakvale 561, Woolgangi 480 and Koomooloo 402.  Practically all dams are full.
