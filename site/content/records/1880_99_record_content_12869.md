Editorial on the SA Election, which was then half way through. [Not all constituencies voted on the same day.]  The Ministry is back except for the Treasurer, but there will be many new faces in Parliament.  (Six new members are provided for by the Constitution Act.)  The Exhibition is doomed and so is Local Option, at least in the extreme sense some sought.  Payment for members is likely to pass.

2nd Leader explores the role of the editor in election campaigns.  The writer says he should be quite neutral or impartial with respect to facts and in publishing letters, but he must be a man of convictions who is willing to publish his judgements and views.

An Election Meeting at the Institute tomorrow evening will hear Dr Cockburn speak.

Burra Institute Committee last Tuesday recommended a ‘Crysanthemun Show [sic] and promenade concert’ to raise money for hall funds.
