Burra Town Council, 18 March

The Burra Buffalo Lodge sent an amount of £3-14-10 from a recent sports day to aid Victoria Park.

Burra Cricket Club was refused permission to use Victoria Park to play a game versus Largs Bay on Sunday.

The Mayor said that to grant permission would be to infringe Council by-laws.

Cr Bevan supported the request, saying other towns permitted Sunday play.

Cr Kellaway said it was their duty to refuse the application.

Cr Bevan said it was ridiculous when they all knew that the club would simply go to the other end of town and play the match on another oval.  Their attitude was holding the town back.

Cr Jennison would rather not see the town advance if it had to depend on Sunday sport to do so.

The Mayor said the Tennis Club had built courts at the other end of town because Sunday play was not allowed on Council property.

Cr Kellaway’s motion to refuse the application was carried.

Permission was granted to have Part Allotments 292 & 293 in George Street subdivided into four blocks.

[Two blocks on the northwest corner of Mitchell Flat and George Street.]

A deputation from Revs Cowle, Barrett, Hobbs and Captain Cox to protest against the opening of a betting shop in Burra was heard.

They claimed a betting shop would:

Be detrimental to sporting activity by keeping people away from playing areas and events.

Be detrimental to national efficiency.

Lead young fellows to place their bets and then go to the hotels to drink and listen to the race because no wirelesses were to be allowed in the betting shop.

Refusal would safeguard the moral and spiritual welfare of the coming generation.

[The report on the deputation and some subsequent debate extends for 1¼ columns.]

Mr S.C. Genders was farewelled as manager of the National Bank on Wednesday and the new manager Mr L. Hawke was welcomed.

Mr Genders had been transferred to Nailsworth and was given a farewell at the Kooringa hotel on Thursday.  He had been in the town for ten years and had taken a role in a number of committees.  The Mayor spoke in commendation of his service.  He was also a past President of the Burra RSL and in the war had been Chief Warden for the Civil Defence.  Mr Glen Finch spoke for bank clients.  Mr Jennison spoke for the Burra Welfare Committee, Mr McGrath for local bankers and Mr Dobson for the Bank of Australasia.  The Mayor presented Mr Genders with an envelope containing an appreciable sum and Mr Genders replied appropriately.

Mr A.E. Smith, Federal Member for Wakefield gives details of how land can be held for returned servicemen and states that financial aid is available to avoid the sort of cases of their being outbid as were recently reported.

[Details in ½ column.]

‘Mother of Ten’ writes recalling the Revue Co. in Burra was squashed by the unprovoked attack led by one of the Councillors on the grounds of its producing ‘shady shows’.  It showed signs of improvement.  Then last year came the Dramatic Club, which had a commendable production for the town’s centenary, but where is its continuing output as promised?
