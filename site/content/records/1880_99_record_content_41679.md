Daviestown to be called Hanson.

[This cryptic comment is not elaborated upon and needs some explanation.

The town was first offered for sale in 1865 as Davies, named after Sir Richard Davies Hanson (1805-76), former Chief Justice of SA.  The official renaming seems not to have taken place till 19 Sep. 1940.  In the 19th century the place was commonly referred to as Daviestown, Davies Town, and Davieston which led to possible confusion with Daveyston in the Hundred of Nuriootpa.  To add to the confusion in 1870 the next town south on the railway line was surveyed and named Hanson.  This name was changed officially in 1940 to Farrell Flat, though the name for the railway station there had always been Farrell’s Flat.  References to Hanson before 1891 actually apply to Farrell Flat which explains why the hotel there was until relatively recently the Hanson Hotel.  In the 1890s Davies is sometimes called Hanson and so is Farrell Flat, but by about 1901 the modern usage had settled down, but why it took until 1940 to be gazetted officially is a mystery.  The apostrophe ‘s’ appears to have officially been dropped from Farrell’s Flat in 1940, but it remained at the station till somewhat later.  See Manning: Place Names of SA.]
