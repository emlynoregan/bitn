Burra Town Council

Once again Cr Dow took up the issue of tree planting for West Ward.  At the last meeting of Council he got a motion passed that 80 more trees be planted in West Ward.

A report from Mr Fairchild showed plantings to date:

There was in addition the Creek Plantation with 101 planted and 217 to be planted.  This was in East Ward.

A further question revealed that some of the ‘not in guards’ trees above had not actually yet been planted.

Cr Dow was annoyed if it were true that explosives had been used near Cr Jennison’s [in North Ward] to make holes for trees, because the cost of explosives had been cited as a reason for not proceeding with plantings in West Ward.

No one else could or would confirm that explosives had been used.

Cr Dow moved that 80 trees be planted in Church, Ware and Kangaroo Streets, Justice Lane and the south end of Hill Street.  Carried.

[Presumably these are the 80 referred to at the beginning of the report.]
