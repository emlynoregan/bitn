Henry Shipway of 27 Paxton Square was 93 on Saturday last.  He was born at Leighterton Gloucestershire 4 February 1840 and at an early age went to work for 1/6 a week.  He migrated to SA aged 16 in 1856 and began driving bullocks at 8/- a week.  At harvest he got Â£1 a week for cutting the crop with a sickle and threshing with a flail.  He later worked on the railways at 6/- a day for construction work.  He married at 25.  In a depression he had a family of 5 to provide for and had to work at 3/- a day for a 10-hour day.  Later he got a team of bullocks and carted fire wood and other timber to Mt Barker.  He then took land at Hawker, but due to adverse seasons had to work for the Council and eventually had to give up the land.  His wife died about 18 years ago and he came to Burra about then.  He had eight daughters and three sons.  Four daughters and one son have died.  He goes to Adelaide twice a year.  His mother lived to 92; though his father died at 60.  He was not a smoker and while not a teetotaller was never drunk.  For many years he was a member of the Salvation Army, but is now too deaf to attend.
