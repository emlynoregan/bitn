Sydney Ram Sales.  15 Koonoona Rams sold for an average of 166 guineas each.  Three specials on offer averaged 370 guineas each.  John Collins & Sons got top price on the day of 310 guineas and might have got more had the ram been offered earlier.  Messrs C. & E. Murray withdrew their rams from the sale and sold privately.
