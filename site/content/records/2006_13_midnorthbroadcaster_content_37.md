Nathaniel O’Brien (10) has been at the Tamworth Country Music Festival 20 -29 January.  He says he has learnt a great deal from the highly competitive experience.  He was a grand finalist in the competitions: ‘The Vault’, Cavalier’s Cutting Edge Music Talent Search, Capital Country Music Association’s National Talent Quest and the Manilla and Districts Country Music Association Annual Talent Quest, in which he received three awards.  He also enjoyed busking in the streets of Tamworth.  He thanks all who supported him so that he could attend.  He travelled with his parents Danny and Karen and fellow young singer, Candy Latham.
