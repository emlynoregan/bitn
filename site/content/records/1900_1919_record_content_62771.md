Soldiers’ Aid Soc.  70 members went out for a picnic at the Gorge on 11 November.  Mr I.J. Warnes lent his lorry and trailer for the occasion.  The morning was cool and threatening, but the afternoon proved ideal.  At 11 a.m. along the road the National Anthem was sung and two minutes silence observed.
