Accident.  A B-double stock crate rolled over near the corner of Ludgvan and Sancreed Streets on Monday 26 July, just before 4 p.m.  The truck flipped onto its side, skidded along a retaining wall and then took out the verandah of the ‘Olive Grove Retreat’ bed and breakfast and residence.  [Formerly the Courthouse Hotel.]

SES, CFS and Police arrived within minutes.  The driver sustained non-life-threatening injuries.  45 cows were rounded up and turned into a nearby paddock.  15 cows were humanely destroyed.  Two cranes were brought in to right the truck.

[The first sentence might lead you to think the vehicle was coming from the east, but the 3 photos indicate it was coming from the west and failed to take the curve at the end of the old Redruth Bridge.]
