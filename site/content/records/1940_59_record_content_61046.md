Burra Town Council, 19 October

Lot 146 conveyed to the Council by J.G. Terry is not a valid transfer, as J.G. Terry did not hold the legal estate.

The Council will have to establish title by possession.

The tender of E.L. Steer for £49-15-0 was accepted for the redecoration of the Town Hall foyer.

The tender of E. & J. Carpenter of £130 for repairing and painting the house at the Town Hall was accepted.
