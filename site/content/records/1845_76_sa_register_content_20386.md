SA Mining Association

The AGM of shareholders of the Association was held on 17 April with Hon. G.S. Kingston in the chair.

The report was taken as read.

The production of copper had been almost as much as the preceding six months; 2,534 tons of ore being raised.  Despite this the Directors said that although they had cut costs the falling value of copper forced them to order the discontinuance of mining from 28 March.  They decided to limit operations to the keeping of water out of the principal workings, sinking Graves’ new engine shaft and washing and dressing low class ore in the Burra Creek.  Active working is not suspended because ore is exhausted, but merely because it cannot be raised profitably while the copper price remains at its present level.  The time may soon come when lower transportation costs or lower dressing costs or a higher copper price or a combination of these may again make it profitable to work the mine.  In the meantime expenses will be kept as low as possible.

The financial statement showed a probable loss on the last year’s operations of £7,389.

E.C. Homersham wondered whether an attempt had been made to save money by the men working eight hours a day instead of six.  The Chairman said they already worked eight hours a day as was usual there and in other mines.

The Secretary Mr Ayers said the wages earned by miners in the past six months had averaged less than £1-14-0 a week.  The question of wages had been considered carefully and there was not much chance of a reduction.  He said there was no use raising ore and exhausting the mine without profit.  They had raised nearly 2,500 tons averaging 22%, but had received no dividends since December 1864.  A sum of £21,640 had been transferred from the stock account to the profit and loss account.  Operations would continue in Graves’ New Engine Shaft and dressing of low grade ores in Burra Creek.

The last sale of 200 tons of copper was made at £78 per ton, which was £17 less than the rate in 1864.

The Directors had sold only one of the properties they had permission to dispose of and the terms were not such as to justify selling any more.  Mr Tomkinson hoped that the remaining running expenses might be met from the proceeds of the halvins.  He also thought it a pity the mine had been carried on for two years when the ore was simply being given away.  He felt new discoveries might well prove to be cheaper to mine and so see the operation at a profit within a moderate period.

The retiring Directors Messrs Thomas Graves, Arthur Blyth, George Strickland Kingston, John Beck and Thomas Greaves Waterhouse, were re-elected.

The fee for Directors attendance at a meeting was reduced for one guinea to half a guinea.
