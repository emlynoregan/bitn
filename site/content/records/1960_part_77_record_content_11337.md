Booborowie Pictures were shown regularly, but with falling attendances they first became irregular and then ceased.  Now the Hall Committee has decided to begin pictures again and to show the films themselves.  It cannot continue unless it pays, so locals are encouraged to give their support.  Good films have been booked fortnightly for the next six months.
