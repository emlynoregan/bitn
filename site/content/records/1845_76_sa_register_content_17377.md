SA Mining Association.  [Editorial]

The 19th annual report of the SA Mining Association was adopted at the annual meeting of shareholders on 20 April.  The Directors state that the productiveness of the Burra Burra Mine, though not quite equal to the yield of former times, is nevertheless very considerable.  In the six months to 31 March the quantity of ore raised was 3,952 tons at an estimated 22½%.  Financial statements show the position of the Association on 30 September 1863.  In the six months to that date ore raised was 4,131 tons at a cost of £10-2-1 per ton.  The produce thus raised realised £55,700-16-2 or £13-9-8 per ton and yielded a profit of £13,956-16-5 or £3-7-7 per ton.  The total profit was within a few hundred pounds of that estimated by the Directors in their last report.
