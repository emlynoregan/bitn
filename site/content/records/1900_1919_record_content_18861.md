In general the paper was of fairly poor quality.  Events that were foreshadowed were not always subsequently reported.  The Council received perfunctory treatment: perhaps because it went so smoothly.  ‘They Say’ & ‘Short & Sharp’ columns contained references to matters that could have been developed and which locals probably knew about, but are now obscure.  There are many items that are essentially fillers.  The actual printing is also poor with many pages faint and hard to read and the type size is very small and must have been hard to read by the artificial lights in use at the time.
