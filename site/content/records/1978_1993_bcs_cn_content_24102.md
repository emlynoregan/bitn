BCS.

To coincide with Open Day and Night last Wednesday a group of students from Years 3 to 7 began broadcasting during recess and lunch times on a station they have named 5BC.  It will operate on two days a week and can be heard in the gymnasium and outside near the canteen.  Equipment is basic at the moment and we are on the lookout for a tape deck, turntable and CD player.

The Junior SRC has donated $200 for purchasing extra gear.

As an extension to this a public meeting is planned later this month to discuss the possibility of establishing a community based FM radio station for Burra.
