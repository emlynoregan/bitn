Editorial on the Eastern Railway. The editor is an advocate for developmental lines which would raise the value of the Crown Lands to be offered for sale. He suggests a railway from Burra in the direction of the new eastern road from Redruth and so over the land to the north and east towards the Darling, or from Eudunda north-east just outside the Hs. of Bright and Baldina.
