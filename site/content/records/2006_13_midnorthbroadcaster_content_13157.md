Peter Batten writes expressing his displeasure at the big new shed being erected on Mt Pleasant behind the former Old Wares and Antiques Shop.  How can a two storey high (7 m) shed be erected above our heritage listed commercial area?  Shame on the owners for not discovering a more suitable site and shame on our town elders for giving approval.
