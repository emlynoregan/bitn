Burra Town Council, 17 September

The Unemployed Relief Council confirmed that the money was to be allocated on the basis that each married man is to be given four days’ work and after that each single man is to get one day’s work.  Any balance after that is to be balloted for by married men with three or more children, but added that of thought fit a portion of the grant could be used for people in need and yet not on the ration list.

Cr Kellaway moved that deserving men not on rations be included and this was passed.

There was a proposal from Inspector Davis of the Highways Department that the Department wished to give the loose road idea a trial from the end of the present bitumen to the south boundary of the Corporation near Jeffrey & Byrne’s slaughterhouse.  This length of about 60 chains would be scarified and a road formed with a low crown.  It would be rolled in and two yards of slag per chain would be spread over it.  Government Grants had allowed £100 for the work.

The Mayor argued against it, as the road was good now.

The Town Clerk did not like the loose road idea either.

Cr Kellaway said a loose road was classed as a non-slip road and as the Department was paying, it would be as well to give it a trial.  If it were unsuccessful the Department would have to restore the road.

Cr Riggs thought it a good idea and the suggestion was accepted.

Three minutes’ silence was observed in memory of the late Frank Treloar and a letter of condolence sent to his family.

Hallett Pastime Fair in aid of the Church of England Building Fund was held last Saturday in the Institute and £60 was raised.  [Report in c. 1 column.  On page 3 of the next issue Mrs Melrose reports receiving another £3-3-0 to bring the total raised to £54-11-11.  If this is correct the previously mentioned £60 appears to have been a gross figure rather than the nett proceeds.]
