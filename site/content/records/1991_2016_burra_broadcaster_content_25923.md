Fossil Discoveries east of Burra by local amateur palaeontologist Robert Heading have been confirmed by Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University as the skull of a Tasmanian Tiger or Thylacine.  The age of the bones has not yet been determined, but the thylacine died out on the mainland three or four thousand years ago.
