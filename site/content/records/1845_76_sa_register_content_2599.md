The Directors have issued a Notice concerning this:

‘The Directors having understood, that the answer to the petition of the Tributers, forwarded by them about three weeks since had not been communicated to them, by the late Superintendent, hereby subjoin a copy of the answer of the Board to that Petition:

‘Tributers’ Petition – I have to request you to inform the men, that the difference in their assays is not the result of any undervaluing of ours, but is from the fact of the party, who has hitherto assayed, being in the habit of making them greater than they really are.  The Directors wish them to be informed that their wished will be complied with, with these alterations from their proposals, that the re-trial be made only when the samples differ by more than three per cent., three per cent. and  under to be divided; that the result of the private sample be given to the Captain before our sample is published; and further the Directors order, that in no instance will they settle upon a certificate of assay from ________  ________  With these alterations, the Directors will willingly pay what is fair in price, if the ores are wanting in produce, more than this the men cannot expect.

Published by order of the Deputation of Directors, (Signed) Henry Ayers, Secretary,

Burra Burra Mines September 18th 1848.’
