Redruth Primitive Methodist Church had special services on 6 & 7 August in aid of the Kooringa Manse Fund.  Rev. E. Masterman of North Adelaide preached on Sunday and his address at Monday’s tea meeting was on ‘Missionary Life and Labours in London’. 

A second tea meeting was held on Tuesday.  Proceeds of about £30 bring the total raised for house enlargements for the past three months to £130.
