The Old North Road

[This article is on the follow-up meeting held at Grotegut’s Gawler Belt Inn on 18 May.  The meeting is extensively reported and though there were more speakers and much greater detail is given, it is essentially a repeat of the arguments in the report of 13 May.]

The Old North Road

A very vigorous meeting was held at the North Star Inn at Templers on Thursday last of upwards of 100 farmers to consider the road from Gawler to Gilberton.

[The arguments paralleled those noted for the meeting at Gawler Belt.  Some noteworthy examples of the problems are mentioned:

Mr Woods had taken two days with 12 bullocks to get 12 bags of corn ten miles.

Mr Newman: ‘Once was bogged on the Saturday and it took 20 bullocks and the best part of Sunday to get unbogged.  Was once capsized in a Government waterhole with a load of flour and a fine piece of pastry it produced. On another occasion had a load of beer and wine and bottles drowned and in fishing for them half a day caught a cold and a full suit of mud.]
