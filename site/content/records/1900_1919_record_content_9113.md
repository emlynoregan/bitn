A Mystery.  On Monday afternoon Mr Frank Ford reported to M-C Phelan that his children had found a man’s hat and coat under the main bridge at Diprose’s about two miles east of Burra.  The police also found a bundle of torn up letters.  The letters appear to be to Albert Burgess from a Sophy Watson and were most affectionate.  There were also a number of destroyed photographs of various people.  A crucifix and Australian Catholic prayer book were also found on the ledge that carries the bridge.  The creeks and waterholes have been searched, but neither the man nor a body have been found.  The items appear to have been placed there about Sunday last.  Mr Rowe, head drover of Mutooroo Station, believes A.B. Burgess is a drover engaged on Buckalow Station and will make enquiries on his way home.
