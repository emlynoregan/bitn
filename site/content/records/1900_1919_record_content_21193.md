Christmas Holidays in Burra.  Christmas Day was very hot and Boxing Day was one of the worst for many years.  There was a hot sultry and windy morning, but in the afternoon the change came with thunder, lightning and a short, heavy shower of rain.  The weather was cooler from then on.  Christmas Eve had not been as bustling as the previous year, but trade was better.  The Salvation Army serenaded at various places with carols.
