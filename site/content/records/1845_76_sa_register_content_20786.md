Kooringa News, 19 June

Heavy rain began on Saturday and lasted till Wednesday morning 19 June.

Last Thursday Mr Smelt, a former teacher near Adelaide and afterwards at Burra, left Fingerpost Run with a flock of sheep for World’s End Station.  He has not been heard of since and in this bad weather fears were held for his safety.  A strict search failed to find him.  The roads are virtually impassable.

Editor: since receiving the above report a telegram has arrived from the correspondent saying Smelt arrived at World’s End Run on Tuesday evening, having lost his way.

William Yahn, a miner placed an axe on the roof of his pigsty, so as to be out of the reach of his children.  The son of William Hocking, a fruiterer, climbed up and got it down.  He then told Yahn’s son to place his foot on a stool and then chopped off two of his toes, saying: ‘There I owed you that.’  Medical assistance was obtained and the toes were re-attached, but with what success only time will tell.

Obituary.  A son of Mr Rogers of Gum Creek aged 19, who was a strong athletic young man, took cold and died after a fortnight’s illness.  [William Rogers died 14 June 1867 at Gum Creek aged 19.  He was probably born 4 May 1848 to Richard and Ann nee Bennetts, as two siblings were born at Gum Creek.]

Obituary.  Michael Stephens, an old miner has died.  [Michael Stevens died 17 June 1867 at Kooringa aged 53.  BISA says he was Michael Stephens born about 1815 in Devonshire and arrived in SA in 1855.]

After a long period without water the Burra Creek has been flowing and is interfering with jigging operations to extract ore from the waste sand.  The recovered ore is averaging 19½%.

The guarantee of the promoters of the Burra Grammar School has now expired.  Three years ago thirty persons guaranteed 12 guineas a year to start the school under Rev. L.W. Stanton MA, who was brought from England to superintend it.  The scheme has been a failure, though Mr Stanton’s services have been secured for a further six months on a smaller guarantee.  It is unfortunate that a superior school under a thoroughly efficient teacher should go down for want of support.
