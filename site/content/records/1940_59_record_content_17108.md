The freezing Works Commission visited Burra last Friday.  The Commission of five members was led by Mr G.A.W. Pope.  The Mayor put forward the advantages of Burra as a location for the works.

There would be plenty of labour available.

There were many Master-Merino Stud Breeders within 10 miles.

Potential existed for increased local breeding of lambs, pigs and the production of milk.

Water was readily available.

A site close to the railway station was available that was also close to the stockyards.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. could provide the power required.

Drainage was good.

Burra exported 230,000 forward to fat sheep p.a.

54,000 gallons of cream

13,000 pigs

300 tons of rabbits
