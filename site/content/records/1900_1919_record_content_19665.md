W.A. Horn has cabled from London his intent of exercising his option.  Under the terms of option he will spend a considerable sum prospecting and may subsequently purchase at a price agreed upon.  The first copper was found in 1845 and in 29½ years the company expended £2,241,170 and raised copper worth £4,749,224.  In 1859 1,170 men were employed.  Active operations ceased in 1877, but at different periods some work has been carried on.  The property is now in the hands of a local company.
