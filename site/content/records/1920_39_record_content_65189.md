 Burra Town Council, 21 December – Burra Swimming Pool

 Solicitors for the Savings Bank of SA write asking whether the increase of the loan from £400 to £500 has been advertised, as it was necessary to do so in both the Government Gazette and the local paper.

 Cr Worth thought that as there was no hope of getting any real revenue from the pool this year, it would be better to let the matter drop and make an early start to have it opened early next season.

 The Mayor was fed up with the whole thing.  Delay followed delay as one thing followed another.

 He said a start could be made very shortly and that it was unfortunate that they had applied for £500.

 Discussion followed and eventually the consensus was that they could borrow £400 without further trouble.

 Cr Jennison was anxious to get started.

 Cr Kellaway moved that arrangements be made to borrow the £400.

 Cr Dow said the motion to borrow £500 was out of order as the previous one to borrow £400 had not been rescinded.

 The Clerk confirmed that no notice had been published about the £500 loan.

 The Mayor said he would like to see a full Council present before anything definite was decided.

 Cr Dow agreed with Cr Jennison that they needed to act.  They had been talking for six months.

 It was unanimously agreed to borrow £400 as originally intended and they would meet immediately to choose a site.

 With respect to the Mine Bridge Inspector Davis had made a fresh survey and would send up the necessary specifications and tenders would be called.
