North Ward Ratepayers’ Meeting.   Held in the German Schoolroom, Redruth, Monday.

The Mayor took the chair.

Mr W. Pearce alone came forward.  There seem to have been no questions directed to him.

Mr Brown thought retiring members should speak.

Cr Tiver thought the meeting was to hear from candidates.

Cr Ridgway wished to say a few words.  A good deal of discontent had existed in Council and outside as to his position.  He asked whether the money had been well spent in the last year.  Discontent came from places where it was spent, but they could not spend £1 in two places. Some of the work was against his will.  They had wanted to make some streets on Redruth Hill, but Council insisted on Railway Terrace.  If the ratepayers wished it, he wanted to resign.  He was not ready to fight for right against wrong simply as he had been.  He did not want to create discord in Council or among his neighbours.  He valued his rest and quiet.  ‘In the morning he had been sat [sic - perhaps set?] on and insulted by a person now in the room in a savage manner.’  He had also been set upon in Council.

Mr Fuss asked why the Council opposed the work on the hill - he could not see the utility of doing it at all.

Mr Ridgway said the Council forced the work elsewhere which used the men and money.

Mr Wells asked if the Council also forced the work by Mr Ridgway’s.  The money spent there would have made a footway up the hill where there was traffic.

Crs Ridgway, West, Tiver and the Mayor thought the Council did order it.  Cr Sampson said it was not in the minutes.

Mr Pinch wanted to know whether the piping, standpipes and gates round the reserve had been paid for by Mr Ridgway.

The Mayor said they had been ordered and paid for by Council.

Mr Wells wondered if other people would be treated the same way and be provided with drying grounds.

The Mayor deprecated the trend of the discussion.

If they were dissatisfied they should accept Cr Ridgway’s suggestion and nominate someone else.

Cr Tiver proposed Mr Wells.

Mr Wells wanted time to consider - he said he was over age.

Mr Lane thought only Council could accept the resignation.

The Mayor agreed.

Cr Ridgway said he wanted them not to torment him another year and desired they ask him either to resign or to continue in office.

Cr Tiver thought it unkind of Mr Wells to raise matters without notice.

[In view of Cr Ridgway’s claim below that he had his resignation already written out, these questions may not have been so completely without notice as Cr Tiver suggests.]

The Finance Committee had done sterling work and the finances were never in a healthier state.  In the year the North Ward had made 107 chains of new road and 183 chains of footways, had maintained 23 chains of road and 32 chains of footways, and spent not less than £300 in various parts of the town.  Had Mr Wells waited on Council they would have done what he wanted.

(Mr Wells protested that he had spoken repeatedly to both Councillors.)

Mr Fuss would like to know where the work had been done: it was all-lopsided.

The Mayor said it was about equal in Redruth and Aberdeen.

Mr Fuss said he had assured himself there was much discontent and those who complained had acted honourably in saying so.
