Attempted Suicide.  Last Friday the three small children of Fanny McWaters missed their mother and despite a search and enquiries could not find her.  In the early hours of Saturday morning they found her bed not slept in and began looking again at dawn.  They eventually went to a well in Paxton Square at the rear of the house and found their mother at the bottom.  They informed Mr Luke Day, who sent one to the police and returned to the scene.  M-C Clarke was lowered, but when at the bottom could do little as he had put his shoulder out in descending.  J.H. James of Kadina assisted.  M-C Clarke was brought up and then Mrs McWaters.  She said she had jumped in because she was starving and Cummings, with whom she had been living, was coming home.  So much rubbish had been thrown down the well that there was a surface layer over the water that supported her.  Even so it is remarkable that she survived given the rocky projections on the walls.  Dr Sangster sent her to the hospital when she had been extricated from the bedsteads, tubs, kerosene tins and broken bottles at the bottom.  Her injuries proved to be minor.
