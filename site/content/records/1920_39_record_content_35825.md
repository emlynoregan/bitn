Obituary.  William John Bundy [sic] of Torrensville, who with his brother-in-law Frederick May [sic] of Thebarton, was killed on Saturday night at Cavan crossing near Pt Wakefield was a cousin of L. Penrose of Kooringa.  Many of the Boundy [sic] family were residents of Burra in the early days.

[This seems to have been at Cavan on the Pt Wakefield Road where a railway line crossed to the abattoirs and went on to Pooraka and Northfield.  The registrations of death give the location as Gepps Cross.]

[Unless the paper has completely the wrong relationship here the registration of death details are wrong.  They have the death of William John Boundy on 25 October at Gepps Cross, residence Torrensville aged 23, but that of Fred Way as 27 October at Gepps Cross residence Thebarton, aged 20.  But William John Boundy married Maud Way 20 December 1924 when he was aged 24 and this agrees with the only likely birth in SA of William John Boundy at Wallaroo Mines 12 April 1900.]
