BRTBA President Peter Edson is calling for fresh blood to reinvigorate the committee at the Association’s AGM approaches.  ‘A strong and active BRTBA plays a crucial role in sustaining the town’s financial and commercial prosperity, since it not only manages the Burra Visitor Information Centre, but also promotes major events like the Antique Fair and the Monster Mine Spectacular that help bring people to Burra.’ He said.
