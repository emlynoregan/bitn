Burra Institute Committee

12 Juvenile Scholarships will be offered to the Burra State School for 1918.

Commercial Classes will close at the end of the present term with a view to making fresh arrangements.

Lt G.A.F. Young takes up charge of the Burra & Petersburg District.  [Presumably for recruiting.]

The Price of Wheat: a 1-column article.

Pte Ralph Thomas writes a letter.  He is now a POW.

St Maryâ€™s Strawberry Fete last Friday was a marked success.
