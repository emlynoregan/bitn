Burra Hospital Board.

Medical Officers are to be informed they are not to admit infectious cases to the hospital without the authority of the Local Board of Health.

District Councils of Waterloo, Apoinga, Burra, Hanson, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett are to be informed they will be held responsible for any fees due the hospital for infectious cases sent in from their district.

Dr Ashton is to be asked for a further explanation of his letter of the 16 February.
