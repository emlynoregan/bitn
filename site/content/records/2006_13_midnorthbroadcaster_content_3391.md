Burra Creek is infested with Pepper trees and Aleppo pines.  Seeds are spreading downstream and causing blockages of the waterway.  Pepper trees are commonly planted in homestead gardens and stockyards in dry areas of NSW, Victoria and SA and are spreading in riparian vegetation.  Odd trees around homesteads are not a concern, but trees delivering seeds to creeks will see the creeks smothered.  Aleppo pines also spread readily and cause concern, as they replace native vegetation.
