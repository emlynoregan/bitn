Characteristics of the 1939 paper.

While there is quite a good coverage of local news, the paper also carried a lot of non-news items.  Some, especially on page 4, were of general interest and many were concerned with the deteriorating political situation in both Europe and China, but there were also a good many jokes used as fillers.

Page 1

News and larger local advertisements and a couple of non-local ones too.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements, sales notices of widely varying size, advertisements for the talkies and public notices.  Small classified type advertisements and one or two large advertisements.  Sometimes some local news.

Page 3

Two or three larger advertisements, but mostly news which fluctuated considerable between local and other items of interest, but also sometimes fillers of general interest and jokes.
