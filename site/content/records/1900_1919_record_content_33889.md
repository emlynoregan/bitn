Football.  The Kooringa Football Club AGM was held last Tuesday with George Lord in the chair.  It was decided to solicit donations to write off the debt.  [Of unstated size.]  It was decided to amalgamate with the Ramblers.  They favoured the name of the new team being Kooringa Football Club and for it to be affiliated with the Burra Football Association.  A combined meeting of the two clubs adopted the name of the Kooringa Football Club.
