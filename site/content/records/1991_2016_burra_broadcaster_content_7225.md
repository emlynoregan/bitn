Christene Pycroft, a Pt Augusta City Councillor, writes re her experience of Burra in the weekend before Christmas last.  She was greatly impressed by:

The unbelievably clean streets

The fact that the bins had liners

The absence of graffiti

Christmas decorations were natural rather than plastic

The great landscaping along the creek

The pride everyone took in their town

That everything was neat and tidy

That the key system relied on trust

That the church was open
