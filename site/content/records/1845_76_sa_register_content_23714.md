Obituary/Flood

On Wednesday a very heavy fall of rain caused the culvert in Commercial Street to overflow.  The main street was flooded and the fine material washed off the surface.  Some low-lying houses were flooded.    At about 11 p.m. a woman residing near the creek behind the Miners’ Arms heard screams. She thought they were from a person whose home had been flooded.  The next day there were rumours that a person had been lost, but no one was reported missing.  The other evening a boy rode in to town and reported a corpse stuck in a tree in a creek on Princess Royal.  The police have not returned as we go to print.  The only person missing is a bushman who left the Miners’ Arms a little before 11 and has not been heard of since.  Under the circumstances it seems he is likely to be the corpse in the creek.  On Friday the very wet weather continued and the creeks rose further.  A man from Auburn was nearly drowned trying to cross the stream near Pinch’s paddock.  His horse and cart were submerged, but he escaped after cutting the harness and was able to reach land with the animal.

[Patrick Coy died 25 October 1870 at Kooringa aged 24.  BISA research says he came from Offaly in Ireland and arrived in 1858 on the General Hewett.]
