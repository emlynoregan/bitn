Obituary.  Hilda Shipard died at Burra Hospital on 19 October and was buried at Pt Lincoln.  She was aged almost 90.  She was born Hilda Milman and grew up in the English Lakes District, but after WWI she immigrated to Australia with various family members.  They went first to Sydney, but eventually settled on Eyre Peninsula.  In 1926 she met and married William Shipard, a farmer and a widower with a young daughter.  They settled at Yantanabie and set about building up a farm from the mallee scrub.  In 1942 they moved to North Shields before moving to Poonindie Hill.  They were well known in the area and Hilda was known as a fine cook and was active in district affairs.  She also enjoyed gardening, running poultry, sewing and handicraft.  In a 1952 bushfire she saved a herd of cows by driving them into a dam.  They came to Burra in 1969 and until her admission to hospital Mrs Shipard lived on the property near her son and daughter-in-law, Ron and Pam.  Her eldest child Clifford died in 1954.
