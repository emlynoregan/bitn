Christmas Eve was busy in Burra.  There were more cars in town then ever before and by 8 p.m. parking places were virtually unobtainable.  The evening was hot and business was brisk.  The holiday period passed very quietly with only the Kooringa Lawn Tennis Assoc. Tournament organised.  The weather was hot and muggy.
