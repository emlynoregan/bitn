Editorial deploring the lack of interest in Municipal matters, which results in the unwillingness of persons to stand for Council.  If those in office are not the best suited it can only be because those outside are so absorbed in feathering their own nests or so wanting in self-confidence they cannot run the gauntlet of election.  If the public would respect their representatives a little more perhaps we would find the best men more willing to offer themselves.

Redruth Court, 5 November.

H. Price, alias Stonier, was committed for trial in Adelaide for obtaining £7-10-0 on a valueless cheque from W. Henderson of the Kooringa Hotel and on Wednesday was committed on a further charge of obtaining £2-10-0 from Stephen Hill of the Royal Exchange Hotel by means of a valueless cheque.

Burra Corporation sitting as a Court of Appeal.  Reductions in assessments for rates amounting to £136-10-0 were approved.  The names of those appealing and the figures involved are printed.

W.H. Hardy writes recalling that last year Burra was allowed £50 for the maintenance of 66 chains of main road, when there are about 5 miles of main road in the Corporation.  Unley was allowed £500 for their 9 miles of main road.  He urges Council to bestir themselves lest they find the Government again using incorrect figures of the length of main roads in their calculations.
