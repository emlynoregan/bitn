Burra Cultural Heritage and Recreational Precinct has moved a step closer to getting funding for a major redevelopment project, in moving to round four of the Regional Development Australia Fund.  The project would embrace five areas:

1.	A Skate Park in the area across the road from the Town Hall and Regional Art Gallery.

2 & 3.	Burra Regional Art Gallery & Town Hall – landscaping, paving and disabled access serving the two buildings.

4.	Jinker and Boardwalk – a new structure over the jinker and a boardwalk linking the jinker to Ursula Street along the western side of Burra Creek.

5.	A pedestrian refuge in Commercial Street.
