Children’ Jubilee Committee.  A meeting was held last Monday at the Institute to arrange to take the Burra children to the Exhibition.  Special admission charges of 3d each and 6d for accompanying adults are available.  Other costs will be 2/6 for travel and 6d for a meal.  The number of children is estimated at 400-500.

John Lewis JP moved that it was desirable to take all the children that wanted to go to the Jubilee Exhibition in the month of October and that the ages be between 7 & 15.  Rev. S. Gray moved an amendment that there be a local demonstration as he thought very small children should be able to participate.  P. Lane seconded and said he thought the original idea was too large an undertaking, which could not be carried out in safety.  The amendment was lost and the motion carried.

Dr Brummitt said the first step was to get correct numbers involved and find out how many were prepared to pay their own way.  Mr Lewis proposed a subscription list, which he would head with a donation of £5-5-0.  A strong committee headed by the Mayor and Councillors was appointed.
