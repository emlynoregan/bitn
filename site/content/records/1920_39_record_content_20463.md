Burra Town Council, 16 August

Permission was granted for a verandah to be erected in front of Mr Spierâ€™s garage and for a garage for Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. in Church St.

The work on the road form the Bon Accord to the Railway Station had made it a shocking mess.  Several other places were similarly complained of.  There was disagreement about whether the blame lay more with the Overseer or the contractor.  The Overseer said rubble was ordered in places where new metalling throughout was needed.

Cr Kellaway started to move to rescind the motion to enclose the monument.

Cr Riggs rose on a point of order that this motion had been before Council at the previous meeting and could not be moved twice in the same municipal year.

The Town Clerk said Cr Kellaway had been given permission to hold the motion over.  Standing Orders said if a motion had been negatived it could not again be brought on.

Cr Riggs said if not carried it was negatived.

After discussion the Mayor over-ruled Cr Riggs.

Cr Woollacott seconded the motion, but it was lost.
