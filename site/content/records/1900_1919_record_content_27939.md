Hooligans entered Alex. Harrisâ€™s wood yard in Kingston St on Sunday night last and assaulted an Afghan who was camping there as he has done at various times in the last 20 years.  They smashed the pole of the van and damaged it in other ways.  Drink seems to have motivated them and so far the police have made no progress in the case.
