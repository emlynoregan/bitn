Burra Burra DC

Good road metal has been fund in the overburden at the Mine and will be stockpiled and made available to the Council.  The normal cost of raising road metal is 20c/yd3.

Council will now borrow $60,000 to purchase new plant: a D6 bulldozer, a low loader tray to transport it and possibly later in the year a new grader.

Rates have been slow in coming in and this has slowed work.  So far $14,000 has come in, mainly from the Town Ward.

The swimming pool was drained some time ago to find the source of a 1,000 gallon a week leak and Councillors are now fairly confident this has been sealed, after a crack across the floor and up one wall was discovered.

Swimming should begin on 1 November as usual.

Smoke Room at the Town Hall.  When the cement floor has sufficiently dried the Council intends to lay carpet squares.

The Minister of Local Government has advised of a $1,400 subsidy on Councilâ€™s purchase of the old Ballast Quarry.

Burra Scouts & Cubs will have a special meeting at Hanson on 19 October when an Army Display Unit will be present.  Families and friends are invited.  Army personnel will talk on safety precautions with explosives.

The Methodist Circuit Quarterly Meeting last Wednesday received a report that the Redruth Trust Committee has agreed in principle to develop the Redruth Church and Hall as a Camping and Conference Centre. It will be necessary to provide ablution blocks.  The circuit meeting expressed its support.
