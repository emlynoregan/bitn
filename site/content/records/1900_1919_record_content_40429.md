Unemployment.  A deputation comprising the local members, T. McWaters (Chairman of the District Council) and Cr S.M. Lane, has seen the Commissioner of Public Works, but has so far not produced any jobs.  He is still making enquiries.  On Thursday a telegram was received that tenders would be called immediately for enlarging the Burra town reservoir to carry an extra 50,000 gallons
