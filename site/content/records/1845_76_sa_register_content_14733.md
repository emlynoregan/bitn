Kooringa News, 10 July

The season is one of the wettest known here.  The creeks continue to flood and the thoroughfares are deplorable.  Crops are sheering to behold whether in garden or field.  Pasture is abundant and vegetables, fruit and dairy produce is in abundance.

The Central Road Board seems not quite to have forgotten us and I am informed some men are actually employed on the line between Kooringa and Kapunda.  It is certainly time.  Some of the teams from Adelaide have been nearly a fortnight on the road and the mail driver finds it difficult to accomplish his journey in the prescribed time.
