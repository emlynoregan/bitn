Kooringa News, 24 January

Obituary/Inquest.  On Wednesday afternoon Dr Mayne held an inquest into the death of an infant named Sophia Webster who was found dead this morning in bed.

Mary Ann Webster:

I am the mother of the deceased child who was about five weeks old.  I last saw her alive when I put her to bed yesterday evening at about 8.30 p.m.  When I awoke this morning and was about to take the child in my arms, I found she was dead.  The body was lying just below the pillow, but not under it.

Edwin Webster, miner:

I am the child’s father and having heard my wife’s evidence have nothing more to add except that the child has been kindly treated and was well when we went to bed.

Dr Maurau:

I was called to see the deceased a little after 6 a.m. this morning and found her quite dead.  She might have been dead about an hour.  She was frothing at the nostrils with feet drawn up and hands clenched as if she had been in convulsions.  There were no marks of violence and she was covered only with a sheet.  All evidence suggests death by convulsions.  The jury returned a verdict of death by visitation of God.

[This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD, but the birth of Sophia Webster is registered on 14 December 1861 at Kooringa to Edwin & Mary Ann Webster nee Symons.]
