Aberdeen P.O.  A petition for better postal and telegraph facilities at Aberdeen has been presented.  About 80,000 letters pass through the existing Redruth and Aberdeen post offices annually.  There are some 20 mails received and despatched daily, bringing in revenue of some Â£400 for the department.  The inhabitants number about 900 plus those in the outside districts.  There are 27 businesses in town and the telegraph station is at the station a mile or more away.  The present offices are in private hands and the request is for a Government officer to control both postal and telegraph services.
