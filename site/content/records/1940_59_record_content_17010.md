Burra Town Council, 20 March

The Highways Commissioner reports the completion of the rebuilding of the bridge and Loudon St.  [Sic: perhaps ‘in Ludgvan St’?]

And the commencement of rebuilding that in Commercial St.

The District Council of Burra Burra sends a questionnaire about the proposed Freezing Works, saying it would give all possible assistance if the Town Council decided to give evidence to the Commission.

A questionnaire for the Housing Scheme was also in the Mayor’s hands.

The construction of a new footbridge in Commercial St will be deferred till the road bridge is completed.
