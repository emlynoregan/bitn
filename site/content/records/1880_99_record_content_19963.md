Cr Ridgway said he might have committed an error, but he thought the work was authorised.  The improvement in Ellen Tce [sic] [Should be Helen] had been done at the instigation of the Road Board stationman.  The work done in the creek bed did not stop the waterway, but gave an enlarged waterway and cost nearly nothing as it came from a cutting opposite.  He did not care about the ratepayers’ remarks, but did expect support from Council.

Cr Sampson moved the ford be no further made.  Cr Symons 2nd.

Cr West moved the matter should stand over till the new Council was elected.

Cr Coglin 2nd and Cr Sampson withdrew his motion. Cr West’s motion was then carried.

Cr Ridgway said the total cost was £5 or £2-10-0 more.

[*The work is not clearly identified, but given Cr Ridgway’s involvement and his comment that: ‘The works around his premises had cost very little.’  It seems likely that the ford in dispute was the one across the Burra Creek in St Just Street. This was confirmed when the missing minute was eventually found see: VII, 495, 24 Nov. 1885, page 3 & VII, 496, 27 Nov. 1885 page2.]
