The Soldiers’ Aid Society held its usual monthly meeting in the Redruth Memorial Hall on the first Thursday in October.  14 attended.  The first motion was to dissolve the society.  Under current conditions it could not continue.  Carried.  A motion was then made that all monies belonging to the society after any outstanding debts go to sick soldiers at Keswick, Myrtle Bank, Bedford Park and Angorichina for Christmas Cheer.  Carried.

Miss Bubb then moved the formation of a new society: The General (Late Soldiers’) Aid Society with the same objects as the late society.  The officers of the late society were transferred to the new.  A Strawberry Fete is to be held on 7 December to aid the Royal Institution for the Blind.

[The problem causing this change was not spelled out, but last year there was a hint of a difficulty in that under the rules of the formation of the original society money could only be given to the Royal Institution for the Blind if it went to blind soldiers and this seems to be a likely reason for this fairly technical change.]
