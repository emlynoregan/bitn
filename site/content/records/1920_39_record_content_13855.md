Letter from Stanley Shaw (A Barwell Boy) on the issues raised by H. C. Atkins.  He considers that the boys are entitled to a day of leisure on Sunday and to see their friends then.  Or does Mr Atkins believe they should have a minimum of recreation and that grudgingly given?  Mr Atkins further suggests that people who want to know more about Barwell Boys should get their own and ‘if they do, God help them’, or words to that effect.  This is an insult to the boys and reveals ‘both ignorance and prejudice’.
