Burra Mine, 13 May.  Captain Sanders reports that in the past month work has been pushed forward in various parts of the mine.  The usual amount of ore has been raised from the open cut and by tributers.  Morphett’s Shaft has been sink a further 8 ft and that part of the lode still in the shaft has improved in appearance and value and black copper oxide has appeared.  70 north is producing some good stones of grey ore and a crosscut has been started to prove the appearance on each side.  We are driving from Grave’s Shaft at the 50 to hole to the long crosscut and hope to do so in about a fortnight.  Peacock’s Air Shaft is being repaired and sunk and four men are repairing the level towards this shaft at the 50 and another four are repairing the level at 50 fathoms from Peacock’s to Roach’s.  Four men are clearing sand from the 60 north of Waterhouse’s in order to start a crosscut to Peacock’s Air Shaft.  The ground in Bunce’s remains very hard.  We are opening the incline tunnel to its proper breadth; 9 ft wide by 7 ft high.  About 28 fathoms have been completed in the last month with 20 fathoms to go.  The foundation for the steam hammer is laid and the hammer fixed.  We hope to get it working in about a week.
