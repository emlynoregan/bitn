Mt Bryan East Telephone Subscribers will be able to call Burra at local call rates from 1 March 1987 following a decision to redraw the charging zone boundary to bring Mt Bryan East into the Hallett Standard Zone.  Mt Bryan subscribers will now get untimed local calls between that exchange and Andrews, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Burra, Hallett, Hanson, Hilltown, Spalding, Terowie and Whyte Yarcowie exchanges.

The Annual Burra Bowling Championships were held over the long weekend.  A total of 148 entrants took part.  Winners:

Pairs	Bruce Stockman & Neville Kelly

Menâ€™s Fours	Salisbury Rink skippered by Jim Pleasant

Mixed Fours	Merv & Estelle Nicholls and Ray & Lola Jennison

Burra Citizen of the Year, Mrs Olive Oates was presented with her award at the bowling competition on Monday.

Tourists flocked to Burra for the long weekend, although there was no barrow push this year.  Burra Tourist Office recorded more than 380 people.  With a barrow push numbers would be about 1,000.
