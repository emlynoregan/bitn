The City of Woodville Choral Group was established in 1981 and fostered by the City of Woodville Council in its aim to encourage arts in the community.  It began with twenty-nine members, but has grown to more than seventy, drawn from across the metropolitan area and the Adelaide Hills.  It presents music for church services, church and school concerts, civil and church weddings, retirement villages, nursing homes and charity events.  They sing for special City of Woodville functions and present Christmas carols at Westfield Arndale and at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.  The musical director is Rosemary Narin, who took over from the first conductor, Peter Ruys, in 1982.  She has wide experience with the Country Choral Association at Lameroo and Pinnaroo, the Gawler Barossa Oratorio Choir and the Uniting Church Choirs of Broadview and Prospect.  She is a teacher of piano and singing and directs Primary School Choirs and has sung in the Adelaide Girls’ Choir.  The accompanist Betty Tothill has been with the choir since 1983.  Rosemary has also been organist at St Mary’s Church in Burra.

[There is no obvious reason for the appearance of this item at this time.  Rosemary Nairn (not Narin) was born Rosemary Reed of Burra.]
