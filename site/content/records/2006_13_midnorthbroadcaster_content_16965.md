Burra Auxiliary of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital Auxiliaries Association has decided to dissolve after 57 years of service due to declining numbers.  The group was formed in 1956.  Over the years funds have been raised through raffles, catering, sale of merchandise, fashion parades and trading tables etc.  President Leonie Ryan said declining numbers meant the Auxiliary could no longer function effectively.  Remaining members met recently for a farewell lunch.  [Photo of Jenny Wall, Pat Taylor, Maureen Bevan, Leonie Ryan, Mavis Spackman and Colleen Spackman.]
