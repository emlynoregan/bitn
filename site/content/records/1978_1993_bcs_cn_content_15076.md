Matthews Emporium staged a clearing sale of furnishings and carpets last Friday.  Would-be buyers arrived with sleeping bags as early as 4.00 a.m.  Ross Drew doubted if anything like it had occurred in the department’s 58 year history in Burra.  Stephen and Maryann Angel will take over that area of the business. [Décor Made Easy]
