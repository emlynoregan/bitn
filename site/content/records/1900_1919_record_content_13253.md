Fire.  Mr Lowman of Mt Bryan, lost a haystack to fire last week.  When M-C Phelan investigated he found scores of pieced of pollard laced with strychnine.  Lowman lost turkeys, geese, fowls, ducks, cats and dogs.  Strychnine was found in an outhouse.  The careless way the baits were prepared has led to the conclusion it was children.  The loss of the hay stack has not been explained and it was counted on by the owner to get him through the season.
