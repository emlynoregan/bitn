Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladiesâ€™ band went to Adelaide on Friday to assist with the YMCA effort.  They were met at the station by the Secretary of the YMCA, Mr Maddern, and entertained for luncheon at the Red Cross tea rooms before going to Gouger St for the start of the parade.  They marched behind the AIF boys and ahead of ambulance cars.  After the parade the girls marched back to Rundle St where a platform had been erected for them.  Traffic was stopped and a vast concourse of people attended.  The Band played several selections.  Mr Crewes appealed for funds after each selection.  After an adjournment for afternoon tea there was a final selection and a last appeal.  A cockatoo was auctioned.  They had to catch the 4.50 p.m. train for Burra.  The weather was dull, but perfect.  On the way back Sgt Bernard Lowe was found on the train at Hamley Bridge and so they welcomed him on arrival at Burra.
