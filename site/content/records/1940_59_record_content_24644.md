D. Macdonald Steele writes urging the revival of tennis and golf clubs in Burra.  He hopes especially for the revival of lawn tennis on the courts of the Sports Ground Syndicate at Burra North.

He says the good length of hose queried by a recent correspondent was sold to the Bowling Club and the motor mower was sold to the agents.  The Burra Lawn Tennis Club has a credit account of Â£36-13-0.  The courts were established and bought into service by the Burra Lawn Tennis Syndicate, which also erected the enclosure and both were then leased to the Burra Lawn Tennis Club.  All that is required to resuscitate the club is some enthusiasm and energy on the part of a few.  As President of the Burra Lawn Tennis Club and of the Burra Golf Club when they went into recess, Dr Steele calls a meeting in February of all interested in the revival of both clubs.
