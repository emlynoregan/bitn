Redruth Court, 9 December.

Davey v. Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.

The case was wilfully obstructing a watercourse within the Corporation of Burra.  Information was laid under clause 239 of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1880.  The Corporation alleged the defendants blocked and diverted water from a natural watercourse.  The defendants were owners of sheep yards through which ran the watercourse and had made the obstruction on 27 September last.  Witnesses would prove it was a natural watercourse that was in existence 43 years ago before the defendants purchased the land.  The Corporation had demonstrated their belief in the watercourse by placing a bridge across it.

William Davey had lived in Burra nearly 40 years and when first knew the place it was a watercourse.  It is now 8-9’ deep in places and to 12’ wide.  It runs with any rain of consequence.  The bank put across it is 14-15’ long in the defendant’s yard and 4-5’ high.  If it remains it will force the water to form another channel and cause damage.  The road is already rutted as a consequence.

Mr Lewis said he knew the gully at the rear of the Model School.  He had been a resident for 40 years.  It was of very small dimensions.  The water flows through an arch in the brewery wall.  The arch is of small dimensions due to silting up.  He could not say if the water would escape in case of heavy rain.

[Then there is a variety of evidence on changes following Council road-building.  Many answers being along the lines of ‘could not say if . . .’ or ‘do not remember if . . .’]

John Sampson gave evidence that he had known the watercourse for 43 years and it had been about the same dimensions the last 15 or 16 years.  Saw the present obstruction being placed there last September.  It would cost about £60 or £70 to make repairs and form a new channel as a bridge would then be required.

Corroborative evidence came from John Robinson Gray and John Jenkins while Henry Woods gave evidence on the placing of the obstruction.

J.D. Cave, Overseer of the Burra and Hanson District Councils for c. 12 years said he had known the site for 17-18 years and there was a very deep creek there at that time.  There was a lot of water lying in the southwest corner of the sheep yards.  Remember the Corporation making a crossing over the creek below the brewery gate.  The crossing was filled up about 6’.  The creek had filled up and the arch in the brewery wall would not carry a third of the water it used to.

H. Collins, farmer of Ironmine, suggested there was no real channel when he first knew it 44 or 45 years ago.

Mr Lewis stated they admitted blocking up the watercourse if indeed it was considered one, but it had been to protect their own property.  The corporation had commenced the obstruction by raising the creek and had not seen the creek was kept clear.

His Honour said evidence conclusively proved the watercourse existed for nearly 50 years.  The owners of the brewery should be compelled to keep the creek open through their property and the Corporation help Mr Lewis see it was done.

As the case was one of principle only a nominal fine was asked for.  Fine 5/- + costs.
