The Parks name has been associated with bakery in Burra for over 80 years.  Mr Thomas Parks Sen. founded the business, which was taken over by the late Charles Parks, his son.  When his health failed his sons took over for some time.  For some time now the premises owned by him and subsequently by his executrix have been occupied by Mr H. Wandke, proprietor of the Excelsior Café.  As the estate is being wound up, he has had to find new premises and has moved to those lately occupied by Bence’s Ltd, which have been remodelled.
