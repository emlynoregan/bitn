The SA Mining Association has made arrangements to sell all of their ore from the Burra Burra Mine to the Patent Copper Company as soon as their present contract with the Apoinga Smelting Works is completed.  The arrangement is for a period identical with that already existing between the two companies, which has five years to run.  The effect will make the Apoinga Smelting works entirely dependent on ore from the other northern mines.  It will increase the internal resources of the colony by bringing a larger amount of copper ore into the hands of the Patent Copper Company for smelting in lieu of making shipments of ore as hitherto.  We believe it is also contemplated making arrangement for the shipment of lower grade ores to NSW for smelting there, receiving back coal.  The Patent Copper Company only wants a satisfactory position regarding the supply of fuel to ensure a long term of prosperous operations.
