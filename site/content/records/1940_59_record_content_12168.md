The Mayor T.H. Woollacott & Town Clerk Mr E.J. Davey visited St Joseph’s School on Friday 11 December to present certificates and prizes for collecting the most scrap rubber during the recent drive.  Sidney Lomman was given the first prize of 10/- and Victor Kellaway the second prize of 5/-.  (Both in the form of War Savings stamps.)  As the first official visit to the school the scholars were given a half holiday.

AC1 Dudley Field was given a social at Leighton Hall on 5 December.  He is the second son of Mr & Mrs Jack Field of Leighton.  Dancing from 9 to 10 was followed by speeches and the presentation.  Speakers were A.D. McDonald MP, Mr Roy Earle and Cr Lomman.  Dudley had gone to the local school and then to Burra High School.  He had been good at sport.  He was well known in the district ‘owing to being on the grocery round’.  Dancing continued to midnight when supper was served.
