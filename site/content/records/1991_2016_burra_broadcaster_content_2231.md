Burra Burra DC news:

Shane Cooper has been appointed Dog Control Officer.

Redbanks was discussed at a special meeting on 9 November.

Ian Auhl has advised that he is withdrawing from any further formal involvement with Burra due to ill health.  Council extended its thanks to him for his services over 30 years.  [Ian Auhl died 22 March 1996 aged 81.]

A sign in front of the Town Hall will explain its significance to tourists and passers-by.
