Burra Town Council, 17 August.

New rules for the Burra hospital have been approved by the Governor:

‘The management of the Institution shall be vested in a Board of not more than twelve members, appointed by the Government, one of whom shall be the Mayor of Burra (ex officio).  The Board to elect its own officers,’ and E.W. Crewes JP was appointed a member of the Board.

The mayor suggested a meeting be called to start a patriotic fund.  Cr Lane then moved to hold such a meeting to establish the ‘Burra Town and District Patriotic Fund’.  The meeting will be held 24 August in the Institute.

A new flagpole and flags are to be acquired.

To start the Patriotic Fund the Councillors, Town Clerk and Inspector donated between them £12-1-6.

Leighton Hall Annual Dinner on 5 August was largely attended.  The report of this dinner reveals [as nothing else in the paper does] that confirmation of the war was received on 5 August and that it resulted in a hurriedly arranged meeting in Market Square where the National Anthem was sung and three cheers raised for the king and the British Army and Navy.  The crowd then gave three cheers for the Mayor.  At the dinner ‘Rule Britannia’ was sung after three cheers for the British Empire.

The Hall debt stood at £350 after the extensions.

Burra Institute, meeting of 10 August.

The question of another fire escape door was held over to the next meeting.  First aid classes are to be revived.

Letter from A.D. McLaren re a disputed goal at the Aberdeen-Light Horse match where he was a goal umpire – defending both his decision and his integrity.
