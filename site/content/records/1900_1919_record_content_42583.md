Letter from ‘One Who Cares’ urging the cancellation of dancing at the Institute and the playing of football ‘while this horrible war is raging’.  The editor comments that on Monday night the Institute committee prohibited dancing until after the war.

Letter from I.J. Warnes, defending his stand on the fracas over the Burra Field Dog Trials.

Letter from M.A. Radford on the same subject.

[For anyone interested in the whole thing this letter is perhaps the most clearly articulated outline of the dispute and sets out the chronological sequence of events and explains how it all came about in fairly dispassionate terms.  Nevertheless some of the statements about who said what are at the core of the matter and these remain in dispute as shown in a letter in the next issue.]
