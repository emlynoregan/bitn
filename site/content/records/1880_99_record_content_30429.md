Cricket.  At Terowie last Wednesday, Terowie won the toss and sent Burra in.  Burra scored 15 and then Terowie scored 76.  In their second innings Burra was all out for 64, giving a total of 79.

[The paper said this left Terowie 7 to win, which they did for the loss of one wicket.  This doesnâ€™t appear to make sense, but if they ended up with 7 runs, perhaps they got three to tie and then a 4 off the last scoring shot to win.]
