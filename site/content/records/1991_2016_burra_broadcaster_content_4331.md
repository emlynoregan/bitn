Variety Club Bash

Local entry will be the 1961 Ford Falcon that is currently having its front end rebuilt.  Last year the ‘Bash’ raised $693,000 for various charities and the local entry raised $7,000.  In recent years the Variety Club has donated more than $3,000 of whitegoods to the Boarding Hostel in Burra.

Adventurer Dick Smith initiated the 1st Bash in 1985 and the 1st South Australian Bash followed in 1989 with 57 vehicles.  In 1990 that increased to 75, with 80 in 1991 and 82 in 1992.  Vehicles must be in standard condition and manufactured before June 1966.
