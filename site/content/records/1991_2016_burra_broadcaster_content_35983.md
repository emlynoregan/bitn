Burra Show Society

A meeting is being convened on 15 March to consider the societyâ€™s future.  Despite a general lack of interest, the society has been held together for the last couple of years by Ken & Kay Broad.  The meeting will consider all options, including folding.  The show relocated to the present site in 1923. [Actually 1924.]  Isaac Warnes with a donation of 30 acres and others with cash donations enabled the show to move from the Aberdeen Oval where it had been held since 1909.  The Society was formed as the Burra and North Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural and Pastoral Society and ran annual shows from 1877 to 1886, after which there was a recess until 1894.
