Laura Books moved into the old Burra Bazaar shop almost two years ago.  It is a quirky business with a wide range of books, but also some bric-a-brac and pot plants.  Proprietor Steve Crouch and his wife Dale run the shop in Burra Thursday to Sunday and a smaller outlet in Laura Wednesday to Friday.  They started the Laura shop in 2000 and also run a 'Books for Africa' program, which sends cast-off books from Australian schools to Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Ethiopia and also to PNG and the Philippines.
