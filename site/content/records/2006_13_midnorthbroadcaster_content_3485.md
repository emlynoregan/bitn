Rabbits are on the increase in the Burra area.  Within the town control measures are difficult because baiting would place other animals and young children at risk.  There has been an ongoing problem with rabbits along the creek in particular.  Jenny Carter has been annoyed at their depredations in her garden and feels much of the problem stems from common ground, for which the Council is responsible and ‘something needs to be done’.
