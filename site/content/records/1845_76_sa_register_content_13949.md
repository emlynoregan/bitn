‘Resident’ writes to the editor from Kooringa 11 January re the proposal to relocate the post office at Kooringa:

It is desirable to amalgamate the office of Postmaster with the Telegraph Office.  The rent and a portion of the Postmaster’s salary would be saved.  The Telegraph Office is centrally located for the surrounding townships and is convenient for miners, the majority of whom pass it going to and from work.

‘Pro Bono Publico’ writes to the editor also on the Kooringa Post Office question:

It is rumoured that there is a proposal to move the Post Office to a kind of ‘hole-in-the-wall’ position, totally unfit for such a purpose and most in a most inconvenient part of town for public benefit.  It would also be beneficial to amalgamate the telegraph and postmastership.  This office is far better situated for public convenience and sited to allow the majority of inhabitants to see the arrival of the mail and so know when it is time to apply for our letters.
