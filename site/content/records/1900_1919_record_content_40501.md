Cr Lane clearly thought the other Councillors should have attended as the work of the deputation extended beyond the finding of railway jobs.

Cr Radford thought that a public meeting could not appoint Councillors to act: only the Council could do that.

The mayor agreed that strictly speaking the actions of Crs Lane and McWaters were illegal, but he agreed the deputation was not confined to the reinstatement of the men.  The action may have been illegal, but it was a good thing and their action must now be endorsed.

And so it was.
