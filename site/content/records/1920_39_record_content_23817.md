St Mary’s.  Canon W.G.M. Murphy of St Peters, a former Rector of St Mary’s, visited on 24 July.  He was also given a social in the Parish Hall.  He had been in Burra for five years, arriving some 25 years ago.  Mrs Murphy asked to be remembered to old friends and especially to Mrs C. Fuss for her practical interest in keeping the Sunday school together.  The Canon was a guest of Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes at Koonoona.  He hopes to return soon to visit the Mission churches, having pioneered the one at Black Springs.
