Australian Orienteering Championships brought nearly 1,000 competitors and many thousands of dollars into the district.  Events were staged over three days.  Competitors ranged in age from 10 to 75 years and were male and female.  The mammoth catering task was managed smoothly.  The town and school ovals became tent cities and school facilities were extensively used.
