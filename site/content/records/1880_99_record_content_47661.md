Burra Town Council.

Letter received from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis re the drain near the sheep yards.  Matter to be left to the new Council.

Thanks were expressed to John Jenkin as overseer for the past year.

Cr Kitchen moved a vote of thanks to Mr Littlejohn, the Waterworks engineer.  At the start of the year he had thought Mr Littlejohn not to be a satisfactory servant, but since the new boiler had arrived the engineer had attended to his work admirably and he did not think anyone could find fault with him.  He regretted the engineer had to work Sundays, but the reservoir was not large enough to supply the town for 24 hours.

Cr Hardy 2nd and agreed.

A vote of thanks was also accorded to W. Davey as Town Clerk and others went to Mr Thomas as curator of the cemetery and Mr J.R. Gray as inspector and Mr R. Andrews as scavenger.

Cr Watt moved thanks to the local press.  Cr Kitchen dissented and Cr Hardy was unenthusiastic, but felt that as the year was ending the hatchet should be buried.
