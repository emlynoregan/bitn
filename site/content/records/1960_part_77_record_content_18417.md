Burra High School held its Speech Night in the Burra Town Hall on 17 December.  Headmaster R. Mueller delivered his annual report.

The enrolment in January was 151, up 7 on 1962.  First Year numbers were lower, but retention was better in the upper years.  First Year 53, Second Year 56, Intermediate 26 and Leaving 16.  In 1965 c. 170 are expected – an increase due to an anticipated increase in Intermediate to 40.  Numbers are expected to plateau briefly and then decline slightly in 1966.  In 1963 Mr J. Sladden and Mr R. Hillman were transferred and in 1964 Mr T. O’Connor came from Salisbury High and Mr J. Ayliffe and Miss M. Callier came from Teachers’ College.  Mr W. Standing and Miss B. Hogan were appointed Junior Teachers.  During the year Mrs Bogisch resigned and was replaced by Mrs Aistrope from Riverton to handle Home Science.  At the end of this year Miss Lawes and Mr McElroy will be transferred and Junior Teachers Barbara Hogan and Bill Standing will attend Teachers’ College in 1964.

Rev. Jenner and his wife are also leaving and we thank them for taking 90 students each week for Religious Instruction.  Rector Drought and Father Hughes are also thanked.

The High School Council has kept the machinery going without having a particularly busy year.

The Parents & Friends’ Association continues to be efficiently run and the completion of the sports area in front of the school is the culmination of one of their major projects.

In sports the outstanding event of the year was the winning of the Open Shield (the Ohlmeyer Shield) at the Mid North Combined High schools Sports Day.  Burra also got the highest points for the Handicap Shield, but the rules prevent the holding of both shields in the same year.

A school excursion of over 300 miles was in part a reward for this effort.  Places visited included Para and Warren Reservoirs, Mt Crawford Pine Forest, Mannum, Murray Bridge and Mt Lofty.

In February the whole school travelled by train to see the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.  Other successful occasions were the Annual Swimming Carnival, Sports Day, Prefects’ Induction, Arbor Day and Visiting Day.

The Intermediate and Leaving classes travelled to Adelaide and Clare to see performances of plays they were studying.  Leaving Teaching Scholarships were awarded to:

Peter Benger	Barry Carpenter	Kerry Costello

Raelene Hirschausen	Claire Kellock	Margaret Murphy

Pam Zanker

For the second year the school magazine has been printed out of the school.

In 1962 134 subjects were passed in the Intermediate.  (The highest number previously had been 111.)  Leaving passes were the second highest ever.  Keith Neill had the best Leaving results with six subjects and Barbara Hogan with five.  In Intermediate Peter Benger passed 8 subjects and was awarded the A.B .Riggs Prize and Patricia Ryan passed seven subjects.

[Mr Mueller then went on to discuss the non-Publicly Examined Subjects to be offered in 2nd and 3rd Year and their internal assessment.  He thought the Intermediate would fall into disuse with the new Leaving and Matriculation Exams to come into operation from 1966.]

Burra is not going to have these new courses in 1964, but will do so in the next few years.

In 1958 the enrolment was 70 and next year we expect 170.  This has meant a number of new buildings.  In the last year a modern laboratory and a classroom were added.  There are now six classrooms, Home Science and Woodwork Centres, a Science Laboratory, a Typing room and an assembly hall.  The old laboratory will soon be converted to a staff room.  The area around the new rooms is yet to be paved.  The toilets have been enlarged and improved.  The old tennis courts have been extended, resurfaced and fenced this year.  A fence was also erected around the lawn and 80ft of seating was provided.  The school now has four basketball courts instead of one, four tennis courts instead of two and two new practice cricket pitches.  The graded area has been sown and watered and has greatly improved facilities for athletics training, softball and football in the future.

New buses have been provided for the students.  The increase in numbers has seen the appointment of more specialist teachers and a sound range of subjects and Leaving subjects no longer have to be combined with other classes as in the past.
