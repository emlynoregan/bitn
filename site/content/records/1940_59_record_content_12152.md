Mrs J.A. Kotz nee Miss M.P. O’Connell of Burra North has received word that her husband Pte J.A. Kotz has been recommended for the Military Medal.  We believe he is the first Burra boy to be so honoured in this war.  He saw service overseas and returned last March.  He is presently in hospital in New Guinea as the result of wounds received in November.  He is a son of Mr & Mrs A. Kotz of Burra.
