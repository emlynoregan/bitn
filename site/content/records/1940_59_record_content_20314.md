Broken Hill experienced its worst ever dust storm last Tuesday according to a report in The Barrier Miner.  Visibility was said to be reduced to one foot, traffic was halted and lights were needed inside as if it were night.  A funeral was halted in the main street and mourners were given refuge and iced drinks in the Palace Hotel.  It later moved on, but had to halt at the Globe Timber Mills for a time.  It took some 2Â½ hours to complete the funeral and service.
