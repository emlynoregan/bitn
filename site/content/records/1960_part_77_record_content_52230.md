Cr R.B. Jennison writes about the Council’s intention to borrow $75,000, in an attempt to counter some prevalent misconceptions.  He says:

It is quite untrue that rates would have to rise as a consequence.

It is not true that the 1970-71 rates are higher than those of last year: they are the same.

It is not true that a consequence will be less money spent on district roads – in fact it is expected to increase.

The amount is not too large.  In fact the Council at present is using less than one quarter of its borrowing capacity and this also answers the other false assertion that it is a very big project.  Council has borrowings of about half this every year for plant.

In fact the project is vital for the future and with royalties from Samin Ltd we could expect to pay off the loan in c. 5 years.
