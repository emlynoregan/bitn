Central Road Board, 20 October

Plans for a new£3,000 wrought iron girder bridge at Williston were approved and sent at once to the Commissioner of Public Works.

A letter from D. Meehan drew attention to the dangerous state of the bridge spanning the Burra Creek at Redruth.  It came through the Commissioner of Public Works who added a note requesting the Board to have the repairs, costing £10, executed.  Mr Macaulay added a memo agreeing that the cost would be c. £10, but added that a new floor for the bridge would soon be needed at a cost of £120.  The bridge however, was not under the control of the Central Board because it was not on a main road.  The work was ordered to be done with the Government finding the funds.
