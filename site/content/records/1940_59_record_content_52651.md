It is necessary to provide suitable play materials that will present a challenge and stimulus to the developing powers of the child.

The child needs the companionship of other children of a similar age, under the guidance of a teacher trained to aid his development.

The pre-school kindergarten opens up new avenues for a child to explore.  The equipment is graded so as always to offer a challenge, whether in muscular activity, appreciation of music or in intellectual activity.  Attention is paid to hygiene and cleanliness.  [Further details of the conduct of such a pre-school are given.]

Three main things needed to be considered in establishing a kindergarten:

Where would it be located?

How would it be staffed?

How would it be equipped?

Mrs Richardson said they thought question 1 could quickly be answered. [The answer is not reported.]

The kindergarten would be run by Mrs Richardson with the voluntary assistance of the mothers.

An appeal would be made to parents and friends re the equipping of the pre-school.

A committee was then established.
