Waterworks Committee:

Cr Rabbich, Chairman, read a Waterworks report and moved its adoption.  2nd Cr O’Leary.  Cr Sampson moved it not be adopted as the committee had not met and it was therefore not a committee report.  2nd Cr Hardy and carried.

Cr Rabbich announced his intention to resign as chairman.

The deed for the Recreation Ground has been received from SAMA.

All hands except the Dayman are to be discharged to try to keep the account in credit till the end of the year as the main roads work was done and the Dayman could catch up on other work.

Cr Hardy called attention to the problem of straying cattle for which ‘even councillors are guilty’.
