Citizen of the Year

Mrs Florence Scroop was named Citizen of the Year.  She has been involved with the Burra North Red Cross for over 40 years and has also been involved with the Aberdeen football, tennis and netball clubs.

For many years she has been head steward of the flower section at the Burra Show and has worked for Meals on Wheels and the Burra Hospital Committee.

[The article variously says Mrs Scroop was 75 years old and ’80-odd’, but as she was born in 1905 the figure of 80 was correct.]

Ian Kleinig was the Young Citizen of the Year.  In 1985 he was selected as a Queens Scout, the highest award in scouting.  His efforts have saved the Burra Cubs from collapse.  He is a steward in the Lutheran Church and a representative on the BCS Student Council as well as being involved in football, volleyball, tennis and swimming.
