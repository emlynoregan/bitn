Editorial on the Government Policy as outlined by Dr Cockburn at Strathalbyn on Wednesday. There were two main planks: protection for the producer and increased facilities for land settlement.

The Register has come out strongly opposed to the Government: its usual stance.  The new tax was outline: a progressive land tax.  It will be as now ½d in the £1 on estates up to £5,000 unimproved value, increasing in steps of ¼d to a maximum of 3d for those over £100,000.  For example on an estate of £10,000 (Which is probably worth about double that when improved.) the present tax would be £20-16-8.

The proposed tax would be:	on £5,000 @ ½d	£10-8-4

on £5,000 @ ¾d	£15-12-6

Total		£26-0-10

The tax will help subdivision of large estates, especially those of absentee owners.  Most agriculturalists will not be affected and of the ten estates most affected eight are the property of absentee owners.  The increase in revenue should be c. £60,000.

Other policies are the extension of railways (the transcontinental line) and water conservation.  Mining on private lands will be encouraged and other changes aimed at encouraging mining were outlined.

F.W. Holder is unable to visit Renmark in the time available and instead is posting a copy of this issue of the Record with the report of his speech on Thursday, to every elector on the Renmark roll.
