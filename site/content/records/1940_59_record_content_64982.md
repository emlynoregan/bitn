Burra Benevolent Society held its AGM 20 August.  In the last 12 months the society lost Lt Bloxham & Pastor Ashdown who were replaced by Capt.Badenhop for a short time and then Lt Kirkham and Pastor Martin.  This year the society concentrated on supplying wood and Christmas cheer to needy persons.  A legacy from the late Miss Rogers was invested to assist in coming years.  To the end of June we had distributed 30 half-ton lots of wood.  M. Riggs, Hon. Secretary.
