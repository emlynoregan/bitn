Mrs I.J. Warnes provided a Christmas tree for the children of the Leighton District. The festivities began about midday and ran though till late at night, for the enjoyment and refreshments were not confined to the younger generation.  The Mayor Mr S. Burns was present and moved a vote of thanks to Mrs Warnes and he was sure the presents received would impress upon the children that they had a friend in Mrs Warnes.  Mr Cock supported him and the party disbanded about 11 p.m.
