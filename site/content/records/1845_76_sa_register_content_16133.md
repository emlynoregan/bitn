Black Springs

The AGM in connection with the Foreign Australasian Wesleyan Missionary Society was held on Wednesday evening 3 December in the Emu Vale Chapel at Black Springs.  The attendance was good and the collections were encouraging.

The weather in the past week has been very hot and bush fires have been raging.  One on Mr Duttonâ€™s property consumed a garden, outhouse and a large amount of feed before being extinguished by Mr S. Porter JP and others.  The other destroyed a quantity of timber and feed.  Both seem to have been the result of negligence.

On Monday morning a severe storm brought thunder, lightning, rain and hail.  The lightning and wind destroyed the verandah of the Emu Hotel at Black Springs.

Obituary.  Some time since a man named Kelly was killed when run over by his dray, leaving a wife and several children.  [This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD.]
