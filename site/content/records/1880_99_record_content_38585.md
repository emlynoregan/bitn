Editorial on Corporation Matters.

There is a great apathy about the Corporation.  Within two weeks of nomination day little has been done to field candidates.  Once it was an honour to be sought; now ratepayers seem to scorn to be involved.  It is not in the townâ€™s best interest to be represented inefficiently.  Even if people are reluctant to take on the work why are ratepayers allowing things to go on without making representations to good representatives?
