Railway Accident, Saturday afternoon.

About 1½ miles south of Burra near Rabbich’s slaughterhouse the 3.09 p.m. passenger train from Burra was derailed when it ran over a bull on a level crossing.  The engine plunged over a small embankment and just penetrated a wire fence.  The next carriage was the post office van whose occupants were considerably knocked about.  The first passenger car was stove in and crushed and how the half dozen passengers in it escaped is marvellous.  The third car was slightly damaged and all three leading cars were derailed.  The only person really injured was a man who leapt from the train.  The engine and post office van were at right angles to the track.  Repair gangs managed to open the line for the night train to get through about midnight.  Work continued all day Sunday when hundreds of locals visited the site.  Passengers were returned to Burra and went on in a special later.  No one so far admits to owning the animal that was cut to pieces in the event.
