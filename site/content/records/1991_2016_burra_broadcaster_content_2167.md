The Main Street Program meeting last Thursday drew about 40 interested people.  Speakers were:

Robert Jenkins of the Main Street Program

Harry Bechervaise, architect, who has worked with the program.

Douglas Alexander, Heritage Advisor to the Burra Burra DC.

Mr Jenkins said revitalising Burra’s main street can be done while protecting its cultural heritage.  The plan would involve design, heritage, business development, promotions and marketing.  Many centres in Australia and overseas have been through the process with impressive results.  A slide show illustrated places where the program had been implemented and also some of Burra’s impressive as well as some of its less attractive features.
