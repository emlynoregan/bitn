Burra Hospital Board.

So far the doctors have not managed to keep a meeting with representatives of the Board.

There was a letter from J. Halls objecting to pay £13-10-0 for 17 days hospital attention.  Though in isolation he could see no reason why a special nurse had been engaged from Adelaide.  The ward was unfit for human habitation.

Mr Lane said as they had an agreement with the Local Board of health to treat infectious cases for 30/- a week, how could they charge more?

Mr Winnall moved the bill be reduced to £4-10-0.  Carried.

Two other bills were reduced from 30/- a week to 25/- for enteric fever, as this was the ordinary ward charge.

The hospital had a shortage of patients – there were presently 9 – in the last two months the highest number any day had been 14 and the lowest 4.

Mr Winnall felt this had causes other than the level of health in the community and needed to be investigated, as a staff of 13 attending 7 to 8 patients was unsustainable.

Mr Gebhardt moved that the Chief Secretary be informed that under the circumstances the Board could not carry on the management.

Mr Winnall agreed that the Chief Secretary should, if necessary, appoint a new Board.

It has been stated that patients are being sent to private institutions.

Mr Crewes said it was a very serious thing to suggest closing the hospital.

A deputation will wait on the Chief Secretary.
