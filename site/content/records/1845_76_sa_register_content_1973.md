Notice.  Burra Burra Mines.  Notice to Miners and carters.  The next public survey day will take place at the mines on Monday 10 January.  Until then all underground operations are stopped, but full employment will be given to miners and others in dressing the ore now on the surface.

Carters are requested to observe the arrangements made for loading the drays during the holidays, and from the large quantity of ore now ready for carting they may rely on getting loaded without detention.
