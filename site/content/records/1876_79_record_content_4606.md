Editorial on the closing of public houses on Sundays. The editor felt that the cause of Sunday closing had lost much of its credibility and support due to the lack of discretion and knowledge on the part of its advocates. The question is not just a teetotal question, though they have taken it up. Only recently a Bill to limit Sunday trading was carried. He then went on to advocate the total abolition of all Sunday trading.
