Johnny Green: research by Ian Auhl

Johnny Green, the silent miner and mascot of the old Burra Burra Miners, has risen again – this time to the top of the resited Peacock’s Chimney.  Once again he is holding aloft his pick and gad at the mine entrance.  Johnny has been around the mine for more than 120 years.  Early paintings and photographs show he has always been the same, holding aloft his emblems on some high point of a mine building.  But he has moved around and his bodywork has changed.  The first Johnny Green was made of wood, as a hastily constructed mascot erected on the top of the wooden shears on Roach’s Pump House on the day it was completed in 1848 and it was still there in 1855 when he was seen by a reporter from the Observer in March.  He was said then to be in his old place, though the engine had been removed.

The second Johnny Green was made of iron and is still in existence, its limbs now riveted together since New Year Vandals tumbled it from its pole at the mine entrance a few years ago.  He is having a well-earned rest in the jinker shed.  When Schneider’s Engine House was completed in 1852 to house the new engine imported from Cornwall, Johnny was placed on the winding wheel platform over the shaft and an 1857 painting by [William] Bentley shows him there.  On approaching the Mine, wrote a visitor, the first object that strikes the eye is Schneider’s Engine House.  The engine works at seven strokes a minute, each time raising 136 gallons of water.  The completion of an engine house and chimney stack generally called for celebrations.  Masons and miners sometimes celebrated completion by drinking a barrel of ale on top.  (The author of this article had to settle for a stubby of beer when he went ‘up top’ on Saturday.)

With the starting of the engine came the christening of the building with brass band, speeches and champagne.  Johnny Green was there in 1852 to watch over the ‘christening’ of Schneider’s Pump House.  The Directors came from Adelaide.  Henry Ayers, Secretary of the SA Mining Association, threw a bottle of champagne at the beam and the Directors followed suit.

In 1858 when Morphett’s Engine House was completed the miners shifted their mascot to the poppet-head platform and it stayed there for the next 67 years, presiding over the death of the Mine in 1877.

During the Back to Burra week in 1925 an old miner, John Beale, returned for another look at Johnny Green.  He had been the ‘roper’ and for many years had stood by the iron figure of the miner on the high platform of Morphett’s Shaft.

In 1929 Frank Treloar in his 77th year published his reminiscences of the Mine in the Burra Record and wrote of Johnny Green, that he had stood silently on top of the pump house until a fire a few years ago caused his downfall.  He was carefully preserved and Mr Treloar was pleased then he learned Councillors intended to have the figure re-erected in a suitable position.  Neither Frank Treloar nor anyone else tells us if there was ever a real ‘Johnny Green’ among the miners.

[The report of the fire from the Burra Record in December 1925 is then reprinted.  The fire referred to occurred on Saturday morning 5 December 1925.]

At about 11 a.m. smoke was seen coming from the top storey of the small engine house close to Morphett’s Shaft and later grass nearby was also noticed alight.  Residents in the area beat out the grass fire, but not realising how serious the fire was, they failed to raise the alarm and tried to put it out themselves.  Between 2 and 3 p.m. it has assumed such proportions that fighting it was out of the question and soon the fire spread to the big engine house over Morphett’s Shaft.  The woodwork of immense proportions burnt like matches.  Towards midnight quite a crowd collected to see the blazing poppets fall, which supported the platform on which the big pulley wheel was fixed, used when the mine was working, for drawing ore up the shaft.  On this also stood the life-sized figure of a miner holding a round stone hammer and chisel.  This figure had always been revered by the miners and even the present generation felt regrets when it, in company with the wheel, crashed to the ground.  The wheel, five feet in diameter and at white heat, broke, but the figure was not badly damaged.  Morphett’s Shaft is heavily timbered and is now burning fiercely.  On Saturday night the sight was very beautiful with flames leaping to a great height.  On Sunday hundreds gathered to see the large columns of smoke ascending from Morphett’s Shaft and the beam timber could be heard falling away and crashing into the water below.

The property belongs to Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride of Adelaide.

Police are investigating, but it is generally alleged the fire was caused by some lads smoking out pigeons, of which a large number live in these buildings.  Many old miners say it could be weeks before the fire burns itself out.

The following week the paper apologised for saying the figure carried a hammer and chisel.  It was in fact a pick and miner’s gad.  The head had a miner’s hat and place for a candle in front.

At the December meeting of the Town Council it was decided to approach Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd and request them to present to the town the effigy of the miner brought to the ground in the recent fire.

Johnny eventually found himself on top of a pole at the mine entrance, where he remained until vandals cut him down in 1967.  The second Johnny Green was too broken to be given another lease of life and was pensioned off to the jinker enclosure while his ‘ghost’ still hovers above.  It is appropriate that the new Johnny Green was fashioned and presented to the Burra National Trust by the new mine owners Samin Ltd.

[See the report of the fire XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3.  The report in the paper seems to indicate that the fire occurred on 12 December, but the boys who started it appeared in court on 10 December, which would seem to make the date of the fire Saturday 5 December rather than Saturday 12 December. In XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3 the court case is also reported.  This reveals that the boys were attempting to smoke out rabbits (not pigeons) from under the floor of the engine house near Morphett’s Engine House.]
