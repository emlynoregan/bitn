Kooringa News, 3 January

New Year pranks included blocking the main street with a double bank of empty cases and the tying of door handles.  Worst of all was the tin-kettling, hurrahing and singing, assisted by the Band of Hope and known as the Drum and Fife Band.  They kept people awake till daybreak.

It has been unusually hot – up to 104°F in the shade and there has been fine dust in the air.

Picnics were popular on New Year’s Day.

Races were held at Westbury and were well patronised on 31 December and 1 January.  One accident occurred when a horse bolted in the Ladies’ Race near the winning post and threw her rider, Ruth Llewellyn, to the ground.  She was stunned, but soon recovered.

[Race results are printed.]

Kangaroo dogs are still annoying sheep in the district.  Captain Killicoat has lost 15 sheep killed and 20 scattered and not yet found.
