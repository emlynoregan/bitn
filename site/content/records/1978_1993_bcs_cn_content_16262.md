Clement Howard Smith

Aged 58 and semi-retired married man with two children.  I moved from Hawker eighteen months ago, where I owned Rawnsley Park – a sheep property adjacent to Wilpena Pound.  It is still held by my family.  We entered upon tourism in 1968 and Rawnsley Park now has eight self-contained cabins and a caravan park.  I learnt much that affects the traveller and I guided tours for fourteen years.  If elected I would work for the bituminising of the Morgan-Burra Road, support the plan to make Burra the Merino Capital of the World, to at least retain present hospital services and seek Government assistance at controlling the earwig menace.  I have served twelve years on the Great Northern War Memorial Hospital at Hawker and for two years there as a Town Councillor.  Burra’s history and stone buildings have impressed me and I would endeavour to retain this part of Burra’s Heritage.  My main interests are gardening, bowls and golf.
