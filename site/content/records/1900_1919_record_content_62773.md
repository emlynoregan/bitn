The Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held last Monday at the Institute.  Mr F. Treloar took the chair and about 35 attended.  The Mayor regretted the small turnout.  The mayor said that he had promised to do his best to carry out his duties and any failure was not for want of trying.  He had been asked to stand again to see the erection of the Soldiers’ Memorial, but had declined to do so.  He read his report.

Cr Radford said it was to the Town Clerk’s credit that of £1,000 due in rates only about £8 was outstanding.  Generally the financial position was healthy.  The health account deficit was the main problem.  He referred to hoodlum activity, which all should try to stop.  The new public telephone in Aberdeen was an example.  People jammed it with buttons etc.

Cr Dane said he had done his best without being anything extraordinary.  Much of the surplus in West Ward was due to lack of tar and labour for approved works.  The old time feud between North and other Wards seems to have died out and he hoped it would not be revived.
