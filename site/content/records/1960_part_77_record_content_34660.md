Mr Bob Fuss remembered recently that a rabbit he had chased 60* years ago had led him into a cave in the banks of the Burra Creek.  Thinking it over he returned to the scene and his memory had served him correctly.  The rabbit had its home in an old minerâ€™s home in the bank of the creek.  The home is still there and if the cave-in was dug out it probably still has two of the rooms intact behind it.  Bob feels he is a little too old to excavate it.  Perhaps someone younger will undertake the job.  [*Corrected 90, 22 (2), 6 June 1967, page 7 to 70 years ago.]
