Extract from the Register concerning the reopening of Burra Mine.

SA would be all the richer if the Burra Burra Copper Mine, 100 miles north of Adelaide, were reopened.  A strong effort is currently being made to reopen the mine.  A proposal will soon be placed before the public to form a company with a nominated capital of £250,000 to purchase and work the same.

Discovered in 1845, the wealth was exploited by the SA Mining Association.  In 29½ years it yielded about £4,750,000 worth of copper ore.  £2,241,167 was spent in wages and over £800,000 went to the fortunate shareholders.  Most ore came from a rich pocket of carbonate ore between the surface and 300 feet.  The other big workings, 1,000’ away, were where a shaft was sunk 600’ and two large reefs were struck.  Mr W. West, who manages the property, believes ‘she will make a very deep mine’.  Little was done to develop the mine at depth when it was producing well and when supplies of the oxidised ore began to fail there was insufficient money to carry on the necessary deadwork.  There had been one or two suspensions previously, but the mine finally closed in 1877.

Copper prices have now risen again, machinery is now better and more economical and the cost of carriage and fuel is now much lower.  A ton of copper could now be landed at Pt Adelaide from the mine for 7/4 as against 25/8 in the old days.  A ton of coal delivered to the mine now for 30/- was then worth £2-10-0.

Tributers fossicking about the place have found rich ore and the waste stuff and tailings are all worth reworking by modern methods.  The shares of the SAMA are now mainly in the hands of executors and trustees who cannot speculate, but it is proposed the new company buy the whole mine – a freehold of 672 acres and mining rights over 11,065 acres.

Recent bores have found copper pyrites at 813’ and continued for many feet, confirming the downwards continuation of copper bearing ground.  For the past 14 years tributers varying from 5 to 30 have been making a living and 15 are presently employed.  In full production the mine should employ about 1,000 men.  [This effort was to result in the formation of the Burra Burra Copper Co.]
