Burra Town Council, 2 February

The Council replied to the Waterworks question by saying that since it had practically no knowledge of how the expenses were made up it could not offer suggestions on savings, but if details of clerical and other costs were supplied they would give it the fullest consideration.

The Unemployed Relief Council sent a letter received on 30 January explaining a grant had been allotted to Councils proportional to registered unemployment on 18 December 1930.  The grant had to be expended in wages paid at the basic wage rate, for work that would otherwise not be done.  The amount was £117-12-0 and the list of proposed work was to be returned by 31 January 1931.

The Mayor thought that under the circumstances the late reply would not matter.

Discussion followed on work that would not need the provision of materials – largely clearing waterways and footpaths.

Alex Bevan applied for a reduction in the cost of his licence.  At present it was £3-5-0 + 5/- for a local licence for the driver and also a licence and ticket for the railway platform.

Cr Bevan complained that one man was running around town paying nothing – proceedings were promised, but nothing done.

The Town Clerk and the Mayor then differed over the authority required for action.

After discussion the application was to lie on the table for a fortnight.

The Mayor read the auditors’ report of two missing receipts; one from a book printed 15 years ago and the other 22 years ago.  Both were for small amounts.  Later the matter was cleared up.  The Mayor said there were certain other matters that required clearing up and wanted a special meeting on Monday night.

Cr Pearce asked if the Mayor believed something was wrong.

Mayor – No. – ‘some of the business methods are unsatisfactory.  There is no honester clerk than Mr Davey.’

The special meeting is to be held in the Lodge Room.

According to notice Cr Bevan moved that the motion requiring all Public Works be considered and recommended by the Public Works Committee be rescinded.

Cr Pearce objected, but it was carried.

The Town Clerk estimated the rates to be collected as:	North Ward	552-0-9
