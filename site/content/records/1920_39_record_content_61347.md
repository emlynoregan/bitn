Mr James Bentley was given a farewell by staff of Drew & Crewes Ltd after forty-three years of service in the grocery department of the firm.  For many years he has been in charge of that department.  The manager, Mr Potter, praised Mr Bentley for his qualities as a gentleman and for the efficiency of his work and his conscientiousness and wished him every success in the city.  He was supported in his remarks by Mr L.S. Penrose, who is now the oldest employee of the company.  He made a presentation of a leather case.  Miss Thompson, Mr Bob Seigert and Mr S. Dunow also spoke in appreciative terms of their association with Mr Bentley as a fellow employee.  Mr John Drew, as the local director of the firm, sent his apologies for his unavoidable absence.  Mr Bentley was also farewelled by the Kooringa Masonic Lodge on Tuesday, when a presentation was made by WM Bro. H. Jennison.
