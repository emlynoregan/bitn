Mt Bryan East.  On Tuesday 30 September rainfall totalling 130 points fell during the day and during the night a thunderstorm added another 130 points.  Dust Hole Creek flooded removing many fences in the catchment and district roads have been affected.

An Earth Tremor was felt at Mt Bryan East about 5.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, rattling things a little.

‘An Ordinary Public Citizen’ writes complaining about the supper arrangements at the Hospital Ball on 3 October.  White and green tickets were issued and he wonders on what basis.  In any event many were left supperless.
