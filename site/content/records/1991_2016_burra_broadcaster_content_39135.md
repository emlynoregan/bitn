Letter.  Robert Frischke of Burra Motor Inn writes strongly advocating shopping locally and hiring local tradesmen to support the town.  Since Paul and he had taken over the motel in September 2011 they had spent some $313,000 in the local community and he estimated that in doing so had effectively injected more than $1 million into the local economy.
