Burra Town Council.

Cr Ridgway moved that the offer of the Reserve in Aberdeen be not accepted.  [After discussion the outcome of this is not clear.]

Unemployment.  A memorial signed by 60 ratepayers asked the Council for work.  The Government has agreed to clean out Barker’s Dam if the settlers will guarantee to raise £30.  There was no resolution to this issue at this time.

Town Council asked the Midland Road Board to construct a footbridge near the Mine Bridge and to improve the ford at the Bon Accord Hotel to get to Drew’s Store.
