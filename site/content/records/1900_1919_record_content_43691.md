Public Welcome for Volunteers.

On Tuesday at the Institute there was a public welcome for Captain Chaplain Nield, Trooper Ockenden, Pte Ashton and Signaller [Ross] Harris.  Mr Crewes welcomed the returned men followed by Rev. J.C. Jennison who urged the Government to adopt conscription.  He tells a story of the discovery of a whole series of buildings at a Lutheran Mission near the top of the Australian Bight near a beautiful bay for landing and within easy reach of the overland railway – all of which he found very disturbing.  The social evil of drink should also be put down and prohibition introduced for all.  Rev. S.J. Bloyd spoke and then Mr Winnall.  Captain Nield responded on behalf of all the returned men.  He included some interesting observations on the broadening effect the adventure was having on Australians and how their admiration of the Indians they had encountered would mean ‘The boys would come back feeling that the White Australia policy must go by the board’.
