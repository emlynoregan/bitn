Press Telegrams.  The editor complains that the postal authorities on Saturday suddenly refused to deliver telegrams to them except at the ordinary rates.  Telegrams at press rates will only be sent the day before the publication of the paper.  The editor feels this is unreasonable and also counterproductive for the post office.  In any event they were printing extras as soon as the news arrived and distributing 300 copies to Redruth, Aberdeen, Kooringa and railway carriages.
