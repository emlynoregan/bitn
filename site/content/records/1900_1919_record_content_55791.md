Robert James McBride has just won his case against his daughter, Mrs Caroline Sandland, on appeal to the Full High Court in Melbourne.  This overturns the order of Mr Justice Buchanan in the SA Supreme Court previously given in favour of the daughter.  [The dispute was over ownership of a property at Flagstaff, which Mr McBride had bought in 1895 for £4,167, but which is now valued at about £12,000.]  The court also ruled that Mr McBride was not entitled to costs in either court.
