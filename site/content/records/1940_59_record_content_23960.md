Prisoners of War

The latest former prisoners of war to return to Burra are Pte Dennis Harris and Pte Frank Preiss.  The return of Pte Cyril Moore has already been reported and we now hear that Bob Lee, son of Mr & Mrs W.R. Lee, formerly of Burra and now of Adelaide, has also returned.

F/Lt Brian Riggs is currently a pilot in a Liberator taking supplies to Manila and returning with prisoners of war.  He writes to his parents, Mr & Mrs A.B. Riggs, describing Manila as seen from the fifth floor of what was once the cityâ€™s most luxurious hotel.  Now every building is damaged and gaunt walls and rubble show where modern buildings acted as a foil to fifteenth century architecture.  He describes the carnage of the last stand of the Japanese in the old city and where American soldiers fell in a green morass.  The bridges were all destroyed, though they have now been replaced with Bailey Bridges.  He talks of the frenzied activity of the Americans and the business of the loading and unloading of supplies.  He left Manila with 20 prisoners of war, three other passengers and Matron Sage.

Mt Bryan staged a social on Tuesday night for Cpl Manning, Sgt Ron Murray, Cpl Arthur Jarmyn and Driver Cecil Beckwith.  Cpl Arthur Jarmyn had been a prisoner in Germany for more than three years and Dvr Cecil Beckwith had been a prisoner in Singapore for a similar period.  A travelling rug was presented to each of the men on behalf of the district.
