Fires.  Three fires occurred in quick succession last week:

At 8 p.m. Friday at Burra North a fire near the ballast quarry was soon extinguished by the EFS.

Soon after that one broke out on W. Brownâ€™s property on the Mt Bryan Road.  The Burra Fire Brigade soon extinguished this fire.

A little later a fire broke out on the property of Mr N. Finch and this was soon extinguished by the EFS.

The occupant of a white sedan car has been questioned about these three outbreaks.
