This is only a little more than half those employed in 1859.  It seems that much of the savings comes from ceasing to explore for copper in new directions.  When in 1859 the number employed exceeded 1,200 the profit for the two half years was £4-8-3 and £3-7-8 per ton.  Now it is £1-17-5 per ton.

The Directors are anxious to find some way of turning their low grade ores to account.  They are still in correspondence with Mr Henderson on the subject of his patent process for the reduction of low grade ores.  This is a matter which would interest many proprietors of mines across the colony.
