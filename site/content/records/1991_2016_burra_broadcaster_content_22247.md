Thorogood’s Cider cellar launched their 1999 vintage on Thursday 4 May.  The honour of launching the new wines was given to Rosie Glow of SA Tourism Best Kept Secrets.

Susan and Tony purchased 100 acres of Burra hill country in 1990.  In 1991 they planted the first of 10,000 native trees and their first apple tree, a Cox’s Orange Pippin.  Since then they have planted some 800 trees from 70 sorts of apple, most of then antique varieties.  They also built their mud brick home and moved in on Christmas Eve 1993.  They moved permanently to Burra in 1995 and began making cider on an experimental basis.  In 1999 they did a small business course and borrowed enough money to build the cider cellar.  They opened tasting rooms on 13 July 1999, since when sales have exceeded projections.  They have appointed a marketing manager and are speaking to Austrade about overseas exports.  The customer base is 50% local and SA and 30% Sydney & Melbourne.
