Burra Town Council

W. Kakoschke reported damage to the bridge at Aberdeen by one of his lorry drivers.  He asked for allowance to be made, as the bridge was too narrow for large lorries.  An account for the repairs will be sent to Mr Kakoschke.

The Relief Council sent details of the Christmas Relief work arrangements with no payments to be made until 23 December.

Woods, Bagot & Co. architects of Adelaide wrote about a sleep-out for the National Bank in Kooringa.  [From the discussion it would seem the intention was to build it over the footpath, since the Council said it was not in favour unless the pillars were placed level with the kerbing.  Two trees would have to come out.]

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. reply that they were not prepared to reserve a portion of the slag heap for Burra Council use, but the Council was welcome to have any amount they wanted while supplies lasted.

A ratepayer was granted permission to work off his rates.
