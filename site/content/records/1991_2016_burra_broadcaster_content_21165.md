Burra Community Event of the Year was the Greening of the Burra Golf Course.

This has increased the number of visitors coming to Burra to play golf and produced a larger filed on open days.  Membership of the club has doubled in six months.  The move has beautified the northern entrance to the town. The project was completed without a Government grant.
