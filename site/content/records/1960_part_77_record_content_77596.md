Football

The Mid North Football League has been dissolved.  Mr A.E. Bannear, Secretary of the League, has advised of the steps in the dissolution of the League.  Notice of the intention of member clubs for the 1976 season was required by 24 December 1975.  It was:

Auburn FC: withdrawal from the League and to remain in recess for 1976.

Aberdeen FC: no response, but remaining in recess for 1976.

Mintaro-Manoora: withdrawal from the League and joining the North Eastern Football League.

Riverton FC: withdrawal from the League and joining the Barossa & Light League.

Robertstown FC: withdrawal from the League and joining the Barossa & Light League.

Saddleworth-Marrabel United FC will amalgamate with the Riverton FC with the new team to enter the Barossa & Light League.

As a consequence the AGM of the Mid North Football League will be held on 2 February 1976 at Saddleworth, when it will discuss and act on clause 6 of the constitution, to dissolve the League.  In the next two months all players will be transferred either to the Barossa & Light League or to the North Eastern Football League and in the case of the Riverton and United players, transferred to the new club and then to the Barossa & Light League.  A wind-up dinner will be held at a date to be fixed.  A history of the League from its foundation, possibly in 1911, to its dissolution is in hand.  Clubs are asked to give consideration to setting aside certain funds for this purpose.
