Pip Edson writes as chair of the Burra Regional Art Gallery thanking parents, friends, staff and students of the Burra Community School for their support of the Portrait Competition which the gallery is running.  Special thanks also to Len & Muriel Bence for judging the many entries.  As a community event the evening was a wonderful success.  The winning entries from the school will go on display in the gallery from 4 April.
