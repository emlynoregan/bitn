Weather.  Good general falls of 1 to 2 inches have ensured a good opening to the season.  Burra recorded 256 points.  Mt Bryan East had 120 points last week and 120 more at the weekend.  Dust Hole Creek carried a small flood on Tuesday.

Electricity.  ETSA will extend power to Mt Bryan East and also east of Hallett.

Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1929

E.A. Haese was Headmaster with Ruth Bachelor, Elizabeth Jones and Stella Parker.  The enrolment was 54.  The school was still being painted when the year began.  A professor deplored the waste of money in educating many in our schools and Dr Steele attacked him, saying that knowledge was power and while it might be dangerous to educate the masses, it was right to give the boys and girls every chance and this was a duty parents owed the child and the nation.

1930

The staff was unchanged and the enrolment was 49.  The Headmaster returned to find drawers forced, lockers broken and 11/7 missing.  On 3 September Brown’s bus, Fuss’s lorry and seven cars took students to Clare for the Mid North High Schools’ Sports.  Between Hanson and Farrell Flat Fuss’s lorry was bogged for two hours.
