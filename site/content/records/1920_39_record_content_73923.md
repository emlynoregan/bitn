Burra Town Council, 6 February

After inspection it was decided the road from Chapel St Bridge to the Methodist Church was not fit for sealing and it would be prepared in winter for sealing next season.

Council agreed to widen the road by the hospital by 3-4ft and to remove 3 or 4 trees as well as moving the fence and a light pole.

Cr McWaters reported on ‘Eyre Street Road’ [sic].  He said it seemed in good order, but for 3-4 chains at the north end and near Grow’s Bridge.
