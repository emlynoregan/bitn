We missed out on Arbor Day due to the dry conditions.

The lunch room has been nicely furnished and the free milk system is working well.

There is still a move afoot to have an extension library in the main building, a new classroom in the yard and a new block of lavatories for Primary School use on the east side.

The latest advice from the Department is that the main school roof is to be renovated to do away with the roofing well and the box guttering – rendering many pigeons homeless and helping to keep drinking water clean.
