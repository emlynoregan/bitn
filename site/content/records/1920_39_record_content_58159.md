Burra Town Council, 7 October

Council was invited to attend the Anniversary Celebrations at the Kooringa Methodist Church.  They decided to attend the afternoon service.

The Minister of railways advised that although no ballast was presently required 500 tons would be ordered from the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  A letter of appreciation for their efforts will be sent to the District MPs.

The Commissioner of Public works advises a new reservoir and pumping plant will be erected at a cost of £4,150.  Another letter of appreciation will be sent to the District MPs.

The Mayor said Burra slag was now being used on roads as far away as Mt Lofty.  The Highway Department’s last purchase was for 5,000 tons.  The immense heap would gradually disappear.

Cr Dow thought not for many years.

The Mayor thought they should apply for a portion to be set aside for local use, as it was a valuable asset. [The discussion then went on for some time about making good roads by sufficient rolling.]

Eventually it was decided to send a letter to the owners of the slag heap, Goldsbrough, Mort & Co., asking for an agreement for some of it to be reserved for the Burra Town Council use.

It was resolved that new post in reinforced concrete be put in for the bridge at Gully’s Wharf.
