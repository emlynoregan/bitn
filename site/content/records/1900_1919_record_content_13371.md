R. Giles, clerk at the court, has come across a couple of wine bottles which apparently were evidence in the case of a sale of wine to an Aboriginal.  It bears the label: ‘This bottle contains part of wine sold by Mrs _____ (we omit the name) to Paddy Richardson, aboriginal native of South Australia, on Monday November 23 1868, and obtained by me from him on our way home.  F. Drought, Police-trooper.’

The second bottle was empty, but the first half-full.

Anyone who would like to try the contents after their having been sipped by Paddy can do so by paying 10/6 to the Burra Hospital.  Its presence testifies to the abstinence of Mr Forder, the respected Clerk of the Court, who sat in the office for 40 years with the wine in the cupboard.  Trooper Drought was clerk in the office of the Commissioner of Police in Adelaide about 18 years ago, but has now been dead about 15 years.
