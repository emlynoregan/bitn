Editorial on Railways

[The editor says that in glancing over the Parliamentary debates, it seems it has been decided that all new lines are to be 3’ 6”, as they are less costly to construct.  Lines hitherto had been 5’3”.]

We wonder why the 4’8” [sic: for 4’8½”] was not adopted at the outset, when it was common in the UK.  With some 400 miles of track contemplated it is an important consideration, especially as the Pt Augusta line is seen as the first instalment of a transcontinental line to Pt Darwin.

The savings in a 3’6” line must be considerable.  The savings in sleepers alone is significant.  Some say that the 3’6” gauge is not cheapest in the long run.  But we think this decision is wise. Even if the 3’6” lines are limited to 20-25 m.p.h. it will be a great improvement on the speed of wagons or drays.  A line built cheaply at say £2,500 per mile to operate at 20 m.p.h. might serve for five years.  In our circumstance (where it is important to open up large areas of new country quickly, at minimal cost) this is better than a line costing £5,000 per mile to operate at 40 m.p.h. with a life of 10 years. An instance of this is the Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta lines, which we believe were constructed at a cost of less than £2,400 per mile and are satisfactorily carrying heavy loads at 20 m.p.h.  We believe there will be no great delays in starting the Pt Augusta and North West Bend [Morgan] lines and that these lines will herald the commencement of a new and prosperous era for SA.
