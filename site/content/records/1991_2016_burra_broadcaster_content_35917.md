Letter.  Pastor Lyn & Phil Arthur write re the establishment of Burra Community Church.

They explain they have come to Burra to offer themselves and their style of worship to the community because people relate to different styles of worship and they will offer informal teaching and worship.   Rather than a Sunday Service there will be two home fellowship meetings per week on Tuesdays at 7.30 p.m. and Wednesday s at 1.30 p.m.  There will be an informal ‘Meet & Greet’ on 1 & 2 March at 6 Church Street.
