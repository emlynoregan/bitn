Hon. G.S. Kingston said Captain Roach had been there more than twenty years, arriving about June 1846 and had never failed to fulfil his duties to both employers and employed.  He had superintended the raising of 200,000 tons of perhaps the richest ore in the world, worth £2,000,000 to the colony.  The mine had employed large numbers, contributed to the development of Kooringa and the district and been the source of profit to many now in flourishing circumstances.

Mr Challoner had been employed by the company for twenty years, arriving but a year after Captain Roach.  Large sums has passed through his hands  in wages and for the purchase of timber and other supplies and all without exciting ill feeling or dispute  and with the strictest integrity.

Mr Elphick was a younger employee and had lived for about nineteen years among the inhabitants of Kooringa.  In all those years his assays had rarely been challenged and on those rare occasions had been resolved in his favour.  In assays between the Mine and the Copper Company the latter sometimes complained his results were too high, but again when referred to Me Walters, the highest authority in England, the result favoured Mr Elphick.

Captain Roach was cheered when he rose to express his thanks.

Mr Challoner stated that the present was not the proudest moment of his life.  He felt sure that when they were all dead the mine would again be worked and be more prosperous then than ever.

Mr Elphick expressed his thanks to those assembled.

Captain Killicoat said that eighteen years ago the copper price was as low as now, had then risen to £137 a ton and since fallen again to £78, but there were no reasons to suppose it would not rise again.

The mine only went to 60 fathoms and it would certainly go deeper, although perhaps not by the present company.  Another cause of the stoppage was the lack of a railway.  Had that been made sixteen years ago the Burra would not now be in its present plight.

[Various other toasts followed.]

Hon. G.S. Kingston said he had arrived in SA thirty-three years ago.  He had laid out Burra twenty-two years ago and always felt a great interest in its progress.  He felt sorry for its present state and believed there would yet be good times ahead.

The meeting terminated at midnight.
