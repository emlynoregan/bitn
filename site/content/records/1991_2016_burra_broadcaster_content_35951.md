Goyder Council

Flood damage in December was considerable, especially in the whole of the eastern region of the Council area.  The Local Government Disaster Fund engaged an engineer to assess damages and this resulted in a claim for all wards for $477,240 for resheeting of roads and of $1,073,580 for edge and gully filling.  Funding for repairs to creeks/floodways/head and endwalls on category 1 & 2 roads is still being considered by the LGDF.

Miss Sally Fieldhouse of Farrell Flat has been appointed Chairperson of Goyder Tourism Committee.

Council has approved the expenditure of $1,000 from Goyder Promotion Fund as a contribution to the SA Museum for work involved in setting up a display featuring the fossil heritage of environs to be housed in the Council’s Burra Office foyer.

[Display set up – later moved in December 2015 to the restored Railway Station.]

Council will donate $1,000 to the Eyre Peninsula Bushfire Appeal fundraiser organised by the five Burra hotels.

Council responded to a request from the Mt Bryan Progress Association re the Sir Hubert Wilkins Memorial Park Playground.  Training for two volunteers will be arranged so that fortnightly inspections of equipment can be made and recorded.  Council staff will inspect two-monthly and report to the Progress Association.

Plots 318-320 in Hallett Cemetery will be set aside for Niche Memorials.
