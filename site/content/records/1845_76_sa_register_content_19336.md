Kooringa News, 25 April

Bigamy.  On Wednesday Mr John Bagg of Springbank sustained a charge of bigamy against his wife.  The case aroused much interest as Mr Bagg is an old settler at Burra.  Mr Bagg said he met his wife 27 years ago on Kangaroo Island.  They had lived together unmarried for five years and she then left him and married a man called William Seymour.  After a few weeks she returned to Bagg and lived with him.  Fifteen years after their first intimacy Bagg married his wife (in Burra), she having assured him that Seymour was dead.  The pair often quarrelled and at times lived apart.  Three months after the most recent separation Bagg laid this information.  William Seymour, the first husband, was produced in court along with a witness, Mrs Janet Bristow, to his marriage with Mrs Bagg.  Mrs Bagg was committed for trial.

A serious assault occurred at the Smelters’ Home last Friday.  A man who was partially intoxicated challenged any person to a fight and when no one accepted the challenge he struck Mr D. Quigley without provocation, while the latter was drinking a glass of ale.  The latter threw the tumbler he was drinking from at the assailant and it smashed, inflicting a severe wound.  As the man provoked the assault the matter was settled out of court.
