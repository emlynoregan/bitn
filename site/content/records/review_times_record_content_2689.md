Mrs Jean Jamieson is the hard working Secretary of the Burra Show Society.  She says entries in most sections were up at this time.  There were two areas of concern; horse events she thought suffered from non-affiliation with the Equestrian Federation of Australia and the sheep section could be affected by the new brucellosis testing at the Royal Adelaide Show.
