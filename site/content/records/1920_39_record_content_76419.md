Red Cross.  President Mrs J. Tennant presided at a meeting on 21 September to discuss efforts to assist the needs of the war.  Mrs Woollacott reported on the meeting at Government House on 12 September called by Lady Barclay-Harvey.  It was necessary to create a stock of made articles for the auxiliary equipment of wartime hospitals.  Clothing and garments will be collected.  New branches of Red Cross will be needed where they have lapsed since World War I.  Advisory committees will be needed to co-ordinate the work of the Red Cross, VSDs & JRC units.  Clothing will be cut by professional cutters.  A range of knitted items is needed and knitting instructions will be supplied.  Old linen is to be collected, boiled, ironed and packed in readiness.  Funds must be raised and proper accounts kept.  Mrs E.F. Marston reported she had visited the Central Red Cross Office on 18 September and there procured materials for making pyjamas and shirts and wool for knitting cardigans and socks.  Transport was free on railways and F.T. Sara offered free delivery from the station.  Mrs L. Day promised to teach knitting to anyone.  Several ladies offered to lend sewing machines.  An advisory committee was formed and a social committee to raise funds.
