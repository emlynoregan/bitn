The Minister of Local Government has tabled a report in Parliament putting forward options for the amalgamation of Councils.  The report outlines proposals for Burra Burra DC to amalgamate with up to six other Councils.

One option is for a super-council with the merging of Clare, Blyth-Snowtown, Burra Burra, Robertstown, Saddleworth-Auburn and part of Spalding.

The report suggests Hallett would fit with Crystal Brook, Redhill, Rocky River, Jamestown and part of Spalding.

There would be significant redefining of Council boundaries and not a simple putting together of Councils.  The amalgamations would also have to resolve the distribution of assets, debts etc.
