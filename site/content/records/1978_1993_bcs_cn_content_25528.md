Chris Reed

I have been a Councillor for seven years and have concentrated on developing the tourist industry of Burra and District through Council initiatives – including the Burra Tourist Association.  My years have given me first hand experience in dealing with the many problems facing Local Government – especially rates, roads and rubbish.  I believe my background in Council, in a family rural enterprise and briefly in a town business gives me the skills to continue to develop the town and community for the good of all electors.
