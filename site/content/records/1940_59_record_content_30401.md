Obituary.  Harry Mann was found dead in his home about six miles from Burra on Friday evening.  He was aged 74.  MC Carter prepared a report for the coroner, Mr H.J.B. Jennison, who gave his finding that death had been caused by a self-inflicted gun-shot wound and an inquest was deemed unnecessary.
