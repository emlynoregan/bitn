Burra Racing Club, Cup Meeting 20 March

There was good racing though the fields were small.  In the main race the Burra Cup there was a dead heat.  Attendance was the smallest for many years reflecting the financial depression of the times.  The Burra Cup paid £90 for 1st, £10 for 2nd place and £5 for third.  The dead heat was H.E. Gregory’s b.g. Little Gun ridden by C. Selby and C.L. Gardiner’s c.m. Orixa ridden by R. Fleet.
