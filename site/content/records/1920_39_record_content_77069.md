Burra Progress Assoc. continues to agitate for improvement to the Farrell’s Flat road and against hawkers in town and to try for Military Camps in the district.  It supported the Bowls Tournament on 31 December.  The matter of the side-shows at the Burra Show was discussed.

The side-show proprietors threatened to pack up and leave if their fee was not reduced from 1/- to 6d a foot.  The Show Committee refused to act; saying it was obliged to confer with other societies.

The Progress Assoc. expressed the view it was unable to see how the Show Committee could adopt an attitude which would result in a breach of faith so far as the public was concerned. The actions of Messrs Bence and Scovell to guarantee the side-shows remained had to be applauded.

The Association did not suspect that the guarantors would be presented with the bill and in this were patently mistaken.  It was a bill they felt should have been borne by the Show Society and a bill that seriously depleted the Association’s funds.
