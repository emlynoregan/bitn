Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports on Boxing Day had some good running.  The Aboriginal runner F. Williams contested several heats of the Sheffield handicap of £30.  This ‘dark horse’ – very appropriately named in this case – stood almost unconcerned till the shot was heard and then with a pleasant smile came away with wonderful rapidity, passing his opponents as he liked.  His running was a treat to witness.  In the forced handicap of 135 yards Williams put up a record of 13.2 secs.

The bicycle events were also well contested with entries from Adelaide.

Richards, the local champion, did not show out at all and apparently suffered from too much training.  We believe he also makes an error in riding both a racer and the pneumatic roadster.  The peddling of each is very different and one confuses the other.  He should stick to one if he is to do well.  Dun Morton did well in winning the one mile for ordinary bikes.
