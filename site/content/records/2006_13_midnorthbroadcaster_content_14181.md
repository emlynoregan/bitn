Ally Fricker for ‘Stop Industrial Windfarms’ writes to dispute the points made recently by Cameron Garnsworthy of TRU energy.  She says the ‘independent’ noise consultants are not truly independent.  Their business depends on the company’s business.  Only a government appointed body could achieve a measure of independence.  She disputes his other points as well.
