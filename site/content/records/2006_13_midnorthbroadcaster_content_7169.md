Aly Fricker of Robertstown also attacks Jacki Mattey, accusing her of not understanding the dynamics of the democratic process.  It is just because a vocal minority can dominate proceedings that a formal motion and voting on the resolution is important when it comes to determining the wishes of the meeting.  She suggests that it is an error to regard the whole process of a legitimate meeting as a slur against the Council.
