Fires.  There was a big fire on Mt Bryan Estate last Wednesday.  It started on the TSR about two miles south of Hallett, possibly from a drovers’ camp at Gumbowie crab holes.  It soon spread to the corner of the Gumbowie Paddock and then a SW change carried it towards Hallett in high grass.  It reached a road in about a mile, but falling trees carried across Price’s Gully and it ran on for several miles.  Back burning saved the Kerklo Paddock and Mr Norriss’s property.  Towards evening it broke out again in the Gumbowie Paddock and was brought under control about 2 a.m. Thursday, though there was a later small outbreak.  The Hallett Paddock lost c. 2,000 acres of grass and the Gumbowie Paddock about 200 acres.  A few sheep were scorched in the former.  It continues to burn in scrub, but is considered safe.
