Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes expressing concern that Country Health SA is seeking to have the title of the land on which the Burra hospital stands transferred to it from the Burra Burra Hospital Inc. of Kooringa.  This is a practice throughout the state, but there appears to be no guarantee that it will not then be sold on.  It is not inconceivable that a future owner may not want a hospital on his piece of ground.  Surely it is short sighted to move the ownership of a vital asset from local control to the hands of an entity composed largely of people with no links to that community.  These quasi government bodies are forever changing.  If I am wrong, this letter will enable someone to come forward to put the record straight and publicly explain, in understandable language, with no fudging or waffling, just exactly what is happening and why.
