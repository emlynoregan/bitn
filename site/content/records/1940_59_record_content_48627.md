Burra Burra DC

The Commissioner of Railway advises that with a crossing 20 chains north of the Mt Bryan Station, a new crossing is considered unwarranted and one so near the end of the station yard is undesirable.  The clerk will write again, pointing out the difficulty of using the existing crossing to access the town, due to the position of the Burra Creek and to the blockage of the southern crossing by shunting.

With Farrell Flat connected to the water main, the Council approved 300 ft of 2½” canvas hose and fittings to be purchased for emergency fire use.

Booborowie Hall thanks the Council for its improved drainage.

A.A. Short’s application to buy 11 acres of District Road, presently rented by him from the Council and adjoining his property in the Hundred of Hanson, was approved.

The superannuation question for Council employees was tabled for one month.

On 30 November the Council truck was slightly damaged in a collision with a car when turning into the Burra North Quarry.

L.C. Kaehne ceased to be the Ranger on 6 November and on 4 December W.A. Nankivell was appointed in his place.
