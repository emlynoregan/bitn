Burra Swimming Pool.  The official handover of the pool to the Burra Burra DC took place on 1 March.  The Pool Committee also met on 1 March to decide a number of issues â€“ especially when it would be available for use.  [The article does not reveal their decision on this.]

Much was achieved at a working bee over the weekend:

Fencing was completed

Lawns were planted

Fine sand was placed between the pavers.
