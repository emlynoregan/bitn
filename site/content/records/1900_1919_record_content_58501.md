This expenditure has prevented the enlargement of the hall and the erection of a verandah at the main entrance, until funds are available.

Welcome to Anzacs.

In Market Square last Friday afternoon a welcome home was given to five more of our original Anzacs and a visiting one: Sgt J. Hatherly, WO J. Murison, Sgt W. Sellars, Sgt W. Dow, Sgt F. Wheatley, & Sgt Collins and also to Ptes J. Hogan, T. Harrap, H. Brown, & Les McGowan.

The group marched with the Ladies’ band from the Cheer-up Room to Market Square at 4 p.m.  After the soldiers were welcomed a collection was taken up for the Ladies’ band uniform.
