Burra Town Council, 2 November

Cr W.J. Lee was welcomed as Councillor for West Ward in place of Cr Samuel, who had enlisted in the RAAF.

The Commonwealth Government advised it was unlikely to require any of the Council’s equipment.

The Inspector general of Hospitals informs that the Council’s contribution to the hospital for the current year was £170.

The number of collections for different causes was becoming annoying for people in the street and the Mayor indicated that as had been done in a number of other towns, he intended to reduce the number of permits issued for collections, especially for those originating outside the town.  The situation was in danger of driving people away from the town on Fridays.

Cr Marston raised the question of the Red Cross shop, which was hitting people in business quite hard.

The Mayor said he could not stop the Red Cross from selling articles in a shop.

The Mayor said there was too much overlapping of patriotic efforts and Cr Lee agreed.

Lloyd Parks was given permission to rake up all carob beans under Council trees.  He was forwarding them to Sydney where they were being treated for war work.

Cr Bevan complained that a notice in Warner’s Café more or less implied that the only place to get a cup of tea in town was the Red Cross Shop.  If this continued there would be more empty shops in Burra.  The Red Cross Shop only operated on Fridays and on other days people would pass under the impression it was impossible to get a light snack in Burra.

It was decided to try to get the notice removed.
