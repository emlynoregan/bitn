Diprotodon Bones.  Paul & Michelle Cousins and family came across large leg bones sticking out of the ground on the Collinsville property near Mt Bryan.  On closer inspection they realised that they were probably diprotodon bones and contacted the SA Museum.  Associate Professor of Biological Science at Flinders University Rod Wells led a team of palaeontology students on a dig last weekend and confirmed their identity.  All the creeks in the area like Widow Creek, Baldina Creek & Newikie Creek have yielded similar finds in the past.  Fossil remains of extinct marsupials were first reported from a dam site at Bundey and along the Baldina Creek in 1889.
