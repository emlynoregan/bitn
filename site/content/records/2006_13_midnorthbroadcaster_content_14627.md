Mary White, (Nee Lloyd) of Burra recalled being in the Volunteer Air Observation Corps in WWII as a Burra District air observer.  This was a role she shared with her mother, Annie Lloyd.  As a 13-year-old school girl she recalled leaving school to help her parents work on the farm about six miles northwest of Burra.  He father was in the Volunteer Defence Corps and often away from home.  Often planes were spotted while they were milking, some distance from the phone and she would run to the house to make the report to the Observation Post in Burra, which was operated by Patricia Pledge, Irene Hirschausen (nee Hogan) and Joan Sutton (nee Davies).  The observation post was located behind the shops in the main street at the top of a tower.

[This ‘tower’ had been built in 1910 behind the then Burra Record office in Market Square.  It was a three storey wood and iron structure designed as a photographic studio.  It was destroyed by fire in December 1950.  See Burra Record, VX, 897 (2), 13 July 1910, page 2, Burra Record VX, 902, 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 and Burra Record, 76, 50, 19 Dec. 1950, page 1.]

The code word when phoning in was ‘Queen Baker three’, but after two years it was changed to ‘Uncle Oboe eight’.  The most common planes they identified were Tiger Moths and Wirroways (fighter).  After the war they were presented with a certificate as a record in appreciation of their Patriotic Response to the Call of Country.
