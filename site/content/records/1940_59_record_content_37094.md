The Lance Clarence Phillips Inquest

The adjourned inquest into the death of Lance Clarence Phillips, 26, grazier of ‘Studholme’, who met his death as the result of gunshot wounds on 5 May 1948, was continued at the Burra North Police Court last Wednesday and Thursday before the Local Coroner, Mr S. Kellaway, assisted by D.C. Williams of the Crown Law Department.  Messrs Worth and Mills appeared for the accused Leslie Herald Weiss.

At the end of the hearing the Coroner committed Weiss for trial at the Criminal Court in Adelaide on a charge of murder, having found that Lance Phillips had died from gunshot wounds to the heart caused by a .303 bullet, fired from a service revolver by Leslie Herald Weiss.  The evidence showed that the shooting was deliberate.

The first witness was Robert Phillips, father of the deceased.

Last saw his son at 9.05 a.m. on the 5 May before the witness had left at 9.15 to pick up some sheep.

Left his son and Miss June Mattner in the house – she had been housekeeping there since the New Year.

Met Weiss (at about 11.40 a.m.) about a mile east of his gate, riding a bike in the direction of Burra.

Weiss said he was going to Burra to enquire about the Eastern Mail, having heard they wanted a driver.

Witness did not notice if Weiss was carrying a firearm and did not observe any wound to his foot or body.

Witness kept a double barrel shotgun at the head of his bed, but did not notice if it was there when he left home that day.  It was not there when he and Sgt France searched for it, but it was later found in a back room.

He saw the body of his son when he returned home.

He knew Weiss, but Weiss had not been to his home when Miss Mattner was with them.

He would say his son Lance did not know Weiss.

He had employed Miss Mattner without inquiring into her character.

He and Lance were friendly with Miss Mattner and he did not necessarily think Lance and Miss Mattner were going to get married.

He had met Weiss at the Koonoona Field Day on 28 April, when Weiss had been drunk, but Weiss had not asked about whether Lance and Miss Mattner were getting married.

Dr R.C. Heddle

Weiss arrived at Burra Hospital c. noon on 5 May.

Weiss said at about 12.40 that someone had been shot and someone was dead at Mr Phillips’ Station.
