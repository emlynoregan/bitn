Editorial on the ‘Garden and Field’ article on the Burra Show.  While not agreeing that there has been any misuse of Government grants, the editor does support the general principle of the article.  He also thinks it is about time the Show Society developed its own grounds because the English & Australian Copper Co.’s site could at any moment become unavailable.  In any case the yards are remote from the town and are divided rather awkwardly.  Perhaps the proposed recreation ground is a solution.
