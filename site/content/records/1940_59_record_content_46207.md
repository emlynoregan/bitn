Health

After years of complaint, the sewage problems behind the Burra Hotel should be solved with plans now in hand by the owners.  Both public conveniences have been repaired.  New conveniences are under construction at the school after pressure was brought to bear on the authorities.  The cemetery is in reasonable condition.

The Mayor extended thanks to his wife, the CWA (for help in Town Hall matters,) to the Town Clerk and to the Overseer and other Council workers.
