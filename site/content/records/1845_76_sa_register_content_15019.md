Treatment of Poor Copper Ores [Reprinted from the Mining Journal, 24 August 1861.]

This subject is receiving as much attention in SA as here.  Mr R.V. Rodda of the Burra Burra Mine has discovered a process promising results no less important than those contemplated by Mr Henderson.  He does not claim to deal with ores as low as 1½%, which is Mr Henderson’s minimum, but3% ores are certainly not below his treatment.  The advantage of his method is that it can deal with higher grade ores as well and is likely to effect a considerable saving in their conversion to copper.  Mr F. Sinnett (the inventor’s agent) says in a letter to the SA Register that the process will be tested at the Yatala Smelting Works on a satisfactory scale and the requisite works are now in progress there.

It has also been affirmed by a competent authority that the brick material at Wallaroo is equal to any found in England or elsewhere.
