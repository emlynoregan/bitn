Burra Black-Out

A surprise black-out was called by the Commonwealth last Wednesday night.  It met with mixed success.  Many had read of it or heard the request over the wireless and the Burra Electric Supply Co. turned off the streetlights.  Burra Civil Defence took no official action, as queries to Adelaide as to what was expected elicited no satisfactory response.  Main streets were dark, but there were some glaring exceptions and neither the Alert nor All Clear signals were sounded.  The local committee will soon hold a black-out where all will be better organised.

Burra Civil Defence outlines what will be required when they hold a black-out practice soon.
