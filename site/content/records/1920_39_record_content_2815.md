E.W. Crewes presided at a meeting at the Institute on Tuesday.  The contractor advises that he has everything ready for the foundation stone to be laid in February next.  When all promises have been fulfilled the amount in hand will be c. £1,475.  The contract for the monument without name plates is £2,184.  To complete the memorial and a Roll of Honour for all the men who enlisted would probably cost another £1,500.  He felt that once work had actually begun promises would be redeemed and more donations would come in.
