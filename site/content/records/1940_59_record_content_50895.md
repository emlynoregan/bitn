Leighton WWII Honour Roll, for men and women who volunteered for overseas service in the 1939-45 War, was unveiled last Wednesday night.  The whole district assembled at Leighton Hall where a dance preceded the ceremony.  Mr G. Gask, as Chairman of the Hall, introduced Mr J. Field, who spoke as a returned soldier and then Mr I. Richardson, as President of the Burra Sub-Branch of the RSL, was asked to perform the unveiling.  He spoke of the men who had served in the Battle of Britain, the Western Desert, Greece, Crete, Syria, Malaya, New Guinea, the Pacific Islands and Borneo.  The roll was cast in bronze and stands approximately 4 ft high by 3 ft and hangs on the wall facing the WWI Honour Roll.
