Kooringa News

Accident/Obituary.  On Thursday last a young man named Henry Marks lost his life at the Burra Mine.  He was employed in raising a pass in one of the pitches at the 30 fathom level, where a quantity of addle had been put to fill up some of the pitches that had been worked out.  While so engaged the earth gave way and completely buried him.  It took from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. to recover the body.  An inquest was held.  He was a steady sober young man, unmarried and a class-leader in the Primitive Methodist Chapel.

[Henry Marks died 6 October 1859 Burra Mine, residence Kooringa aged 21.]

Accident.  On Monday 10 October a worker at the Bon Accord Mine suffered a broken arm and collarbone and a dislocated shoulder when he stumbled while wheeling a barrowful of stones along a bank and the stones fell on top of him.

Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel held its Anniversary Services on Sunday.  Sermons were preached by Rev. Harcourt of Norwood and Rev. James Lyall (Presbyterian) of Adelaide. Congregations were large.  The collections were made to aid the trust fund and also to build a gallery in the chapel to increase its seating.  The Monday tea meeting was most numerously attended.  The public meeting was also largely attended and the balance sheet showed a great increase in the amount collected.  An appeal was made for funds to erect a gallery.  Mr Colton headed it with a donation of Â£5-5-0, as also did Mr Padman, with Messrs Ballantyne, Young and Bray contributing in proportion.
