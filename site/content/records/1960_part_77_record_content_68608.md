Burra District Swimming Pool Committee met on 17 October and a loss of $2,065 was revealed for the past season.  The whole committee was re-elected for 1973-74: President, Brian Thamm; Secretary, Miss Heather Keane; Roster Secretary, Mrs J. Carpenter; Treasurer, Mrs D. Kempster and Assistant Treasurer, Mrs N. Hurst.  The season had run well.  The Treasurer reported a profit of $341.72 on sales less purchases.  Major costs were: Repairs $2,574, Chemicals $634, Power $606 and loan repayment $614 of principal and $43 interest.

The pool will be open on days of at least 21°C and evenings if it is 30°C at 6 p.m. (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and extended at the discretion of the supervisor.)  Are any members of the Burra Swimming Club interested in reviving it?  Contact the Committee.
