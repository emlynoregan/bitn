The Quondong Mail.  A deputation has waited on the Minister of Education urging a weekly mail service by horse or coach to Quondong, c. 110 miles northeast from Burra.  Tenders have previously been considered too high.  At present a bi-weekly mail goes to Thistlebeds and it is thought one of these might be extended to Quondong.  The area is permanently occupied, carries 105,000 sheep and pays £1,100 rent.  Extending the Thistlebeds service would save £100 p.a.
