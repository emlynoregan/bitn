Obituary.  Mrs McNamara died at her residence in Welsh Place on Saturday.  She was the eldest daughter of the late Mr D. O’Brien, who met his death at Baldina Creek several years ago.  A husband and four small children survive, the youngest aged 5 weeks.  The family lost Mrs Honora O’Brien only a few weeks ago.  [She appears to have been Mrs Lawrence McNarmara, born Honora O’Brien according to the birth of the child mentioned above: Lawrence John, born 11 January 1906.  She was apparently registered at birth on 4 October 1871 at Honorah O’Brien.]
