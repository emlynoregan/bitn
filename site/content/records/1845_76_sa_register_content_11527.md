SA Mining

The Burra Burra Mine present a scene of activity almost unsurpassed in its history.  The company is now regularly paying quarterly returns of 100% upon the original shares.  The immense quantity of ore being brought to grass suggests this will continue for some time to come.

The Bon Accord Mine has commenced operations on land adjacent to the Burra Burra, where some suppose large lodes will be found.

The Karkulto Mine, about 15 miles south of Kooringa and owned by the Burra Burra Co., is also producing some good ore.

The Royal Mining Co.â€™s property adjoining the Karkulto Mine has also recently exposed a lode of rich copper said to be 3 feet wide.

Messrs Chambers & Co. & Messrs Parker & Co. have opened mines with some promise in the far north.

The Kapunda Mine is also working well and smelting its ore to fine copper.

Mining is going on favourably in the Mt Barker and Strathalbyn areas where large deposits of copper, lead and silver are indicated.  At Wheal Ellen the ore being raised is jack, yielding from 30 to 35% lead and 30 oz silver to the ton.  About 2,000 tons of this ore are laid open.

Echunga Goldfield has a new lead and several holes there are said to be yielding payable quantities.

The coal discovery recently reported from near Kapunda has been found to be a hoax.

We do not believe there is a coal field at Port Lincoln, though specimens have been sent from there.
