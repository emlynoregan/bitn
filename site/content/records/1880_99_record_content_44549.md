Redruth Letter.

Messrs Bradwood & Wise of Pt Adelaide have got the tender for the Bon Accord Bridge and will commence soon.  This will be welcomed by the many at present unemployed.

The Government wants 10,000 yards of railway metal from the quarry, but doesnâ€™t want to pay a fair price.  It is hoped better counsel will prevail.

Mr & Mrs I.W. Goss, who are leaving for Broken Hill after a long residence here, were given a farewell at the schoolroom of the Redruth Methodist Church.  Speeches were made by Rev. J. Hopkins & Messrs B. Preece, J. Dunstan Jnr, W.A. Rabbich, John Wittick, B. Butterworth & W.T. Rabbich.
