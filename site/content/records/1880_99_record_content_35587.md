Burra Town Council.  The main road grant of £250 has been received.

It was resolved that the footbridge in Queen St be repaired as soon as possible.

Tenders to be called for concreting the foundations of the Thames St Bridge.

Cr Watt moved the re-erection of the footbridge near the old Pig and Whistle, in line with Stock St and the one in line with Blyth St to be repaired.  Carried.

A new bridge in line with Paxton Tce was discussed.

A tender from C. & A. Fuss to repair the footbridge at the White Hart ford for £23-19-6 was considered much too high and the work will be done by the overseer of works.
