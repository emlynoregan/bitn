Accident/Obituary.  Mr John Campbell aged 50, a teamster employed by John Collins & Son of Collinsville, died 6 March at Burra Hospital.  He had been driving a team of 9 horses while sitting on the shaft of a wagon loaded with heavy timber.  Near the Petherton School he appears to have fallen and his left leg was crushed to a pulp by the wheel of the wagon.  He was found by Clem P. Duell of Belalie and taken to Burra Hospital where his leg was amputated and he died soon after.  He had no near relatives, but Malcolm McLeod of Clare, a cousin, removed the body to Clare for burial.
