Burra Community Sports Club: President Graham Kellock’s report for 1984-85.

This year was one of consolidation.  With two year’s experience for the bar licence and the Ladies’ Auxiliary, matters have settled into a routine based on experience.  Teas after football home matches and monthly in summer have proved popular.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary has also been catering successfully for 3 weddings, 1 clearing sale, monthly Council teas, Dalgety Bennet Farmers and Elders IXL promotional evenings.  They have used their income to upgrade facilities.  The Bar Committee has erred $5,400 to the main committee.  Other fundraising continues – especially the rubbish contract, which has been negotiated for another year.  Barley cropping brought in $8,600.  The sheep haven’t made money yet, but with lambs at foot and shearing due, the future looks promising.  A crop has been sown for next year.  Gum trees at the north end of the oval have been pollarded, more trees planted and we are investigating resurfacing the netball courts.

Office Bearers 1985-86: President, Richard Secomb; Vice-President, Neil Page; Secretary, Sally Hayes; Treasurer, Di. Day; Administrator, Des. James and Bar Manager, Trevor Wall.

The Ladies’ Auxiliary Report by Marg. Lloyd runs for c. one page and parallels the above with more detail.
