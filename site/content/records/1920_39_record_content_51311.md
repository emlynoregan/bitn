Booborowie Ratepayers met on 9 June in the Booborowie Hall to discuss the proposals to amalgamate Councils.  T.J. Wedding was voted into the chair.  The meeting was to canvas ratepayersâ€™ opinions.  The combined revenue of Hallett, Mt Bryan & Burra DCs did not equal that of Booborowie DC.  Ann Ward alone would produce as much as any of the eastern Councils.  There was no advantage to Booborowie in enlarging the area of the Council.  Mr A.C. Woodgate said amalgamation merely meant greater centralisation, which is already of sufficient detriment without extending it.  H.A. Mayfield was also opposed.  W.C. Catt was against it too, but said if any amalgamation was forced on them then areas to the north and south should be merged rather than east and west, owing to the ranges.  The decision was that they should stay as they were, but if that failed then a merger with Hanson would be the least disadvantageous.
