Salvation Army.  Adjutant R. Cresswell was farewelled at the Army Hall on Monday evening.  She was appointed senior officer at Burra as Captain Cresswell just two years ago and now goes to the Salvation Army Boys’ Home at Box Hill in Victoria.  The Mayor presided.  He said she had taken on something of the role of a District Nurse and had been a tower of strength for the Benevolent Society.  Rev. Tilbrook endorsed the Mayor’s remarks and other speakers were Mrs J. Kemble & Mr A.O. Aberg.  The Mayor presented a wallet of notes.  Adj. Cresswell said she had had to give up field work for social work because of her throat trouble.
