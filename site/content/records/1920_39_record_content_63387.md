Burra Centenary Sports were held at the Burra Racecourse Tuesday 6 October.  Over £50 was taken at the gate, even though there was no charge for cars and adults were only 1/-.  Attendance was estimated at 1,500.  The organisation was in the hands of the President of the Committee C.S. Preiss and Secretary Alex Bevan with a sizeable committee.  Riders came from all over Australia and found the track in excellent condition.  N. Hutchinson was the announcer over the Nomis Amplifiers.  Events:

75 yards Johnny Green Handicap won by K. Kain (£1).

President’s Half Mile Wheel Race Handicap won by F. Watson (£2).

Samuel Baker Sheffield 130 yards handicap won by Frank Pearce (£2-10-0 & cup presented by Samuel Baker).

Burra Town Council Jubilee One Mile Wheel Race won by H.J. Conyers (£3).

Half Mile Wheel Race for Boys aged less than 14, won by Norman Fitzgerald (10/-).

Burra Centenary Two Mile Wheel Race won by F. Watson (£7-7-0 and a cup presented by E.T. Baulderstone.  There was a nasty fall in this race when Conyers apparently slipped and his pedal went through the wheel of Martin’s cycle, smashing it beyond repair.  Fortunately both riders escaped with only bruising.

The Holder One Mile Wheel Race for Boys aged less than 16, won by William Draper.

220 yards Coppertown Foot Race won by R. Waker (£1-10-0).

Match Race over one mile won by W. Moritz (SA Champion) (£3).

Philip Lane 3 mile scratch race won by W. Morits (£2-10-0).

Tug of War.  A. Lomman’s team defeated Bert Marcus’s team in two straight pulls.
