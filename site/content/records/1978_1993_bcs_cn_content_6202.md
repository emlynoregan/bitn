[The Chairman outlined the history of the decision to build the sports complex however, this is not reported.]

Precision Builders of Adelaide were the successful tenderers at $163,000.

Fund raising was a major concern.

$40,000 came from the Division of Sports and Recreation.

$25,000 came from the Burra Football Club.

$95,000 is a loan from the Saving Bank of SA, repayable over ten years.

The building was started in March and is nearing completion.  The opening is planned for Sunday 31 October by the Minister for Sports and Recreation Mr Wilson.

The new executive was elected: President, Graham Kellock; Vice-President, Malcolm Beinke; Secretary, Des James and Treasurer, Di Day.
