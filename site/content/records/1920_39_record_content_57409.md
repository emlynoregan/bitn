Obituary.  Ann Baker, wife of Mr Samuel Baker of Aberdeen, died at her residence 8 August after a very short illness.  She was aged 94.  She was born at Swansea, Wales 18 December 1840 and arrived in SA with her parents John & Mary Edwards in the Richardson in 1848.  Her father came to take charge of the refining for the Burra Smelting Co. and their first home was a dugout in the creek bank.  Miss Edwards was married at Kooringa in 1862 to Samuel Baker and the couple had 73 years of happy married life.  Their first home was in the street leading to Hampton and 71 years ago they moved to their present home, where, with one exception, their thirteen children were born.  And we are informed, where all of their grandchildren were born.  Eleven of the family survive.  Mr Baker will be 96 on 17 March 1936.  He remains a tall, striking personality with a fair measure of health.   Mr Baker was born at North Terrace, Adelaide 17 March 1840 and must be one of the oldest, if not the oldest born South Australian.  Eight daughters and three sons survive:

Mary Ann, Mrs J.V. Lord, Kingswood, SA

Jane, Mrs A.T. Pearce, Sydney

Louisa, Mrs J.C. Gleeson, Mrs L. Baker, Glenelg

Olive, Mrs J.C. Gleeson, Richmond, SA

Minetta, Mrs M. Cain, Glen Osmond, SA [Mrs Martin Kain: born Etty, married and died as Hettie.]

Lily, Mrs E.H. Oakes, Broken Hill, NSW

Miss Sarah, Aberdeen

Miss Mabel, Aberdeen

Thomas, Aberdeen

John, Robertstown
