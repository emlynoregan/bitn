Obituary.  A badly damaged section of the page may indicate the death of F.J. XXXX of Mt Bryan.

[This may refer to the death of Francis James Josephs who died at Mt Bryan on 9 December 1944, aged 91. BISA research gives his name as Francis Esker James Josephs, born 7 January 1854 at Lobethal.  The SA Births CD records that birth as Franciske James Josephs. An error in transcribing handwriting might account for the discrepancy.]
