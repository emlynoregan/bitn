Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic is one of the oldest in the town.  At one time it was held at Princess Royal, close to the woolshed, but of recent years it has been at Sod Hut on land of Mrs J.C. Sandland, largely on account of the splendid trees and the state of the road.  This yearâ€™s event was as successful as ever and 8 or 9 trollies took the children.  A splendid sports program was followed.  Picnic parties from the town joined them.
