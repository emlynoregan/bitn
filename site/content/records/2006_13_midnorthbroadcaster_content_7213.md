2009 Uniting Church Kids Camp Out was held at Clare caravan Park on the weekend.  A contingent from Burra arrived on Saturday morning with church group co-ordinator Arthur Simpson and overseeing Minister, Dave Smith, to set up the camp site.  A multitude of activities kept everyone buzzing for two days.  More than 200 children attended and the event was a great success.  Saturdayâ€™s program concluded with supper and devotion.  Sunday began with a Big Mix concert.  Mr Smith praised the behaviour of the children.  The next such event is planned for the Barossa Valley.  [Photos included.]
