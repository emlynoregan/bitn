Cycle Race.  The Advertiser 400-mile Cycle Tour for professional wheelmen next weekend will come through Burra, which will be the overnight stopping place for the second stage.  [Terminology here is confusing in the report.  There were two stages on each of three days. Burra came at the end of day two or the end of the fourth stage, but the end of the second stage of the second day.]
