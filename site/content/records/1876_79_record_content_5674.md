Editorial on the great use of timber fuel in SA and while believing it regrows rapidly enough in the Adelaide area, it is not doing so in the north.

`Wood will become [one] of the most considerable expenses among our household necessities.'

The cost of coal makes it impossible as an alternative except perhaps at some seaports. The only hope is in tree planting. In some places trees would be a better investment than wheat. The scrub lands would be better kept as a wood supply than sold as agricultural land and `instead of clearing clauses being inserted in the agreements for purchase a limit should be placed on the destruction of the trees.'
