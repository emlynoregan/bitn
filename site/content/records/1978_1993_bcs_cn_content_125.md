24 August 1978

Burra Town Hall.  Following a visit by Premier Dunstan late in 19 76 a State Government grant has enabled the District Council to commission an Adelaide Architectural firm to prepare proposals for the restoration and renovation of the Town Hall.  The report considers the need to upgrade the supper room and toilet facilities and makes suggestions concerning parking and public access to the Hall.  The 40 page report is available from the Council or Library and public response is sought.
