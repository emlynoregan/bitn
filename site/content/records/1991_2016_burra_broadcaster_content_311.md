Adam’s Menswear & Coppermine Ladies’ & Children’s Wear have combined under one roof and the new look Adam’s has moved two doors down Commercial Street.  The new store is located in the old Drew & Crewes’ Building and is somewhat reminiscent of the old Bence’s shop with a spacious display area.  The new premises become a one-stop shop for all the family’s clothing needs.  The owner, George Pannell has done most of the building work himself.  Most of the fittings and shelving are from the original Bence’s store.
