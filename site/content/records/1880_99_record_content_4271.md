Football.  Ob Saturday 9 Colours played 16 Allcomers

Colours 1.7 Allcomers 1.4

Allcomers also had about the same number of small fry swarming onto the ground ‘scarcely in their teens’

‘it retards good football and will be the cause of some serious accident.’

(Unfortunately perhaps, for good football, one of the small fry scored the Allcomers’ only goal.)

[The reporter also comments that spectators on the ground were a nuisance.]
