Redruth Methodist Church has an enlarged group of trustees and they have agreed to take over the late Primitive Methodist Church which has been declared unsafe.  The Jubilee of Methodism in Redruth will be celebrated early in June and a sketch of the history of Methodism in the place is to be prepared.  A scheme for enlarging the Primitive Methodist building will be worked with the celebrations and the said building will then be called the Methodist Jubilee Hall.
