Burra Benevolent Society held its AGM 17 August.  Rev. C. Pitman as chairman welcomed the Mayor.  The year had been rather quiet.  They had 10 financial members and attendance at meetings had been disappointingly small.  Two Salvation Army officers had moved on during the year and Rev. Dorman left, to be replaced by Rev. Tregilgas.  Selected families were sent letters enabling them to collect goods to a stated value as Christmas Cheer.  In April the late Treasurer died in Adelaide.  The Societyâ€™s wheelchairs had been returned, as one user had died and the other had left the district.  Wood had been distributed in half ton loads in august 1949 and June 1950.  Elected for the coming year were: Chairman, Rev. C.L.H. Pitman; Secretary, Mrs A.B. Riggs & Treasurer, E.R. Davey.
