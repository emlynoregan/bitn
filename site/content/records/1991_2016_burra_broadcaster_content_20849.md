Farming

1999 gave farmers a mixed bag.  At 383.2 mm to date, it was a dry year.

To the north and east farmers and pastoralists received donations of hay from others to survive.

In May an isolated case of Ovine Johne’s Disease was identified at Woollana Stud, but despite widespread testing on many thousands of sheep, no other case was found.  Weeks later it was found to be a case of Bovine Johne’s Disease and despite the scare, the Mid North, as a result of all the testing, remains one of the safest areas to buy sheep.

The 1999-2000 harvest is proceeding well, though the recent degree of damage by the hailstorm is still being assessed.
