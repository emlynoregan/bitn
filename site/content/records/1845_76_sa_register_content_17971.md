Fire

On Sunday morning at about 10.15 the stables of Mr N. Opie at the Smelters’ Home Hotel were discovered to be on fire.  Three valuable horses were there.  Mr T. Paynter who lives there at once opened the door and tried to free the horses.  He untied one and another broke its rope.  The third was burnt.  The two sho got out had their eyes burnt.  One will not recover and the other will never be of much use.  The stable was a wooden building and soon burnt.  A stack of hay and a large quantity of harness were also consumed.  The Mine fire engine attended and a number of men and it at least enabled them to quench the embers to prevent further mischief.  The cause is unknown.
