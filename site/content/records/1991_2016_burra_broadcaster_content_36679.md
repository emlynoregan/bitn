Letter.  Glenys Christopher & Bob Skinner write to counter the advice apparently being circulated by some locals that the property at Ford’s Corner has a sanctuary agreement on it that renders it useless for other purposes.  It is important to note that there are different categories of sanctuary status.  One type that is to ensure that existing native vegetation remains untouched is forever and is so noted on the title.  The agreement for Ford’s Corner is not listed in the title and may be de-gazetted by its owner at anytime.  It allows grazing while demonstrating that the owner will do all they can to preserve the native species on the property and prevent damage to the land.
