Football.  AGM of Aberdeen Football Club.  There was a small attendance at Jubilee Hall last Wednesday.  The year ended in credit of 15/3 despite a very poor year of football and difficulties in fielding teams and keeping the club together.  The secretary suggested that it would be better if there were three local clubs instead of the present arrangement and that the three teams be kept as nearly even as possible.  A meeting to consider the future will be held in February 1925.
