The National Trust in Burra has received a donation of $45,000 from the Commonwealth Bank towards the restoration of Redruth gaol.  Branch President Maureen Wright made suitable acknowledgement of the gift when interviewed last week at Ayers House for TV news coverage.  Her special Jubilee dress was most appropriate for the setting.
