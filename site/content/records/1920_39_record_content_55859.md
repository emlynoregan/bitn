3rd Anzac Sports.

These were one of the biggest fixtures ever held in Burra.  Separate committees managed the sections: Military, Racing, Cycling, Athletics & Motoring.

The grounds and tracks were in great condition.  The day dawned grey and foggy, but by 9.30 a.m. it was glorious sunshine with no wind for a beautiful day.  The Nomis public address system was a great help and could be heard wonderfully clearly everywhere.  Music was played between events.  There were a couple of unfortunate occurrences.

In the Ladies’ Hack Race Miss Pat Jeffery of Hallett, who was riding Mr A. Reed’s Patriola, was thrown when the horse ran off into a barbed wire fence.  Though not seriously injured, she did need medical attention.

In the 5-mile amateur motor cycle race A. Nolan the winner seems to have struck a hole in the track just after the winning post and lost control of his machine.  The cycle struck the post and rail fence throwing the rider against a post and then struck two girls, the Misses Joseph of Mt Bryan, before knocking down Mr Joseph and Mr R. Sharp Sen. of Kooringa.  At first it was thought Mr Nolan had been fatally injured, but condition is now reported as less serious than feared, with a fractured arm, concussion and severe abrasions.  Miss Mary Joseph sustained badly cut legs and her sister suffered similar injuries.  Mr Joseph suffered bruising as did Mr Sharp who is also in hospital with an injured knee.  The second rider in the race, Jack McWaters of World’s End, swerved across the track into the rails on the other side receiving some bruises and abrasions, but escaping fairly well.  As the crowd rushed towards the injured they forgot that four other machines were still on the track and those four riders were lucky to be able to stop without striking other members of the crowd.

The results of events are printed.

The event of the day was said to be the Lynch Draught Horse Race: minimum weight 14 stone.

[89 kg]  M.W. Bednall had a feather duster confiscated when he mounted Roy Lloyd’s Rogilla.  He was also penalised.  After a fine description of the race we learn that the winner was Roy McWaters on Prior Bros’ Tiger.  The struggle for F. Spencer’s cup for coming last was fought out between Ralph Hill on his Arachne and Con. Lynch who was eventually disqualified for jamming Arachne on the rails and for finishing sideways.
