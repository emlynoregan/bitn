White Australia.  There is an amazing ¼ column article on the wonderful qualities of the white race – strengthening mental and physical purity and helping to avoid problems like divorce and suicide.  Surprisingly the prejudice does not seem to extend to the ‘better types of coloured races . . . of the East’ and the writer envisages the possibility at some distant time of the migration of suitable labour – ‘in the meantime we must keep this policy free from colour prejudice and raise the nation to a level of patriotism where its racial purity would not be affected by the presence of coloured citizens.’
