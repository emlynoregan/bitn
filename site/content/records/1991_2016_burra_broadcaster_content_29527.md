A youth Forum was held in Burra recently sponsored by the Lower North Community Health Service.  Linda Stanway was the facilitator.  Spokesperson for the forum, Sara Earle, said the forum had discussed many ideas of what was needed in Burra for the youth and the top of the list was a skate park and this is being pursued.  It was also decided to form a Youth Advisory Council to feed ideas directly to Council.
