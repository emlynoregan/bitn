Burra Town Council. The Council agreed to the location of a weighbridge for J.W. White. The misappropriation of a cheque for £12 by Mr Fogg was discussed and finally the matter placed in the hands of the solicitor with power to act.

Cr Ridgway endorsed the Council's joining the Association of Municipal Corporations, but suggested it be deferred to the new council as they currently had no money and the joining fee was £5-5-0.

He also moved that the £100 standing to the credit of the Cemetery be invested in Corporation bonds.
