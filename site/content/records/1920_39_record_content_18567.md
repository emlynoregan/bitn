Mr & Mrs Ray Chambers were farewelled at the Bowling Club on Saturday evening.  He had been a founding member, probably held more debentures than anyone else and had for a time acted as greens manager.  He was presented with an inscribed quarter-sized bowl mounted on a silver column with a plinth of ebony, as a memento.  (This was designed by Mr Spencer and made in Adelaide.)  [Details extend for over 1 column.]

Mrs Chambers was farewelled at the Croquet Club on Thursday.  [Details take c. Â½ column.]
