The Uptown Gallery at Burra North will feature in the TV program ‘Postcards’ soon.

With 26 galleries in the Regional Arts Guide Tom Marshall feels very fortunate to be chosen along with the Irongate Gallery at Mintaro to be showcased in the television program.  Postcards airs on Adelaide’s Channel 9 on Sunday’s at 5.30 p.m.
