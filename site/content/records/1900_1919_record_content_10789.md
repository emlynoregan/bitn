Children’s Bazaar.  About three years ago several young girls organised a bazaar and in their first effort raised £6 for an invalid’s chair for the Burra Hospital.  12 months later they raised £16, which went towards the hospital acetylene gas fund.  This year their third effort was held in the auction mart and was opened by the Mayoress Mrs J. Winnall.  £20 was raised.  The girls mentioned in the report are the founder, Nellie Vivian and Ivy Ward, Millie Pascoe, Myrtle Berriman, Nita Pearce, Ruby Sandland, Eileen Johnson, Rita Vivian, Joy Sangster, Stella Moody, Kathleen Johnson and Dolly Vivian.
