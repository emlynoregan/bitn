All the above refers to the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the strongest branch before Methodist Union in 1900.

In 1840 John Wiltshire, a Primitive Methodist, began to preach in Light Square.  The Primitive Methodists built a church in Elizabeth Street, Adelaide, and were strong at Mt Barker.  After four years Rev. J. Long came to serve Adelaide and Rev. J. Wilson went to Mt Barker.  By the time of Methodist Union they were about half as numerous as the Wesleyans.

Bible Christians began in 1850 with Rev. J. Way and Rev. J. Rowe being the first ministers.  The former was based at Bowden and the latter went to Burra.  Rev. T.E. Keen was brought out to serve the Gawler Plains and Mr Way established a church in Young St in Adelaide.

The Methodist New Connexion built Maughan Church in Franklin St, under Mr Maughan, who died young.  In 1888 this branch of Methodism merged with the Bible Christians.

The Union of the three remaining Methodist branches was achieved in 1900.

Prince Alfred College was established when 13 acres of land was purchased at Kent Town in 1862.  Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, laid the foundation stone on 5 November 1867 and Mr S. Fiddian BA was appointed headmaster in 1868, though the college had started before his arrival in the Pirie St Lecture Hall.

The Bible Christians operated Way College under Dr W.G. Torr from 1 February 1892 until Methodist Union and in 1904 it became Methodist Ladies’ College.  In 1926 Mr & Mrs R.H. White donated the Chapman Alexander Institute to the Church and it became Wesley College, the training college for Methodist ministers.

Other Methodist Institutions established over the years include:

Memorial Hospital, North Adelaide

The Mt Barker Rest Home

The Magill Children’s Home

Resthaven, the recently started old folks’ home

Maughan Central Mission

Kuitpo Colony

Bowden & Brompton Mission

Missions at Pt Adelaide, Glanville and Pt Pirie

Home and Overseas Missions
