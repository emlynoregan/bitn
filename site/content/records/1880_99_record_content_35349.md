Letter from Matthew Datson deploring the problems associated with alcohol abuse and urging the cause be looked at.  He felt the need for more secular amusements and activities.  While a Christian himself, he thought the church had failed in this area and secular forces needed to be encouraged.  Poverty and desperation were contributing causes of the problem.
