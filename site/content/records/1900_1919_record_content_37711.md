Burra Football Association.  Meeting last Thursday.

Much of the debate was concerned with Mr Truscott’s move to have the Light Horse team playing members confined to members of the Light Horse.  Eventually the motion was withdrawn.  In addition a range of procedural matters and amendments to rules were discussed and the report runs to 1½ columns.
