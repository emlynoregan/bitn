Burra Show 1961

The very successful show for 1961 was opened by Mr R.C. Gosse, President of the Royal Agricultural Society.  Despite entries being down in some sections, the total of 2681was a record.  The tractor driving competition, tried for the first time, created much interest.

The weather was a little warm, but nearly perfect.

Sideshows were disappointingly few this year because there were eight shows on the same day.  The tiny tots, as a result, were not really catered for, except for pony coach rides.

There were some excellent displays in the Industrial Stands, though overall fewer than last year.

The ring events as usual kept the interest till late afternoon.

Gate takings amounted to £241.

[Personal interest: At the opening there was an apology from Mr R. Fuss, a member of the Committee.]

Mr Rex Warnes, as President of the Burra Show, asked Mr Gosse to open it.  Mr Gosse commented on hoe important Burra had been in the past with copper, but now it was rather the gold of the Golden Fleece.  The district has become renowned as the cradle of the SA Merino Industry.  He regretted that all too few of the district’s fleeces were entered in the Royal Adelaide Show and hoped for better in the future.
