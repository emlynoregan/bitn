Market Square.  A group of 45 residents gathered in Market Square yesterday morning to blockade the start of redevelopment work by the Burra Burra DC.  The redevelopment has been controversial since last year when the Council announced new lighting proposals and alternative road route to increase safety.  The protest started at 6 a.m. when Council workers moved in the remove concrete kerbing around the rotunda and the median strip in Market Square.  According to several protesters several incidents occurred before workers took a tea break at 8.45 a.m.  They had not returned to work by noon.  One incident involved Mr Bill Keane, a farmer from Gum Creek and Mr Tom Boulger, a shop owner.  The pair ended up standing in the bucket of a loader that was removing kerbing opposite the rotunda.  They were forced to jump off.  Another protester was Mrs Eunice Baker, who was strongly opposed to the Council’s actions, saying they had ignored ratepayers’ feelings.  She said the Chairman had gone to the Clare Sheep Show and left the newly appointed District Clerk to face the protesters.  She was also unhappy with the National Trust for making a compromise with the Council.  Tourist Information Officer Jenny O’Connor hoped more residents would support the move against the changes to the square.  The square was listed as number six in importance on the National Estate, she said, and the Council had no tight to modernise it.  People were generally rather apathetic, but she thought this issue might galvanize them into action.  Mr Derek Rayfield, Secretary of the Burra Preservation Organisation said the demonstration was spontaneous. The Organisation had collected 819 signatures from 1,471 ratepayers in just a week.
