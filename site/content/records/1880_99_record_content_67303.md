Burra Waterworks

The Water Conservation Dept. has dropped suction pipes to within 3” of the bottom.  Water in the well is still falling and the present depth is about 6’.

The chimney stack needs replacing, the mains have not been flushed in the last two months and the boiler needs chipping.

Pumping takes from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m.

The report on the Mt Horrocks scheme puts the cost at £34,000.

The Engineer has given notice of leaving in four weeks’ time if no other arrangements can be mutually arrived at.
