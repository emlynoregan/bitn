Editorial on Municipal Matters.

There is little need in Burra for general policy and Council can deal with matters as they arise.  The boundaries of Council activity have long been laid down.  ‘At present there are far more houses in town than are occupied owing to the scarcity of population.’

‘Those, however, who are left are struggling against odds for subsistence, and it is astonishing how some of them live.’

‘The Town Council has done good work of late years, and today the town is in a very satisfactory state.’

William Dearlove of Ketchowla has sent £2-2-0 to help the town’s poor at Christmas.  Surely if someone 40 miles away can remember the town’s needy those resident in it can do no less.
