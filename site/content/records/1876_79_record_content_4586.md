Burra Musical Union Concert. This was held last Tuesday and saw a good sale of the front seats, but a thin audience elsewhere. The review suggests a rather patchy performance; though the choruses which are the core of the Unionâ€™s scope of work were a success. More of this rather than the solos should be their aim. The larrikin element is again complained of.
