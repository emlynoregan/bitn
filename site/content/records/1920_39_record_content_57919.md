Burra Town Council

The Highways & Local Government Department advises that a motion to disallow the by-law on hawkers would be brought forward in the House of Assembly this week.

The Mayor saw this as ‘City influence again.’

Three ratepayers were allowed to work off their rates.

The Fire Brigade requested a space at the rear of the station for a back yard, with the intention of it being made into a garden, which would improve the property and the town.  The only trees there were cork elm suckers.  Council resolved to inspect the site before deciding.
