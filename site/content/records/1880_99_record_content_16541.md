Gordon.  J. Cooksley of Farrell’s Flat on 16 February writes debunking Gordon’s hero status and attacking those who place all blame on the British Government.  Gordon, he says, was sent to try to effect a reconciliation between Egypt and the rebels and to establish order.  He disdained peace overtures, advised the English Government to take certain steps and when they declined he endeavoured single-handed to bring about the changes he thought best.  Gordon was an officer who exceeded his duty and got into trouble.  He goes on at some length to sheet the real blame home to Gordon’s defiance of orders and impetuousness.
