RSL Rooms.  It was mentioned at the RSL AGM on Friday that their billiard table is the only full-sized table in the town and it is getting very little use from members.  Not since the late George Terry conducted snooker tournaments have any organised billiards been played in the town.  Are there enough snooker players to run such a tournament?
