Terowie Institute will be 130 years old this year and to celebrate the occasion Philip Wood and Marina Gray are publishing a book on its history.  They are seeking any images of the inside or outside of the building.  The front two storey section was built in 1879 on land provided by the founder of Terowie, John Aver Mitchell.  The hall at the rear was added in 1885.  [Photo of the hall.]
