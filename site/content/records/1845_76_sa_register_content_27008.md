Kooringa Municipal Matters

A meeting of at least 150 ratepayers was held at the Burra Institute on Wednesday 29 December to consider the desirability of forming the district into a municipality.  Captain Sanders presided in the absence of Captain Killicoat.

P. Lane said he had called the ratepayers together as a consequence of the place being proclaimed a Rabbit District.  This was unfair to the townspeople who would have to pay two-thirds of the rate and reap no benefit from it.

O. Harvey proposed that the time had come when the township should form themselves into a Corporation.  He was sure no one could gainsay this after looking at the town.  It was as dirty as any in the colony.  It should have happened years ago and was now a disgrace.

Joseph Beaglehole was opposed.  They would be better off with a District and Rabbit rate that with a Corporation without any knowledge of its cost.

R. Ward seconded the motion.  Several other residents spoke in support and then W.R. Ridgway moved an amendment deferring any movement towards a Corporation (and union of the various townships) until the Government had dealt with memorials proposing local government for the northern townships of the district.

Kooringa should leave the other townships alone and not try to drag them into a union which they should oppose.

Mr G. Woerner seconded.

Mr J. Sampson Jnr moved a further amendment that the meeting adjourn for a week so that the ratepayers could coolly consider the matter.  J. Beaglehole seconded and when put this amendment was lost by a large majority.

Mr Ridgway’s amendment was lost by about 4 to 96.

The motion was then carried 100 to 6.

O. Harvey then proposed the Corporation should include  the townships of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Hampton, Llwchyr, Millerton, Roachtown, Nelson, Graham and The Mines.

Seconded by J. Jenkins and carried.

An amendment by Mr W.R. Ridgway seconded by Mr Voerner [sic] to strike out all the towns except Kooringa was lost, as was an attempt by J. Sampson Jnr to refer the question to a committee.

A committee to see to the implementing of the resolution was established: Messrs O. Harvey, C. Lowe, J. Roberts, E. Lipsett, T.W. Wilkinson, John Drew, H. Dawson, J. Tiver, A. Bartholomæus and John Jenkin.
