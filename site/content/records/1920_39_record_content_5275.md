Burra Council, 5 September

The Mayor considered the response of the Railway Commissioner about a phone at the goods shed was unacceptable.

Cr Kellaway and Cr Bartholomaeus thought the arrangements were OK.

Cr Harris had been refused information on ringing the passenger office.

The Mayor will interview the Commissioner.

A deputation of Messrs J. Allen, Bosisto & Murison asked the Council to have Burra gazetted under the Fire Brigades Act so an up-to-date fire extinguishing plant could be obtained.  The petition had 62 signatures.

Mr Bosisto said at Balaklava the system had payments divided as follows:

Fire Brigade Board pays 3/9

Insurance Companies pay 4/9

Locals pay 2/9

The cost of insurance had fallen by 15%.

The plant at Balaklava had cost £600 and four permanent men cost £160 per annum.

If the Council erected a fire station including an office, bedroom and garage it would be allowed £12 p.a. for that reducing the annual upkeep to £22.  The station to have a telephone and the men to take turns to sleep on the premises – to be there from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Initial expenses and upkeep in the first year c. £200.

Cr Radford said water supply was a problem.

The Mayor was strongly in favour.

In the recent fire the ‘alleged’ reel was taken to the fire, but with no way of fastening it to a car someone had to hold it and they had proceeded at the furious pace of 10 m.p.h.

On arrival they had trouble connecting the hose, only to find there was no water.  The present reel might serve the City of Copperhouse!

The Town Clerk was ordered to gather all information.
