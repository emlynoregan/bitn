Dan van Holst Pellekaan met with concerned community members at the White Cedars Café last Thursday, following a meeting earlier in the year.  About 14 attended this meeting.  Many issues raised were concerned with local government rather than the State Government he said.  Issued discussed included ongoing concerns about services at the Burra Hospital, district flood mitigation, better ways to deal with Burra’s heritage listing and the proposal to re-instate rail services to Burra from Adelaide.
