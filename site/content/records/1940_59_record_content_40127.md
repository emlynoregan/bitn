Burra Town Council, 10 January

Advice from the Hospitals’ Dept. that the Council’s contribution has been increased from £204 to £253.  The Department says the precarious state of Hospital Finances and the large overdraft is due to many people receiving free treatment.

The Mayor pointed out that most of them were old age pensioners and invalid pensioners and the Act did not allow them to force such to contribute to hospital funds.  Other problems were the expensive medicines and the rising salaries of nursing and domestic staff.  The overdraft stood at more than £2,000 and the Mayor saw no hope of liquidating it without financial assistance.  He felt the sudden increase in Council contribution without warning was unfair.  The Clerk said the Burra Burra DC’s contribution had been increased to about £960 and protest was useless, as it had been gazetted.  The Government contribution was 8/- a day per occupied bed.  A strong protest will be lodged.  (The contribution in 1947 was £175 and in 1948 £204.)
