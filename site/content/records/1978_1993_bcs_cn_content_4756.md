R.J. (Dick) Cuttle

In 7½ years in Burra I have been involved in many aspects of the town and district and believe I have made a true contribution to the district and its people through these organisations.  I have gained considerable administrative experience and have had dealings with the Burra Burra DC.  Those experiences include:

Sport as a player, umpire, administrator and coach.

School Council as an elected parent representative.

Apex Club – many functions from Service Director to debater to President.

Kindergarten Committee.

Burra District Advisory Committee.

Burra Copper Festival 1977 Publicity Officer.

Having lived in three different country areas, have experience of four local governments.

Have an interest in contributing to and learning more of its functions.

My election would ensure at least one representative was from neither a farming nor a business background and if elected would try to have meetings changed to evenings to make Council more accessible to people in the area.
