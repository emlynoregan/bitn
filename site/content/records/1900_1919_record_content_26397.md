A Bolt.  A horse attached to a masher cart got free from a post it was tied to on Thursday afternoon and bolted.  It successfully got between several traps and careered up Ayers St, turned into George St, negotiated the Pig & Whistle crossing and the turn into Thames St, traversed Market Square and took the Adelaide Road.  At Connor’s old place it encountered a closed gate and returned via Commercial St to Market Square and then went north to be eventually caught at the Royal Exchange Hotel.  In all this no damage had been done except the initial breaking of the strap attached to the bit.
