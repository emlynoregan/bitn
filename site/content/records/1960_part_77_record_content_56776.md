M & BHA.  Mothers of young children are urged to attend the next branch meeting on 15 June.  The President and her committee are concerned at the dwindling interest being shown.  Only four attended the last meeting and this could soon mean that with no meetings there will be no clinic.  Average attendance has often been about 10.
