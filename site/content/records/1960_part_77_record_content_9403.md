Christmas in Burra.  Burra businesses were quiet on the afternoon of Friday 22 December, but the town was busy between 7 and 9 p.m. and the Merry-Go-Round proprietor reported the same.  He did not continue operating after lunch on Saturday.  Father Christmas arrived on schedule and distributed sweets, ice cream and whistle in an orderly fashion.  Burra Rural Youth organised a Christmas Eve Dance with Darrell Field’s Band.  Over £23 was raised for the Burra Hospital.
