C.A. Uhrlaub writes again, still expressing his shock and disgust at being asked to produce a balance sheet by an anonymous writer to a paper when no question of his integrity as treasurer had ever been raised.  Anyone wanting to see a balance sheet may do so on application to him at Mt Bryan School after school hours.
