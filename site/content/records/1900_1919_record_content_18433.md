Weather & the Season.  The hot weather has much reduced the anticipated yield of wheat in the east.  Haymaking has commenced much earlier than expected, but the quality will be lower than expected.  To the west the crops are better and were much less damaged by the heat, though here too the yield was reduced.  Rain fell yesterday when 114 points were recorded.  The creek rose and Market Square was flooded due to blockages in drainage.

Hallett Sports were successfully conducted on Monday and the results are printed.

W.J. Edwards [previously of Burra] is starting business in Broken Hill in the new premises erected by the Democratic Club.

‘Shareholder’ writes on the Burra Burra Copper Co. & Burra Mine.  He thanks the paper for its report, given that he had not received a balance sheet from the company.  He wondered why Burra Mine could not be worked at a profit when copper prices were high and other mine miles from rail transport were paying a dividend on 7% stuff and tributers at Burra could clear up to £4 a week.  It makes him think something is wrong.

H. Parker has completed No. 1 fence in connection with the Oakbank Vermin Board.  It is very substantial and will last a lifetime.

A Successful Concert was held in St Mary’s Hall last evening.

W.H. Hardy suggests two local justices be selected to hear his case concerning the pram incident, but as the evidence would probably take a day it is not reasonable to expect people to so spend their time.  The Mayor was named as a responsible party to hold the money, but His Worship declined to interfere in the matter.
