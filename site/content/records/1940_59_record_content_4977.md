FFCF Burra RSL Wives & Relatives Group AGM 7 February.

Along with other groups we participated in the Anzac Sports 1940 for which we received £74.  At that time membership was fewer then 30 and is now 60.  The group has also co-operated with the CWA in the Children’s Hospital Appeal.  Poppies were sold for the RSL and we have sponsored the Family Welfare Bureau.  On the fourth Friday in every month a social afternoon is held for sewing, knitting and friendly talk.  The Cupboard Fund was established so we could offer different gifts from those supplied by the FFCF or the Red Cross.  The income for the year was £107-0-9 and the expenditure was £87-12-2.  In the past 10 months we have forwarded to the FFCF 193 pairs of socks, 45 pairs of mittens, 24 pullovers, 68 scarves, 13 skullcaps, 2 balaclava helmets, 1 pair of kneecaps, 1 knitted waistcoat, 414 handkerchiefs, 172 dillybags, 1 housewife and several bundles of magazines.  And to the Burra Comforts Fund 40 pairs of socks, 50 handkerchiefs, 30 packets of cigarettes, 88 dozen chewing gum, and 20 pairs of socks are held in reserve.  Elected were: President, Mrs G.S. Hawker; Vice-Presidents, Mrs D. Keynes & Mrs Jennison and Secretary & Treasurer, Mrs R.J. Lloyd.
