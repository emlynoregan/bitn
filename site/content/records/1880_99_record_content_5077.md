Burra Town Council, 19 September.

Application has been made to Mr Powell for a piece of land needed for a road in Hampton.

A foot crossing is to be made over the creek on the east side of the saleyards.

Owners of cottages are not prepared to look after street trees.  The Council will have them watered.

Cr Rabbich has decided to move his piggeries out of town on account of the requirements of the Health Act and By-laws.  It is believed that Mr Bromley and Mr Gebhardt will do the same.
