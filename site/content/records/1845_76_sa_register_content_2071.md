Advertisement.  The Reformer stage-cart.

The proprietor thanks all his numerous friends and begs to inform them that as soon as his health permits they may hope to see him on the road again with the Reformer stage-cart.  None being fitted up water-proof for the comfort of travellers in winter, it requires a man with a strong constitution to withstand the fatigues of the road.  As the proprietor feels deficient in this regard, he will hold the property open for sale, together or separate and turn his hand to some quieter, though less lucrative pursuit.

Four strong horses complete with harness to sell with the coach and two horses, with harness complete to sell with the cart.  They are also open for hire by job, day or week.

W.W.G. Nicholls
