Mt Bryan Hall meeting recently favoured building a hall and the latest meeting was to resolve the financing of it.  Chairman H.S. Stephens favoured a special rate of 1Â½d for 22 years (or a lesser rate if for 40 years.)  Eventually it was decided to borrow the money from the State Bank for a term of years.  A special rate will have to be struck to guarantee the repayment
