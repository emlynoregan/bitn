[Jane] Florence.

Lancelot [Ashley] Lewis.

The family reunion has been a long time in the planning and owes much to the work of a great-granddaughter of John; Bronwyn Lewis.  Much work on the family tree has been done by Bob Lewis; a son of Essington and by Sandy Lewis; the Hon. A.A. Lewis, a WA politician and son of Lance Lewis.  Bronwyn thought it was time to act as Bob had died and few of his generation were still alive.  A year of work saw 85 gathered at the Burra Town Hall representing four generations of the family.

John Lewis’s Children:

James Brook Lewis was known as Brook and studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and at Melbourne to complete his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery.  He went to WA where he worked in the wheat belt and on the goldfields and was doctor at Gwalia when Herbert Hoover was overseer of the mines there before returning to the USA and becoming President.

Gilbert Norman Lewis farmed at ‘Bundaleer’ before becoming a Major in the Indian Army and a champion polo player.  He later bought land in WA from where his great-grandson, Nick Trethowan, spoke of being the fourth generation on ‘Balgarup’ in Kojonup.  He was a great horseman and polo player.  His great grandson, Peter Trethowan, has been a professional polo player.

Essington Lewis was officially recognised at the centenary of Federation celebrations as one of the 100 most influential Australians.  He is the subject of Geoffrey Blainey’s book Man of Steel and John O’Donoghue’s play I am Work.  He was Managing Director of BHP and in WWII Director General of Munitions.

Eleanor (Nell) Lewis served as a nurse in WWI.  She later married George Cowan.

Florence (Jane) Lewis stayed in the Clare Valley and married Alec Melrose.  Their wedding present was ‘Kadlunga’ where the fourth generation of Lewis descendants still live.

Lancelot (Ashley) Lewis died aged 52 but still made his mark.  At 9 he rode alone from Burra to Adelaide and at 12 he made a journey from Burra to Warrnambool.  He served in WWI [where he was severely wounded.  He worked for Bagot, Shakes & Lewis and later was Managing Director of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd with which Bagot, Shakes & Lewis merged.]
