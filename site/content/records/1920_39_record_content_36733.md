Mongolata Goldfield

Interest continues to grow.  F. Harris has shown us some good results from dollying out a stone.  One prospector is trying to find alluvial gold.  He is down about 30ft and others are also hard at work.  Some 28 years ago the well-known Madam Hellier who answered questions while in a trance predicted that a gold mine would be found about 10 miles east of Burra.  Mongolata is about that in a straight line.
