Booborowie Methodist Church 38th Anniversary was celebrated on 18 August and the report runs for some 1⅔ columns.  It includes considerable historical material on the church, drawing on material prepared for the 10th Anniversary in 1901 when Rev. W.F. James preached.

Nearly 13 years ago (from 1901) spare land near the famous Booborowie Station was thrown open for working men’s blocks and many families settled in the district.    Methodist services began in Mr Wall’s dining room for c. 2½ years.  Income for the circuit fund averaged £1-10-2 per quarter.  On Christmas Day 1890 a blockers’ picnic was held to raise funds for a church that could double as a day school.  £8-9-0 was raised.  Two allotments were purchased for £10-10-0.  A meeting in Mr Tohl’s house decided to erect a stone building 25ft x 15ft.  In due course the materials were delivered by voluntary labour.  C. & A. Fuss began building the church in mid-September 1891 and finished it within two months.  The cost including land etc. was £194.  £100 was borrowed at 7%.  A Sunday school with 23 scholars began in 1892 and trees were planted around the yard through the kindness of James Loudon.  The Education department used the church in the daytime as a school for 50 scholars.  Within four years £50 had been paid off and in the fifth year with a generous gift from Messrs Brown, owners of Booborowie Station the remainder was cleared away.  In the first 10 years the church’s income was £439 or an average of £44 for all purposes.  For some time there were only two members.  Gradually the number increased to five and then remained static.  For some months the church was the site for unsectarian Literary Society meetings.  Many Band of Hope meetings were also held.
