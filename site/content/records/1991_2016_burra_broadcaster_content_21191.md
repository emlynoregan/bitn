Fire.  A large fire started on 25 January and burnt out about 600 ha of grass at ‘Mokota’ near Mt Bryan and a few ha of land belonging to the Lines Family.  It is thought it was started by a header.  21 CFS units attended.  The steep terrain presented a challenge for access, with some areas accessible only on foot.
