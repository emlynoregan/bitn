Kooringa Magistrates

The need to appoint a Resident Magistrate in Kooringa is clear from the events of the last few days.  On 7 November the Magistrates were absent, which wasted the time of the suitors and other required to attend.  On 8 November the hesitation of the Sitting Magistrate to issue a Warrant of Distress in the case of Bailey v. the Patent Copper Co. in confirmation of a previous decision of the Court draws attention to the inadequacy of the arrangements.  In considering the absence of the Magistrates on 7 November it must be borne in mind that both are medical men and their professional duties may absolutely prevent attendance at times.
