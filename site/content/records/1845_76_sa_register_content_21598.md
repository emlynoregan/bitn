Redruth News, 22 January

Last week the Engineer in Chief was in the town to decide the location of the new railway station.  Section 2264, part of which is commonly known as Princess Town, is mentioned in the Act of Parliament as the terminus.  This is not more than ¾ mile from Kooringa and 1½ miles from Redruth.

Weather.  Lately it has been uncommonly cold and wet: more wintry than anyone can recall for January.

The case of Kronke v. Hiles for an indecent assault was dismissed at the hearing at Redruth Local Court.  It will appear again as Mr Hiles has indicted Mrs Kronke for perjury.

Wesleyan Foreign Mission Services were held last Sunday and Monday in Kooringa.  Mr Jarrett the Primitive Methodist minister delivered the sermons.  About £13 was collected in Kooringa.

The Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association held its monthly meeting.
