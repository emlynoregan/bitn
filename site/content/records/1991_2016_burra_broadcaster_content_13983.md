Advertisement & Advertorial for the Antique Clock Shop.

The business has been in Burra for six years.  Richard Holbrook is a qualified watchmaker and his wife is responsible for the Griffiths’ Cottage B & B, which has been going for two years.  They are now too busy to also operate the tearooms in conjunction with the clock shop and in consequence as from 17 September the clock shop will close for refurbishment and will re-open on 24 September.
