Fires.  There were three rubbish fires on Friday afternoon, Sunday afternoon and Monday early afternoon.  Each was soon extinguished.  The most serious was at Mr J. Bogisch’s at Burra North where a wormwood hedge and packing cases were destroyed.  This had potential to do far more damage, as it was near Sara’s old wooden storeroom.
