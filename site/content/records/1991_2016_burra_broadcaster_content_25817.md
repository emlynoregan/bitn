Mid North Counselling Service had its AGM last week and Kathy Ottens reflected on her time as a rural counsellor for ten years.  The improvement in the rural economy had made her workload more achievable, with less need for cash-flow budgeting one reason for the reduction in demand.  Problems and financial difficulties of course continue and a series of good years is needed to make a big difference and poverty still arises when jobs are lost or families break up.  State Member of Parliament Caroline Schaefer was the guest speaker.  She gave an overview of the state of the rural sector.
