Hallett Wind Farm Lights have been turned off.  After Federal MP for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, called for a review, the red flashing lights on the wind farms in the Hallett area have been turned off.  Advice to AGL, who own the cluster of wind farms in the Hallett area, was that since the towers are below the lowest permissible aviation height, they do not have to be lit.  The intrusive lighting has now been turned off.
