Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM advises that the offer made for some London interests to take up the unallotted shares in Byles’ Co. has been cancelled.  The London interests south an extension of time, but the directors felt that, as prospects were good, London should not be allowed to come in at the last minute to the detriment of Australian shareholders.  Negotiations have therefore, for the time being, been cancelled.

At the company’s AGM in Adelaide last week Mr Williams, former underground manager of Lake View and Star Mine in WA, addressed the meeting.  He was very hopeful of prospects at Mongolata following three visits to the field.
