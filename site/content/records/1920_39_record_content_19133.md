Porter’s Lagoon.  A large crowd gathered on Saturday to see the launching of The Swan.  Many cars lined the shore, requiring a parking attendant.  The President of the Committee, Mr H. Atkins, said he was pleased with the turn-out and glad the scheme had attracted so many shareholders.  People could become shareholders at a cost of only £2 and more shareholders meant more boats could be bought and so turn Porter’s Lagoon into the ‘seaside resort’ of the north.  The Minister controlling fisheries has promised to release fish into the lagoon in winter.  Mrs Atkins christened the boat The Swan.  Pedestrians and aquatic sports followed. (Boys race, 1 man rowing race, 60yds swimming race, 4-oared race, two men with one oar each, men’s 100 yds race, diving and 4 men with one oar each.)

Also there were two canvas dressing rooms for gents and two for ladies as well as refreshment and cool drink booths.  The evening saw a dance in the Farrell’s Flat Hall.  Unofficial fun included: riding the barrel & slow diving.  The Swan was well patronised.  How about a ‘Floating Palais’ now?

Thanks to Ern Pratt and colleagues who organised it.
