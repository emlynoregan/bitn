Burra Sale Yards

Elders & Landmark held an off-shears sheep sale at Burra Sale Yards last week.  This was the first sheep sale in Burra for some three years.  It attracted a good crowd and good prices.  11,000 sheep went under the hammer.  The yarding comprised:	1,000 wether lambs

1,000 wethers

9,000 ewes

The success of the sale has encouraged the agents to plan for another sale in 2005.
