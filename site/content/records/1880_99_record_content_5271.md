Mr Ward.  There is a report of Mr Ward’s behaviour in Parliament in column 7.  His speech on the second reading of the Crown Lands Bill was much interrupted by members of the Government and others and he replied rather hotly, was asked to withdraw offensive remarks, refused, was named, given the right to make an explanation, declined, and was removed by the sergeant-at-arms.  The House voted not to allow him to speak again till he had apologised for his conduct.  On Wednesday he withdrew the offending words and gave a ‘lame’ explanation.
