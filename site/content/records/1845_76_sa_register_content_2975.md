Advertisement.  The Miners of the Burra Burra Mines, 1 November 1848 to the Editors of the SAR:

We regret to see the continued advertisements in your contemporaries of the specified rates of pay for the future working of these mines.  We hereby inform the Directors that we feel we cannot entertain the thought of again retaking out pitches or bargains unless the Directors shall see fit to grant us our former wages.
