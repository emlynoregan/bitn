Mrs George Hann was farewelled after a residence of 23 years in Burra.  She has gone to live at Fullarton.  She will be greatly missed both in social and musical matters.  She was given a farewell by St Mary’s Church in the hall after Evensong on Sunday, where she was presented with a cheque in appreciation of her work over many years.
