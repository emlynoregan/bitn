Commercial Hotel

The proprietress, Miss E. Scovell, says she has leased the hotel to Mrs Rasheed of Adelaide.  Though there have been a number of owners, this is the first time the hotel has been leased.  The late Mr Tom Scovell bought it about 15Â½ years ago.  He died in 1945, since when the business has been carried on by his sister, Miss E. Scovell, who will now go to live in Adelaide.

[See 82, 4, 5 Feb. 1954, page 1 (incorrect date for 2 Feb.) for information which contradicts this statement about the leasing of the hotel.]
