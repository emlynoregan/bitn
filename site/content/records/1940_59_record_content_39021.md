Obituary.  Mr W.H. Quinn died at his residence at 32 Caulfield Ave. Cumberland Park on 6 October.  Mr Quinn was the fourth son of the late Thomas and Ann Quinn and was born at Princess Royal Station near Burra on 16 October 1861.  At the age of seven he accompanied his family by bullock dray to Mt Gipps Station in the Barrier Ranges and spent the next ten years there with his father and brothers in dam sinking, fencing and other station work.  They often mustered bullocks in the paddock where the mining town of Broken Hill now stands – its rich lodes of silver, and lead then undiscovered.

The family then moved to Mt Bryan East where they engaged in farming and grazing pursuits.  They suffered great hardships in the depression of the 1890s when wheat prices fell as low as 1/5 a bushel, fat lambs to 1/6 a head and good fleece wool to 5d a pound.  Later conditions improved and Mr Quinn acquired some valuable properties before his retirement.

On 2 December 1891 he married Miss Annie O’Malley, daughter of the late John & Bridget O’Malley, at Silverton Church.  They had a family of seven: three sons, Messrs Tom, Will and John of Mt Bryan and four daughters; Mesdames Dare of Mt Bryan East, F. Cahill of Walkerville, F. Richards of Mt Bryan and Miss Ann Quinn of Cumberland Park.  Mr Quinn remained at Mt Bryan East until retiring to Cumberland Park in 1933.

Mr Quinn was of fine physique and took a keen interest in public affairs, being for some years a member of the Hallett District Council and later of the Mt Bryan District Council.  He was a Life Member of the Agricultural Bureau.  In his younger days he was a keen cricketer and could play several musical instruments as well as being an expert step-dancer.  As a member of the Catholic Church he took a prominent part in the building of St Brendan’s Church at Mt Bryan.  He is survived by his widow, seven children, thirty grandchildren and one great grandchild.  He was buried at the Burra Cemetery.

[William Henry Quinn.  Birth registered as 2 November 1861 at Princess Royal.]
