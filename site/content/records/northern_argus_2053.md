Burra Show Society held its AGM and Peter Stockman was elected as the Society’s new President. The Vice-Presidents are Bob Jamieson and Ian Slade.  Jock Duncan as outgoing President reported on a very successful 1986 show.  With a focus on sheep and wool, the features had been:

A marquee in which Elders Pastoral had set up many displays from their successful Jubilee Show ‘On the Sheep’s Back’, held earlier in the year.

Vet John Kock demonstrated laproscopy of ewes.

Marleston School & the Wool Corporation presented static displays.

M.T. & B.M. Kellock displayed their Supreme Champion Ram from the Royal Show and his fleece.

Collinsville displayed the fleece from the World Record priced $102,000 ram.

Photos of sheep adorned the walls of the Show Hall.

Frank Doecke presented a display of historic shearing handpieces.

There was a blade and mechanical shearing competition.

Another highlight was the presence of bullocky Jim Kelly and his 18-bullock team.

In the year Matt Reilly has assisted in the filling in and levelling of the old railway siding and the iron fence at the bottom of the showgrounds had been rebuilt.  Since the show the oval had been resown.
