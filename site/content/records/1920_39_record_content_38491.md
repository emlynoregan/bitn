H.J. Cadd President of the SA Wheat Producers’ Freedom Association writes saying the Commissioner of Taxation has begun to negotiate with landholders who appealed against their land tax assessments.  Generally they seem to be being offered a reduction of 25%.  They are urged not to accept this before a meeting of farmers is held.  This will be soon in Maitland.
