Burra United Friendly Societies’ Annual Sports were held on Boxing Day at Victoria Park.  Gate takings were up on 1903 despite the latter part of the day being dusty.  Major Marshal, an American Negro, was engaged to impress in the cycle races, but he was far from impressive and the money was not well-spent.  The cycling and pedestrian races were the best for many years.  The bike track has been improved, but needs considerably more work.  It needs tar-dressing.  Unfortunately many local spectators stayed away and the bulk of onlookers seemed to be strangers or neighbours.  The changing tent near the tea tent was a mistake since ‘as a rule people prefer to have something besides blasphemy with a cup of tea’.  There was no music of any kind this year.  The events are then reported in over 2 columns.
