Obituary.  Mrs Thursa Finch died suddenly 15 April after collapsing suddenly at breakfast with heart failure.  She was born in Devonshire on 10 March 1833 and married 15 April 1857 to Mr William Finch.  In about 1870 Mr Finch came to Australia to try his luck and Mrs Finch followed in 1872 in the City of Adelaide.  Her two sons, William and George, came with her.  In England Mr Finch was in the trawling business.  In Australia he worked for his father who had migrated a few years earlier.  After several years they took land at World’s End until retiring to Burra.  Mr Finch died about 6 years ago.  Sunday was the 60th anniversary of her wedding.  Three sons survive: William (Kooringa), George & Samuel (World’s End).  The three daughters all died in infancy.

[Born Thurza Tuckermann and died at Kooringa.]
