Obituary.  Mr C. Adolph Lott died at his residence in Paxton Terrace 30 May.  He was the only son of the late Mr & Mrs Adolph Lott and was born 20 December 1860 in Welsh Place, Kooringa in the old home still standing in good repair almost opposite the Kooringa Hotel.  He was educated at Dr Stephen’s and F.W. Holder’s schools.  On leaving school he worked with his father, a cabinetmaker, in the premises now occupied by Mr A. Lomman.  Later he went to Clare, where he entered the employ of Mr Pethick, builder.  Returning to Burra, he was employed for a time by Mr H. Bruse, carpenter and cabinetmaker, and later worked for the firm of Sara & Dunstan of Aberdeen.  In the early days of Silverton and Broken Hill he went to Silverton and opened a branch business for Sara & Dunstan.  In later years he was in business for himself as a carpenter and builder until his health required him to retire about six years ago.  He was for a time a Town Councillor and he took an active interest in football, athletics and cricket.  He was one of the oldest members of the Foresters’ Lodge and a member of the Kooringa Lodge [Freemasons] and possibly the oldest subscriber to the Burra Institute.  He married 10 June 1886 Miss (Nurse) Amelia Hodges, who came from Perth, but was then working at the Burra Hospital.  Her father had served in the Crimean War.  Their golden wedding would have been celebrated on Thursday this week.  His health failed after he broke his leg five years ago.  Surviving children are: Mr Adolph Lott (Headmaster Renmark Public School and late Major in the AIF), Mr Cliff Lott (Kooringa), Mrs L.S. Penrose (Kooringa), Sister Clara Lott (Adelaide) and Mrs Dan Murdock (Crystal Brook).  There are 12 grandchildren.

[Born Adolph Carl Theodore Lott 22 September 1859 Kooringa: died Carl Adolph Lott 30 May 1936 Kooringa.]
