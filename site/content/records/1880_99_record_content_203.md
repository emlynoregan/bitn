Burra Town Council 5 January

Cr Ridgway moved to sell land on which the rates were in arrears.

[For property on the old system rather than under Torrens Title this was a complicated problem as ownership was often hard to establish.]

Cr Lewis was granted 6 weeks leave as he would be absent from the town.

Land Payments.  A meeting at Mr Midwinterâ€™s at Baldina on 8 January decided to ask the Government for further concessions re the payments due on land, in view of the crop failures.  Many farmers had reaped only 1 to 4 bushels per acre.  They had payments deferred last year, but were now even worse off.  Mr Midwinter asked for a further two years to pay the interest and then three years to pay the principal.  (Carried)
