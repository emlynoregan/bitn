Dick Smith opened the restored family home of Australian explorer, adventurer and scientist, Sir Hubert Wilkins.  Over 500 attended and a replica of the ‘Southern Cross’ aeroplane flew overhead.  Sir Hubert had sold the original to Kingsford Smith, who fitted it out for the historic crossing of the Pacific.
