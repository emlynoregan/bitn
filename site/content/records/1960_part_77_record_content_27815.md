Decimal Currency

The Burra Post Office is well organised to handle the change to decimal currency on 14 February.

Letters for one ounce will then cost 4 c.

Each additional ounce will cost 3 c.

Aerograms will cost 9 c.

Airmail letters to Europe will be 25 c. per half-ounce.

A three-minute telephone call to Adelaide will be 40 c. at day rates and 30 c. for evening rates.

Decimal currency postage stamps will be available from 7 February, but must not be used before 14 February.
