Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The banquet and presentation to returned men was held last Wednesday in the Institute, sponsored by the Burra Cheer-up Society for the returned men of the town and district.  The Society, which will soon disband, decided to present each soldier, sailor and nurse who enlisted from Burra & District with a gold medal and to do so at a banquet for the returned men and nurses, their wives, parents, or next of kin and all returned men living in or visiting the district along with the officers of other patriotic societies and the Chairmen of the various District Councils.  Over 700 invitations went out and nearly 400 attended.  The hall was artistically decorated and all was a great success.  More than one sitting was required and guests waited outside under the trees on seating which was supplied.  The medal presentation began at 8 p.m.

The Cheer-up Ladies’ band provided the music and Mr Crewes said they would not disband till the last boy came home.  Over 200 medals were distributed.
