Tourists.  A busload of elderly tourists visiting Burra recently included a number of former Burraites:

Sister Watson, nee [Mary Ellen] Rosewall, daughter of the late J.A. Rosewall and now Night Sister at the Home for Incurables.  [1890-1971]

Thomas R.J. [Robert James] Reynolds whose family was at Booborowie in 1874 and who once worked at the Burra Brewery.  He was born in Burra and now lives at Hindmarsh. [1876-1957]

Mrs Norman, who was born in Burra, lived at Booborowie and also nursed at Burra Hospital in Dr Steeleâ€™s time.

Mrs Nolan, nee Bernhardt, was born in Burra and is sister to Mr R.J. Bernhardt of Burra.  [Louisa Christiana: 1888-1970]

Mr A.E. Grey of Hindmarsh, formerly of Farrell Flat and whose family came to the district in 1874.

C.F. Veale, who knew Kapunda better, but whose family came here in 1834 [sic: perhaps 1854?] and worked in the Burra Copper Mines.  [Perhaps Congdon Fox Veale: 1870-1967]
