Obituary.  Mr Bill Brown died at his home ‘The Grove’ in Burra on 23 June aged 56.  He was a past President of the SA Merino Stock Breeders Association and a committee member since the early 1960s.  He was well known as a judge of Merinos at Royal Shows in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth as well as at country shows.  He was President of the SA Stud Merino Breeders Association 1968-70.  He was born on the family property at Elliston in 1921 and he registered his Merino Stud there in 1949.  In 1956 he transferred it to Burra, retaining ‘The Grove’ as the stud name.  At the Perth Royal Show ram sales last year ‘The Grove’ sold an outstanding ram to an East Wickepin WA buyer for $26,000 (by a sire from Ashrose, Hallett; a bloodline originating from Collinsville and used by ‘The Grove’ since its inception.)  In 1960 Mr Brown pioneered the Arubiddy Station on the Nullarbor Plain, which now carries 16,000 Merinos and is run by his sons Peter and Dean.  Mr Brown had been Chairman of the Burra Burra DC 1972-76, a member of the Burra Bowling Club for ten years and in his early days played cricket in Burra.  As well as his sons Mr Brown is survived by his widow, Zita Brown and daughter, Rosemary, now living in Queensland.  The funeral on Monday at St Joseph’s Burra was one of the largest seen in the area.

[William Brown born 10 May 1921 Elliston.]
