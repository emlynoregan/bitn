Mr J.G. Sara was born at Willunga and at a young age was taken to Rhynie, where the family lived briefly.  They then moved to Farrell Flat for about three years.  His father kept a general store as well as being a carpenter and undertaker.  A local identity, Johnny O’Leary, once came in when a coffin was being made and asked if he kept any second hand ones.  (Meaning ready made.)  The family next moved to Burra where J.G. spent his boyhood and youthful years.  He remembered Cooper & Bailey’s Circus and Wild Animal Show coming, but there was no performance due to a great flood.  Sara & Dunstan’s had the contract for the Anglican Church and the Burra Public School.  J.G. worked on the school and also at Roseworthy College for the firm.  He later worked at Butterworth’s Mill.   (In 1952 the Shell Depot.)  When he was 19 he and another Burra boy, Arthur Leighton, decided to go to WA and in 1883 they sailed in the barque Ribston of 350 tons from Pt Adelaide to Fremantle in 21 days.  He got suitable work in WA for 12 months before returning to SA.  For a year he worked with Dunn & Co., flour millers at Quorn.  On returning to Burra he married Miss Emma Tiver and in the first year the couple went to Terowie in Sara & Dunstan’s ironmongery store.  Then he was sent to Cockburn to take charge of the general store and forwarding agency.  His wife followed in the company’s train and he had a camp oven roast ready for her and his daughter when they arrived.  At one time there were 150 teams ready to load goods to Broken Hill.  When the railway was completed through to Broken Hill the store and goods were packed on a jinker and moved to Argent St where the firm was established at builders, ironmongers etc.  They were successful tenderers for buildings of all sizes.  Many small wood and iron dwellings were erected and later added to.  He has a photo of Mr J.H. Cann, former President of the AMA with skull cap, knee straps, upturned sleeves and pick in hand, shaking hands with the underground manager of the BHP Mine, showing the good feeling between capital and labour.  Mr Cann was later an MP in the NSW Parliament.  Messrs Sleath & Ferguson were among Union officials at the time of the big strike when some ugly incidents were reported and the Riot Act was read.  A number of Union officials were arrested and convicted.  Sleath & Ferguson each received two years.  Safety and health conditions were improved with better wages and the bonus according to the lead price.  Other notable events there were the big fire and the water famine, when at one time J.G. had to pay 30/- per 100 gallons for water.  He was for some years the Burra Record’s correspondent in Broken Hill.  With a decline in trade he worked for some time for BHP open cut, as time-keeper for contractors.  He and George Green decided to try WA and they started a cash grocery store in Perth, but when his wife’s father and brothers wanted to leave their Aberdeen General Store to go on the land, J.G. was offered and accepted the well-known business of James Tiver & Sons.  Their son Frank Sara was with G. & R. Wills & Co. in Perth, but they decided to have him with them in the Burra store.  For two years J.G. continued to take groceries and about 100 loaves of bread to Mt Bryan & district.  The Aberdeen Post Office was in the store and J.G. was postmaster for over 30 years, retiring at 78.  The late Frank Sara will be remembered for his ability and integrity.  Now J.G. has failing hearing and sight.
