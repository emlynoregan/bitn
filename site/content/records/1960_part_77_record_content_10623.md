Burra High School is celebrating its Golden Jubilee this year.  The Headmaster Mr R.V. Mueller recounts some of its highlights.  [In the summaries that follow references to sports achievements and prizes awarded have been omitted.  They have generally appeared when they occurred.]

1913

The school officially opened 20 January 1913 with J.W. Statton as Assistant in charge and with 30 pupils.  Pictures chosen by Mr V. Pavia arrived and the library began with 42 books.  A basketball was purchased.  Inspector T. Cole recommended a table be obtained for the teacher.  Late in the year a cupboard was supplied.
