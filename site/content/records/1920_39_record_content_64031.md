We were not allowed to talk to the boys beyond the salutation of ‘Good morning’ or ‘Good afternoon’ Master and Miss so and so.  A large party was given once a year on the occasion of Master Fred’s birthday, when we all mingled freely together.

[Frederick William James White was born 24 August 1863.]

As my father wished me to learn book keeping, which Mrs White did not teach, I spent many hours in the boys’ school.  The work was on similar lines than ours.  Boys entering the school saluted the Master and obtained his ‘Good morning Sir’ greeting, then formed in line for inspection of hands, hair, clothing and boots.  Woe betides the boy who had dirty nails or dusty boots.  He would be immediately sent home with a stern rebuke.  Well I remember such a one.

Oh! Alfred Schutz

Go clean thy boots

Or else the fruits

Of thy untidiness and insolence

Shall well be seen in after years

We were given a good sound commercial education of we failed to profit it was not through neglect on the teacher’s part.  Both master and mistress have long gone to their rest.

[Frederick Richard White c. 1843 – 12 August 1905, Unley.
