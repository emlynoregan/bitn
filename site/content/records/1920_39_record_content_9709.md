The Golden Wedding.  The marriage of Thomas Parks and H. Martha nee Newman was celebrated at Kooringa 25 December 1872.

Mr & Mrs Parks celebrated this event on Christmas Day.  Mr Parks is the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Parks, baker of Hindmarsh.  He was born 6 September 1849 and came to Burra as an infant.  The family lived first in a dugout in the Burra Creek opposite the Church of England and more than once had to be rescued from floods.  He was educated at W. Youngâ€™s school in Adelaide.  For many years he worked for Bath & Pearce (Later Pearce Bros.) and after they ceased trading he worked for Drew & Crewes until he retired.  Mrs Parks was born 5 October 1848 and came to SA with her parents in the Bonyan in 1850.  They settled in Adelaide, but soon went to the Victorian goldfields where her father, Mr Newman, soon died.  Her mother remarried Mr W. Herbert two years later and they came to Burra.  In 1872 she married Thomas Parks.  They had four daughters and one son: Mrs W. Seymour (Pt Pirie), Mrs A.H. Sugars (Kooringa), Mrs J. Brown (Pt Pirie West), Mrs E. Holwell (Pt Pirie West) & Will Parks (Kooringa).  There are 14 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.  All the children were present for the celebration.
