W. Howard Turner offers a brief letter on the usual topic and also offered a lengthy one that the editor decided not to print.

Mary Turner writes denying it was she who called out ‘Germans Germans’ to certain of the Red Cross Ladies.

[The Editor seems finally to have decided that enough was enough on this topic.]
