Weather.  Rainstorms hit Burra on Monday 21 February, dropping about 26 mm in a short time.  The Burra Art Gallery had problems with water entering the building and Décor Made Easy had an area flooded due to a blocked drain.  The Art Gallery experienced problems from a heavy flow of water down the hill as well as from guttering.  The Morehead Street-Best Place intersection was flooded when drains failed to cope.  In the midst of it all a trailer became detached from its truck near the corner of Commercial and Chapel Streets and traffic was blocked for some time.  [Photo]
