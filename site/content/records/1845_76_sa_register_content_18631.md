A Public Meeting at Steelton was held in the schoolroom on 6 June.  Mr J.B. Miller presided.

He spoke in favour of the middle road as passing through the best agricultural land – lying 12 miles west of the Tothill’s creek Road.  The middle road was also straight for 13 miles beyond Springfield and there was a good natural road without a bridge, ford or other obstruction.

The claim of Burra memorialists that there is no water on the middle road is wrong; there are 12 Government reserves with permanent water.

Mr Challoner had said at the Burra meeting that the removal of the present road would be detrimental to all.  It might be detrimental to the Company he was interested in, but to move it to the centre of a widely populated and cultivated district would not be detrimental to any except a company of mine shareholders and speculative landowners.  The present road was undoubtedly of interest to the Copper Company, but not to the inhabitants of the populated agricultural district to the west of the present road.

A letter refuting certain statements in the Burra memorial will be sent to the Central Road Board.
