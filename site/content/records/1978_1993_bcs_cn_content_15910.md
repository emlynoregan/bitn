Burra Printing Press

Burra National Trust has decided to organise fundraising for the purchase of the Burra Printing Press and equipment dating from 1876.  These historic items are for the benefit of the whole town.  Their final resting place has yet to be determined.  The asking price of $6,000 is well below market value.

[Donations to the value of $960 are acknowledged.]

[The printing press certainly did not date from 1876.  The original hand press took an hour for three men to print one side of 250 copies.  It was certainly replaced very early.  In 1883 the business was totally destroyed by fire and new type and equipment procured.  There was another extensive fire in 1910, which destroyed all the back premises, all the type and much equipment.  It is true that the printing press survived another fire in 1935.  Although undoubtedly old fashioned by 1977 when the paper closed, it was certainly not a century old.]
