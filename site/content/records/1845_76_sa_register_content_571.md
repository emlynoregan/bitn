Burra Burra Mines

Directors of the SA Mining Association, who had decided on the name Truro for the township at the Burra Burra Mines, have since resolved to adopt the euphonious native name ‘Coolinga’.

Mr Crawford of the Hindmarsh Brewery has contracted to erect a hotel at the Burra Burra Mines and it is said he will attach a brewery to the new establishment.
