St Mary’s Day School held its break-up concert in the Parish Hall on 19 December.  Items presented were a credit to headmistress Miss Sinclair and her assistant, Mrs Hodson.  The Rector said he regretted Miss Sinclair’s departure.  She had been in charge for three years and in that time much progress had been made.  The enrolment had been doubled and an assistant, Mrs Hodson, appointed this year.  The Inspector’s report was very favourable.  Both Qualifying Certificate candidates this year were successful.  Presentations were made to Miss Sinclair from the students and by Mr Bednall on behalf of the School Council.  Mrs Hodson will be headmistress in 1936 with Miss Dorothy Taylor as assistant.  Qualifying Certificates went to Veda Butler and Mollie McBride.
