Perlite

The Council has engaged a consultant, Mr Des Menz of Enviro Civil, to prepare additional information in the Perlite project as requested by the EPA.  The information is not regarded as controversial and the EPA does not see this as a complicated development proposal.  The Mid North Regional Development board does not expect any delays in the approval process.
