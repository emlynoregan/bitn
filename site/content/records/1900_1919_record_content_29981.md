Football.  At Petersburg on Wednesday Burra lost to Petersburg.  [Presumably badly, since no scores are mentioned!]

On Saturday Aberdeen 62 defeated Hallett 10, but the game was played in an impossible gale with Hallett mustering only 14 men.

At Farrell’s Flat on Saturday Kooringa lost and once again no scores are given.
