Burra Co. MI learnt last Wednesday that this year there would be no encampment.  This is not only a disappointment, but also it prevents the men from becoming ‘extra efficient’ and so earning £3-4-0 and even if ‘extra efficient is awarded they still lose £2-4-0.  This is no way to encourage the volunteers.
