Burra Town Council, Monday.  The Deputy Postmaster General wrote to say the revenue of the Aberdeen post office did not warrant the buying or leasing of a building at present.

Continuous telephone operation will be arranged as soon as possible.

Condolences were sent to the West, Hardy and Pederson families on their recent bereavements.

The Mayor indicated he was willing to stand again if that was what the people wanted, but was equally ready to stand aside if another candidate came forward.

Cr McBride did not feel inclined to fight an election, but would stay on if no one else came forward.
