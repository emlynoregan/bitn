Mr O’Dea of Booborowie suffered an accident on Thursday evening while going home from Burra.  He fell out of his spring cart at Firewood Creek while standing up to put on an overcoat.  The horse went on to Flagstaff where Mr J. Oats found it and drove back to Burra, concluding that an accident had occurred.  He found only the seat cushion.  He reported the matter to police the next morning and Mr O’Dea was found having a meal at the Courthouse Hotel, but he is unable to say how he got there.
