Accident.  Jack Kemp, a passenger from Broken Hill North, left Burra for Adelaide on Friday night 6 November.  The car rolled completely over on the Black Springs Road about 15 miles south of Burra, but it ended up on its wheels facing the way it had come.  No one was much hurt and the vehicle was roadworthy and so they continued on their way, reporting the accident at the next police station.  Senior Constable Chambers had some difficulty convincing them they were at Burra and not Kapunda.
