Burra Bowling Club has purchased the Green due to the generosity of Debenture Holders and a bequest from the late E.F. Marston.  A complete new fence will now be erected around the green.  At the AGM the elections returned: Patron, E. Finch; President, H. Binks-Williams; Vice-Presidents, Messrs G.H. Dollman & S.J. Woollacott and secretary, J.B .Topsfield.

The retiring President H.J.B. Jennison reported a successful year.  The greens were in excellent condition. During the year there were official visits to Blyth (twice) and Hallett.  Hallett and Robertstown Clubs visited Burra.  The most important matters for the year were incorporation and the purchase of the greens from the Debenture Holders, an option made possible by the £500 bequest of the late E.F. Marston.  The club’s financial position is sound and the committee is grateful for a donation of £50 from the Croquet Club Ladies.  Greens man Mr F. Fillmore has done an excellent job, but unfortunately he is unable to continue.  Winners for the last season:

Championship	V.A. Riggs

Consistency	J.B. Topsfield

Championship Pairs	Les Phillips & Reg Barty

Handicap Singles	Joe Lloyd

Electric Light Pairs	Joe Lloyd & E. Finch
