Mr J.R. Barker of Baldina has found an interesting item on his property.  It was a pile of thin plastic 12-15 ft across and 2 ft high and far too heavy to lift.  Attached to either end was a solid round cylinder and to one of them a long nylon rope was fixed.  It appears likely to have been a large tethered balloon, perhaps 100 ft across, which has escaped from somewhere.  So far no one has reported seeing it in flight.
