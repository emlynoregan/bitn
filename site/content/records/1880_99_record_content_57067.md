Last year one of the North Ward Councillors tried to introduce a new by-law, but it came to grief on unforseen rocks.  This year another effort was made and now the opposition of 216 ratepayers has led to a decision to rescind the new by-law.  Really they had no choice because the whole proceedings were ultra vires and the by-law was framed in such a reckless manner as to contravene the Hawkerâ€™s Act 1863.  [The paper then prints parallel texts of the two measures to prove the point.]
