Burra Community School celebrated with their end of year Formal at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The Masquerade theme saw an imaginative display of craftwork and colours of blue, white and silver adorning the Hall.  When the Year 12 class decided on a more intimate farewell dinner at Martindale Hall this yearâ€™s Formal looked like falling through for a while.  The SRC worked hard to create an end of year event for all middle and senior school students.  A Formal Committee was set up co-ordinated by Christine Landorf and a commendable band of helpers was assisted by a generous donation from Goyder Council through the Youth Advisory Council and popular Yorke and Mid North sound masters, Diversity DJs offered their services at an affordable price.  The evening was deemed a great success.
