‘cannot recollect a case in which a child has been more grossly neglected than was this poor little thing.’

Harriet Fisher described how she visited and eventually offered to take the child for 5/- a week to allow the mother to go out to service.  The arrangements were made in the presence of Dr Brummitt.

The mother and grandmother were present when the child died.

Laura Patterson:

Am a single woman living at Kooringa.  The child, aged two months, was born at Terowie.  Mrs Potter was midwife and Dr Hill attended.  (The witness here contradicted herself.)  The child was getting on well till I came to Burra.  The child caught a cold - we could not get our things when we came here and slept on the floor three or four nights.  Got fresh milk from Dr Brummitt daily and gave it five bottles in 24 hours.  Could always get sufficient food for the child.  Never received any support from the father.  Positive Dr Brummitt never cautioned me.

John Patterson, grandfather of the child:

The child was never strong, continually crying.  It was fed on condensed milk and sugar.  Dr Hill attended the ninth day after birth.  Doctor complained to me about its treatment after its death.

Martha Patterson, mother of Laura Patterson:

‘ . . . it was always a very week [sic] child.  It seemed to dwindle away from time of its birth.  Sometimes fed on maizena and sometimes on condensed milk.’

After half an hour the jury said ‘Emma Patterson came to her death from natural causes, accelerated by neglect owing to the unfortunate circumstances of the parents and insufficient home comforts and necessaries of life.’

And ‘. . . there had been considerable amount of neglect on the part of the mother; who should be severely censured by the coroner.’
