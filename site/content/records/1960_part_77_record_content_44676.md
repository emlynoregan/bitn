Kindergarten Fathers’ Auxiliary.  Only five fathers attended the meeting on 26 February, but with apologies pledging support, it is hoped their work can go on.  Since the meeting considerable work cleaning up the grounds had been done.  Native plants for shade are being investigated.  [Details of the work in ¾ column.]
