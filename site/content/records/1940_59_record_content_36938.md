Diphtheria Immunization is recommended to Burra parents following two recent deaths from the disease in Adelaide.

Legacy Club Appeal stands now at £126-16-3.

An Inquest into the death of Lance Phillips will be held at Burra on Wednesday 2 June, conducted by the local coroner, Mr S. Kellaway JP.

Burra Rifle Club members had a picnic shoot against a Riverton Team on Saturday to the Riverton Club’s range, which is located at Rhynie.  The plan was for a shoot over 500, 600 and 700 yards, but rain set in during the 600 yards shoot and deteriorated further, causing the 700 yard shoot to be abandoned.  On the day Burra 975 defeated Riverton 945.

Burra Bowling Club Trophies for the 1948 season were presented on Saturday.
