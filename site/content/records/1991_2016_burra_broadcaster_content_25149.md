Letter.  John Agnew writes on GM crops in response to the negative article the previous week by Ally Fricker.  She listed the dangers, but none of the potential benefits, such as increased yields or less reliance on chemicals to control pests and weeds.  He says genetic modification has been going on for ages by selected breeding and even across species barriers as with intriticale from wheat and rye.  The modification could be adding genetic material or for example switching off an enzyme that leads to brown bruising in peaches.  GMOs need to be assessed individually, not have a blanket ban thrown over all.
