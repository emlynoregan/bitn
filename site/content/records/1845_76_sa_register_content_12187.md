Bush Fires

A public meeting, not largely attended, was held at Burra Institute on 15 February to consider ways of aiding the fund recently set up to aid sufferers from the late bush fires in the south and southeast.  Mr M. Marks was voted into the chair.

Rev. Whittaker moved that they render every possible assistance and urge the Government to take action with as little delay as possible. He felt that as Burra was second only to Adelaide great things should be done here.  Rev. Flockart seconded.  He knew many of those who had suffered loss, having visited many of the homes now destroyed.  The motion was carried.

Rev. Ibbetson moved that a group of collectors be established and named those collectors.  G.R. Stephens seconded and the motion was carried.  A sub-committee was also established to superintend the arrangements.
