Characteristics of the 1946 Paper.

Page 1.

A couple of large advertisements, but mostly solidly local news.

Page 2.

About 3 columns worth of large advertisments and the advertisements for sales, public notices and entertainment.

Page 3.

Dominated by large advertisments, but also carrying the small Cash Column ads.  Some local news.

Page 4.

Similar to page 3.

In general, compared with the war years, there was much more advertising and, of course, an absence of syndicated war news, information or propaganda.  Local events were well covered.
