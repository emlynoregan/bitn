Fire in Aberdeen.  On Wednesday the wooden shops of Mr T. Harvey were in flames about 3 p.m.  The whole were destroyed in a few minutes.  With difficulty flames were prevented from spreading to his larger shop and dwelling adjoining.  They were saved by a 2â€™ parapet.  Sparks and smoke were carried by a strong wind across the street so for a time it was feared the houses belonging to Mr Ridgway would also be destroyed.  This was averted though trees on the property were scorched - it is feared to death.  The shops had been built some time ago by I.W. Goss who occupied them for a time, but they then became the property of Mr Harvey who had one stocked with groceries, tinware etc., all of which was lost, though we believe insured.  The origin of the fire is a mystery.  Mr Harvey was absent from home for a day or two and Mrs Harvey was in the stone shop at the time.  The lack of either a hydrant or a hose rendered the nearby fireplugs useless.
