Burra Town Council, 2 March

Cr Kuchenmeister sent in his resignation due to financial difficulties.  It was accepted and the fine waived.  The Mayor said that this was the second occasion recently on which a Councillor had resigned for the same reason due to the depression.

[This would appear to be a reference to the resignation of Francis Harris in February 1930, though at the time ill health was cited as the reason.]

Burra Electric Supply Co. wrote that it would not be a party to any alteration in the existing contract for street lights, but in view of the depression would make a % reduction for the year and would light the rotunda free when required.  A letter of thanks will be sent.

Permission was granted for the Returned Soldiers TB Aid Society to hold a badge day, though the Council found itself unable to assist financially this year.

Dr T. B. Ashton wrote asking for a reduction in assessment on his property in the town, as it had depreciated 43%.  He is to be advised Council cannot act now; the appeal court having been held.

The Town Clerk accepted the salary offer made last meeting.

A by-law was adopted to compel hawkers to pay a fee for a stand in town.  Cr Pearce said it would have little effect as it would not apply to door to door sales.

New decking is to be put on the bridge near the old smelts.

The Mayor produced a list of 100 men on rations.  There was only Â£117 to divide.

The Town Clerk said only 50 had registered with him.

Cr Pearce said some names on the list were only boys of 14.  They discussed the question of single men: some of whom were hard up against it.  Rations did not include boots and clothes.

The Mayor said he thought they should stand to the married men, some of whom had several small children.
