The Princess Royal Feedlot.  The concerns raised by John & David Lindner and Graham Whetstone were discussed last Thursday at a conference at the Regional Council of Goyder before Commissioner Green.  This appeal process against the decision of the Regional Council of Goyder’s Development assessment Panel’s decision to approve the feedlot (with conditions) did not lead to a resolution.  The process will now go to the Environment Resource and development Court, where a judge and two Commissioners will hear the appeal.
