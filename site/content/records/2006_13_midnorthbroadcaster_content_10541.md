Burra Railway Station has received a $220,000 grant to begin the restoration and redevelopment of the site.  The handover of the money was announced by the State Environment and Conservation Minister Paul Caica.  The intention was to develop the building as a palaeontology and archaeology museum to showcase fossil remains of the mega fauna discovered at the Redbanks Conservation Park, east of Burra.  A research and educational centre to promote local Ngadjuri culture would also be established at the site.  The whole project would cost $1 million. Pip Edson, as spokesperson for the ‘Save the Railway Station Group’ said that although this was the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work needed to realise the project, it was exciting to finally be able to begin the restoration.  Much work is to be done and it will involve volunteers as well as skilled tradespersons.  The restoration will directly employ 12 skilled contractors and 4 trainees over some 9 months.  Volunteer Roy Taplin will manage the project.  He was at the station early on Friday to clear broken glass and other debris as a result of a vandal attack overnight.  After visiting the station Mr Caica met other interested persons for morning tea at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The heritage listed Station building was erected in 1883 and replaced a wood and iron structure built for the arrival of the line in 1870.  The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line closed in 1988.
