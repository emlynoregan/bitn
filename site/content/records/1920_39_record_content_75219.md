N. Hiles Pearse writes about the recent case of T.H. Eustice and travelling stock.  While having a wholesome regard for the by-laws generally he felt the pathetic features of this particular case deserved a more compassionate hearing.  Having been driven from his normal pasturage by drought and monetary disabilities Eustice sought consideration from Councils on his route westward.  Morgan DC granted freedom of the road, but the autocratic Burra DC replied to his request and predicament with a summons.  Ironically there were still horses, said to be the rangerâ€™s, running at large on the TSR as they were when Eustice was charged.  Huge travelling flocks are a thing of the past.  The TSR in question was almost cut up some time ago.  Not one tenth of the number of even 20 years ago use the Burra-Morgan TSR and a three-chain road would feed the sheep presently using it.  Mr Eustice was not part of the tribe of parasitically inclined loafers who used once to infest the roads.  Had he obtained a drought relief exemption pass as he could and should have done he would not have faced either the fine or the loss of prestige.
