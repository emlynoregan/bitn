Burra Town Council, 16 May

Mr O’Leary & Mr Carmody asked the Council to bear half the cost of removing and re-erecting the gate of the Catholic Church made inaccessible by the recent roadwork.  Council will inspect the site and report at the next meeting.

Crs Rabbich and Dunstan reported on the situation where part of Fore St had been closed and they advised it be reopened and 61’ of adjoining allotment be bought to carry the road up in that direction.  Mr Gray asked £100 for it.  Mr Dunstan Sen. & Mr W. Bentley as agent for H. Nankervis also objected to the closing of this section of Fore St.  Cr Dunstan said they should offer Mr Gray his purchase price, plus the cost of his improvements and the removing of the same together with interest to date.  The section of road to be repurchased should be at valuation.  The whole Council will inspect the site.

Mr Pearse has agreed to level off the embankment on the new piece of road, but has refused to do anymore to the road itself.  Council will inspect it and issue definite instructions.  No payment will be made until the work is completed.

A new complaint against the sexton has resulted in his dismissal.  [See tender notice.]
