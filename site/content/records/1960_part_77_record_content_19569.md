Obituary.  Mr William George Terry, who died suddenly at his home in Burra North on 31 March, was born at Broken Hill 7 January 1902.  He was the eldest son of Mr & Mrs William Terry and moved to Burra in 1911 when Mr Terry Sen. became manager of Sturt Vale Station.  He completed his schooling at Gawler and returned to work at Sturt Vale before taking work with the District Council.  Later he joined the tailoring staff of the late E.C. Hammond, whose business he acquired in 1930 and which he continued in until 1962.  He was active in the town’s sporting activities and in community affairs.  He was a keen bowler and was Burra Bowling Club’s singles champion several times.  He was instrumental in forming the North Eastern Bowling Association and skippered a mixed rink at the recent Easter Tournament to second place, only a few hours before his death.  He was secretary of the Burra Racing Club for some time before ill health forced him to retire.  He is survived by his widow Edith nee Harris, son Jim of Sydney and daughter Val. Mrs John Taylor of Tarlee.  There are four grandchildren.  His two surviving brothers are Jack of Burra and Tom of Adelaide.
