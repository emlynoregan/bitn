Market Square

Following the recent petition the goose-neck poles in Market Square have been removed.  At a meeting of the Burra Burra DC on Monday 9 December plans and an artistâ€™s impression of the square were on display.  Details of alternative lighting and its cost were also displayed.  A public meeting on the matter will be held at the Civic Centre on Thursday 19 December at 8 p.m.  Undergrounding of power lines continues.
