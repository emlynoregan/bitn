BCS was upgraded over the holidays:

A $20,000 upgrade of the eastern end of the Kooringa Building commenced.  (Junior School)

Major computing upgrade was undertaken for the Middle School (Redruth Building) so that all classrooms now have internet cabled computers.

The main computing suite had a $13,000 furniture and cabling upgrade and a further $30,000 was spent on a replacement set of computers for the Junior School.

Replacement desks for the Junior School are on order ($4,500).

DECS has advised that it has allocated a further $250,000 to enable total asbestos roof replacement, air conditioning and heating upgrade and science labs upgrade.  This work will commence in Term 1.

Burra Regional Art Gallery has re-opened [after interior re-painting] with exhibitions by Clifford Firth and Len Bence & Friends.
