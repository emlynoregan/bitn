R.J. Woollacott writes from Victoria Barracks, Windsor on 12 November.

Today took part in arrangements for Lord Robert’s funeral – standing guard in Trafalgar Square.  Not feeling the cold.  Tuesday last to a smoke concert given by the Congregational Church with cigarettes, cakes, buns, coffee and apples.  These are fortnightly shows.  Concerts also given by the Anglicans and political bodies etc., but the Congregational ones are the best.  There are concerts almost every night.  It is very cold in France and Belgium now and wet in the trenches.  We expect to be sent away before Christmas.  [He was in the Coldstream Guards.]
