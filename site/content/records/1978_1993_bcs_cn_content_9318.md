Lower North Schools Athletics Carnival was held at Eudunda.  Unfortunately steady drizzle for most of the day marred the enjoyment.  Burra won 47 of the 97 events.  Rosie Lloyd won the seven events she contested.  Burra ended up about 250 points clear of Kapunda, Riverton and Eudunda to make it four wins in a row.  Notable among the many successful Burra athletes were Graham Kessell (javelin), Paquita Queissner (short sprints and hurdles), Justin Hall (track and javelin), Ian Kleinig, Jo Brooks, Michael Kessell and Brenton Hancock.
