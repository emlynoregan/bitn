Redfire Resources in their last quantity report said the Burra Project consisted of two exploration licences covering more than 1,000 km2 around the Burra Mine and the Mongolata Goldfield.  The Burra Mine [in the 1970s] was an oxide copper deposit that produced 2.7 million tonnes of ore averaging 3% copper.  Past exploration concentrated on copper outcrops south of the town.  To the north the prospective zones are covered by alluvium for some 15 km and this is where Redfire has been looking.  243 surface soil samples have been taken.  Anomalous copper values have been found extending for 700 m and 100 m to 300 m in width, were found1.5 km and 4 km north of the old mine.  Redfire has confirmed that the mineralising system extends to the north of the old mine.  At Mongolata anomalous gold values have been found north of the goldfield.
