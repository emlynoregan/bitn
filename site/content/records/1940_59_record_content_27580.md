Female Labour

Cr Kellaway noted female porters working at Adelaide Railway Station recently: ‘holding down men’s jobs’. 

The subject was discussed at a recent Council meeting and Cr Kellaway went on to say: ‘…it was about time the Government took a strong stand against the employment of such labour and taught these females to become domesticated.’

‘He said that many of them would not be capable mothers when they were married and that lots would burn a kettle of water.’

Council decided to place the subject on the Agenda Paper of the next Mid North Local Government Association meeting.
