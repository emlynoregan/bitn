Local Board of Health.  Tuberculosis.

Dr R.C. Heddle reported a case of chronic tuberculosis.  The patientâ€™s home was later inspected by the Health Inspector Mr E.R. Davey and Health Officer Dr Steven and it was condemned as unfit for human habitation, being dirty and with totally inadequate ventilation.  The owner was ordered to immediately make repairs and alterations.  There are quite a number of substandard houses in the town.
