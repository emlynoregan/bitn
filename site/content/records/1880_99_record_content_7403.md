Obituary and Inquest.  On Monday morning Mr Halliat fell down dead in Mr Batchelor’s shop, Kooringa.  J.D. Cave JP conducted the inquest.

William Batchelor - Deceased came frequently of late, buying books at my father’s shop and had come this morning for the same reason.  I was fetching a book for him when he fell.  Called my father and sent for P-C Johnson and then went for Dr Brummitt.

William Henry Batchelor confirmed the above.

Robert Brummitt said the post mortem revealed extensive disease of one of the valves of the heart, of long standing.

Harriet Smith, wife of James Smith, said she had known the deceased c. 30 years and believed him to be aged c. 64.  He had stayed at the Smith’s the previous night with no signs of ill health. He was on his way home to Lancelot.

P-C John Worthy Johnson gave confirming evidence and said the deceased had

£14-11-3 on him, together with three keys and a train ticket for Terowie, a bundle of clothes and five new books.

The verdict was in accord with Dr Brummitt’s findings.

[No Halliat is registered as dying, but John Hallett died on 11 July of heart disease, aged 64.  He was a farmer of Gumbowie and seems certain to have been the person intended despite the name and date of death being 10 July in the paper.]
