Burra’s 98th Show was a Success.  [If was in fact far short of the 98th Show; The first show was in 1877, but the society had gone into recess from 1886-93 and during WWII 1940-45 and was also cancelled in 1897 and 1914 due to seasonal conditions.]

The 1975 show was a success with gate takings of $856, which compared well with 1974’s $1,046, when it coincided with the Copper festival.  President Ron Shipard introduced Hon. Dr Hopgood to open the event.  Much of the success is due to the Secretary Mr Darrell Field.  Entries were good, especially in Horses in Action, Wool, Fruit & Vegetables, Flowers and Birds.  The Sheep Pavilion was full.  Dogs were re-introduced and attracted good entries.  The food and drink stalls have been updated.  The display of modern farming equipment was bigger and better than ever.  In the Miss Show Girl Contest the Open Winner was Miss Susan Kotz of Burra, the Junior Winner was Susan Towle and the Sub-Junior Winner was Janet Durling.
