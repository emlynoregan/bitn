West Burra Copper Mine.  5th Half-yearly Meeting: Saturday last at Burra Institute.

While no large body of payable ore has been found, some rich bunches have been found at both the 50’ and the 100’ levels with some samples of high grade.  The winze has been sunk to the 100’ level and workings are now well ventilated.  The half year cost of work and management was £226-5-0 and the company is in credit £360-9-0.  So far drives and crosscuts total 473’.  The shaft is at 152’ and winze of 38’.  It may be advisable to send a parcel of 10-20 tons for smelting as copper is now at a very high price.  The proposal is to test the width of the lode at 100’ and sink a winze on the course of lode to water level.  Confidence was expressed in the directors.
