Characteristics of the 1940 paper.

The format was a broadsheet 8 columns wide.

Page 1.

There were three or four large local advertisements, but most space was occupied by news and often from July the Burra & District Honour Roll, though its position does sometimes vary.  The news is heavily weighted toward patriotic efforts and increasingly presentations to departing soldiers take considerable space.

Page 2.

Advertisements are mostly of sales, entertainment, patriotic events and public notices.  There are three or four large local advertisements.  News quantity varies, but about half the page is common.

Page 3.

Three or so large local advertisements.  Both here and on other pages the ‘news’ is mixed with other articles that are often war related.  They include actual stories from the war and propaganda against the Germans, Italians or Japanese, but also articles on war production, weapons, equipment and advice on what to do for greater car efficiency, use of gas producers, and on matters like air raid precautions and blackout requirements etc.

Page 4.

Half of it is often about advertising and frequently carries the rainfall figures from 1880-1940.  Although it often carries some local news and sometimes the conclusion of the main article from page 1, more general war related articles as mentioned above, are not unusual.

In general it seems to give a good coverage of activities in the district for the year, but there are some anomalies and omissions.  For example the Diggers’ Cupboard Fund gets casual mention, but no real explanation.
