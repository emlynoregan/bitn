‘Engineer’ writes commenting on the Mayor’s claim that ‘It would lower the dignity of the Council to take notice of anything in the Press’.  This was in reference to Mr Morgan’s letter on rubbish.  But last year the Engineer drew their attention to the sale of Burra Creek land and urged the Council to act to acquire some and they clearly did take notice.
