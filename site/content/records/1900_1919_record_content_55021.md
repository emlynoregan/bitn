Editorial on: The Burra Hospital.

The Board is wrestling with the problem of the reduction in Government subsidy.  In the 12 years to 1915 the upkeep was £18,000 and only £900 or 5% came from paying patients and donations.  Recent experience suggests that many of the patients knew a good thing when they saw it and were actually in a position to pay, which was surely unfair to those who did pay.  The difficulty is to get those who can afford it to pay while [not?] depriving the needy of free access.  At present the scheme most in favour is to supply each member of the Board with admission tickets.  A person who needs admission and is unable to pay, or can only pay part, will explain this to one member of the Board, who can then issue an admission ticket.  This would not prevent immediate admission to urgent cases without question.
