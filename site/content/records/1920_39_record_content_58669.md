Obituary.  John V. Lord died at his residence in Kingswood on Sunday aged 73.  He was a very successful pioneer pastoralist of SA and the Broken Hill district.  He was well known in Burra.  His parents, Mr & Mrs John Lord, came from Cornwall, but J.V. Lord was born at Callington SA.  As a young man he lived in Kooringa with his parents in one of the minersâ€™ cottages almost opposite the Masonic Hall.  Later he kept a store at the Pinnacles near Broken Hill, before the silver-lead mines were discovered there.  With little money at his disposal, he took up a block of 10,000 acres of virgin country he called Silverdale.  He was successful on this small block and later acquired all the country around it, consolidating it into one fairly large station.  In 1904 he took over an abandoned station east of Burra, known as Pine Valley and he converted this into a thriving station.  His next station was Oakvale, previously owned by Mr Cudmore, which he purchased in 1909 and in 1911 he acquired Wondervale, adjoining his original 10,000 acres in the Broken Hill district.

He left the Broken Hill district in 1912 and one of his sons carried on the station there.  He then purchased Sandergrove Estate near Strathalbyn, but sold it in 1924.  He purchased Thackaringa Station, adjoining Silverdale, in 1923 and formed the partnership J.V. Lord & Sons.  He next bought Kalkaroo Station, formerly a portion of Boolcoomatta Station, north of the Cockburn line.  In the past few years he has lived at Kingswood while maintaining an active interest in his station properties and visiting them frequently.  A few weeks ago while visiting Pine Valley Station he was taken seriously ill.  The trouble was then with his heart and other complications.  He married Miss Mary Ann Baker, a daughter of Mr Samuel Baker of Redruth.  He is survived by his widow, six sons and two daughters: H.V. Lord [Harold Vivian] (Pine Valley), Hurtle Lord (Silverdale), Percy Lord (Thackaringa), Sylvester Lord (Kalkaroo), T.L. Lord [Thomas Leslie] (Oakvale), Eric Lord (Oakvale), Miss A. Lord [Alice] (Kingswood) and Miss M. Lord [Mabel] (Kingswood.)  [Born 30 December 1862 Callington: died 24 November 1935 Kingswood.]
