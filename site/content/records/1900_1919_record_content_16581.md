The Record reporter paid a visit to the mine and the reporter suggests that the Manager, Mr Pryor, was not very happy about the report in the paper the previous week.  He said they were pumping out the water so why the gloomy response.  He did not agree with the dire predictions attendant upon ceasing tributing work.  The Record accused him of hugging the old works.  Mr Pryor asked how he could get clear of them.  The reporter suggested that if he had to answer that he would want Mr Pryorâ€™s pay.
