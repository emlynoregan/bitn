Since the boundary would have to be defined before any petition could be signed, a meeting is called in a fortnight to determine the area of Leighton Ward to be included in a transfer.  A petition in conformity with the Local Government Act will be prepared incorporating any change decided on at the Leighton meeting.  It was expected that any change would take several months to be approved and put into effect.
