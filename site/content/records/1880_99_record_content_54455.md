Letter from Pyap Village Assoc. Seeing that the people of Kooringa and neighbourhood are collecting for the benefit of this settlement, I thought perhaps they would like to know a little about us and our ways.  The settlement comprises about 350 men, women and children working in co-operation.  It is managed by five trustees elected annually.  The revenue comes from improving the land on which the Government has lent 5% of its total value.  All are living in tents since arriving four months ago.  235 acres have been cleared and grubbed.  60 acres are planted in wheat and 14 in potatoes and vegetables.  Several thousand almond, peach, apricot and rooted vines and an enormous quantity of vine cuttings are being planted as quickly as possible.  Rabbit proof fencing has been erected.  We have an irrigation pump capable of delivering 300 gallons per minute, and a saw bench.  The great wants are horses and dairy cattle to provide an income while the vines and trees grow, also sheep and pigs.
