Burra Town Council, 4 April

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club was given permission to erect a club shed on oval property through the southern wall and to plant trees and shrubs and improve the area.

A hole in the netting of Gully’s Wharf Bridge [i.e. the Burra North Swing Bridge] is to be repaired.

A previous motion had been passed to have the name of E.R. Davey removed from the Town Clerk’s Honour Roll.

Crs Fisher and Cornelius moved to have all names removed, as those concerned had been paid servants.  Carried.

[Given that the roll is still there in the Town Hall in 2014, this resolution does not appear to have been put into effect.  See also comment at 90, 3, 26 January 1960, page 1.]

Resolved that a carpet runner be obtained for the dress circle stairways and from the doorway to the stage in the main hall.  Quotes were of £59 and £35.  Also that winding gear be obtained for masking the screen for pictures.  Quote £48.  Carried.
