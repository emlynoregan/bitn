Early Closing Meeting in the Institute Lodge Room last Thursday.

The Mayor said there would need to be a petition signed by at least 10% of electors to bring the town under the Early Closing Act.  If a larger counter-petition were lodged a poll would be needed.  The area of application would have to be defined.  Murray Bridge for example had taken in two adjacent Hundreds.

Mr Crewes moved the adoption of the Early Closing Act for Burra and Mr Lowe 2nd.

Mr Wicklein wanted the area to include World’s End, Booborowie & Leighton.

[Selling from vans was one concern expressed.]

Mr Crewes said their vans came in on Friday and van men would enjoy the Saturday half-holiday.

Mr Wicklein then changed his motion to include the Hundreds of Ayers, Hallett, Kingston, Baldina and Kooringa.  2nd A.D. McLaren.

N. Pearce was for closure by mutual consent rather than by invoking the Act and Mr Treloar agreed.
