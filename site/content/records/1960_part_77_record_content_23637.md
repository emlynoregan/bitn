Mt Bryan Methodist Church held its harvest festival on Sunday 28 February.  A dedication service was held when Mr Horrie Edwards and family presented a lectern and Bible to the church in memory of their late husband and father.  Mr Edwards had been a local preacher in the circuit for over 40 years.  He was a member of the Order of Knights and Sunday school Superintendent for many years at the old church.  Mr George Goodridge and Mrs Crew presented to the church an engraved music stand in memory of Mrs Goodridge who started teaching in the Sunday school of the old church when she was 17 and continued till she moved to Ironmine in 1906.  She then taught there for five years.  She married in 1911 and again took a Sunday school class and with her brother Horrie worked in the Sunday school till the church closed in 1939.  Both Mr Edwards and Mrs Goodridge also worked in the Town Church and Sunday school for many years.
