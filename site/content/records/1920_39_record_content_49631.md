A deputation from Kooringa Tennis Club said the Council owned the land on which the club had its courts and it wished to purchase the land.  Ten years ago the block on the edge of the creek was a waste plot and the club had spent £500-£600 on building it up and installing two asphalt courts.  There were 3 or 4 years of a 15 year lease to run.  In view of their expenditure the club sought certainty of tenure.  Mr Potter supported Mr Bednall in the request.

Cr Bevan asked whether they would support a 99-year lease like the Aberdeen Tennis club – he was strongly against Sunday tennis and felt that might be at the back of the move.

Mr Bednall said such had not been discussed.  Financial inputs were hard to get without security of tenure.  Mr Bednall was prepared to give his personal assurance concerning Sunday tennis and believed the majority of members would not take advantage of the position to play Sunday tennis.

Cr Dow wondered who would fix the price.

Mr Bednall felt the Council should sell for the value it was before it was improved.

They could sell because it was not parkland, but had been bought from the Mining Co.

The decision was deferred for a fortnight.
