Weather.  Clare had 2 1/14 inches [fraction unclear] of rain on Monday, which damaged wheat in the fields.  At Redruth floods destroyed the ford, which had been greatly damaged by a flood a few weeks earlier.

Redruth Bridge is in a fearful state with a hole in the middle at least four feet square.  Strangely no steps have been taken to caution travellers.
