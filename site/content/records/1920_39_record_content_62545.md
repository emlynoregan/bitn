Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 1 August.

Work has been temporarily suspended in the tunnel in favour of that at the north end of Farnden’s Hill.  Opening up a vault a little north of Hogan’s Shaft.  From this we obtained 25 tons of c. 4 dwt dirt, which will pay for the operation.

Renovated Hogan’s Shaft and timbered near the bottom.  Will crosscut east from the 58 ft level to try to pick up the lode being worked in the open cut.

Open Cut – Drive north was extended to 23 ft on an ore body 8 inches wide.  10 tons of ore at grass.
