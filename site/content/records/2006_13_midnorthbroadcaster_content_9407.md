Gold Discovery.  Archer Exploration, the copper, gold and uranium explorer, will undertake a new wave of sampling in the Mid North next month following the discovery of surface samples grading up to and above 6 grams per tonne of gold near Burra.  Chairman of Archer, Greg English said samples from their Watervale Prospect at North Burra were encouraging. Quartz vein samples had recorded 3.84 g/t and 6.42 g/t.  The site for the North Burra exploration licence is 43 km NNE of Burra.
