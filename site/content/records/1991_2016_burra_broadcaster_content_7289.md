Burra Burra DC

The Department of Road Transport is to be approached to assist the Council with funding the maintenance of part of the heavy vehicle by-pass at Burra North.

Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club is asking the Council to reconsider leasing arrangements at Aberdeen Oval or to permit the erection of a clubhouse.  Cr Adrian Gill will discuss the matter with the club and Leighton Cricket Club.

The draft amendment to the Supplementary Development Plan with respect to possible new industrial allotments is approved for public exhibition.

Details of the total works program and other budget matters are printed in some detail.

Council has budgeted for a $51,000 cash deficit, with income of $2,462,521 and expenditure of $2,650,699.  Council expects to use $78,000 of its cash reserves to cover some of the expected increase in costs and there will be a 4% rate increase.
