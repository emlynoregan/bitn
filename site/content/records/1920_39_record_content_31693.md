Burra Town Council, 9 August

There was further concern about fruit hawkers in the town.

Cr Allen moved a by-law be framed to charge hawkers 10/- a year.  Cr Woollacott pointed out it would take some years of revenue to pay for drafting it.  The Town Clerk said it would cost c. £5.  The motion was withdrawn.

The Mayor said he had ordered a copy of the ‘Menin Gate’ painting and had collected about half the money in donations.

M. Collins MHR wrote saying he had passed on the request that the Geophysical Survey Party should visit Burra and look over the mine site.

The Minister of Defence would give all advice re an aerodrome, but the Government had no money to spend on such.

J.S.R. Oborn writes saying that suggestions re school work at the Show were forwarded to the secretary as soon as the annual meeting was advertised.  Various committee men have told us that a meeting of teachers would be called to revise the prize list.  It was not done and we have taken the stand we have as the only means of bringing our requests prominently before the committee.

Burra Rifle Club visited Eudunda on Saturday.

Burra 603 drew with Eudunda 603.
