Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs John Pearce of Leighton House Kooringa has been celebrated.  Mrs Pearce was born in Chapel St 2 January 1850, the third daughter of Mr & Mrs Francis Symons and she has lived here all her life except for a few months as a five-year-old spent on the Ballarat goldfield – during which time she gained her faint recollections of the Eureka Stockade, which occurred while she was there.  Mr Pearce was born at Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire 22 June 1851 and arrived in SA in 1859 on the Marion with his parents and came to Burra in a spring dray.  After school he worked with his father who owned a saw mill and carpentry and joinery business.  On his father’s death he took over the business.  He built the first house in Terowie and in Yarcowie and retired about two years ago.  He married in 1870 and in 1873 went to live in Aberdeen, moving back to Kooringa in 1880.  There were 14 children of whom 12 are living: Edgar & Clem (Burra), Alfred, Norman & Oswald (Adelaide), Mesdames P. Milner (Adelaide), A.S. Dearlove (Ketchowla) & the Misses A., C., G., L. & T. Pearce of Kooringa.  All except Norman attended the celebrations.  The wife and two children of the eldest son, the late Frank Pearce, also attended and all but one of the grandchildren.  Mr Pearce was organist at Kooringa Wesleyan Church.  He never at any time took part in public matters.
