Signposts may be restored in some areas following representations from the RAA about the one at Black Springs.  Their lack is causing a waste of fuel and tyres.  The letters of signs must not be over 4‚Äù high and signs must be easily removable.  The names of important and strategic centres are listed and they must not appear on any road sign.
