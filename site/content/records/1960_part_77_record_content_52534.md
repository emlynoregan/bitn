The Bon Accord site is situated at the junction of the North and North-East Roads and is Â¾ mile from Kooringa, with which it is connected by a good metal road.  There are no allotments on the site which would have to be purchased and it is the nearest possible site to the Burra Mine, with which it could be connected by an inexpensive tramway.  There is an abundance of splendid water and it is central to the freehold townships of Copperhouse, Hampton, Nelson and half a dozen others yet to be built on.  Its nearness to the Government Township of Redruth means business may be diverted from Kooringa, but the experience from other stations in SA suggests they do not become the best business sites.
