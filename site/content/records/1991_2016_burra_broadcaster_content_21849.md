MIM Exploration is planning to drill a number of holes near Burra next month in a continuing search for copper.  This will follow up anomalies found in a geo-physical survey in 1999.  Drilling will take place on Eberhard’s ‘Mullaby’ and the properties of Peter Stockman, A. & P. Stockman and J. & M. Tiver.  The holes could be as deep as 200 metres.
