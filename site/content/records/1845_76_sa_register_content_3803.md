Obituary/Inquest.  W. Wyatt, coroner, held an inquest on 21 July at the ‘Golden Phœnix’ near the Yatala Smelting Works on the body of Jesse Sydenham, a bullock driver aged 10½.  Edmund Sydenham, son of George Sydenham and brother of the deceased, said he was driving his team two drays behind that of the deceased on the previous Monday, on the road from Yatala to Burra Burra.  Seeing the team jump on one side, he stopped his own team and went forward.  He found the deceased lying on the ground.  The dray wheel had passed over him, but he was not dead.  Witness went to the smelting works for a doctor, but when he returned Jesse was dead.  It was the first time the deceased was in sole charge of a team, though he had been with them before.  When they had started out deceased had been sitting on the front rail of the dray with his feet on the pole.

Dr E. Davey had seen the deceased about noon lying on a sofa in Mr Nocks’s house.  The marks on the body suggested the wheel had passed over the body obliquely from his right hip to the left side of his chest.  He attributed death to internal injuries from this event.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death and drew the attention of the Government to the need for legislation to prevent the employment of children of a tender age from driving bullock-drays or other vehicles, which they are evidently incompetent to manage. Edward Sydenham was 19 and we noted he was unable to write his name and made his mark on the deposition.

[Jesse Sydenham died 20 August 1849 aged 10 years 6 months.  Residence Reed Beds.  The Edmund/Edward confusion of his brother’s name reflects the report in the Register.]
