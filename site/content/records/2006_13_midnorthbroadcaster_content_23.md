BCS will soon have a new multi-purpose shed located near the staff carpark.  It will house improved facilities for vocational training.  The school will fund about half the $100,000 cost and the Federal Government’s ‘Investing in Our Schools Program’ will contribute significantly.  The five bays of the new shed will offer:

Technical studies storage

A groundsman’s store

An automotive area

Industrial arts section

A multi-purpose area for special projects.

The school also intends to overhaul its science laboratories, which have some occupational health and safety issues, due to their age.
