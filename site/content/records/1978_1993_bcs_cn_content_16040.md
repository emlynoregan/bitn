BCS.  Staff Profile: Kerry Jones

I am teaching Drama and English this year.  I am originally from Mt Gambier.  In my short time here I have toured the town extensively and am intrigued by its historical aspects.  I am particularly enthusiastic about teaching Drama and look forward also to enjoyable interaction with the community.
