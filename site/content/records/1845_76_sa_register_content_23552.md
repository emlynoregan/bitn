The Burra Railway will be formally opened today as announced in Saturdayâ€™s issue.  The train of invited guests will depart at 7 a.m., but the ordinary one will be allowed to precede it.  Provision has been made for 500, but it is feared that this accommodation will hardly be sufficient.  Not only will a large number assemble at the Adelaide Terminus, but accessions are expected along the route.  The lavish hospitality of Kooringa folks will certainly be put to the test.
