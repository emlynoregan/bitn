Saddleworth & District Historical Society has acquired a thrashing roller donated by Otto Pfitzner and his son Roy of Tarnma.  Over 100 years ago some German settlers of Friedrichswalde (Tarnma since 1918) felled a huge red gum 23 feet long and over 4 feet in diameter.  In its green state Mr Bob Noye has estimated it weighed ten tons and seven tons when dry.  For months they worked on the log chipping away about five tons with hand tools to leave the two ton roller we see today.  It is a long tapered object with fluted sides.  It was fastened to a pole at its pointed end and rolled in a circle by two horses harnessed to a spindle on the larger end.  Large quantities of wheat could be threshed with a fraction of the effort of hand flailing.  Wally and Darryl Baldwin transported the item to Saddleworth, where it will be treated with preservative and mounted on a concrete base by the Institute.
