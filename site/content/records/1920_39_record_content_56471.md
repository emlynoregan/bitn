SA Stockowners’ Assoc. Burra Branch, AGM was held on Friday.

The guest of honour was Mr Sutton, the General President, who had come from Mt Gambier and had just opened the Burra Wool Exhibition.  The Branch President, I.J. Warnes, presided and reported on a hard year for graziers.  Wool prices had recently risen, but most producers had already sold their wool.  The price was still too low to be viable.  Railway freight was still too costly.  These conditions plus a drought made for hard times.  Spring rains had brought grass, but also a plague of grasshoppers and now the country was subject to drifting dust.  [Mr Warnes then went on to speak at some length on taxation changes, shipping freights, Alsatian dogs, export of meat, the grazing of stock routes, sheep stealing, a proposed duty on skin wool in England, the bounty on wild dog scalps, the Monday lamb market, a levy for pastoral research, railway freights and the registration of vehicles used solely on pastoral properties.]  M.S. Edwards continues as secretary and I.J. Warnes was re-elected branch President.
