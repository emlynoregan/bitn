Cantata.  Next Sunday at the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School Anniversary a performance will be given of G.F. Root & H. Butterworth’s Cantata The Choicest Gift.  There will be an orchestra of 20 and it is said by many to be better that the same composers’ Under the Palms which was presented to acclaim about two years ago.
