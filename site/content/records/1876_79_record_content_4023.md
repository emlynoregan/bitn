Burra Corp. A letter to the Ed. says that the Overseer of Works [Mr F.W. Holder] says that the work in Lower Thames St is done, but we say it is worse than ever, especially in front of the Pig and Whistle. At Ohlmeyer's Corner a person crossing Lower Thames St has to go down a dry stone wall from 2'6" to 3' high!
