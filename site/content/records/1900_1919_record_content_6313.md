John Lines was charged on the information of Charles Ullmann, baker, with being unlawfully on the latter’s premises on the night of 29 August.  John Lines and James Knevitt entered Ullmann’s bakehouse in Kingston St and asked for a loaf of bread.  Ullmann said he didn’t have a loaf, but would give them a piece.  They then entered his bedroom and bread and a candle were thrown at him and one of the two then assaulted him.  Panes of his window were broken and later he noticed some buns and a white pudding were missing.

Lines was given 2 months plus 1 month for hindering police in their duty.

James Knevitt was similarly charged and was sentenced to 1 month for being unlawfully on premises, 10/- or 7 days for being drunk, £1 + 15/- costs or 14 days for indecent language and £3 or 1 month for assaulting police.
