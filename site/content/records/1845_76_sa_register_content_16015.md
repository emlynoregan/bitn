Kooringa News, 22 October

The Wesleyan Chapel here celebrated its Anniversary last Sunday.  Rev. J. Watsford of Adelaide preached three sermons.  There was a very fair congregation despite the cold drizzling rain throughout the day.  The weather was much better on the following day for the tea meeting in the schoolroom and the attendance was correspondingly greater.  [Proceedings at this meeting are then reported in some detail.]

A meeting was called at the Court House Hotel for electors to select a candidate for the coming election, but there was so little interest that nothing was accomplished.

In the past week large quantities of wool have passed through the town en route to Kapunda and Adelaide.

Mr Whitford, whose accident was reported last week, is getting on as well as could be expected.

Accident.  Henry Skewes, a colt breaker and resident here, was struck today by lightning near Clare.  His horse dropped dead beneath him and he lies in a very precarious condition.

The weather has been most variable throughout the week.
