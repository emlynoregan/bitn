Grasshoppers invaded the town in the last week and swarmed on bowling greens and croquet lawns as well as badly damaging gardens.  At Baldina the flying mass near Mr C.H. Mann’s home on Wednesday sounded like an aeroplane overhead.  At Tom Goodridge’s at Gum Creek they stripped all the green stuff.  At Mt Bryan the wheat was advanced enough not to interest them, but they stripped gardens and attacked the lucerne.
