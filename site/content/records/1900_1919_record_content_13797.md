The Farmers & Producers Union polled their members and they generally supported Messrs Jenkins, Rounsevell, & Grant.  The local branch favoured Messrs Rounsevell, O’Loughlin & Miller and many will follow that despite the general vote.  This will undermine the unity of the movement and threaten the result, possibly resulting in the defeat of Messrs Miller and O’Loughlin.
