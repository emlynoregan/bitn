Mr Andrew Tennant said the FFCF was similarly controlled in what it could spend funds on.

The chairman thought it would be good for the Show Committee to help the Red Cross effort.

The Burra Show Ground is to be offered to the Commonwealth for the duration of the war, if they so desired it.

Election of officers for the Show War Committee: Patron, T.H. Woollacott; President, I.J. Warnes; Chairman, A.B. Riggs; Sec., M.S. Edwards.

Mr Riggs said they had so far received £441.

Mrs Tennant said the ambulance fund stood at £107 and the amount needed would be about £700.

The Show Committee resolved to donate £100 to the Red Cross Ambulance Appeal.

They also donated £20 to each of: Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Leighton, Hanson and Farrell’s Flat Red Cross Circles.

Patriotic Social at Copperhouse School on 15 June successfully raised funds for the school’s Patriotic Fund.
