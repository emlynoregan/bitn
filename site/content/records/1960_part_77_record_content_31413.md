The Market Square Museum Opening

Proceedings began with a small procession of horse drawn vehicles and Mr Les Warnes in his Newton Bennet car c. 1910 vintage.  Mr Bob Radford drove the governess cart from Princess Royal, Mal Kellock drove a buggy and Mr Arnold Heinrich drove a cart.  [Official guests were as listed in last weekâ€™s paper.]

Several people spoke before Mr Shard declared the Museum open.

Mr Baulderstone said that for quite a while the old jinker had been parked in a corner of the Wayville Showgrounds and had been returned to Burra through the efforts of the Town Council, to be housed now near the National Trust Museum.

Mr Tennant said that Mr H.C .Morphett, a past president of the National Trust had come to Burra in about 1963 and following his visit a meeting was called to see if a branch could be formed here.  The museum was a modest beginning to look after items of past years before they were lost forever.  Mr Tennant thanked all those who had donated items.  Mr Shard spoke of the National Trust in general and its expanding role in the preservation of the past.  Afternoon tea in the Town Hall followed an inspection of the Museum.
