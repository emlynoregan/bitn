Girls’ Citizen Club was formed in September under Miss D. Jones of Burra High School and a member of YWCA associated with Redruth Methodism.  There is a senior and a junior section. On 11 December a fellowship banquet was organised for a visiting member of YWCA Miss Yuli Kamuri, but ill health forced her to cancel on Monday, though the banquet went ahead with Mrs J.S.W. Coles, Mrs E. Lawson & Mrs E.A. Haese as guests.  The induction service for the club was carried out by Miss Glasson representing the National Board of the YWCA from Adelaide, who conducted the Sunday evening service at the church.
