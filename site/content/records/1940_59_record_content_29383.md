Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society is soliciting donations to purchase a hand propelled invalid chair to be the property of the society.  The appeal is in the interests of Mr C.J. Lomman, born in the district and often to be seen in our streets in a chair that is difficult to propel.  An almost new chair can be obtained for £37-10-0.  £5-5-0 has so far been received.
