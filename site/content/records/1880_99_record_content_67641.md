Court.

John Ford was fined 10/- + costs for keeping a pig about his premises.

Ernest Crewes writes a letter urging support for the Transvaal Patriotic Fund.  Money will be used to aid the sick and wounded soldiers in the war.

The Editor adds – ‘this is not a case of philanthropy, but the duty of every British subject to give their mite towards assisting the brave men, who are now engaged in the biggest struggle that has taken place for some time fighting for the honour of old England’.
