The Burra-Morgan Road

The sealing project for the Burra-Morgan Road was officially opened by the Minister of Transport and Urban Planning, Diana Laidlaw.  Councils had been lobbying for the sealed road for about sixty years.  The Minister unveiled a plaque.

The Road building and sealing was undertaken by L.R.M. Constructions and overseen by Luigi Rossi of the Department of Road Transport.  At one point the road was closed for seven months to speed up the process.  The dry winter in 1997 may not have pleased farmers, but helped to bring the project in early and under budget.  Already traffic on the road has increased.  Burra traders are commenting on the number of buses using it as well as truckers, holidaymakers and boating enthusiasts.  It is part of the shortest east-west route across Australia.  The opening was also marked by a Bicycle Blitz.  Eighty breakfasts were served on the banks of the Burra Creek at Burra before Graham Gunn flagged off the first two riders – Brian Thamm and Ivan Venning (Member for Schubert) at 8.30 a.m.  In all 137 riders participated.  The ride went to ‘The Gums’ for the official opening of the road by the Minister, Hon. Diana Laidlaw and then continued on to Morgan, where prizes were presented.  The first solo finisher was Kathy Bruce, the first senior team was Peterborough Football Club and the first junior team was Goyder Student Boarding Hostel.  Some fundraising during the ride meant that $569 will be split between Burra and Morgan ambulance Units.
