Letter.  Barbara Frances of Burra writes criticising the organisers of the Governor General’s visit for bringing caterers from Clare to provide the luncheon.

The editor then explained that the Governor General had originally intended only a fleeting visit to Burra, before moving on to the Clare valley.  The organisers had negotiated to extend his stay in Burra by several hours by bringing the Clare valley to him.
