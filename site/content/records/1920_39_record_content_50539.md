Obituary.  Miss Margaret O’Leary who died at her residence 13 April was the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John O’Leary of Kooringa.  She was born in England and came to Burra with her parents since when she has lived here all her life.  The only surviving member of the family is Miss Mary O’Leary.  [Margaret Agnes O’Leary died 15 April 1934 at Kooringa aged 80.  This corrects the earlier error re the surviving sister, but if the earlier statement is true that death occurred on Sunday, then that was the 15th.]
