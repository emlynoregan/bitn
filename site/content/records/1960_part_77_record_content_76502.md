The Council has no present intentions of cutting its workforce.

The Golf clubhouse is almost finished and has now to be paid for – though half comes from grants and much from the club itself.

REDS work has taken funds that will later be repaid.

An appeal for funds from the National Estate has been forwarded to the Government to enable completion of the restoration of the Powder Magazine and work on the Bon Accord Mine Engineer’s Shop, along with further work on the dugouts, Brewery Cellars and Redruth Gaol.

Local Ladies on the Melbourne Cup Fund Raising Committee have offered to help contribute towards a new piano for the Town Hall.
