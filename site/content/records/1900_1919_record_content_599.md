When the Burra Mounted Rifles disbanded their surplus money was given to the Burra Defence Rifle Club to be fired for by those who have completed the class firing.  There are now five 1st class marksmen, two 2nd class marksmen and 29 3rd class marksmen.  Half will be fired for by the first two groups and half by the 3rd class group.
