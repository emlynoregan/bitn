Weather of late has been hot and sultry and though rains in the year have been timely none has penetrated the subsoil and so crops seemed to be visibly wilting when a thunderstorm on Sunday brought good falls.  Burra got 99 points and Leighton 120, but although falls extended to the east, they were patchy and varied from 35 to 160 with most in the range 40-90 points.
