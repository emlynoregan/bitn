Inquest into the death of Johann Gottlieb Przibilla who was found drowned in a waterhole on Gum Creek Station on 11 May 1902.  The deceased was aged 57 and was identified by his son Henry Christian Przibilla.  On 9 May they were taking a team from Farrell’s Flat to Yongala and the deceased took a short cut while the informant and his brother took the team around by the road.  He had taken this short cut before.  He reported his father missing when he did not turn up at Canowie, 23 miles from Gum Creek, where they camped for the night.  The police dragged the waterhole after finding his hat by it.  Evidence from Martin William Przibilla – son of the deceased of Yongala and Christian Julius Przibilla of Farrell’s Flat attested to their father’s state of mind.  Police evidence also supported accidental falling into the creek and drowning, which was the jury’s verdict.

[Registered as Johan Gottleib Przibilla died 9 May 1902 aged 57.]
