Zac, Burra Hospital’s Pets for Therapy black Labrador, has retired to Hyde’s household in Gawler, at the age of eleven years.  He had been at Burra hospital since May 1995.  Thanks to Pauline Venning for tending to Zac’s needs over the years and to Wesfarmer Dalgety for generous donations of tinned and dried dog food over the three years.  Thanks too to Goyder House students and others who walked Zac regularly.
