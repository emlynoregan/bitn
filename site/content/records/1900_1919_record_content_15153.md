Telegraph Changes.

With the telegraph work of the railways to be done away with it is proposed that a messenger from the Kooringa Post Office is to meet the train four times a day to take delivery of telegrams for distribution in the town.  This would considerably hamper the telegraphic department of the Kooringa Post Office as the messenger would be absent from there for three hours a day and would also have to be on guard from 6.30 a.m. to all hours at night.  This is unworkable and is sure to raise protests.
