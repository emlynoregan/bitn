Burra Picnic Race Club held its AGM on 6 July.  Retiring President John Oates said that although numbers attending were slightly down on 1998, this yearâ€™s race day was successful and the gymkhana events were very well patronised and the sleepy lizard derby created a lot of fun.  The new shelter for barbecue caterers by Bob and Reva Cullen was a real asset.  The increase of $1,300 in the bank account compared with this time last year will allow donations to the Kidney Foundation and local clubs.  Elected: President, C. Taylor; Vice-President, A. Moore; Secretary, Reva Cullen & Treasurer, Barb Nesbitt.
