Eastern Road: the Burra District Council petitioned the Midland Road board to declare the Kooringa-Nankivell’s Gully Road a Scheduled Main Road. This would allow both end of the town to be serviced. A detailed description of the route is given. The Board deferred any decision.

On 22 June Hon. John Colton, Commissioner of Public Works visited the area with his secretary, & Chairman of the Midland Road Board & the Board's Superintendent-Surveyor, to decide the vexed question. They were met by P. Lane (Mayor), & Messrs Butterworth, Ridgway, Stewart, Preece, Tiver & others. After a lunch with councillors at the Commercial Hotel they proceeded to the junction of the Bright and Baldina Roads, 50 or 60 chains short of the proposed deviation. They proceeded on foot as far as Nankivell’s where they rejoined their vehicles and were driven to the railway station by way of the old road via the Smelting Works. To fill in an hour they visited the Burra-Hallett railway works before leaving by the evening train.
