Burra Hospital Board, meeting 28 May

Nurse Wallace refused to take over the Matron’s duties when the latter’s time expired on 19 May – ‘under the circumstances’.  [There is no mention of Sister Johnson who was earlier reported to have been appointed to the position.]

Matron’s solicitors have returned the cheque for £27 handed to her on 19 May.

Various financial matters are reported, but further discussion was held in committee.
