The Lutheran Church.  The Mission Festival at Westbury Methodist Church on 20 August will be the first for the Lutheran Church at Copperhouse.  They have now taken over the church from the Redruth Methodist Circuit and will hold regular services there.  (See advertisement for details.)  Pastor Hoopman founded the Lutheran congregation at Booborowie 25 years ago and when he was transferred Pastor Harms took his place and served for seven or eight years.
