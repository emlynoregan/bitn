Leighton Basketball Club has been disbanded.  It had been formed on 4 May 1946 and with the Spalding, Hallett and Booborowie Clubs formed the North-Eastern Basketball Association.  They played on a ground at the Leighton Recreation Ground, which had been already graded for a tennis court.  The Leighton team was premier in its first year.  Nelda Bruce (Kleinig) was Club President 1946-55.  Elvyn Collins took over for 1956-58 and 1966-68.

In 1956 permission was given to play on asphalt courts at the Recreation Ground.  Jacie Bruce was President 1959-61 when Mr F. Goodridge became President.  Due to lack of players the club went into recess until 1963, when it entered a team in ‘C’ Grade in the North-Eastern Association.  In 1965 & 1966 ‘B’ and ‘C’ Grade teams were entered.  In 1967 ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Grade teams played.  In 1968 ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ Grade teams were fielded and three teams continued to play until 1973.

Amalgamation with Booborowie and Hallett was discussed in 1972, but it was decided to continue.

Circumstances prevented it entering teams in the North-Eastern Association in 1974 and it then joined the Stanley Netball Association and in 1974 entered two teams.  The senior of these was premier in ‘C’ Grade in 1975.  The Stanley and Mid-North Associations amalgamated in 1976 and distances became too great.  The players joined the United Club.
