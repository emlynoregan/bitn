Unsafe Housing.  One of SAMA’s houses in Stock Street, Kooringa, collapsed on Wednesday afternoon.  The roof fell completely in.  It was occupied by Mr Rogers, a blind man, but fortunately no one was at home when it occurred.  There are several other ‘rookeries’ which the authorities should have a look at before someone is buried alive.
