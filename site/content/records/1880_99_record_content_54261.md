Court.

Edwin Boulton was in court for the third time in a short period.

Once charge was that with Charles Schutz Jun. they had held up the baker’s van by shouting ‘Whoa’ at the horse.  This was dismissed on a technicality.

There was a charge of using indecent language in a public place which cost him 10/- plus 15/- costs.

He was also charged with using threatening language towards L-Cpl Thomas, but the witness got so confused in the box that the charge was dismissed.
