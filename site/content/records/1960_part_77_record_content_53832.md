Burra Methodist Youth Fellowship

The temporary suspension of the program gave the committee time and opportunity to look at the aims and purposes of the group.  The MYF will sponsor a Dance and Social Evening at the Redruth Hall on 18 December.  Proceeds will aid the Annual Christmas Bowl Appeal. For 1971 members will be issued with a card clearly stating the aims and objectives of MYF.  To be valid it will have to bear the signatures of the member, the memberâ€™s parent or guardian and the minister.  [The Pledge of Membership and objects of MYF are printed and are suggestive of some of the problems recently experienced.]  In brief they included:

A promise to attend their church of choice as often as possible

To co-operate with appointed leaders

To respect the property and furnishings of the Methodist Church and to acknowledge that failure in this area could lead to closure of the group

To acknowledge that persistently unco-operative members shall, after due warning, be expelled.
