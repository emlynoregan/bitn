Mrs H.J.B. Jennison, Mrs N. Pearce, Mrs A. Clode and Mrs Jeffery convened the afternoon tea, served in the pavilion with many varieties of savouries and cakes.

The Mayor, Mr T.H. Woollacott introduced The Chief Secretary, Hon. A.L. McEwin, who declared the first day’s events open.  He also welcomed Mr W.F. Johns, Superintendent of the SA Police and the Police Band.

The Mayor and Hon. A.L. McEwin in their speeches both recounted events from Burra’s past, including the mining period and Burra’s later efforts in two great wars.

Superintendent John also spoke, recalling that his youngest son, now a Lieutenant on HMAS Hawkesbury at Singapore, had been born at the old Redruth Police Station and his own memories of the town were very pleasant.
