2nd leader. Our attention has been drawn to an extraordinary letter in the Australian Star signed ‘Humanity’ accusing us of partiality and unfairness. The Mayor (it says) cannot explain his side of the case. [re the Burra Hospital] In fact Mr Lipsett sent us only two letters and both were published — the first, long one, as received, the second with some minor changed which were discussed with Mr Lipsett. The Star complains that the surgeons and their friends can get their letters published. Fact — one surgeon wrote two letters and both were published after alterations at the request of the editor. The Secretary of the Hospital Board wrote one long letter and refused to change the wording at editorial request. It was printed as a paid advertisement. The Star then asserts that the Record is owned by the Hospital Board. But in fact: - 
Hospital Board & Surgeons 	Proprietors of the Record 
Rev. H. Howitt (Chair) 	Dr Nesbitt 
Rev. R.W. Campbell 	Dr Brummitt 
Mr Roach Messrs 	Sara & Dunstan 
Mr Coglin 	Mr J. Drew 
Mr Rosman 	Mr T. Drew 
Mr Lewis 	Mr Wilkinson 
Mr J. Drew 	Mr J. Roach 
Mr T. Drew 	Mr F.W. Holder 
Mr H. Dawson 
Mr Cockrum 
Mr Warnes 
Dr Nesbitt 
Dr Brummitt 
The three proprietors who are not on the Hospital Board are connected with the Corporation and would therefore be claimed by the Mayor.
