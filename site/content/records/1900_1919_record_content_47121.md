Burra Red Cross.  The Annual Report by E.M. Harcus, Hon. Sec. & Treasurer.

50-60 ladies have attended meetings.  We have sent 12 cases of made garments, 1 case of 100 sheets for Mareeba Hospital – each case being worth c. £20.  Last 15 July we sent £60 to Adelaide Rad Cross.  The branch was most active in Australia Day 1915 with other patriotic societies.  In August our Bazaar raised £200, of which we sent £180 to Adelaide for medical supplies following a special request from Lady Galway.  On 3 March 1916 £73-10-6 was raised at a garden fete.  We also strongly supported Australia Day.  On 28 April a garden fete at ‘Benacre’ by Hon. John Lewis raised £10 for the Mareeba Hospital.  On 16 June Red Cross Button Day raised £200.  Very cold wet weather meant a small house for the Petersburg Dramatic Co. and the sale of sweets by Miss Lane and Sister Solly produced a profit of £4-10-0, which allowed a total profit of only £5-15-9 to be paid into the general fund.  In summary since October 1914:

Sent to parent society in Adelaide	324

Sent to Mareeba Convalescent Hospital	210

Given to Ambulance Day, Burra	  15
