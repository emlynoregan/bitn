Fresh fruit and vegetables section deserves better support from the home gardener.

Flowers and Floral Arts sections had a good display following a good season.

Birds were strongly supported with good displays.

Wool received many entries.

Sheep entries were again disappointing.

Goats had a good display.

Pigs drew only one exhibit and the cattle section was similar.

The dog display was only average.

The Motor Cycle Trials were a successful innovation.

Horses in Action were popular and entries were of a high standard.

The Shearing Competition was popular with spectators, but entries were down a little.

Miss Show Girl was revitalised this year.

Sideshows were well supplied.
