Burra Hospital.  The hospital’s X-ray machine is to be relocated to Victor Harbor despite views expressed at the Lower North Health Advisory Group on Monday.  The machine was originally donated by the Gebhardt Trust according to the Group of Concerned Burra & District Residents spokesperson Helen Szuty.  The view expressed was that it should stay in Burra and that at Victor Harbor arrangements could be made with existing private providers.  Ms Szuty expressed her disappointment that the advice of the meeting had not prevailed.  There is a state-wide program for updating X-ray machines, but no indication yet as to when Burra’s would by replaced.  The issue of the hospital’s title was also raised and the Lower North HAC agreed to look into the matter of the retention on the title of the clause:

‘In trust to permit suffer and be used at all times as a Hospital Reserve over Allotment 94 and the land marked X.’

Another matter raised was the resurfacing of the car-park.

The meeting was told that it is likely that a private dental practitioner will establish a practice at the Burra Hospital.
