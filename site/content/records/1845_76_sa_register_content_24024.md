Mt Bryan.  The foundation stone for the Bible Christian Chapel was laid on the Queenâ€™s Birthday.  Many travelled from Kooringa for the occasion.  The ceremony was conducted by Rev. J. Rock.  A hymn was sung and there was a reading from Ezra 3 [which deals with the building of the Temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity.]  A document was placed in a cavity and the stone laid by Mr James McLeish, resident and trustee.  Tea was then provided by the ladies in a tent.  A public meeting was then chaired by Mr Clapp.  The chapel will be in the Gothic style 18 ft x 28 ft and 14 ft to the ceiling.
