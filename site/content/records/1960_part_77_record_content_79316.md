[Auhl fails to mention the move from Market Square to Commercial Street and its date.  I have not ascertained when it moved to Commercial Street, but the Market Square premises were destroyed by fire again in April 1910, but were rebuilt on the same site.  In January 1935 they were in Commercial Street when a fire that began in an adjoining shop again burnt out the office, but this time the press was saved.  See also 98, 21, 29 June 1976, page 7 for corrections to this history.]
