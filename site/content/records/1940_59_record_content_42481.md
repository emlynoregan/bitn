Burra Burra DC, 1 August

Cr Finch was welcomed back after his illness and took the chair.

A soldier settler has applied for 54 acres of the Parklands between the town of Hanson and sections 257/261 Hundred of Hanson.  The Director of Lands asks if Council has any objections to the resumption of these lands.  The Director is to be advised it has none.

At the request of the Hanson School Committee the path from the school to Robinson’s store will be gravelled.

Transfer of land: Public Trustee to J.O. Beinke of lot 21 Lostwithiel, lots 16 & northern half of lot 18 Copperhouse & part lots 20 & 22 of Lostwithiel.

Arbor Day at Mt Bryan School on 12 August saw 21 trees planted in the school grounds.
