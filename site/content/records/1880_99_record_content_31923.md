John Joseph Freeman claims £95 from Chivell and his wife for wrongful detention of horses, wagon, and harness and for trespass.  Evidence runs to over 1⅓ columns and the verdict was £6 for trespass, reduced to £5 if the set of harness was returned within a week.  Freeman was entitled to the chattels on tender of £27-0-6.
