Letter.  Simon Jaffer writes a very long letter about the debate over whether ‘Miss Popularity’ is a good or a bad thing.  He accuses critics of writing about things of which they have little knowledge.  His family has been host to two and later three of the girls.  He found them to be intelligent, well balanced and level headed enough to cope with the demands of the rigorous and sometimes stressful situations they were placed in for the sake of the TV program.  As for the complainants –

‘…some of these same individuals, on occasion, whine and bitch about anything that does not fall within their own sterile comfort zone or which disrupts their peaceful existence.’

‘At the end of the day it is only a TV program.’

He goes on to suggest that as a tourist town, Burra can only benefit from the publicity for some years to come.

As for ‘lewd’ comments, they have been shouted from crowds for eons.

And the suggestion of Narcissism might as well apply to the individual writing letters two weeks running proclaiming the ‘immorality’ of the event.

Ask the 350 or more members of the community who gather at Morphett’s Enginehouse every second night to be part of it, what they think.  Ask the school what they think of the money donated to them – or the Leisure Activity Group or the Kindergarten.

‘You people are in the minority that suck the enjoyment out of some relatively harmless fun for the rest of us.’
