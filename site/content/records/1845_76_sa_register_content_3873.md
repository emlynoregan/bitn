William Edward Barnes, ore-dresser, was charged on suspicion of having altered an order drawn by Thomas H. Williams, Superintendent of the Patent Copper Co. works, on the Manager of the same company.  Joseph Wood, clerk at the Patent Copper Co., said he had compared the order with its counterpart and said it had been clumsily changed from £2 to £2-15-0.  The order was drawn in favour of C. Jacques.  Charles Jacques said he recalled receiving the £2 order, but could not recall to whom he paid the order.

Alfred Richard Hurst, a waiter at Wren’s [Burra] Hotel said the prisoner had presented the order at the hotel.  He noticed that the 15/- was written in different coloured ink from the £2.

[Corporal Duins gave evidence and eventually the order was traced from John White, ore-dresser, to William Stevens, Barnes’ employer, who paid Barnes with it as part of the £3-10-0 due for wages.]

The Magistrate decided that there was insufficient evidence to prove Barnes had altered the order, but bound him over in his own recognisances to answer any charge that might be preferred against him at the next Criminal Sessions.
