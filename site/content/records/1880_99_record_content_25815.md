John W. O’Brien writes to draw attention to the dangerous creek where it crosses the Copperhouse road between Nevin’s and German Fred’s Corner.  For Example, ‘last Saturday as Mrs Saunders [actually Sanders] was returning from Aberdeen to Copperhouse with the mail, and when attempting to cross at the place referred to the horse, trap, herself and a heavyweight in the person of Mrs Coombes got washed off the crossing and taken down with the current for a considerable distance, and it’s almost a miracle how some of them were not drowned, and were it not for timely assistance the result must have been very serious’.  He suggests a culvert is needed.  [J. W. O’Brien was Mrs Sanders’ brother-in-law.]
