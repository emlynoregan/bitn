Ulooloo Goldfield

A. Walker has visited Ulooloo where the men are all getting something.  Mr Tim Tremorden who picked up the big nugget is sinking in haste and has a rival nearby.  It is said the original workings at Ulooloo yielded Â£130,000.  One man alone has sunk a shaft 40-50ft, shelved at certain distances and he pitches the stuff from shelf to shelf.
