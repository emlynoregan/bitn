Burra Town Council, 12 October

The Mayor has presented a framed photograph of himself to be hung on the Council Chamber wall.

The Mayor said Sgt Kain had recently been appointed an Inspector.  It was the first time the town had had a resident Police Inspector.  He was to be congratulated on his excellent work in the past and on the way police had handled crowds and traffic during Centenary Week.  It was decided to send a letter of congratulations.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the work of the Town Clerk in organising the centenary Celebrations.

[Note that Inspector Kainâ€™s presence in the town was to be short lived as an Inspector: he left Burra on 29 October for a new post.]
