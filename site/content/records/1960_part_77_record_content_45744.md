Weekend School: Historic Copper Towns of SA

This began at the University of Adelaide on Friday evening with a seminar in the Napier Building addressed by men knowledgeable in the area and continued there on Saturday.  Ian Auhl spoke on the history of Burra.  On Sunday morning participants toured Kapunda and then over 100 people picnicked at Princess Royal lawns, where they were joined by local members of the National Trust.  Clouds gathered, but the rain held off till evening.  In the afternoon the group visited the dugouts, Paxton square, the Burra Mine, the Redruth Gaol and the Museum.  Guides were Ian Auhl and the President of the National Trust in Burra Mr Lewis Moore.  The CWA provided afternoon tea and the whole event was deemed a great success.
