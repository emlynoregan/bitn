Anzac Commemoration Service.  The conditions in Market Square on Sunday 27 April were very cold and windy.  About 60 returned men marched under the leadership of Ian Richardson, with W. Young, President of the Air Force Assoc. and Padre Hobbs.  About 300 people attended the service.  The march was led by the Ex-Navalmen’s Band from Adelaide.  The service was led by Rev. R.S.T. Pettet of St Mary’s, assisted by Methodist ministers Rev. H. Hobbs (Kooringa) and Rev. C. Christopher who gave the occasional address.  Wreaths were laid by Mr Richardson for the RSL, Mr W. Young for the Air Force Assoc., The Drum Major of the Ex-Navalmen’s Band, M. Heinrich for the Demobilised Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen, E. Finch for the Burra Burra DC, W. Carpenter for the Burra Town Council and G. Dollman for the Fathers’ Assoc.

The Annual Church Parade of ex-servicemen was held at the Kooringa Methodist Church at 7 p.m. when both Methodist ministers took part and Mr Ian Richardson led a number of returned men into the church.  Rev. Hobbs gave the address.  The RSL entertained band members at lunch in the club rooms.  On arrival the band played some bright pieces at the Burra Hospital.

At Hallett the Annual Anzac Service was held in the Memorial Hall on 20 April.  Attendance, though good, was less than the previous year.  Rev. Armstrong officiated.
