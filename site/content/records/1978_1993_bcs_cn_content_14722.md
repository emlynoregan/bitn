Burra Swimming Pool Management Committee

Annual Report of President John Barton

This year the committee had to work within a set Council budget of $7,000.

The coldest summer for many years restricted income and in 92 days of operation we took $3,537.40.

Adults numbered 706 or 7.5 per day and children numbered 4,500 or 49 per day.

Pensioners and unemployed were 47 or 0.5 per day and there were 366 spectators or 4 per day.

The cost of the supervisor-operator was $3,754.48, giving a deficit of $217.08.  Painting the pool cost $3,500.  We expect to end the year in deficit $1,500 over the Council’s budgeted deficit of $7,000 and this will come from the Swimming Pool Management Committee’s Fundraising Account.  This is a good result considering the 1985-86 deficit was over $14,000.  The out of hours swimming club got off the ground.
