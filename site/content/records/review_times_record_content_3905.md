Burra came in for some praise at a Local Government seminar at the Festival Centre last week.  It was used as an example of what a town could do to boost tourism in hard times by using heritage to attract tourists.  There were many interstate visitors and speakers present as well as the Premier Mr John Bannon and the new Federal Minister for Local Government, Margaret Reynolds.  The theme was how best local government can cope when Federal and State funding dry up.  Past Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr J. Hawker told the conference that Burra was a ‘living heritage town’.  From a town with a static area population of around 2,000 and a 9% unemployment rate in the late 1970s, it had gone to a population of about 4,000 with an annual rate revenue of $1.2 million.  Mr Hawker said, ‘We set ourselves this task and we didn’t get there without aiming; we realised the real wealth in Burra was our heritage.  We have the finest assembly of neo-Victorian buildings in Australia.  We are surviving because we had the desire to survive.’

The town had started purchasing key properties in 1980 and consciously put National Trust members on the Council, which then set about finding out how best to sell projects to Government agencies and departments to attract grants to achieve long term objectives.  The theme was value for money in a living heritage town.  He said several projects not only generated running costs, but made enough profits to start others.
