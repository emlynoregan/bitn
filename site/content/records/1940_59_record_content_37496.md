Obituary.  Mr Albert Opperman of Burra North died on 12 June at Burra Hospital after a short illness.  He was born in Burra 2 February 1874.  For 30 years he worked for the late Mr James Reed on ‘Wandillah’ and other properties and even for the recent shearing at Wandillah, he worked in the woolshed.  Mr Opperman was a keen gardener and was proud of winning the most points at the Burra Show in the vegetable section for six successive years.  He was also very knowledgeable about care and attention to fruit trees and was much in demand in the pruning season.  He was fond of all kinds of sport and during his youth was a member of the Burra Football Team and followed them closely after retiring from the game.  He is survived by his widow and two sons, Mr Rex Opperman of Burra and Mr Murray Opperman of Booleroo Centre, and two daughters, Mrs A. Andrews of Mile End and Miss Lilla Opperman, Matron of the Balaklava Hospital.  There are five grandchildren.

[Born Albert Ernst Charlie Oppermann 2 February 1874 at Llwchwr (Burra): died 12 June 1948 at Burra, residence Burra North.]
