Dr Ashton writes enclosing the Hospital Boardâ€™s last letter to him which assures him the position offered is still open for him.  He includes his reply which is printed.  He accuses the Board of appearing to be plausible while really using misrepresentation and concealment of the true status of the hospital.  Having once had experience of the Board he does not wish to repeat it in a hospital he believes to be in reality a Government Charitable Hospital posing as a subsidised hospital.  It would he says be unethical to accept fees for attending a patient at such a hospital.  It is time the hospital was properly organised and as a subsidised hospital the ratepayers given a voice in the management as at Jamestown.
