Editorial?  The leading article appears to be editorial comment, but the style and content is very much like that found in the regularly appearing syndicated ‘Advance Australia News Service’.  It may be derived directly from that.  I have not been noting this frequently printed series of articles, as they have no direct local content.  They were ultra-nationalistic and followed the political philosophy of Fascism.  The articles advocated an end to party politics, loyalty to the State and the need to have and follow a strong leader like Mussolini.

Burra Brass Band is doing well at practice and the conductor Mr J.H. Murison would welcome visitors to their practices on Thursday evening in J. Allen’s rooms.
