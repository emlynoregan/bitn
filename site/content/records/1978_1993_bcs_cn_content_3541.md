Paxton Square

So far a $55,300 grant from the National Estate Program has been obtained.  Mr David Gilbert has been appointed to draw up a brief for the redevelopment.  Endorsements will be required from the Burra Burra DC and the Lewis Board of Management before plans and specifications can be proceeded with.

A Bore has been sunk into the Burra creek area opposite the mine entrance and power will be connected next week.  Burra Burra DC is indebted to Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilisers for a donation of $10,000 to provide an alternative water supply for the creek.  The company has also provided motors and other necessary electrical equipment.  The support of Mr Graham Armstrong is much appreciated.  The surrounding area will be landscaped.
