E.F. Marston responded.  After praising the Petter Engines he said the decision to install Automatic Voltage Regulators was done as they desired to improve the service to consumers.

Mr Taylor in his speech warned that the practice of supplying electricity at a high tariff for light and at a low (indeed uneconomic) tariff for power had an inherent danger.  Originally the company had been intended principally to provide light, but the increasing use of electrical appliances was shifting the balance and the company would have to take care that the tail did not wag the dog or the company could end up requiring increased generating capacity to supply power at an uneconomic rate.

The company has paid modest dividends of less than 4% p.a. on average.

L.H. Pascoe the company engineer said that over sixteen years interruptions had been few and he believed Burra held the record in SA in that respect.  Other people also addressed the gathering and some further technical details are printed in a report that extends for more than 3Â½ columns.
