The Burra Community Development Program (The Town Hall Committee) held its AGM last Thursday in the superbly restored Burra Town Hall.  Between March and June the Civic Room was restored by the wonderful efforts of Roy Taplin, assisted by Brenda Taplin.  A Goyder Heritage grant of $1,000 paid for paint, but the results come from the thousands of dollars of in-kind volunteer labour.  The Burra History Group members have organised the remounting and framing of photographs of ten of the town’s former mayors, which now add historic interest to the room.  The remaining mayors’ photographs will be added in due course.  The old lodge room has seen the addition of a display of lodge regalia and an early town streetlamp, donated by Bob Perry of ‘Gaslight’, for which Roy Taplin made a replica lamp post.  Chairperson Meredith Satchell said that there had been 7,686 visitors for the year and they had donated $3,311.  Many of them were interstate visitors.  The refurbishment has created a vibrant, active community venue.
