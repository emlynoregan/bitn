The Local Board of Health has been advised by the Central Board of Health that the problem with the smell from the Bacon Factory is its own problem and it has the power and duty to deal with it itself.  The Mayor said he did not understand the Central Board’s attitude – it had previously been quite willing to send its own inspectors to country towns to interfere with such items as flywire doors to shops.  It clearly did not wish to get involved here.

Cr Carpenter agreed, saying that the Central Board was for ever getting involved when he was catering for miners at Mongolata.

The Bacon Factory owners had already started on the job of placing pipes across the creek for his waste water.

The Board agreed to support Mr G.C. Heinrich in his attempt to get a small covered buckboard to transport meat from the slaughter yard to his shop – an application that authorities had refused.
