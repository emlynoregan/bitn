Obituuary & Inquiry.  On Tuesday afternoon last two people were killed in a train accident at a railway crossing five miles north of Burra: Mrs Joroslafsky [Lafsky & variously Joraflalsky & Jaraflafsky in the report.] and Thomas F. Couper.

Mrs Lafsky worked one day a week at Mackerode and was being driven home by Mr Couper, an employee of Mr A.G. Gebhardt, when the accident occurred.

The driver of No. 130 up goods train, William Bell McDonald, gave evidence.  About 4.30 they were approaching the crossing at the 105¾ mile post.  A buggy with two occupants was on the road travelling towards the crossing on the western side.  The whistle was sounded, but the buggy turned towards the crossing and failed to stop.  The whistle sounded again.  The driver tried to stop the vehicle, but the horse reared and plunged and disappeared in front of the engine.  There was a terrific crash and the train was immediately stopped.  A woman’s body was found on the footplate below the engine’s chimney.  The man’s body was beside the track 15 yards from the crossing.  The bodies were removed to the brake van and after clearing the debris from the engine, the train proceeded to Burra.

George Herbertt [sic], engine driver, gave corroborative evidence: he added that the horse escaped, recrossed the crossing and headed for Mt Bryan.

Ezra John Cosh, guard, confirmed their evidence.

John Quinn, Station Manager at Wandillah Station heard one whistle and the bump.  There was a south wind and his house is south of the crossing.

Florence E. Hunt, nurse of Mackerode, gave evidence that Mr Couper and Mrs Lafsky had left in good health and spirits.  Couper was a total abstainer.  The pony turned up at Mackerode unhurt.

Dr Steele gave evidence that both victims had died instantly of fractured skulls and he described various other injuries.

M-C John gave evidence of the scene of the accident.

M.A. Radford JP as coroner reviewed the statements and decided that an inquest was unnecessary.
