Burra Show. Arrangements this year were an improvement on last year both in machinery and animals. Just as crowds began to assemble rain fell and the large roofed area was 
fortunate indeed. The results occupy two columns on page 3. There was a banquet afterwards at the Institute. 
[They include Best bouquet for table — W. Fuss 1st 5/- & and B. Fuss 2nd 2/6. W.=H.C.W., but B.=?- perhaps Bertha?]
