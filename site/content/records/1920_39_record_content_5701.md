The Inspector General of Hospitals forwarded a complaint from Miss Rose Pearce that her sister had to go to Adelaide at great expense for an operation that could have been much more cheaply done if Dr Ashton had been on the staff at Burra Hospital.

Dr Steele said that Dr Ashton could have operated on his patient at Burra.  Copies of the whole correspondence involving Dr Ashton, Dr Steele and the hospital will be forwarded to the Inspector General.

Dr Steele said the battery of the electric light plant would have to be replaced in a couple of years at a cost of c. Â£130 and if, as he hoped, an X-Ray plant was soon installed a new battery would be required.  He suggested a committee be appointed to go into the matter.  Deferred to next meeting.
