Pancake Day or Shrove Tuesday at Burra Uniting Church last Tuesday saw a large gathering and the consumption of some 560 pancakes in a celebration that also raised money for UnitingCare Agencies, which provide assistance for those doing it tough in the community, whether they are homeless, abused, frail, families in crisis or have disabilities.
