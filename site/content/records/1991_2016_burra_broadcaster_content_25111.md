Letter.  ‘Don Lloydathlon’ writes to congratulate all volunteers and organisations that contributed to conducting the biathlon last Saturday.  He was however, disappointed in the local adult response – three mothers and one grandfather.  Surely some of the winter sporting team members could have shown support for a chance to improve fitness and have fun.  He hopes the enthusiasm shown by the youngsters will encourage a repeat next year.
