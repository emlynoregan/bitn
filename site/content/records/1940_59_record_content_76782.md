1956-57	60 acres barley	643 bags	nett £680

Interest has been earned of £281 to make a total of £5,815.

There is also £300 from Booborowie Ladies’ Club War Savings Certificates to make in all £6115.

Mr J.C. Hawker has extended last year’s arrangements for 1957-58.

The building has now been completed at a cost of a little over £7,000, which includes enlarging the stage and curtains and proscenium.  It is hoped the 1957-58 harvest, together with the opening function on 22 & 23 March, will clear the debt.  At the AGM elected were: President, A.W. Pearce; Vice-President, P.T. Cousins and Secretary, J.E. Dewhirst.
