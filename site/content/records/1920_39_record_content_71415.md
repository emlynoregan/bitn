Burra Town Council, 20 June 1938

Burra School Committee offers to supply trees and to plant an avenue from the school to the school house if Council will dig the holes.  Request granted.

The by-laws with alterations and additions were adopted.

The main changes relate to motor vehicles plying for hire, to parking and to street hawkers.

Ct Lott thought the old part of the cemetery should be levelled and planted with lawn and the main paths gravelled.

The paths will be gravelled and the cemetery inspected with regard to some action.

The mayor reported that he and other councillors had met with the Institute committee re the Council taking over the Institute.

Cr Robinson said the position was that the Institute had an overdraft of about Â£3,000 and much had to be considered before Council could take it over.  He understood there would have to be a poll of ratepayers.
