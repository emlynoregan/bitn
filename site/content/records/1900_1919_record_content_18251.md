The evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff was an absolute denial that the whole event took place and a denial of ever being to the house.  [Cartwright would scarcely admit knowing which house they lived in, though they had previously been neighbours in East St.]  Much of the evidence sought to show Cartwright’s whereabouts on the day in question to account for his movements and to show he could not have been at Mrs Willmott’s house.  His reasons for going to the saleyards near the Burra Hotel seemed a bit thin, but a number of respectable witnesses saw him there and/or spoke to him.

After the evidence was presented there were long addresses by both Counsels and the bench adjourned.  When the court reassembled the SM reviewed the evidence and said the court was unanimous in fixing damages at £50 against Willmott and the Record.
