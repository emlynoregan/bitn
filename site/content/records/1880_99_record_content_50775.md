Cr Hardy asked if the Mayor had seen a paragraph in the Record re the planting of No. 2 Reserve.  The Mayor said he had and it was an unfair representation.

At Monday night’s meeting very disparaging if not insulting remarks were passed to Cr Linkson and Cr Walsh in reference to the way in which the trees had been planted.

The Mayor said that last year the trees had been planted properly: this year the ground was ‘pig-muzzled’ and the trees thrown in.
