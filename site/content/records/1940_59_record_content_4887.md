N. Hiles Pearce writes further on the Recent Floods to the southeast of Burra.

At Geranium Plains a German wagon was found perched in a tree, while its load of tanks had completely vanished. S. Schmidt of Burra Creek lost four milking cows, which were deposited at ‘The Gums’ about ten miles away.  Two were drowned, but the other two dragged themselves out and walked back home to be milked.

At the camp at Robertstown for the men employed on the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline men had to be rescued from their flooded cubicles with the aid of ropes.  One unfortunate was hauled about a chain underwater after he had lost his footing.  Two 400 gallon iron tanks, one full, were carried off to Geranium Plains, miles away and battered out of recognition.  A number of wells were submerged and their top gear carried away.  On Glenbower (the south end of ‘The Gums’ Station) two 5,000 gallon tanks were carried away and left in a smashed state in the mallee.  A 30 ft Comet windmill was left leaning like the Tower of Pisa.

Ernst Winter at Bundey and C. Zeuner at Mt Mary lost 200 sheep each.

Two hundred men are still making emergency repairs, propping up the railway line between Mt Mary and Sutherlands.  All roads are in a terrible state and there is work for one hundred men at Point Pass alone.  Trees in the bed of the Burra Creek carry bruises twenty feet above the ground level from the debris and the miscellaneous debris vomited up by the creek beggars description.

Nevertheless the good resulting from the downpour will be inestimable.  At ‘The Gums’ records show that falls in excess of two inches were recorded only twice before; in 1890 and 1936.
