W. Howitt [Rector of St Maryâ€™s]

The observations made in my sermon of 25 June were based on my own observations, on the reports of the Government Health Officer and of the Inspector of the central Board of Health and upon the fact that ten cases of typhoid prevailed in Paxton Square at the one time.  Dr Gosse, Chairman of the Central Board of Health, inspected the Square last Friday and confirmed these reports.  I do not think I need to offer any further justification of myself.  The directors are nearly as much to blame as their local supervisor.  The sanitary authorities agree that typhoid fever is the direct product of filth and defective drainage.

Scarlatina and typhoid fever have prevailed in Burra more or less for the two and a half years I have known it.  It is quite within the lines of my duty, as I conceive it, to preach on this subject as on any other.  Dirt is one form of evil and it is my conviction to do battle with evil in any and every form, whether moral or physical.

I, 2 (3), 14 July 1876, page 4 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 3 on the microfilm.]
