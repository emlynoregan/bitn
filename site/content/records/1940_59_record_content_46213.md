Candidates for 1950-51.

R.C. Lott (East Ward Extraordinary Vacancy) said he had served on Council before and would work for the best interests of his ward and for the town in general.

M.F. Pritchard (East Ward Extraordinary Vacancy) made similar expressions of intent and said he realised that rising costs would require close attention to details.

H.C. Davies (West Ward) said he had no previous experience in Council, but was sure the town would go forward.  ‘Thought the Town Hall debt should be reduced and everything done to improve the hospital.’

H.M. Scott (West Ward) thought a Progress Assoc. should be formed, where matters could be thrashed out and concrete proposals put to Council.

R.G. Bernhardt (Extraordinary Vacancy West Ward) said this was his first attempt to be elected and he would do his best for his ward and the town.

Mr Carpenter, the incoming Mayor, agreed with the usefulness of a Progress Assoc. or a Ratepayers’ Assoc.  He was proud to be the Mayor as a native born Burra boy.  The Town Hall needed attention and he would support efforts to reduce its debt.
