Ian Kleinig, CFS volunteer, who has spent two months undergoing rehabilitation in Adelaide  after being struck on the back of the head by a falling tree limb while working on the containment of the Murrindindi complex of fires near Alexandra about 60 miles from Melbourne, has finally returned to Burra.  Damage to his brain resulted in blurry vision and a very slight speech delay, but he is expected to make a full recovery after a further 12 months of rehabilitation.  Many members of the Burra Brigade, along with crew members who were on deployment at the time of the accident, were present at the Burra CFS Station to welcome Mr Kleinig home, together with CFS chief Officer Euan Ferguson and CFS Volunteers Assoc. CEO, Wendy Shirley.  A scheduled media conference drew a contingent of cameras, recorders and journalists from various networks.  Mr Kleinig said the actual events were more of an ordeal for his family, as he could not remember anything from about two hours before the accident.  Fellow members Ross Haustorfer from Terowie and Geoff Millard from Georgetown said the burnt-out tree that struck Mr Kleinig was about eight inches around, but stood up to eight feet off the ground.  Mr Kleinig thanked all those who had rescued him on the day and the medical professionals who had since provided care as well as all the well-wishers who had sent cards etc.  Mr Kleinig had been bed-ridden for quite a while and is still recovering strength and fitness.  He looks forward to gradually taking his place in the brigade as is health allows.  He was part of the last wave of SA CFS volunteers deployed in Victoria.  [Two photos.]
