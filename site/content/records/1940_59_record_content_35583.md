Obituary.  Mr Ernest Frederick Marston, one-time proprietor of The Burra Record and very well-known citizen of the town and district, died at his residence in Kangaroo Street in the early hours of Monday 23 February.  He was born in Heathcote, Victoria 80 years and 10 months ago.  At an early age he learnt the printing trade in order to support himself and a widowed mother.  While still in his teens he was employed as a compositor at the Melbourne Age and before he was 20 was manager of a suburban paper.  Later he moved to the country and found positions in various country newspaper offices until he arrived at Numurkah in the Goulbourn Valley District.  Here in 1901 he married Miss Normanna Teare (who predeceased him in 1911) and in partnership with his brother-in-law (Mr W.J. Teare) purchased the Numurkah Leader.  The partnership was successful for some years until the business was bought by the opposition company, which then closed its own business and continued with The Leader.  Mr Marston then went to England and Europe on a trip and returned about 1913.  He purchased the Burra Record and ran it successfully for many years.  The Record was purchased by its present proprietor at the beginning of 1945 and the late Mr Marston then retired from an active role in the business.  In 1917 he married Miss Mary Lane of Burra.
