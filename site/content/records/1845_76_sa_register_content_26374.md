Burra, 26 May

The weather continues fine and the country is looking splendid.  Sowing has generally been completed.

The 1st Anniversary sermons for the new Wesleyan Church at Redruth were preached on Sunday last by Rev. G.W. Patchell.  The congregation exceeded the capacity of the building.  At the tea meeting A.H. Forder presented a financial statement showing a debt on the church and schoolroom of £730.  The Anniversary proceeds were £80.

W.R. Ridgway’s new residence [in Aberdeen] is especially admired.
