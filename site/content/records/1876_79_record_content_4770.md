Letters to Editor. 
Dr Brummitt writes in reply to F. Lipsett re hospital admission rights.

Another letter to the editor suggests that the hospital dispute has more to do with personalities than with principle.

From ‘Sobriety’ regretting that the Cricket Club should meet at a hotel rather than the Institute.
