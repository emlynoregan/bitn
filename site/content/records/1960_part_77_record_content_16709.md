Burra High School

The new classroom is now completed and can be used next week if the furniture arrives.  The new laboratory has been delayed and requires about three weeksâ€™ work.  Hirschausen Bros. have commenced work on the old courts in front of the school.  They will be extended and resurfaced and cyclone surrounds added.
