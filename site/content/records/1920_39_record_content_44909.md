Mining Prospectors’ Assoc. meeting 11 February

Roy Kirkham was elected Chairman, as the former Chairman has left the field.

Prospectors are asking for the establishment of a post office.

They regarded Mr Whitford’s statements encouraging individual prospectors and not companies as misleading and believe new arrivals would be disappointed.

They point out that new arrivals must pay for water carting and are limited to 20 gallons from the tank a week at 2/6 per 100 gallons.

For prospecting, water must come from dams, as the bore is being reserved for battery use.

All of which makes prospecting here far from easy.  The view of the meeting was that the field is a company proposition.
