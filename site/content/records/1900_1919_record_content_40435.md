Accident.  J.M.C. Bennett who was driving one of I.J. Warnes’ cars on Monday had a miraculous escape when the car skidded in sand on the Baldina Ford and broke part of its steering gear.  The car plunged 14’ off the ford and landed on its nose before turning upside down.  Mr Bennett was deposited in a water-filled cleft between rocks and as the door was open he could crawl out unhurt.  The wire rope protection at the ford broke away some time ago and has not been replaced.
