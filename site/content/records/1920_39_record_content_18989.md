A.B. Riggs writes in defence of the Mayor.  It was the Council that made the first move and not the Mayor.  There is no Mayor in peace time that has done more for the town and the returned soldiers.  Mr Crewes and ‘Returned Soldier’ seem to be trying to raise a false impression of His Worship’s efforts as Mayor.  Why has there not been a move to get the scheme of the Memorial Committee put into action?  As the scheme was introduced in Mr Crewes term of office, Mr Riggs ventures to say he (Crewes) slipped up in not getting it started.  Had it been started Mr Collins would have seen it through.
