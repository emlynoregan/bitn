Burra Regional Art Gallery

The Chairman’s Report 1998-99 is published as a supplement.

The report reflects a successful period of operation.  The Chairman strongly believed there was a need for a manager/director and also had hopes for the creation of a community and cultural precinct incorporating the Gallery and the Town Hall, which would offer opportunities for major events with a significant spin-off for the region.

A significant problem for the Gallery was the recurrence of water intrusions into the building on three separate occasions.  On one occasion over $800 damage was done to Allyson Parsons prints.  Only quick action saved original works on another occasion.

The setting up of the S.T. Gill interpretive elements has been deferred as a result of the shortage of people to manage the Gallery.

Exhibitions are listed:

1997-98

Sonia Skipper	1 July 1997 to 21 September 1997

Russell Morrison – Top end landscapes	26 September 1997 to 31 October 1997
