Burra Town Council, 6 July

The Mayor welcomed the recently elected Councillors.

He was disappointed at the low turn-out of voters in municipal elections.

Cr Dow pointed out that 72% had voted, which was not a bad result.

The Mayor said his remark was intended generally – some metropolitan contests had only a 26% poll.

The Town Clerk reported that a special train would run from Burra to Adelaide on 18 September for the Floral Display and the fare would be 6/- return.

The Council agreed to waive the fees for approving the Centenary Hall at the Showgrounds.

The Mayoral allowance for the year was set at £30.

Committees for the year were appointed.

The footbridge at the corner of Paxton and Kingston Terrace is to be removed and replaced with a slab of cement.  [Presumably this means at the corner of Paxton Square and Kingston Street near the Kingston Street Bridge.]
