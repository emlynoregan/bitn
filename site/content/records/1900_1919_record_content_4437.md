Booborowie Methodist Church: 10th Anniversary, 20 October

Rev. W.F. James preached and at the tea meeting on Monday lectured on President Garfield and gave a sketch of the Church’s history.

Nearly 13 years ago spare land near Booborowie Station was thrown open as workingmen’s blocks and many settled in the district.  Methodist services were commenced in Mr Wall’s Dining Room and held there for about 2½ years.  Attendance was good and income about £1-10-2 per quarter.  A Blockers’ Picnic on Christmas Day 1890 raised £8-9-0 to start a building fund for the church that might also serve as a day school.  Two allotments were bought for £10-10-0.  A meeting on 1 September 1891 at Mr Tohl’s house decided to erect a stone building 25’ x 15’ and in time voluntary labour placed all material on the site.  Mr Giles was treasurer, later succeeded by Mr Reynolds.  C. & A. Fuss began work in mid September 1891 and finished within two months.  The cost including land was £194.  Subscriptions were £23, picnic raised £8, and donated labour was worth £53.  £100 was borrowed at 7% and £10 was raised at the opening.

The Sunday school began with 23 scholars in February 1892.  Trees were planted through the kindness of James Loudon.  The church is being used by the Education Department as a day school with almost 50 scholars.  Within four years £50 of debt was paid off and in the fifth year the remainder was paid due to the generosity of Messrs Brown, owners of Booborowie Station.  Membership began with 2 and gradually rose to 5.  The church has also been used for some months by an unsectarian Literary Society and many Band of Hope meetings have been held.
