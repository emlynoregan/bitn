Burra Cheer-up Soc.

On Thursday 27 December there was a welcome home social for S-M W. Ford & Cpl Przibilla, but the former could not attend.

Tpr Beaven returned unannounced on Christmas Eve and Pte Nankivell during the holidays when the Ladiesâ€™ band was unavailable, for which they were very sorry.

On Wednesday 3 January the Band welcomed Pte Burton on his way through to Mt Bryan.

On 7 January there was a social for L-Cpl Burton, Pte Nankivell & Pte Honan.

Pte Herb. Riggs is congratulated on his MM.
