N. Hiles Pearse writes about a recent report on snakes’ eggs being found near Burra and says they were undoubtedly carpet snakes’ eggs.  He says that while not numerous, they are found at ‘The Gums’ where they favour timbered country in the Burra Creek overflow.  [The first report had suggested they were black snakes’ eggs, but this was later discounted because black snakes bear live young.]
