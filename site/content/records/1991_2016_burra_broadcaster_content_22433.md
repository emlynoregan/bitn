Burra National Trust has been conducting a planning review.  The review found that the Engine house/Mine Site and Malowen Loweth were key elements in the offerings to visitors.  The objectives of the new plan are:

To consolidate and enlarge the current cultural tourism offerings in Burra.

To convert the Market Square Museum into a National Trust business site.

To maximise the value of ‘outside sites’: the gaol, cellars, dugouts, smelts, Hampton, police lockup and the courthouse.

The first priority is to establish a copper interpretation centre, preferably at a national level and to consolidate the museums, particularly the Bon Accord and the diorama, at the Mine site.

This would free the Bon Accord Museum for development as a conference centre or for specialist displays, such as a printery, dentistry and blacksmithing shop.

It could be an accommodation facility or a venue for school groups.

The consolidation of the main museum elements at the mine site would allow for easier access for visitors and make for more efficient management for the branch.

A business plan is now needed for the Market Square site.

The feasibility of a copper interpretive centre at the mine needs investigation.

The building of a replica beam engine at the mine site has also been suggested.
