Frank Griffiths.  Though it is some time since the war ended it is only this week that Mr & Mrs Griffiths were notified that their son Frank has been mentioned in despatches for bravery while fighting in the Southwest Pacific.  He saw four years’ war service as a Jeep driver and before enlisting worked with S.J. Woollacott of Burra North and since for Mr Downer at Woodside.  Four of the Griffiths’ sons enlisted and three were accepted.
