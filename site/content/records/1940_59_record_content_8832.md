Pte L.J. Jesser, (abroad) writes expressing gratitude for the parcel received and for mail from home.  The parcel (unlike some received by others) arrived in very good condition.  He describes the beautiful pine-clad hills where he is, amid the snow.  Everyone there was looking forward to Christmas.
