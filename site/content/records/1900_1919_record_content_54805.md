The Leighton Roll of Honour.

The roll was unveiled at the Hall on 7 April in memory of all who have enlisted.  Mr I.J. Warnes was supported by E.W. Crewes, Rev. D.B. Bridgwood (Methodist), Mr J.E.H. Winnall (Anglican), Captain Trigg (Salvation Army) & Mr A.D. McDonald.  40 names were on the roll with others to be added, and 4 of them had been killed.  Each of the above named gave a stirring speech and Mr Warnes called upon Mrs D.E. Williams to unveil the Roll of Honour.  She had sent four sons to the front: one had been killed, one had returned, one was on his way home and one was still at the front.  The roll is in the form of a beautiful bronze tablet about 4’ x 2½’ surmounted by the Union Jack and the Australian Flag painted in and it is embellished on either side with weapons and at the foot the sign of the Golden Fleece.  The names are on brass plates.  [The names are listed at the end of the article, though only 39 rather than the 40 suggested above.]
