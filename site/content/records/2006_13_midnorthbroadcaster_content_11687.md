Peter Brodie of Burra writes on the importance of keeping the Burra Hospital:

When a hospital closes so does half the town.  A lot of businesses close down and those that are left don’t prosper.  People leave the town and the value of real estate falls.  There is a flow-on effect for the school and police.  Unemployment rises and the town suffers from demoralisation.  [He goes on to say he knows of no reason for the campaign against Dr Dissanayake.]  ‘But neither Dr Dissanayake nor members of the public are aware of any specific reason for failure during an assessment, which she was not aware was happening.’

[He fears the transfer of the hospital Country Health or a private business.  And is worried about the possible delays in arranging the formalities for getting a doctor from the UK to share with Dr Fernando the accident and emergency services.]

‘After a long time without patients because of no admitting rights and people being forced to go to Clare, the Health Department will tell us that we don’t need a hospital because everybody goes to Clare.’
