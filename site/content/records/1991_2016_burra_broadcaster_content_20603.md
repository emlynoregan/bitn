Christmas Celebrations were held in Market Square last Sunday evening.  Over 200 people attended and barbecues ran non-stop.  Children eagerly awaited the judging of their decorated Christmas cakes:

2-6 years	Rhiannon Peppiatt

7-10 years	Johnny & Zac Lynch

11 and over	Peter Ryan

Darryl Venning conducted a lively auction, which raised $494 for the Burra Hospital for new quilt covers.

The Christmas story was then told and carol singing followed.  Judy Giles organised students to give items of music and dance and then the Christmas lights were switched on.
