Aboriginal Traces.  A group of scientists and others from Adelaide came last weekend to investigate Aboriginal rock markings found in Baldina District some three years ago by Messrs F. Spencer, J. Biddle.  F. Spencer and L.S. Penrose of Kooringa joined them.

They found evidence of an Aboriginal encampment covering half an acre with spear heads and other implements.  It is said to be the finest showing of native art so near Adelaide.
