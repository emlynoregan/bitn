Fire broke out on the Mt Bryan Road between the 107 & 108 mile posts.  The property of railway workers was destroyed and 15 acres of grass on Mackerode.  The railway men were living in tents and engaged in bridge work.  The north passenger passed at noon and then a goods train and soon after one of the men said the tents were alight.  They saved a tent on the Terowie side, but the flames leapt the road and got into the grass.  There had been four tents.  The head of the gang Thomas J. Crotty gave particulars and believed that the goods train threw out a cinder, as the engine needs to be stoked here due to the grade.  Others corroborated his account.  R.C. Jones lost £6 worth of goods and W.C. Miconi all his clothes and belongings except what he was wearing.

Fire on Friday, also on A.G. Gebhardt’s Mackerode, burnt through about 15 acres of good feed.  Fortunately the fire was soon noticed and extinguished.  A few days before Christmas another fire on the same property was also quickly extinguished.  Trains are believed responsible in each case.
