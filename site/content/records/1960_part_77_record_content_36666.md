Accident/Obituary.  Two elderly Mt Bryan East residents were killed instantly on Friday at about 2.30 p.m. some four miles north of Mt Bryan when their car collided with a truck laden with sheep skins.  The truck was driven by P.G. Dunn of Kilburn and was travelling south.  The small sedan was travelling west from the Mt Bryan East road to join the main road.  Mr Arthur E. Goodridge (67) a retired labourer was driving the sedan, which was practically destroyed on impact.  The driver and passenger, Mary Olive Jean McKay (53), also of Mt Bryan East, were both thrown from the car and are believed to have died instantly.  The truck driver swerved right to try to avoid the impact, but the truck rolled over completely after the collision and ended back on its wheels, facing west and blocking the roadway.  The driver and six-year-old passenger in the truck seem to have been saved from being crushed by the high load of skins.  The young boy received some lacerations and stayed in Burra Hospital overnight for observation.

[Arthur Emmanuel Goodridge born 14 June 1900 Booborowie: died 13 October 1967 near Mt Bryan, residence Mount Bryan East.  Mary Olive Jean McKay born 26 February 1914 Loxton: died 13 October 1967 near Mt Bryan, residence Mount Bryan East.]
