Uniting Church

The High Court of Australia has dismissed an action challenging the proposed entry of the Presbyterian Church into the Uniting Church.  An appeal to the Privy Council has not been rules out and this could delay the inauguration of the Uniting Church beyond the scheduled date of 22 June 1977.  In the meantime a comprehensive educational program is preparing the local church for union.  Burra Circuit will become a Parish and be part of Frome Presbytery.
