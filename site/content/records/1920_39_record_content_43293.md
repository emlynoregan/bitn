Mongolata Goldfield

The large tank for domestic water is now full after Sunday’s heavy rain.

The battery is expected soon, as tenders for carting it have been called and a site decided upon.

W. Carpenter has made alterations and additions to his boarding house in anticipation of growth when the battery arrives.

John Baker, manager of Golden Harp lease has employed John Lewis a prospector from WA who has found four or five nice gold-carrying leaders.  Gold is also showing in the drive off the first winze in the tunnel where the face of the material is 3’6” wide.

Block 8: the crosscut east off the tunnel is now 10ft and driving south off the bottom of the top shaft is at 13ft.
