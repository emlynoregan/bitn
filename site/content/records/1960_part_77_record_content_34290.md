RSL.  Monday night last week 50 members of Burra and surrounding sub-branches attended a dinner at the Burra RSL Club Rooms in honour of the touring New Zealand delegation.  The visitors were amazed at the condition of stock here under such dry conditions.  They decided on Tuesday to leave early and travel to Morgan via Saddleworth, Marrabel and Eudunda instead of the very dusty road via Florieton.
