Letter from E.A. Wohling attacking the cowardly ‘Fairplay’ for insulting the working men of Burra from behind a nom-de-plume.  Consider the Oodnadatta men: five men worked for five weeks in blistering heat and dense flies and mosquitoes, contending with sand and sore eyes.  After paying for provisions for the five weeks they could send £1 to their families.  He [‘Fairplay’] also contended that those at Pinnaroo must be well off to afford living in a hotel as some are.  At 17/6 a week they are doing well: otherwise they would have to buy a tent and utensils etc., buy food, which in the heat, ants and sand would involve considerable wastage.  ‘Fairplay’ would need much more evidence otherwise intelligent workers ‘must accept the assurance that you narrowly escape being a natural born lunatic’.
