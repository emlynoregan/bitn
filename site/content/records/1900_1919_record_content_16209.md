Redruth Court, recently

Charles Adams sued George Ford for £9-10-0 damages.

Ford conducted his own defence and his wife sat by and guided him, ‘but at times his superior knowledge of the law oozed from between his lips and he told the Court what they ought to do.’

Adams owned a block of land near Hampton fir 15 years.  Ford put up a division fence, but it was evidently not enough to prevent them seeing each other.  Ford bred superior fowls and got annoyed when Adams’ fowls entered his yard.  When Ford took down the fence to repair his poultry yard some nine months ago Adams asked him to repair it and after no action sent Ford a second letter that had no more effect.  Ford and his wife are illiterate and someone else had to read the letters to him.  Ford also contended that Adams had erected a fowl yard using the post holes that Ford had dug.  Other witnesses gave evidence and eventually a verdict for 40/- (£2) was given against the defendant.  Ford narrowly escaped being charged with contempt of Court for his reaction and left defiantly vowing not to pay anything.  [The case is reported at some length mainly because Mr Ford’s idiom was a source of amusement when reproduced in the paper.]
