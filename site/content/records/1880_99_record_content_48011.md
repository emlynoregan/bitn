Wesleyan Endeavour Society Christmas Trees

At the Wesleyan Lecture Hall last Wednesday two trees were covered with gifts for sale.  There were also other stalls.  Dr Brummitt had a galvanic battery which was well-patronised.  Refreshments, drawings and paintings by W. Bentley & pupils, pot plants etc. were also on sale.
