Paxton Square was declared an Historic Reserve under the Aboriginal & Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965, on 9 January 1969.  William Paxton was a Hindley Street Chemist.  In 1845 he and three other Hindley Street businessmen formed a company to light Adelaide streets with gas.  The scheme was quickly shelved when one of them, Thomas Bunce, shared the news he had of the discovery of copper on the Burra Creek.  A shepherd named Streair had come to Adelaide and traded his knowledge of it for £8.  Paxton invested £140 in the get-rich-quick scheme and became one of the first directors of the new SA Mining Association.  The shop-keeping nobodies were wealthy men within two years and the Burra Burra Mine became a bonanza.

Paxton acquired a number of choice sites in the private town of Kooringa and soon owned the hotels: the Burra and the Miners’ Arms (now called the Burra Hotel).  One of his properties on the east side of the creek became known as Paxton’s Square, though when he sold it the only building on it was the Bible Christian Chapel, now Baulderstone’s storeroom.  The Mining Association acquired it from him in 1852 and engaged Cornish masons to erect 33 cottages on three sides.  The eleven cottages on each side enclosed common land for the tenants.  The cottages were erected to house Cornish deep miners brought out especially from Cornwall in the 1850s to work the deeper lodes where water was a problem.  Each had two or three rooms with floors of packed clay and cost 5/- a week.  When SA Mining Association went into liquidation in 1914 the cottages were acquired by John Lewis, then of the Burra stock and station firm of Liston, Shakes & Lewis.

[Note: the cottages were passed in at auction in October 1912 and Lewis purchased them towards the end of 1913.]

Lewis later became Hon. John Lewis MLC, Father of Essington Lewis the great industrialist.

[Actually Lewis was already an MLC, serving in the SA Legislative Council 1898-1923.]

Mrs Jane Melrose of Kadlunga, Mintaro, is a daughter.

In March 1923 Paxton Square was incorporated into a trust by Lewis who arranged for it to be managed by a Board of Management.  Hon. John Lewis died a few months later.  [25 August 1923]

The cottages were to house the poor and needy of Burra.  The trustees for many years were Stanley Kellaway, Isaac Warnes & Mrs Jane Melrose.  In 1968it was being administered by members of the Lewis family: Mr R. Lewis, Mrs Melrose & Mrs J. Gosse.  Until last year Mr Stan Kellaway Jnr acted as Curator for the Lewis Trust.

Following a meeting between representatives of the Burra Town Council and the Burra National Trust early in 1968 a common approach was made to the Lewis Trust to consider the appointment of local trustees.  The meeting was chaired by R.B. Lewis and considered ways of bringing the cottages up to an acceptable standard while still fulfilling the original purpose of the trust.  It was realised that Paxton Square could not be sold nor the trust dissolved without a special act of Parliament.

It was decided to bring some cottages up to standard while respecting their original external features.  New trustees were appointed, with Rev. G.D. Sibly as Chairman and the Board of Management was enlarged to include local trustees: Mr R. Jennison, Mr L. Phillips, Mr G. Finch, Mr S. Woollacott, Rev. G.D. Sibly and Mr E.T. Baulderstone.  A plan of modernisation was drawn up by S.J. Woollacott, who has already made substantial improvements to the living amenities of the cottages.  He is the present curator.

Realising their important significance in Australia’s mining story, Mr Ian Auhl submitted an application in 1968 to the Board administering the Historic Relics Act, asking that Paxton square be proclaimed an Historic Reserve.  He was supported by representatives of the Lewis family.  At a meeting of the Lewis Trust in Burra the Secretary of the Relics Board, Mr R. Edwards, acting on behalf of the Board and the Protector of Relics, Dr Inglis, asked the trustees to consider giving their support to the move and they agreed.  The application was also endorsed by Mr Dean Berry, President of the Sa National Trust.

Professor Geoffrey Blainey also lent his support.  Paxton Square is the first building in SA to be proclaimed an Historic Reserve under the Act.  The present trustees are appointed Wardens under the Act.  More and more people in Burra as well as those who study Australia’s pioneering past are realising that Burra has a whole series of buildings which make the town unique in SA.
