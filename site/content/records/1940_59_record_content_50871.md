Burra Rifle Club held its AGM.  The club is in a sound financial position.  F.T. Marston, as retiring Captain, reported on the year’s efforts.  The year saw a series of inter-club matches organised by the Northern District Rifle Clubs Union Executive.  The matches were run on a handicap system with Burra on scratch.  Burra thus did quite well to come in fourth, being 11 points behind the winner.  When firing against Hamley Bridge Burra scored a record 6 possibles.  The team however, broke down badly on the return visit to Hamley Bridge.  Burra’s performance at the Country Teams’ Championship at the Dean Rifle Range at Pt Adelaide was disappointing.  Mr Marston announced he could not continue as Captain.  Elected were: Captain, D.H. Field; Vice-Captain, E.C. Hopkins; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt and Treasurer, P. Betts.
