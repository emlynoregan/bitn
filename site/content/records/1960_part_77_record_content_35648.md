Obituary.  Mrs Alice Barrett died 26 June 1967.  She was the wife of Rev. A. Stanley Barrett and came from the Whitbread family of Mallala.  She had been a tower of strength to her late husband, especially during his early ministry on the West Coast.  With her husband, she raised a large amount of money for the wider church through their musical abilities with the chimes of bells.  Her husband was forced to retire prematurely due to ill health and together they spent their retirement in Burra.
