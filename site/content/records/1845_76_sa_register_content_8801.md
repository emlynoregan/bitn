The profit and loss statement for the six months ending 30 September 1853 shows a nett profit of £11,981-4-8.  The quantity of ore raised in that time was 1,781 tons, which sold for £20,519-13-5 or an average £11-10-5 per ton.  The cost of production was £8,538-8-9 or £4-5-11 per ton; leaving a surplus of £6-14-6 per ton.

The quantity of ore on hand at the surface is 2,126 tons and the quantity of metallic copper yet to be realised is 328 tons.  There is a balance of £27,753-11-7 available for dividends.  Some time must elapse before the proceeds of copper and copper ore can be matured, so it is not proposed to pay another dividend before 3 March 1855.  After that time, with the return of labour, there is every expectation that quarterly dividends can be resumed.
