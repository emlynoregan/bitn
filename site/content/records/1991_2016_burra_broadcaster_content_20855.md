In May an isolated case of Ovine Johne’s Disease was identified at Woollana Stud, but despite widespread testing on many thousands of sheep, no other case was found.  Weeks later it was found to be a case of Bovine Johne’s Disease and despite the scare, the Mid North, as a result of all the testing, remains one of the safest areas to buy sheep.
