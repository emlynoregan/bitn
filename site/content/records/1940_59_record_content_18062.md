Burra North FFCF, 4th Annual Report

The year started with 64 members and ended with 71.  The members have been knitting seamen’s socks and helmets among other items.  There has been a variety of fund-raising activities [which are listed] and we entered heartily into the Christmas Hamper Appeal.  43 parcels were sent at Christmas.  A parcel was sent to the Cheer-up Hut for Christmas Celebrations.  Each first Thursday in the month was a social afternoon.  A Christmas Party was held on 30 December.  For the year much good work was done in money-raising and knitting.  The need for our group remains great.  The major output for the year comprised 329 pairs of socks, 45 mufflers, 22 helmets, 197 face-washers and 160 handkerchiefs.  Receipts for the year were £116-5-10.  £65-17-6 was paid to headquarters.

Secretary Alison Bentley & President Myrtle Riggs.
