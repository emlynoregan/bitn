Letter.  Leo Sturman writes to say that Burra needs new industry and needs more than tourism to survive or it will slowly decline.  Council needs to acknowledge it has to spend money to make money and must create a serviced industrial area.  Taking into account heritage values, this will need to be away from the townâ€™s core tourist attractions.  The tragedy of the present debate is that the proposed new industry is the right move, but in the wrong place.
