Kooringa News, 3 August

Business remains quiet.

A violent storm with rain raged here on Sunday and Monday as elsewhere in the colony.  It was also cold at 45Â°F.

Wheal Marion has turned out a shicer after going down three fathoms.  [Shicer = unproductive.]

Miners are leaving for Wallaroo in large numbers.

A Benevolent Society has been resuscitated here to meet many of the pressing wants daily seen in this place.
