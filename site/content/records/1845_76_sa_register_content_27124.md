Serious Accident on the Northern Railway

Three persons died in an accident on the Northern Railway on Wednesday morning 9 February: Jonathan Wright, engine driver, John Warren, stoker and William Holmes, ganger.

The catastrophe happened to a goods train that left Burra station at 5.30 a.m.  It proceeded to Peak’s Crossing about four miles south of Burra where a creek passes under the permanent way.  The creek was swollen by rain from a thunderstorm the previous night.  It overflowed and washed away some of the foundations of the bridge and made three breaches in the embankment.  When the train reached the first undermined section the line gave way and the engine fell with the tender and following trucks piling themselves on top of it and on the bodies of the three deceased.  The first information reached Adelaide at 9 a.m. from Farrell’s Flat.  It was forwarded by the guard, George Gitsham of Gawler, who had driven to Farrell’s Flat after the accident.  The flood had cut communications south from Burra.  A telegram soon after noon stated that the engine was much damaged with the tender and trucks on top of it and that the bodies of the deceased were visible, but could not then be extricated.  Arrangements were being made to clear the line as soon as possible.

Mr Mais, Manager of Railways and Mr Calf, Superintendent of Traffic went to the scene by special train, leaving Adelaide at 10.30 a.m.  They spent the day supervision action at the scene.  An engine with lifting equipment left Riverton early in the morning.  We understand the three deceased were Riverton men.  Wright was married, aged 31 and had been in the service 6 years.  The stoker was single and aged about 24.  Holmes was aged 56 and was a widower.  At the time of the accident he was riding on the engine to reach the scene of his work.  It was at first feared the guard was also dead, but he followed instructions and returned to Burra to stop the passenger train.  The interruption to the telegraph prevented news of him arriving till later in the day.  The train normally consists of 13-16 trucks and in this case was long enough to save the guard.

[SA Deaths CD registers the deaths as:

Jonathan Wright died 9 February 1876 at Peak’s Crossing, residence Redruth aged 35.

John Warren died 9 February 1876 Peak’s Crossing, residence Aberdeen aged 27.

William Holmes died 9 February 1876 Peak’s Crossing, residence Aberdeen aged 56.]

Particulars from a special correspondent telegraphed from Riverton midnight 9 February.

The rail traffic has been disarranged by the accident.  I arrived at Riverton shortly before 5 p.m. by goods train, expecting it to go on, but the engine had to return and I had to await the passenger service.  I went to Mintaro where I met Mr Mais, the Engineer-in-Chief, and returned with him by the return train, getting the following information from him.

[The report then repeats the information in the editorial comment to the point where the guard left the scene.]

Having survived the accident, the guard got a horse and vehicle from a nearby farm and drove to Burra expecting to telegraph details of the accident to Adelaide, but the floods had disrupted communications and this was not possible.  He stopped the 8 a.m. passenger train.  He returned to the accident and then walked down the line to Davistown [i.e. Davies, the present day Hanson] and from there with another man went to Farrell’s Flat by railway trolly.  From there the news was telegraphed to Riverton and Adelaide.  A number of men were despatched from Riverton and some 60 or 70 have been working all day to clear the wreckage sufficiently to recover the bodies.  It was not until about 7 p.m. that Wright’s body was removed.  His body was in perfect condition, but embedded in sleepers, rubbish and coal.  The other two bodies were badly mutilated, having been caught between the engine and the tender.

The accident was caused through neglect of duty.  Regulations provide that the line must be walked along every morning before the first train starts.  This was not done.  The man whose duty it was to walk the four miles south of Burra Station was at Burra at 5 a.m. and asked Holmes if he should proceed.  Holmes said ‘No; I am going down myself.’  Holmes was the chief ganger at that end.

It will probably take a week to restore the track.  A bridge will be built in the gap, as the cheapest was of effecting repairs.  Passenger trains will run as usual, as there are engines and carriages on the Burra side of the break.  The cost of the damage cannot yet be estimated.  The engine and tender can probably be repaired for £1,500 or £1,600, but there is also damage to trucks and the Government will have to pay compensation for the lost wheat.

A sad aspect of the event is that one of Wright’s children is dying and he was up the greater part of Tuesday night with it.  The bodies have been taken to Kooringa to await the inquest by J.D. Cave.

[I have not been able to find this death on SA Deaths CD.]

The telegraph line between Burra and Clare had also been washed away.

Mr Mais arrived in Adelaide by train 2.15a.m. Thursday morning and Mr Calf followed later in a special.  Officials on the latter train added some details.  They said the chasm at the scene was 40 or 50 ft wide and the bodies were badly mutilated and also burnt by the engine fire, which had to be extinguished some hours after the accident.  Hundreds of people have come out from Burra, many to assist in the clearing of the line, but many more as spectators of the tragedy.  It is said that the train was only travelling at 7 m.p.h. when the accident occurred.
