Burra Races on Wednesday last in F. Dew’s paddock were only moderately successful.  C.C. Heinrich of Burra Hotel was the sole promoter and the crowd was small.  The principal event, the Burra Handicap, had four starters and was won by Bend Or.  The Grand Ball and supper that was planned to follow the races was cancelled due to the small attendance.
