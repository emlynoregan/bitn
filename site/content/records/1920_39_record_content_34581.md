Sir John Melrose recalled meeting Mr Hawkes 46 years earlier when he had few grey hairs in his moustache and walked with such a determined air that he was dubbed ‘Lord Hawkes’ (and the name stuck).  He found Mr Hawkes a good fighter for his causes and a pleasure to do battle with – and such a good speaker that ‘even if he knew nothing about it, he would tell the story alright’.  He praised him for his professional skills as a pastoralist and for his generosity.

Other speakers were: Fred Raynor of ‘The Bluff’ Hallett, Mr J. Thomas of Aberdeen and Mr F. Treloar.  Apologies were received from L.W. Gebhardt and M.A. Radford.

Mr Hawkes said there were three events in his life of outstanding importance.  The first was leaving England, the second was his courtship and marriage and the third was facing him now.  He came to Australia as a young lad of 15½.  His father was a barrister with 14 children and there was never much money about – whether because his father had few clients, or failed to live up to the profession’s reputation for fleecing them he didn’t know.  He had landed in SA on 14 January 1879 by the Lusitania.  He had courted and married Isabella, the daughter of the late J.M. McBride.  [He recounts an anecdote about asking McBride’s permission.]  Leaving the district after over 50 years and Koonoona after nearly 40 years continuous residence would be difficult.  He did not however fear spending his time sitting on the verandah and expected his life to continue its busy routine.  His first experience with sheep was as a lad when he found one ‘Tup’ and six ‘Tegs’ in an English lane without an owner and made money out of yarding them and advertising for an owner.  In Australia he first took 150 rams to Parnaroo for Mr John Sandland just 50 years ago.  Later he left Koonoona and found a billet on a Darling Station.  That was the 1880s when after a period of prosperity and inflation following the Franco-Prussian War with good seasons and high wool prices, things were going down with low wool prices, dingos, drought and rabbits all at once.  In the good season of 1887 he had the supervision of over 200 rabbiters working on the NSW Government’s scalp bonus system, but it was like trying to empty the sea with a bucket.  Rabbits were the greatest scourge to the pastoralist.  He returned to Burra in the late 1880s in bad times.  Pastoral leases had expired and chaos reigned.  Managers and overseers were 2d a dozen.  Fortunately the late Hon. John Lewis picked him up and made him sub-manager at their Burra Branch.

Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes were also given a farewell from ‘Millipa’ the residence of Mr & Mrs Glen Hawkes on 21 June.  About 50 people were present – employees of Koonoona Pty Ltd including Mr & Mrs W.P. Wade, manager of their Winnininnie Run near Peterborough.  Tennis was played and afternoon tea taken in the dining room.  Mr Wade had been asked to speak for all and made a heartfelt speech instancing many kindnesses of Mrs Hawkes over the years and of Mr Hawkes as a role model.  Mr A.T. Butler endorsed his remarks.  The employees presented Mrs Hawkes with a porcelain tray and morning tea set and Mr Hawkes with a handsome clock. Mr Hawkes made a suitable response.
