Obituary.  Robert Phillips of World’s End Creek aged 72 died suddenly on 20 October while attending his sheep at Florieton.  He was born in Hampshire 11 March 1847 and migrated to Australia with his parents and two sisters.  His mother died six months later when he was aged 9.  The family lived at Gawler Hills and then Tothill’s Creek where one sister drowned and the other married Mr James Sherwell and now lives in Victoria.  He and his father were carters for the Burra Mine and later to Blinman and The Barrier.  In 1876 he tool land at Baldina, which he worked for several years before moving to World’s End Creek.  Several years ago he acquired land in the Hundreds of Schomburgk [now Maude] & Stuart where he carried on grazing.  In 1880 he married Miss A.P. Hempel of Robertstown who survives with a family of six sons and three daughters: Alfred (Mt Bryan), Lindley & John H. (Schomburgk), Norman H., E.T., & C.F. (World’s End Creek). [Which would appear to total seven sons.]  And Misses Mary, A.J. & E.E. & H.C. Phillips of World’s End Creek.  [Which would appear to total four daughters.]
