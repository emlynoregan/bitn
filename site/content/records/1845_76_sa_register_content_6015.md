Kooringa Concerts

George Bennett’s concert at the Burra Hotel on 25 April was well attended.

Items mentioned are:

Old Colonist’s Song

Adelaide Polka

Jetty Treff’s song Trab, Trab, Trab

Madame Francesco Allen sang Mother’s Farewell from ‘Norma’ [Rapturously reviewed.]

Mr Bambrick’s playing of the flute was admired.

C. Walsh sang Old Colonist’s Song (His voice and technique much improved after a sojourn in Adelaide.)

A gentleman amateur sang The Maids of Merry England and Merrily Rolls the Mill

Mr Bambrick’s second concert on 26 April saw Madame Allen quite triumphant.  [Corrected 7 May to Madame Otto.]

The third concert is looked forward to this week.
