Burra’s Water Supply.  In response to a question in Parliament the Hon. The Minister has authorised the provision of a new plant and the construction of a 250,000 gallon storage tank at an estimated cost of £4,150.  The existing plant will be retained as a standby.  This follows the assessment of the water supply as most unsatisfactory, due to the inefficiency of the plant.
