In the School Class for 5th Class children:

B. Fuss 2nd to A. Bentley for drawing on sheets

M. Fuss for visiting cards.

In manual work for boys R. Fuss was 1st in Fretwork, and also in Brush Work and Cane Work.

These are somewhat mysterious.  A. Fuss is unknown and M. Fuss could be Myrtle, though she would have then been almost 16 years old.

B. Fuss could have been Bessie Marguerita, though she rarely used her first name.

A. Bentley was presumably Alison (Al.)

R. Fuss would have been Lawrence Robert Fuss.]
