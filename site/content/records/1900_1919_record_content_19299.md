On Wednesday there was another fire near Wattlegrove.  It got a good hold and headed for Firewood Creek, but fighters stopped it entering Mr Reidâ€™s property.  Messrs Thomas & Gare lost c. 250 acres of grass and others also lost some.  It was first noticed just after the midday train for the north.
