Burra Town Council, 16 March.

Mrs T. Halls writes for a cab licence for Albert Harry who is not quite 17, but very competent.  The application is due to the ill health of Mr Halls.  Councillors were sympathetic, but the Clerk pointed out that a licence could not be granted till he was 17.

C.B. Griffiths complains about the sheep camping about his house and in front of his door.  The Ranger will investigate.

Several pieces of timber have been stolen from work being done at the bridge. [Which bridge is not specified.]  The police have been notified that 8 pieces 4” X 2” x 20’ are missing.

The tennis court wire-netting fence near Allan’s [Allen’s?] was lying on the footpath.  It is ordered removed.  [In XXI, 1886, 25 March 1914 this is amended to the fence near the Skating Rink.]
