Burra’s Population

Note: the district figures include the townships of Farrell Flat, Hanson, Mt Bryan and Booborowie.

There has been an increase in the size of holdings and in the number of vacant houses on properties.

[A hand-written comment on the office hard copy says the figures for 1959 and 1961 are estimates only.

Another hand-written comment suggests that the increase between 1954 and 1959 reflects seasonal conditions.

Figures are also printed for Clare, Jamestown, Peterborough, Kapunda, Spalding, Hallett, Riverton, Robertstown and Morgan.]
