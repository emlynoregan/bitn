Burra Town Council, 7 May

Burra Electric Supply Company asks for the Mine Bridge light to be moved 15 ft in either direction and for a temporary road to the proposed power house.  The present position was right in the middle of the proposed road.  To be moved to the north side of the Bridge at the companyâ€™s expense.

The company also asks for an extension of time of six months for the installation of lighting.

There was then a discussion on the charges for electricity, which Cr Hammond thought were excessive.

G.J. Tiddy applied for permission to build a house.
