Burra Branch of the National Trust will hold a garden party at Princess Royal Homestead this weekend.  The homestead is close to Burra and will give people another chance to wear their period costume said President Mrs M. Wright.  About 60 people are expected to attend.  Vice-President Mrs C. John said it was a good opportunity to visit Princess Royal, which was not open very often.  She said it was probably the classiest building in the district.
