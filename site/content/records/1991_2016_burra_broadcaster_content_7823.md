Letter.  Mrs Elaine Eberhard writes to say how pleased she was to see the good attendance at the Courthouse meeting of 28 August, but disappointed at only two of the public at the AGM of the local hospital.  Apparently only at crisis points or when the Government indicates it is going to cut services, do the people display any interest.
