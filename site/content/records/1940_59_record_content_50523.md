Burra Hospital.  Elder’s Trustee & Executor Co. has advised the Hospital of a further sum of £500 from the estate of the late Charles Ernest Gebhardt, bringing the total value of the bequest to about £5,000.  The sum is designated for new nurses’ quarters and private wards.

The plans for the new building have been verbally approved by the Chief Secretary and sent for official approval.  The supply of building materials will still cause delays.
