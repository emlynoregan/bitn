The Seaside Trip to Semaphore took place on 19 March.  Some 600 adults and children took part.  The day was excellent and a picnic was held on the beach.  People joined at Hanson, Farrell’s Flat and Manoora as well.  The train departed Burra at 6.30 a.m.  The Burra Coronation Band went along to enliven the day.  At Semaphore rooms had been set aside by local authorities at the Institute for the use of excursionists.  The train took about five hours to get to Semaphore travelling directly from Dry Creek without going into Adelaide.
