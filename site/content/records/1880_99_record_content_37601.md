Football.  The Clare trip.  It rained heavily on Tuesday night and the coach arranged for Clare arrived at 7 a.m. to find only 14 players after waiting for two hours.  They decided to go at 9 a.m. and the weather then cleared up until about halfway to Farrell’s Flat when rain returned and it poured until Clare was reached.  The horses which initially had been prepared to do the distance in half-time now required rests and occasional walks to relieve them.  Clare was reached about 2 p.m.  Dinner was taken at Host Gray’s and they then moved to the oval.  ‘Experts on irrigation pronounced it to be thoroughly irrigated’.  The side was six men short and the Clare side arrived half an hour later.  The rain now stopped and a good number of spectators appeared.  The spectators had the best of the game.  After a poor exhibition of football all through Clare had scored 2.15 to Burra 1.3.  ‘It is said enough Clare mud was brought home to start a small farm.’
