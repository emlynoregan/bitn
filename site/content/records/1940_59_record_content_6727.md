Sister Joan E. Carey, daughter of Mr & Mrs T.M. Carey of Broken Hill and granddaughter of Mr & Mrs J.G. Sara of Burra North has recently returned to Australia from England, where she served as a war nurse.  After training in Broken Hill and Melbourne, she proceeded to England and joined the staff of St Thomasâ€™s Hospital in London and later did private work with a nursing club.  When war was imminent she joined the Queen Alexandra Nursing Service and served for 15 months on an ambulance train in England and Scotland, serving the sick and wounded arriving from the Continent, including those from Dunkirk.
