Burra Town Council, August

The Mayor reported visiting the Mine Area, the Caravan Park and the Swimming Pool with Mr Pollnitz of the Government Tourist Bureau with Councillors Cornelius and Finch and the Town Clerk.  Mr Pollnitz suggested asking the RAA to send an officer to devise a long term plan for the Caravan Park.  Mine access roads need grading and shafts need to be made safe.

It was resolved that Johnny Green be moved and consideration be given to relocation at a suitable site in the Mine Area.

A general rate of 47d in the pound was declared with a differential rate of 35d in the pound for assessments 89, 326, 568 and 577.

In the event of school crossing lights being approved the Council will support this to £50.

The Corporation will pay £50 rent for the Town Hall this year.

A price will be obtained for cyclone mesh and posts to make shafts at the Mine safer.  Up to £200 was approved for a ramp at the Mine entrance and road grading by the Burra Burra DC.
