Regional Council of Goyder

Council has moved to seek registrations of interest from architects to undertake the refurbishment of the Burra offices of the Council.  A draft drawing has been produced in house to get input from staff.  CEO Stephen Kerrigan said the redevelopment would encompass all areas including the RSL section.  Agreement has been reached with the RSL that they will share the Council Meeting Room in the new design.  The Honour Boards will be retained and the area will be available for the usual RSL functions.
