M-C Jemison, formerly a policeman at Burra was then sent to Moonta and lately to Stirling East.  Things there did not go well for him.  [Or to quote the paper: ‘didn’t go too good with him’.]  He has resigned from the police force owing to continued illness and is in a private hospital in the city.
