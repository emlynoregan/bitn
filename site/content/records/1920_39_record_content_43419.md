Indoor Bowls.  Report on the season just ended in over ½ column.

They had quite a successful year, though this year there were only six teams and players were down to 77 from 97.  Expenditure was 9/10 more than income, but they ended the year in credit £1-13-2.  Nothing came of attempts to arrange country trips.  The Association began in 1928.  Report by P.J. Rule, Honorary Secretary.
