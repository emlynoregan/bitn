Illegal dumping in the Goyder Council area costs ratepayers thousands of dollars.  Andy Nicholls, natural resources manager said there were still some landowners who believed they could flout the law.  This follows the discovery of 250-300 20-litre agricultural metal and plastic pesticide drums dumped in a gully on Hills Rd off the Spalding to Burra Road.  They pose a serious environmental risk and would cost thousands to remove.  There was the risk of serious pollution to neighbouring land.  Mr Nicholls said a free Drum Muster collection would soon be held in the Councilâ€™s area.
