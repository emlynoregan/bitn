Letter.  Bob Skinner writes, commenting on the Council’s decision not to get involved with the red phone box replacement.  He saw the phone box as part of the tourist attraction of the town – not a benefit for just the adjacent business and doubts the Council’s acumen in seeing its tourist benefits.
