'Espagna' writes on the origin of the word ‘Merino’.

It is a Spanish word, corrupted from the Latin ‘merinas’ or Majorinus’ implying a superintendent of sheepwalks; hence the Spanish ‘merinos ovejas’ or sheep under the care of the merino or major.  There are two kinds of sheep in Spain.  The coarse-woolled do not travel and are housed inside in winter. The fine-woolled spend all their time in the open air and at the end of summer migrate from the cool northern mountains to the warm southern plains of Estramadura and Leon for winter.  Lately their number was estimated at 4,000,000.  These ‘merinos’ are also called ‘transhumentes’ because of their annual migration.

[Further details of this sheep migration are given with a suggestion that transhumance might improve the wool of sheep in Australia as well.]
