Burra Show Society met on Friday and the President, Mr I.J. Warnes attacked the paper for suggesting not enough interest was being taken in the society.  He seems to have mistaken our intention which was to attempt to galvanise into action those who never make any effort to support the society and not to reflect on those members who do support it.  Mr Warnes also attacked the Burra Racing Club for not paying its secretary.  Perhaps it is time the Racing Club had another meeting to take action to write off its debt.
