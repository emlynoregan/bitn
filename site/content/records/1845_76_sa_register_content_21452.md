Burra News, 25 December

Thursday 19 December was the hottest day for the season with a searing northerly wind and clouds of dust.  Numerous bushfires surrounded the town, filling the air with smoke.  For some hours burnt grass fell from the sky and accumulated in sheltered corners.

The largest fire started 30 miles from Mt Remarkable and travelled down through Mannanarie, touching Woorkoongoree, Gottlieb’s Wells, Canowie and Booborowie.  The fire travelled 40 miles in six hours.  Fire fighting efforts met with little success.

Another fire southwest of Kooringa broke out at midday on Bown’s at Springbank and rapidly ran up the hills, crossed the ranges and got into Need’s paddock.  Mrs Need tried to save some sheep, but got caught by the fire, barely escaping with a burnt arm.  In the meantime the fire had reached the house.  The furniture was removed to the Government Road, but the house was eventually saved, though some dry creepers burnt over the roof.  They lost five pigs, 70 fowls and 25 acres of wheat and a new haystack.  The fire then spread to Mr Porter’s paddock and all his feed on the eastern side of the ranges was consumed.  A friend rode to warn Mr Flowers and Mr Humphries, seven miles away, but the fire outpaced him.  Flowers’ Run is greatly injured and Humphries’ all but burnt out.  Amazingly a haystack of Mr Flowers, protected by a low stone wall, survived.

The cause, uncovered by an inquest on Friday, was almost certainly someone carelessly throwing out ashes at Bown’s.

At the inquest Richard Bosence gave evidence of its origin at Bown’s when only Mrs Mrs Bown was present.  The wind was strong from the northwest.  He said he had often cautioned Mrs Bown about carrying hot ashes out to the ash heap.

John Bagg gave corroborative evidence.

George Townsend thought the fire started from ashes carelessly thrown out during a boisterous wind.

The jury decided the fire started from the ash heap referred to through the carelessness of some unknown inmate of John Bown’s house.

On Sunday 22 December another fire at Stony Gap burnt a good deal of grass of Messrs Duffield & Porter.

Shell parrots are in the neighbourhood in immense numbers.
