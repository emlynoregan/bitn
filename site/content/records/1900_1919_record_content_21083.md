Correspondence from other towns. Sporting events are reported: at length in the case of football.  Overall little evidence that the paper went out to get news â€“ rather that it waited for it to be sent in.  Court cases are mostly briefly reported and the Town Council reports are brief and uncontroversial.  There are lots of boring repeated advertisements in small print and while the size of the humorous fillers varies greatly, they are sometimes substantial.
