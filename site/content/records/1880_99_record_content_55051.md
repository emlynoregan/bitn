A Deputation waited on the Treasurer, Hon. F.W. Holder, last Friday in the Burra Council Chamber seeking a special grant of £25 to erect two culverts on the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen.  The argument mounted was that they were a necessity which could not be met from the road grant of £225, which had been reduced from last year’s £250.  Burra had rarely asked for special grants.  Holder agreed and said the only one he could recall was for the Bon Accord Bridge.  The best he could do was to sanction the £25 now and try to avoid deducting it from the next grant, but that he could not guarantee as the appropriation for the main roads vote had yet to be taken.
