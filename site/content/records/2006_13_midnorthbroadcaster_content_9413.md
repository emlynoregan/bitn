Des Woolley writes questioning the ‘Mayors’ right to that title.  He says the rules laid down by the Local Government Association provide for the principal member of a Council to be called a Chairperson if chosen by the Councillors and a Mayor if chosen by the electorate as a whole.  He is therefore looking forward to voting for the Mayor in the November elections.
