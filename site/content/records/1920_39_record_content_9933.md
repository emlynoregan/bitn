Ironmine Memorial Schoolroom

On Saturday 13 January the foundation stones for the memorial schoolroom at Ironmine Methodist Church were laid by James Flower and D.E. Williams.  During the War it was decided that the room would be a memorial to the memory of those who paid the supreme sacrifice and to those who returned.  The Sunday school has been held in the church for 50 years, which is not satisfactory for up-to-date methods of teaching.  The money for the white freestone building with red brick facings has mostly been raised.  The function was set for 5 p.m. to suit local residents.  Present on the platform were Rev. E.M. Ingamells (Redruth Circuit), Rev. E. Smith (Kooringa Circuit), the Trustees and the President and Secretary of the Ladies Committee.  To date £410 had been raised and the cost would be £550 plus furnishing.  The Mayor of Burra (Mr M. Collins) apologised for his absence at a council meeting at Hallett.  £69-4-0 was then placed on the stones and the crowd went on to tea at Leighton Hall where Mr Collins later joined them and a concert followed.  [Including songs from R. Fuss.]  By the end of the night a further £31-9-0 brought the total for the day to £100-13-0.
