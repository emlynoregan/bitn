‘Old-timers’ simply wish to enjoy themselves in their own way and question if the ‘cranky’ dances of today will stand the test of centuries as some ‘old-time’ dances have.  The writer also considers that modern ‘jazz’ dancers expect 10d of every 1/- they spend to come back in expensive bands and decorations etc.  Old-timers come to dance.
