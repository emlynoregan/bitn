A Landcare Conference at Clare last Wednesday included travel by coach to ‘The Gums’ to see a demonstration of boxthorn removal by Rick Hastings of Boxthorn Removals Port Victoria, using a converted 4WD tractor with high clearance and large tyres to minimise damage to other vegetation.  The bush is lifted vertically out of the ground with little disturbance to surrounding growth.  Smaller bushes can also be clumped together and heaped in a pile for burning.  So far the Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board Executive has organised a clearing program involving twelve properties and some 400 tractor hours of work.  Pepper trees can also be targeted – though in the absence of rain only small ones.  Mechanical removal of pepper trees seems to be better than chemical attack.
