BCS.  Staff Profile: Mick Koziol

I was first appointed to Salisbury H.S. in about 1965.  I moved then to Elizabeth Boys’ Technical H.S.  I spent a year at Smithfield Plains before doing compulsory country service at Lucindale Area School.  After an enjoyable time there I transferred to Glenunga H.S. where I taught Years 11 & 12 Physics every year and Years 11 & 12 PES Maths off and on.  I coached Glenunga H.S. volleyball teams.  While holidaying in Clare in 1987 I bought 18 acres and have tried to move there ever since.  My wife managed to gain an appointment at Riverton.
