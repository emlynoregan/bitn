Burra Oval Improvement is to continue.  With the football season over and cricket clubs having made other arrangements, it is intended to completely top dress the playing area.  A section of the front wall (on the western side) is to be removed and replaced with cyclone fencing.  The material from the wall will be used to form a parking area around part of the western side.  Changes will be made to the road around the oval to delete most traffic hazards and make for freer movement, particularly around the dressing and refreshment rooms.
