Trout Fishermen will have another chance to catch trout at the Burra Swimming Pool on 22 September.  The recent ‘Gone Fishin’ event had raised $120 for swimming pool improvements.  About 150 anglers had taken part on 11 August, but there were still many trout in the pool.  Michael Gill caught the first fish on the day and Kevin Jacka caught ‘Tiny Tim’.  Anglers on 22 September could enter free, but would pay $0.50 for each fish caught.  300 trout had been shipped in from the Adelaide Hills for the event.
