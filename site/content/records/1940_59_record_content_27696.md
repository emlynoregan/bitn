Burra Homing Club

The 20 July race from Carrieton was won by Kellaway Bros with J.L. Allen second.

The 27 July race from Tailem Bend was won by P.J. Byrne with T. Broad second.

[The first race was to have been from Parachilna and the second from Tintinara, but curtailed trains due to the coal shortages caused the above changes.]
