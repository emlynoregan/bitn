Thomas Henry Eustice of Hillmanville, Councillor for Waikerie DC was fined £20 plus £1-11-0 costs for failing to move stock the required distance of 5 miles per day on a TSR in the Hundred of King.  The Clerk of Waikerie DC had written saying the stock would be travelling from 23-30 January and Eustice was a genuine traveller.  On 1 March the Ranger interviewed Eustice just inside the Council boundary where he had been for about a week and he asked for an extension of time.  The Ranger said he had no power to grant extensions and he would have to do his distance.  He was later found at the same spot and again told to move on.  He said the stock were too weak to do the 5miles a day.  He stayed several more days.  He complained about the law and blamed the drought conditions around Morgan.  Mr Bednall for the Council said the defendant was doing just what he blamed others for: eating out the stock route to the disadvantage of local travellers.
