Scavenging. Even though last year's arrangements have been much abused, the lack of any arrangements so far this year has resulted in many regrets which indicate that the old system did achieve something. Now that the Council has decided on a health rate the scavenger will collect household rubbish and anything else that is a nuisance to the eye or nose that can be classed as rubbish.

The Editor also writes regretting the apparent lack of accord between the District Council and the Town Council where they should be co-operating. [The issue concerned the state of a slaughterhouse that was brought to the attention of the District Council by the Town Council.]
