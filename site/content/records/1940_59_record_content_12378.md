Characteristics of the 1942 paper.

The format at the start of the year was a broadsheet 8 columns wide, with characteristics essentially like those of 1941.  With the issue of Volume 63, No. 7, of 17 February 1942, there was a major format change, designed to make more efficient use of wartime paper supplies.  The editor announced:

The Burra Record this week changes from broadsheet to tabloid format.  Although 8 pages of tabloid use as much paper as four pages of broadsheet, it will be much easier to change the size of the paper to suit demand or necessity.  Adjusting down to six or up to ten or even 12 pages will be simple should occasion warrant.

Placement of material was rather flexible, but the following is representative.

Page 1.

Solidly local news

Page 2.

Dominated by advertisements for auctions, public notices and the Cash Column, i.e. small advertisements of two to six lines.

Page 3.

A couple of large advertisements and largely local news.

Page 4.

Similar to page 3, often with some war news or war related articles or propaganda.

Page 5.

Some large advertisements, with local rainfall figures and non-local news and informative articles.

Page 6.

Larger advertisements for about half the page, with a mixture of local and war news or war-related articles.

Page 7.

Similar to page 6.

Page 8.

The District Honour Roll takes up almost two columns.  There was a fictional serial of two to two and a half columns.

There was another change with Volume 63, No. 28, 14 July 1942, when the editor announced:

Shortage of paper has forced the reduction of the paper to four pages.  Print size has been reduced and cast in six columns instead of five, to actually provide more reading matter than in the previous six page paper.

The paper for 18 August is typical of this format:

Page 1.

One large local advertisement and the rest local news.

Page 2.

One or two large advertisements, auction notices, public notices, entertainment advertisements and some news.
