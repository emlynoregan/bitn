Fair View Phosphate Mine.  Work continues.  There is no news regarding the claims of Messrs Killicoat, Finch, Rosewall & Baker.  Mr Arthur Haselle writes to us in response to the article in the Record of 27 September saying: I have never jumped a claim in my life; for the past eight years I have held large interests in S.A., on Yorke’s Peninsula; I have a business at Port Adelaide, and until recently had my steamer trading in S.A. waters.’
