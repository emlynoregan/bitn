A.L. Clode’s official opening will be next Friday.  A short ceremony will be held at 2.30 when the DC Chairman Mr Ray Jennison will declare the new complex open.  Clode’s have a long association with Burra.  Late in 1929 Eric Clode’s father, Mr Arthur (Laurie) Clode, decided to open a hardware shop to compliment his building business.  At that time the emphasis was on general building materials.  In 1949 Eric joined as an apprentice carpenter, a trade he continued until 1959 when he began to spend more time in the shop.  He saw the opportunity for a larger shopping complex and purchased the site for the new premises.  Work began on the new premises last June and it is designed to be a one stop shop for the handyman. As well as hardware there is a small music centre, the Burra Sports Centre and the Cornwall Kitchen, which specialises in take-away food and there is also a Laundromat.  The old shop has been retained for heavier hardware lines.  Photos:
