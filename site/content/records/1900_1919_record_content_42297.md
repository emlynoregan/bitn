West Burra Copper Mine: inspected 19 May.

The main underlie shaft is at 100’ and driving extends a total of 18’.  One vein 3-6” wide is fair, but the rest of the formation is low grade.  The drive east meets a fault after 16’ and the ore body beyond has not been located. At 50’ the east drive hasn’t found anything while the west drive at 42’ is more promising.  A winze from here to the 100’ level is to be dug.  The indications on the west side at both the 100’ and 50’ look promising.  The seam in the 50’ west drive is 15” wide and gave 34-36% copper.
