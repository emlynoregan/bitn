The paper was dominated by war news with many letters from soldiers and especially the efforts of Burra and district to raise money for the various funds.  These efforts are reported at great length and with great care to acknowledge all financial donations, gift items and other assistance.  Jingoism is relatively restrained, but not entirely absent.  It naturally appears in reports of some of the stirring speeches at major events.
