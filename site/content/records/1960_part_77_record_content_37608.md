Burra Mine.  The Chairman of Broken Hill South Ltd at its annual meeting said that at Burra percussion drilling of the oxidised ore was completed.  Indications are of 3.3 million tons at 1.6% copper and a waste to ore ratio of 1.4 to 1.  The economic feasibility of an operation at Burra is marginal.  More sampling and a pilot testing is needed to determine the mining recovery.
