Supreme Court of SA, 4 November

Cross-examination of Ayers continued.

Witness said the instructions given Burr when appointed were approved by the deputation of Directors at the Mine at the time.

William Pope, a miner for 15 months at Burra Burra knew Hoskins to have done the assays at the Mine from April to June 1848.  He also gave evidence concerning the changed instructions about resolving discrepancies in assay results before payment.  On a re-run of some of his ore the results were ⅛% under Hoskins’ first assay, but 1½% over the Directors’ first assay.  He said the strike began before the Directors’ response was publicly known.  Captain Roach had communicated it to a few, but Pope had not known it.

James Hoskins the elder, miner and assayer, said he lived in one of Taylor’s cottages.  All the completed cottages were let and he found them tenantable and secure.

James Taylor, carpenter of Kooringa, had been engaged to erect 30 cottages. He had erected some and parts of others.  The walls were 6 ft 6 inches from the floor.  The foundations of brick cottages were of stone 22 inches high.  The walls of other cottages were all of stone.  The brick walls were 9 inches thick and the floors were raised above the outside surface.  Foundations in some places were sunk.  Stone walls were 14 inches thick and the height of the first lot was 6 ft 6 inches and some later ones were 8 ft.  When Mr Burr left there were 16 brick cottages and 14 stone ones completed.  The company owed the witness c. £300 for work and material then on the ground when Burra left.  He had finished some houses and been paid £250 since.  All cottages finished when Burr left were presently occupied.  None of the 8 cottages facing the creek were finished.  He believed his cottages would last for 100 years and that observers then would say the same.  The floor was to be lime-ash 2-3 inches deep.  Mr Burr had said the last cottage finished was better than the rooms he had.  Possession of 26 cottages had been given to Mr Burr.  The cottages which he got notice to take down were not finished when the witness left Kooringa.

Gwynne summed up for the defence.  He said much of the evidence was intended to show the difficulty in obtaining a sample from the large heaps of ore by the Kooringa method, but they had all made the mistake of attributing the difficulties to the size of the mass and not to the character of its component parts.  The evidence showed the plaintiff had not kept his side of the contract and that his dismissal was justified.

Fisher summed up for the plaintiff.  Gwynne had poured scorn on the plaintiff’s witnesses, but Gwynne’s own witnesses were much more interested parties than any of those the plaintiff had relied upon.  He said Mr Burr had not been shown to have made any representation to induce the offer of the position and had left a highly honourable office to take up the position at the Mine.  He had left a position with the certainty of advancement.

The assaying was incompatible with the many onerous duties the Superintendent had to perform.  Mr Ayers had admitted that letters from him might be made to appear official or otherwise to suit a given purpose.  There was nothing in Burr’s instructions concerning the cottages and all the alleged general neglect was mere trumpery.

The letter of dismissal depended on the cleaning of the ore, the subject of assaying and the fear of loss on previous shipments.  There was no proof that copies of correspondence were not kept. Keeping of a formal diary must have been a matter within the discretion of the Superintendent.  Any attempt to link Burr with the miners’ strike was spurious.  In Ridgway v. The Hungerford Market Co. it was held that if a master had retained a servant in his employ after having taken cognizance of a fault, a condonation would be presumed and he (Fisher) contended that Ayers’ letter of 7 September was a full condonation of all former matters complained of.

[The letter is then printed.]

And yet the letter of dismissal was sent the very next day.

His Honour then summed up.

Mr Burr sought to recover damages for being unduly dismissed; he had been engaged for three years on conditions repeatedly detailed during the trial and his discharge without just cause after one year was the cause for the action.  The defendants denied the contract and in addition alleged various breaches of duty of which the jury had learnt from counsel and witnesses in justification of the dismissal.  He would dispose of the first plea that they did not enter into the contract and that Mr Kingston was not a Director when the contract was made.

His Honour read the letter of appointment and Mr Burr’s reply and called attention to Mr Ayers’ evidence concerning the letter and the Directors’ names.  The jury would have to decide the meaning of the document.

If they thought Mr Burr required or believed he had the security of the Company as well as the Directors, they would find for the plaintiff and if not, for the defendants.

He would have them consider whether the plaintiff was to make assays of the men’s samples as well as of the newly discovered ores.  It was clear assays were to be made, but not so clear by whom.  His Honour read to the jury Mr Ayers’ evidence on Burr’s duties, to perform the duties of Mr Chipman, and also Mr Burr’s letter stating his intention to engage Hoskins to do the drudgery.  The jury would have to decide whether Mr Burr considered it his duty to do the assaying.  His Honour scrutinised Mr Phillips’ calculations and deduced that the loss showing was so small that it did not bear out the charge of wilful negligence – still that was up to the jury to decide.

When it came to the charge of wrongfully and carelessly paying for ore below the recognised standard of 20%; was this charge made out to the jury’s satisfaction?  The lot of ore referred to came out at 19¾%.  Did this justify the plaintiff’s discharge?

Then came the charge of grossly negligent supervision of ore-dressing.  It appeared that a quantity of the ore was ordered to be redressed.  It was for the jury to decide if that redressing was necessary and if that necessity arose through negligence on the part of the plaintiff.

They would also have to consider the evidence about the state of the sieves and a letter was read to them from Mr Burr requiring a supply of wire.  It appeared to His Honour that this was the strongest charge against Mr Burra, but the jury had to decide if it justified his discharge.

As for the cottages – the point here was not whether the contract was improperly drawn, but that Mr Burr had permitted work to be continued after it was condemned and had paid money on it.

[There was further summing up on details of the cottages and on whether Burr had kept copies of his letters and had failed to keep a diary.]
