The Arts

A rare exhibition early in the year saw works by famous Australian artists including, Arthur Boyd, Russell Drysdale, Arthur Streeton and local painter Allyson Parsons.

The 6th Annual Antique Fair drew excellent crowds in May.

Allyson Parsons won the 1997 Victor Harbor Rotary Art Show’s open section prize worth $7,500.

Burra Quilters held its biennial exhibition in the Burra Art Gallery in May.

The Burra Railway Station – disused for some years – opened briefly as Delia Kraft’s Burra Railway Station Gallery.
