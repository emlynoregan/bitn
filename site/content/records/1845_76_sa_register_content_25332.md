Inquest & Obituary.

An inquest was held on 21 August at the Aberdeen Hotel into the death of John Mogford, hawker, whose body was found within a few miles of Gottlieb’s Well Head Station.

Vincent Hanson reported seeing the deceased about midday on Monday about two miles from Gottlieb’s.  Mogford was driving a spring cart and returned his greeting.  He had taken deceased for a half-caste; much discoloured about the face.  He went to the station and on returning about 40 minutes later met Morris Rayner going for Mr McCulloch.  He said deceased was lying on the road about two feet from his cart.  Hanson went to the body, helped to straighten it out and then went to the Survey Camp to consult Mr Elder who was in charge.  They put the body into his cart and went towards Gottlieb’s, but on hearing no one was there they started back to the camp.  Witness then went to Mr Goode of Canowie, the nearest JP.  He advised Mr Rayner to ride into Burra and report the death to the police.

Morris Rayner reported meeting the deceased’s cart with his body hanging over the near shaft with his right foot under the foot board.  Alfred Watson, a lad was with Rayner and Michael Dowd, a man, was walking about 100 yards behind.  He and Dowd lifted the body down to the ground.

Eliza Fisher of Burra said she had lived with the deceased for 15 years, but was not married to him.  He had been ailing for ten years from a liver complaint and sometimes had fits when he drank, which he did heavily.  Deceased had been away about five weeks, took no drink with him and had not seen a doctor for three years.

Dr William Henry Dashwood said he had known the deceased for several years, but never attended him professionally.  He had no hesitation is saying the man had died from apoplexy.

Lance Corporal W. Smith had attended when told of the incident.  He had found on him a bill, a comb, 32/6 in silver, a half-penny, three £1 notes, and orders on Elder, Smith & Co. as well as a letter addressed to J. Biglands, Peninsula, Port Adelaide.  His load had consisted of groceries, skins etc.

The verdict was that the deceased had died on 18 August of apoplexy.

[John Mogford died 18 August 1873 near Gottlieb’s Wells, residence Kooringa aged 61.]
