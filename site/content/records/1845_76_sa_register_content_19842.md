Kooringa News, 11 October

Election.  So far there is no sign of any other candidate than Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal and Gottlieb’s Wells.

Petty thefts seem to be on the increase.  One night last week the detached kitchen of Mr Dunstan’s at the White Hart Hotel was entered and half a bag of flour and a new broom were taken.  On Monday rations and other items were taken from a hut at Gum Creek.

On 8 October Mr McCulloch charged Michael Manning of Saddleworth with stealing 200 sheep from Princess Royal Station.  A few months ago Manning passed Princess Royal with a flock of sheep en route to the Barrier Ranges.  About this time 1,400 sheep were lost from Princess Royal.  Last week Manning returned with another flock and when at Gottlieb’s Wells word was sent to Mr McCulloch that a number of sheep with the Princess Royal ear mark were in the flock.  A warrant was issued.  Manning says he could produce a receipt for the sheep and also the man who sold them if given time.  The case was adjourned to 13 October and bail taken for his appearance.

Rev. Slatyer, deputation for the Bible Society preached on 7 October at the Wesleyan Chapel in the morning and the Primitive Methodist Chapel in the evening.
