Burra Art Gallery

Chairman of Goyder Council, Denis Keller officially opened the next stage of the development of the Burra Art Gallery recently at a special preview of the Russell Morrison exhibition.  He was welcomed by the retiring President of the McDouall Stuart Board, Judge Andrew Wilson.

The gallery building was originally constructed in 1860

It was used as the Kooringa Telegraph Station and Post Office for 100 years before the opening of the Post Office in Market Square.

After a 1993 petition with 450 signatures the Burra Burra DC purchased the building for use as an art gallery.

The Gallery Board was formed the following year to oversee the preparation of plans and to raise funds to restore the building.

To date more than $60,000 has been obtained from the State Government and half as much again is needed to finish the task.

Much is owed to the drive and vision of Susan Roche.

The Gallery was officially opened a year ago by Mr Kym Bonython.

In addition to the hard work of the Board the Gallery owes much to the input of its many volunteers, especially to Len Bence, Glenys Christopher and members of the local artistsâ€™ group and of course, to the former Burra Burra DC led by Graham Kellock.
