Maurice Collins replies to ‘Returned Soldier’ who, amid general matters on the guns, suggested that Collins should have done more to finish off work at the memorial in his position as Chairman of the Memorial & Roll of Honour Committee.  Collins points out that he only replaced E.W. Crewes in that position in December last and says that ‘soon after the war was over the Memorial Committee . . . slipped into a state of coma and I can assure you took a great deal of resuscitating as evidenced by the fact that the first meeting held by this body and after an interval of somewhere about four years, was held as before stated in December of last year.’

[This is a little harsh, as they did manage to get the Soldiers’ Memorial finished in 1922 before lapsing into the coma.]

He then goes on to accuse the ‘Returned Soldier’ of attacking the Council in a ‘dirty manner’ – reflecting on their loyalty.  He welcomes fair criticism and notes that the Council has now considered the input of the RSL.
