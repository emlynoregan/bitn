Local Board of Health

The Inspector said one or two cab drivers were unlicensed because he would not grant them one and he sought Council’s opinion on the matter.  Council confirmed its confidence in the Inspector’s judgement on fit and proper persons to have cab licences.

A sub-committee will investigate the desirability of a cab stand in front of Mr Simpson’s residence.

Shooting match, Wednesday.

Mr Mack 44 off the rifle & 52 with handicap
