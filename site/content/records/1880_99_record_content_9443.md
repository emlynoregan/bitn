Editorial on Waterworks for Burra.

Few places in SA are better supplied with good water naturally than Kooringa.  In Aberdeen the natural deficiency has been met by the lately extended Government Waterworks.  Redruth now seeks a similar boon, which no doubt will soon come.  The lower part of Kooringa is content with numerous shallow wells and only Market Square and Commercial Street with the hill to the west requires a water supply.  The town is so scattered and the houses so far apart that a general scheme will be both most costly and unnecessary.  A scheme a few years ago would have involved a general rate, but it was rejected, as the majority were unprepared to pay for what was required by only the few.  The case of Gawler with its very high rates proves that this was a wise decision.  We warn the whole body of ratepayers to be wary of this lest the great mass of people end up paying heavy rates beside their existing burden - for the benefit of the few.  Nevertheless it is evident that a further supply of water beyond the Market Square well (which has been very useful) is essential for the business area and upper part of Kooringa.  This is needed both for convenience and for fire protection.

Three or four schemes are before Council:

1.	Mr Hargraves scheme would supply the whole of Kooringa and cost more than would be wise in both initial cost and maintenance.

2.	Another would be so limited that only the Square would be served, apart from the water carts.  It would comprise simply tanks over the well in the Square.

3.	Then there is Mr Henderson’s scheme, which would seem to suit quite well.

4.	Finally there is an extension of the Aberdeen pipes.

This last scheme involves agreeing to the Government making 12½% on their outlay either by levying a rate, a Corporation payment, or private guarantee.  Besides this it is tacked onto the railway supply.

Now if a scheme can return 12½% to the Government it can do so for the Council, which can borrow at 6% and so make 6½% profit.  Moreover the Government does not get work done as cheaply as the Council so the cost to Council would be even less.  This would also remove the threat of a general rate being introduced.

Another plan available is for the Government to construct the scheme and then hand it over to the Council for local authorities to run at what profit they can get while paying the Government 3% of the cost of construction in year 1, 4%in the 2nd year and thereafter 5%.  This would remove the problem of obtaining the funds for construction.

The Council would have a say in the extent of the scheme and the working would be in their own hands.  This is the plan likely to be recommended by Government and a new well and tower could be provided between Kooringa and Aberdeen from which all portions of the town could be served.
