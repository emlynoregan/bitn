Burra Seaside Trip this year was held last Saturday in perfect weather.  Numbers were down, probably due to the Centenary Exhibition soon to be opened in Adelaide and to the number of other Centenary Celebration activities scheduled for this year.  A large number of the travellers spent time in the city and at the interstate cricket match.
