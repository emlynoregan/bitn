The Neales Flat Lutheran Congregation will celebrate the centenary of their worship centre at a 10.30 a.m. service on 26 August.  The church was dedicated on 12 December 1912 [as St John’s].  On 11 December 1966 the St John’s congregation joined the [adjacent St Paul’s congregation to form the] Trinity Church.  From then till 11 October 2009 [St John’s] building was used as a hall.  During this period it was used by the Neales Flat Lutheran Youth, the Agricultural Bureau, CFS, the Farmers’ Federation and others.  On 11 October 2009 the building was rededicated and became the Neales Flat Lutheran Church.
