Joseph Denton of Farrell’s Flat has earned a reputation as a successful water diviner for some time now on both the eastern and western sides of Burra.  He is an old resident of the district, being the second son of the late J. Denton of Aldinga and was born in 1869.  For a time he had a general store at two Wells and then went to Saddleworth where he joined Mr Partridge in his big business there.  He later opened a store at Waterloo in 1896 and subsequently gave its management to his brother and extended operations to Mintaro.  Afterwards he bought Mr Sexton’s business at Farrell’s Flat.  In 1899 he married and has two sons and two daughters.
