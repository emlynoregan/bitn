Roy Taplin, Burra’s Restoration Hero, is leaving the town.  Roy and his wife Brenda came to Burra in retirement in 2003.  Having established a home and garden, Roy offered himself as a volunteer to restore the interior of the Burra Town Hall.  As a master painter and decorator, Roy undertook major repairs as well as the beautiful redecorating work that transformed the building.  Roy then turned his attention to the Burra Railway Station.  Here Roy managed the huge restoration work, the majority of it single-handed.  The project was kicked off with a $200,000 government grant, which eventually grew to about $300,000.  Estimates for the restoration were $1 million.  Without Roy’s years of dedicated time and skill, the project could not have been completed.  Roy has given a magnificent gift to the town.  We wish Roy and Brenda contentment in their move to the city.
