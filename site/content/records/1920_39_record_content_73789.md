Voluntary Aid & Volunteer Service Detachments were formed in Burra at a meeting in the Lodge Room 24 January, when 70-80 people attended.

Mrs H.H. Dutton of Kapunda, Assistant Controller for Country Districts of Voluntary Aid Detachments and Supervisor of Volunteer Service Detachments, addressed the meeting.  Mrs Sandland Vice-President of the local Red Cross has only just returned from overseas where she saw the preparedness in England at the time of the recent crisis.  The Mayor Mr Kellaway introduced Mrs Dutton.

Members of the Voluntary Aid Detachment would be under military control.  Members are not paid and had to pass a series of exams – First Aid, Home Nursing, Gas Mask Drill, Motor Driving, Cooking, etc.

Volunteer Service Detachment recruits would not be required to go outside their home town, though they might be required to do the same work.

Dr Steele also spoke of the need for organisation in case of emergency.

Mrs Andrew Tennant was the Commandant for the VAD in this district – other officers will be chosen later.

Mrs D.M. Steele was the officer in charge of the VSD.

Motions to form both the VAD & VSD were passed.
