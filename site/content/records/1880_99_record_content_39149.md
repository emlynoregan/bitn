‘Ajax’s’ third letter to public men is directed to W.H. Hardy. Compared with the first two it is so kind that it looks suspiciously like Ajax might be Hardy.

‘You have been . . . anything but a failure.’

‘You have done your duty.’

‘I remember the commencement of your public career some two years ago . . . as a candidate for a seat in the Town Council . . . which you gained . . . by running rings around two or three others.’

‘You must admit that the question of the “classes v. the masses” has been rather too much in your line.’

There is a medium in all things and it would have been better ‘had you devoted a little more attention to the welfare of the “classes” - as you call them, and allowed the “masses” to look after themselves.’

When the time came for the masses to support you they let you down.

‘When the time comes for action when they can help to keep these gentry at bay . . . they have not the pluck to follow up their promises and support their own.’

‘I believe your heart is in the right place.’

‘I can say you have been for the last two years worthy of the confidence your supporters placed in you . . . altogether above bribery . . . straight without a sign of pander to anyone.’

‘No doubt you have faults, but really you know how to stifle them from me at any rate.’

‘You evidently thought a great deal of William H. Hardy at one time, but I am pleased to find you determined to remain on the same level as the “masses” you are so proud of.’

[This appeared in the issue immediately after Hardy lost the election for East Ward to George Parks whom he said was supported by legal and other prominent men.  It sounds very much like Hardy feeling sorry for himself.]
