Burra Town Council, 6 April

R. Fuss granted permission to erect an addition to Miss Ford’s house in Chapel St.

The motion re using the Miner’s Effigy (Johnnie Green) as a ‘silent cop’ was rescinded.

Cr Kellaway moved it be placed atop the new shelter shed on the Aberdeen Road.

Cr Woollacott said that was too low and it would lose its effect.  He moved an amendment that it be placed near the mine road on a high pedestal and point toward the mine.  Carried.

Various road and footpath matters were discussed, especially the never-ending debates over the proper way to make a tarred road or path.
