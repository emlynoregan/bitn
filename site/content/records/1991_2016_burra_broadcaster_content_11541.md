Burra Uniting Church has a new roof – replacing the original iron of 1914.  It has been replaced at a cost of more than $15,000 with full lengths of 10.1 m galvanised corrugated iron laid on the 52°pitch roof.  The gutters are 7.5 m above the ground and the apex of the roof is 18 m high.  The roof structure was found to be in excellent condition and under the flashings workers found the name of J. White & Son, the original workers.  The job was supervised by Paul Wilson, local building contractor.  [Photo.]
