Placer Exploration Ltd is commencing a drilling program in King Well and Barker’s Dam areas east of Burra.  A series of reconnaissance holes will be drilled at selected locations in the Hundreds of King and Rees and in the Out of Hundreds area immediately to their east.  Existing tracks will be used wherever possible and no earthworks or track construction is envisaged where tracks are not available.  Silver City Drilling has been contracted for the drilling using an aircore rig.  Drilling was expected to begin in mid-October and last about two weeks.  [Map printed.]
