Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Representatives of Commonwealth Social Services attended a Board of Management meeting to set out facts relating to the homes as required by the Government.  It is hoped to begin construction soon on 16 units.  The committee has purchased the block of land next to the Burra Hospital from the Hospital Board and the adjoining block from Mr J.G. Carpenter.  This will give room to duplicate the original set of units should demand warrant it.  It is understood the minimum age of admission will be 60 for women and 65 for men and other details regarding costs etc. are yet to be finalised.
