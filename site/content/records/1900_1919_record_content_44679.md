Editorial on The Holidays.

Burra was quiet with a rush of people to the seaside and elsewhere.  The weather was extremely hot, especially on 28 December, which ended with a long and severe thunderstorm and 65 points of rain.

On Wednesday another storm dropped 16 points.  On Monday 4 points fell in the town, but there was a deluge to the east in patches.  Koomooloo got 50 points and Woolgangi 32.

Business was brisk on Christmas Eve and Christmas day was very quiet.

New Year’s Eve was unusually quiet.  1916 arrived without any shouting or other noise – just a general wish for peace.

Miss Edith Cave again provided the Christmas tree at the Burra Hospital on 22 December.  The grounds were decked out in flags and Japanese lanterns.  A fine program of music accompanied the distribution of gifts.

Percy Fuss is about again after being critically injured in a train accident on 11 September.

Burra Boy Scouts.  17 members had a camp on Saturday at Princess Royal, by kind permission of Mr J. Tennant.

Mr J.T.F. Johnson, head of Burra School, has been moved to Moonta after 5 years.  He was active here in cricket and golf clubs and was a local preacher and Circuit Steward for the Kooringa Methodist Church.  He was also active in patriotic matters.  He is replaced by Mr C.J.W. Mundy.

J.P. Turley, for some years in charge of Drew & Crewes’ wood and chaff store, has gone to become manager of Mr Power’s station.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held their annual picnic at Sod Hut last Saturday and it was enjoyed by the smaller than usual number who went.
