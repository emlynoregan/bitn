‘Whom Do You Think’ writes agreeing that tennis should be revived in Burra, but not at Burra North.  Transport will remain a problem for some time to come and in any case the Lawn Tennis Club was never a financial success and the war merely provided its coup de grâce.  Courts must be erected at this end [i.e. the south end] of the town.

I also enquired about the hose and would like to know when the Centenary Funds are to be distributed and whether they might aid the tennis courts.

[The Editor considered that the likely writer under this name gave no practical physical support to the centenary, but it is only to be expected that he would be anxious to assist in spending the profits.]
