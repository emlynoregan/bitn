Décor Made Easy has opened its third showroom – this one in Clare, with the other two being in Burra and Jamestown.  The new showroom is at 28 Old North Road, formerly the conference room directly behind the ANZ Bank.  The new showroom was an opportunity to give Décor Made Easy the ability to show a wider range of products, and move them around between the three branches, said Stephen Angel.
