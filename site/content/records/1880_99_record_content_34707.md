Shearers & Sheep-Owners met at the Institute last Friday to try to settle outstanding differences.   Among the graziers present were: Goode (Canowie), Loudon (Booborowie), Scott (Quondong), Sandland (Koonoona), Warwick (Hallett), Riggs (Baldina), Gebhardt (Mackerode), Killicoat (Abberton Park), and many more.

The ASU was well represented.  The price for ewes, wethers and lambs was set at 17/6 per 100 and rams at 35/- per 100, plus board, or where the shearer provides rations, at 20/- & 40/- per 100.  Other aspects of the agreement and working rules are printed in an article extending for a full column.
