Burra Picnic Race Meeting drew a good crowd on Saturday to Thistlebeds.  President John Oates said that entries were down a little this year, but there was a good roll-up for the gymkhana events.  The crowd was c. 400 with Burra Golf Club members serving c. 100 breakfasts on Sunday morning, many having camped out overnight.  The sleepy lizard derby was as popular as ever with eight lizards in the field.
