Aberdeen Post Office

Inspector Skinner has visited and noted that the revenue at Aberdeen for 1912 was £312 and from January to September 1913 was £230.  An official P.O. cannot be granted with revenue of less than £400.  At that level a building would be rented and at £500 an office would be built.  He thought he could remedy the closing of the office at certain hours and could arrange delivery if letters received were 100 a day.  This is of course merely stating the regulations.
