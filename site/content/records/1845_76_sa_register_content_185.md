Letters of Fiat Justitia No. 9: To the Commercial Mining Speculators

[The writer says both individual people and commercial communities have fits of insanity and the crisis point in such fits is termed ‘a panic’.  At such times there is an absence of thought, feeling and expression, except for the one prevalent illusion, which becomes all absorbing.  He recalls in England panics in 1819, 1825 and 1837.  He fears the present discovery of mines in South Australia will lead to extended embarrassment and ultimate ruin.  The scramble to invest in ‘The Mining Association’ is an invitation to partake in a wild gambling scramble after sudden wealth.  He fears the reaction in South Australia, the result of the inevitable losses and consequential ruin, will be more pronounced because capital is so limited and property subject to more extreme fluctuation.

Merchants and traders need to realise that their own businesses require all their capital, their energy, their industry and prudence.  If there is surplus capital it should be invested in areas where the merchants’ own knowledge or experience is greatest.

That the sums required for the purchase of the Special Survey could have been wisely abstracted from the resources of the merchants involved is beyond belief.

This is the course of gamblers.

Fiat Justitia does not doubt the discoveries are important or that their value is great, but holds that they need more capital to make then profitable than this limited community can afford.]
