Letter

I am not a personal friend of Dr Nesbitt and neither am I a banker, banker’s clerk, clergyman nor one of the doctor’s late committee.  I can give an impartial opinion and having watched this debate from the start I have reached the following conclusions:

Dr Nesbitt was right to take his complaint to his superior officer, Dr Gosse, as the District Council is not being recognised by the Board of Health.

He might have brought the matter to the attention of Captain Saunders because of his position in the Mine relative to the houses in question.  I am inclined to think he never thought of such a course.

Dr Nesbitt has no personal or mean motives in this controversy – it is, after all, more to his advantage than otherwise if people are sick.

It is evident that Dr Cave was once of Dr Nesbitt’s opinion with respect to the sickness in Paxton Square, but because of his position as Mine Surgeon is anxious to keep in favour with Captain Sanders and so gave up his manliness and now says what Captain Sanders tells him to say.

Is it not strange that Dr Cave, Dr Dashwood, Captain Sanders and ‘A Lover of Fair Play’ should all send in letters at the same time, taking the same view?

I can understand Captain Sanders and Mr West becoming annoyed at a suggestion of neglect of duty on their part, though I do not think that was Dr Nesbitt’s intention.  I an sure the inhabitants of the Square are grateful for Dr Nesbitt’s course, which has resulted in the company improving their homes.

The inhabitants of Kooringa are fortunate to have secured the services of so able a gentleman; a man of independent character whose social life is above reproach.  I regret that the matter has become so personal.

‘Another Lover of Fair Play’
