Opening of the Burra Burra Miners’ & Mechanics’ Institute

This ceremony took place on 27 August.  A tea meeting took place at 4 o’clock.  It was well attended and was considerably enlivened by various hymns and pieces sung by both English and German choristers.  After tea R.B. Robinson took the chair.

Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson, secretary of the Provisional Committee of the Institute, read his report.

The Committee cannot but congratulate members on the success that has attended their undertaking.  Sufficient funds have been raised in sixteen months from the initial meeting to warrant the erection of the building in which we are assembled this evening and in which your Committee hope to see large numbers of the inhabitants daily assembled for the purpose of improving their minds and advancing their social position.  This institution will bring such information within the reach of every man, however humble his lot.

‘The Burra Institute has been designed and erected to meet the wants and to increase the comforts of the poorest and humblest individual in the district…it is not, as some have supposed, intended for the exclusive use of those already possessed of ample means, and who have received in early life a liberal education.’

Up to this date a sum of more than £700 has been deposited in the Union Bank in Adelaide to the credit of the Institute and an equal sum has been placed on the Government estimates in favour of the same.

The contractors for the building will have to be paid £920.  This leaves £480 to pay for the tables and seats, to increase the stock of books and to meet a portion of the cost of lighting, firing and attendance for the first year.

Subscriptions of members will also assist.  The Directors of the SA Mining Association have generously promised £20 and the Manager of the English & Australian Company’s Works will also assist.  Books to the value of £35 have been ordered.  H.S. Price of Canowie has ordered an additional £20 worth and will donate them to the Institute and Mr G.S. Kingston has made a similar promise.  15 papers and magazine are being sent regularly from England.  At present there are 74 subscribers of £1 and upwards.  The services of Mr W.H. Birbeck have been secured as Librarian.  Your Committee is also glad to acknowledge the interest and encouragement of His Excellency the Governor.   He has also enrolled his name among the subscribing members and has accepted the office as President of the Institute.

Rev. J.G. Wright moved the report be adopted and T.W. Powell seconded.  Mr Powell said he had tried to form an Institute eight years previously, but had failed.  The motion was carried unanimously.

Rev. Thomas Hillman moved the following be appointed officers of the Institute.  D. Mackay seconded and it was carried unanimously:

The Chairman called on Mr John Howard Clark to address the meeting.  He spoke on the usefulness of Institutes.

Various votes of thanks followed and the meeting ended with ‘God Save the Queen’ sung by the German choristers.

Several of those present entered their names as subscribers.  About 250 attended.
