Locust Spraying.  The State Government is committed to protecting SA agriculture from plague locusts.  It has committed $750,000 to an aerial spraying program.  Spraying will start in the Upper north, where areas around Quorn are badly affected.  Areas affected include Peterborough, Orroroo, Melrose, Wilmington, Quorn, Carrieton, Craddock and Hawker.  The aim is to hit them before they move south into cropland as well as to protect the pastoral zone.
