Peace Thanksgiving Service was held last Sunday in the Institute.  The hall was packed for the united service with many returned men in uniform occupying the reserved seats at the front.  The cold, wet, boisterous weather caused a move to the hall from the planned meeting in Market Square.  E.W. Crewes, Mayor, presided.  On the platform were Rev. H.H. Hopton (Anglican), Rev. D.B. Bridgwood & Rev. G.K. Haslam (Methodist), Capt. Hammitt (Salvation Army) and the Burra Cheer-up Ladiesâ€™ band conducted by G.E. Dane.  Thanksgiving services were also held in the local churches.
