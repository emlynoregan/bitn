Burra Town Council, 19 May

Burra CWA has written to Council concerning the possibility of making the Lodge Room at the Institute into a CWA Rest Room.  Council appointed a committee to investigate same.

The Hon. Secretary of the Burra Library Committee wrote complaining of congestion at the entrance to the Institute on picture nights.  The picture proprietor will be asked to open both doors instead of one and have the gangway policed.

The Burra Burra DC has offered to sel the Slag heap Paddock to the Town Council at £6 per acre, providing satisfactory access was left at the the western portion and the ground was turned into a sports ground within five years.

The Clerk advised that the tenants had vacated the Institute cottage.  Resolved that the cottage be inspected.

It was decided to tar the footpaths in front of Sara’s, the barbers and the Royal Exchange Hotel at Burra North.
