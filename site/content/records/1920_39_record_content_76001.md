A deputation from the Burra Tree Planting Committee waited on Council.  Mr R. Fairchild said the committee had been formed in June and intended financing the trees and guards and wanted to plant Council reserves near the Bon Accord Hotel, along the creek near the bridge and past the railway reserve.  Also those near the Aberdeen Croquet green & Sara’s, that near the Mine Bridge and a little block near Mr Kellaway’s.  Mrs E.F. Marston undertook to defray the cost of planting Lane Garden.

R.H. McWaters spoke in support.  The Mayor supported the idea.

Mr Fairchild said the plan was first to plant gums along the creek.  It was also intended to plant some willows 10-12ft high.

Cr Samuel asked about almond trees, but Mr Fairchild said some residents were opposed to almond trees.

It was resolved that Cr Villis & Cr Reed meet with the committee with power to grant permission to plant as long as the Council was not financially involved.

The Mayor drew attention to the hand-printed document by the late George Hann concerning Armistice Day, which was hanging on the wall.  It had been sold by the Bugler System soon after the end of the Great War and bought by the late Mr W.I. Short for over £130.  When Mr Short died recently Mrs Smith handed it over to the Council in memory of Mr & Mrs Short.  It was certainly a valuable item in the history of Burra.

Cr Samuel moved a minute of appreciation be entered including the names of Mr & Mrs Short and of Mr George Hann.

The Mayor said that in response to a letter from the Premier’s Office he had appointed Mr M.W. Bednall to act to keep in touch with the Central Committee concerning Civil Defence in an emergency.  Council endorsed this action.

Following a letter from North Ward ratepayers it was decided to relocate one of the two lights near Mr Bett’s bakehouse to Railway Terrace.

The general rate for the coming year 1939-40 was declared at 2/9.

Arrangements are to be made with the Bank of Australasia for an overdraft facility of £650.

Several minor works were approved.

‘Snake Gully’ Dance at Hanson in aid of a supper room for the hall.  (The coppers for boiling water at this stage were outside in the rain.)
