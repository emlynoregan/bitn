He considered that a £5 franchise would place political rights in the hand of every industrious man and would not disqualify any honest or virtuous male adult.

Mr Burgess craved the attention of the meeting that he might remind them that the effect of the resolution must be to disqualify fully two-thirds of the inhabitants of Kooringa.  One half of the young men present at the meeting would be disqualified by it.  It would disqualify the respected son of their much esteemed chairman.

The Chairman said: ‘Serve him right.  He should qualify.’  (Roars of laughter.)

Mr Burgess asked whether the inhabitants of the creek would be more honest, industrious, thrifty and intelligent if they were translated from their humble habitations to the best houses in the town.

He might not entertain views in accordance with the majority, but nevertheless he would move an amendment in favour of universal suffrage.  He also pointed out that a number of men resided by agreement in substantial houses owned by the Copper Company and occupied without a lease and without the payment of rent.  They would be disqualified under the £5 criterion.

Mr Lang reminded then that the original wording was that the occupied premises had merely to be worth £5 annually.  Mr Burgess pointed out that the valuation would be difficult to establish as there was no assessment in the town.  In any case he believed universal suffrage was the inherent right of the race.

He therefore moved his amendment: ‘That all residents in the borough 21 years of age and untainted with crime should enjoy the franchise.’

Mr Budd admitted that at home [i.e. in the UK] he was a Chartist, but that was very different from being a Red Republican.  He supported Rev. Burgess’ remarks.  All had the right to the franchise whether they were without a sixpence in their pockets, or the opulent lords of broad acres.  He seconded the amendment.

Rev. Pollitt spoke in favour of an educational test for the franchise.  He doubted the wisdom of giving the vote to those who were illiterate, who neglected the education of their children, and who were ‘regardless of their character here or their fate hereafter’.

‘He was certain that no honest and industrious man need be six months in the colony until he could qualify under the resolution.’

Mr Pearce addressed questions to the last speaker through the chair.

Could more than two-thirds of the population of the Burra townships read and write?  And if not should the remainder be disenfranchised?  Would occupants of houses of annual value of £5 be disenfranchised if they could not read and write?

Mr Pearce said there were many intelligent young men living in Kooringa who chose to live in lodgings as best suiting their needs at the present.  He suggested it was unjust to disenfranchise a young man who might be saving money for a marriage or whose wife had not yet followed him to his new place of employment.

Mr Pearce supported universal suffrage as in the amendment.

Rev. Cheetham also supported the amendment for similar reasons.

The Chairman said he disapproved of universal suffrage.

When the proposals were put 48 supported the amendment and 29 supported the resolution.

The amendment was declared carried.

Mr Burgess then proposed: ‘That to protect the electors in the free enjoyment of the franchise, and to prevent bribery or intimidation being resorted to, the mode of election should be by ballot.’

He had heard the secret ballot denounced as un-English and unmanly.  Nevertheless it was used in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in the clubs, to elect committees in the House of Commons and by the Masons and Oddfellows.  He had known an instance where an elector went 20 miles to vote against his conscience, but by adopting the ballot such a thing could not occur in SA.  Mr Morgan seconded the motion.

Mr Gollin in supporting the motion referred to the local situation and the possibility of many hesitating to vote against a candidate nominated by the Directors of the Mining Company if the voting was not secret.  He also referred to cases of buying votes ‘at home’.

The Chairman was strongly opposed to the ballot.  No man should conceal an honest opinion and no man could be called free and independent who was afraid or ashamed to avow his principles.  A man should express his vote in the face of day and court enquiry for his own reputation.  If the electors wanted to operate under a cloak of secrecy, why should not their representatives do the same when voting?  (As did the deputies in France.)

The danger of persecution for an honest exercise of the franchise was greatly overstated.

The motion was carried on a show of hands.

Mr Pollitt then moved: ‘That this meeting would beg to suggest to the Lieutenant-Governor that, in the division of the colony into electoral districts, the claims of those townships to a representation equal to the proportional number of inhabitants may be considered.’  Mr Gollin seconded the motion.

It was carried unanimously.

Mr Harris then moved: ‘That a memorial, founded on the foregoing resolutions, be prepared and forwarded to the Lieutenant-Governor, and advertised in the newspapers, and that a subscription be entered into to defray the necessary expenses.’  Seconded by Mr Brannon and carried without dissent.

A vote of thanks to Mr Lang was carried by acclamation.  Mr Burgess observed that had the meeting been called for 6 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. it would have been necessary to adjourn to the open air.
