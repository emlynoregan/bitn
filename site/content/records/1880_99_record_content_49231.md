The state was in a strained and unsatisfactory financial condition.

There was a depression of trade and a large amount of poverty.

Some said class dissatisfaction was the cause, but it was a symptom or effect not the cause.  The problems have been due to many causes, but speculation in land was one – too many were trying to live on the toiler – to get rich without contributing.  What is needed is a more just distribution of wealth, an absence of demoralizing competition and shorter hours of toil.
