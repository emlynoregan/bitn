Railway Tariffs.  A meeting was held at the Institute on Monday evening to lobby for a decrease in the railway tariffs for stock.  Too much stock still walks to market because of the high charges for railway transport.  A long letter from H.E. Bright Jun. of Gawler outlines the issues.  A memorial for presentation to Parliament is being prepared and will be presented about the end of July.
