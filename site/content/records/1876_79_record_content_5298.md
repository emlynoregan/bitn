Mayoralty Election. 
At a meeting at Broad’s in Aberdeen the Mayor accused the Record of misrepresenting him [in an unspecified matter.] He saw the future work for the Council principally in footpaths and streets. 
A plan for a suitable building for the cemetery was in the office. [Probably the mortuary chapel plan previously prepared by F.W. Holder.] He was prepared to give moderate, but not lowest salaries. 
Sir Henry Ayers had twice been written to about ground for the cemetery and a favourable reply might be anticipated. 
He was not sure they could get a Town Clerk, Inspector and Surveyor all for £100 p.a.  A ratepayer complained that he could have done much better and saved a lot of money, but in fact the ratepayer was one of those who had cost the Corporation so much money in the first 18 month’s of the Corporation’s existence. 
He then gave some figures relevant to the Corporation’s first 18 month’s. 
Rates Received 	£602- 5- 6

[*This figure doesn’t seem to me either to add up or to make any sense. The total 
approximates what you get if you add up the whole list of the numbers above including the 
balance in line 3 — which is also a penny out.]

This shows the ‘loss to the town through these Robinites’
