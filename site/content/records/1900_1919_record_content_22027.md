Snow.  It was bitterly cold on Sunday with a heavy fall of snow on Monday morning.  Small fry indulged in snowballing and so did old fry.  Snowmen were manufactured.  One misdirected snowball broke a window of Stan Laneâ€™s shop in Market Square.  Many horse baulked completely at the white surface.  By about 9 a.m. the thaw was general, though some remains on the hills in places yet.  About 2 p.m. a very heavy fall occurred, but by then the ground was too warm to retain it.
