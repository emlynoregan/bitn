title: The expenditure has largely been on capital works, which in other countries
  has been done by private individuals, (railways, telegraph lines, harbours, jetties,
  public buildings etc.)  There is ample security for such borrowings.  Contrast this
  with the UK taxpayer, which supports an unproductive army and navy.  We should be
  concerned less with reducing taxes and more with increasing the equity with which
  they are levied.
