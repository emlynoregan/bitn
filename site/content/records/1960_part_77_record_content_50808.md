Mid North Football League.  Plans are in hand to write the History of the Mid North Football League.  Mr A.E. Bannear has undertaken the task and seeks co-operation of the clubs.  Minute books from 1923 have been examined.  Records from the period before 1923 are sought and players of the past with stories to tell should contact the League Secretary.
