The Copper Market.  A report from Liverpool dated 25 August cites Burra Burra and Kapunda copper at £99-£100 per ton.  The recent low prices for copper have resulted in reduced production from mines around the world and some have closed; the prices obtained not meeting the costs of production.  Inevitably supplies will be limited for some time and that makes prospects for the article favourable.
