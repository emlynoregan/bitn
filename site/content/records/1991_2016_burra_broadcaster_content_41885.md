Hallett.  A new tourism and social precinct was unveiled at Hallett on Friday 22 July.  A Regional Development Australia Fund grant for a project that totalled $155,000 was able to convert an underused site in the centre of Hallett into a tourism and picnic precinct.  The project opposite the Minimart involved the demolition of an unsightly CFS building, the installation of a new toilet, paths, landscaping and a carpark and bike wash-down facility.  (Hallett is on the Mawson Trail).  [5 photos.]
