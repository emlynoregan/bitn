Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.

The committee met on Thursday evening.  Representatives came from the districts except for I.J. Warnes (Mt Bryan) & W.S. Murray (Booborowie) who were unable to consult their respective Councils in time.

It was resolved:

The memorial will take the form of a monument in Market Square, subject to Burra Town Council approval.

The structure will be marble or granite or both, surmounted by a life-sized bronze statue of an Australian Infantryman.

Space will be allotted for the names of fallen soldiers from each of the following districts if so desired: Corporation of Burra, DCs of Burra, Hanson, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Apoinga, & Booborowie.  The classification of names will be left to a sub-committee

Applications will be called for competitive designs for a cost not to exceed £2,000 with a prize of £10-10-0 for the approved design.  Designs are to be in to the Hon. Sec, Mr Dane by 10 Nov. 1919.

The Burra Corporation’s approval will be sought for a suitable site.

The Editor of The Record will be approached to stimulate contributions by a weekly appeal in the paper’s columns.
