Christmas Tree

Mrs Sidney Dowling of the Burra Hotel organised a Christmas tree at the Institute attended by nearly 400 of the townâ€™s children and their parents.  Her idea at first envisaged a treat for about 40, but it grew and grew.  Admission was by invitation only.  The overture was played by Messrs Rosman & Murison at 7.45 p.m. with Father Christmas due at about 8.05 p.m.  Ten little girls entertained them in the interim.  When Father Christmas arrived presents were snipped off the tree and distributed as the name of the recipient was called.  They also received a bag of lollies, some fruit and an ice cream.  A sprinkling of adults was included in the process.  Refreshments followed.  Thanks were expressed on behalf of everyone by Father Cullinan & Rev. Lawson.
