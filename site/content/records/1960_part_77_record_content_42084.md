Leighton Public Hall Committee under the Chairman Mr Rod Bailey & Secretary Tom Lynch, recently had the hall painted outside and completed repairs inside.  Stage curtains have been fireproofed.  The building is used once a month for a dance.  When the present debt is paid the next project is a new toilet block.
