E.T. Howell writes from Georgetown re the northern mail conveyances.

The horses used are half-fed and often so leg weary that they can barely start the coach.  The roads are such heavy going that a team of good horses would struggle to do a ten mile stage and yet these stages are 19-20 miles.  The cruelty and delays are all blamed on the state of the roads, but that is well known and the contractors should be prepared to meet such difficulties.  Drivers are also lacking in civility and offer no help either with finding accommodation for the passengers or their luggage.
