Curlew Mine

A collection of specimens worth c. £100 was seen at F. Harris’s shop on Friday from Curlew Mine.

From a small area at the mine last week gold worth c. £200 was recovered.  It was in a lode about 3 ft wide, but the gold-bearing portion is only 6 inches wide.

The syndicate includes: T.H. Villis, Eddy Finch, H. Morgan & Mr & Mrs G.B. Morgan.

Another lot from a lode about 60 ft away was richer with coarser gold valued at c. £200.  Mr H. Lewis is managing Curlew and Mr T. Villis is the principal shareholder.
