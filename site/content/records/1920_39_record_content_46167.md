Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Everything was then considered in abeyance till the arrival of the Dorset.  Late next day however, Mr Graham received a message from Mr Giles and was told by him that two other parties had come forward with £5,000 each and unless Graham and the original proprietors could come up with £10,000 by 10 a.m. the next day (Thursday) he would claim the survey in conjunction with those parties. Though Mr Graham failed to do so, it seems Giles and the two new parties failed to come to a definite arrangement.  Bunce & Penny came forward with £1,000 each to Mr Giles.  Giles said he had to talk to the other parties and met them at the Bank of SA.

Captain Bagot on leaving the Bank met Bunce & Graham and said the original party had one chance: raise £10,000 by noon Saturday.  Bagot and his party would then retire and leave them and the SA Company with the survey.

By noon on Saturday they had raised £9,200.  Giles (Manager of the SA Company), Aston & Bagot proceeded to the Colonial Treasury and tendered two cheques for £10,000 each, but that of the SA Company was not endorsed by the bank and was therefore not held to be legal.  The original proprietors had by then raised the money and offered to merge with Aston & Bagot, but the latter felt they were still pledged to the SA Company and failed to respond.

At a meeting of the directors of SAMA on 19 August 1845 the directors were asked to try to merge with the men who held a moiety of the special survey.  After a meeting with these men the directors reported on 23 August that those men would join the Association on terms:

The proprietors of the Survey should be repaid the amount subscribed by them for the purchase of the survey, viz £8,500 in scrip certificates of the Association at par.

The additional capital of c. £2,000 should be raised by the proprietors of the survey and scrip holders of the Assoc. taking scrip at par in proportion to their respective interest.  Proportion of additional capital taken the proprietors is £1,605 and scrip-holders £120.  Cross subscribed capital would then be £12,320.

Mr Peacock reported that with Stocks, Beck, Hagen & Paxton, also members of the Special Survey moiety they had gone into rules and regulations considered necessary for the government of the association to be submitted to scrip holders.  Peacock then said the trust deed as revised by the solicitors had been considered by his committee and those members of special survey proprietors and considered satisfactory.

A subsequent meeting of scrip holders accepted this.  On 25 August the following were appointed directors: Charles Beck, William Paxton, James Bunce, William Peacock, John Benjamin Graham, Emanuel Solomon, John Bentham Neales, Christopher Septimus Penny and Samuel Stocks Jnr.
