Burra Mine

Captain Sanders report on 8 July.

Morphett’s Shaft is down nearly 13 fathoms below the 70 and by the end of September we hope to reach 85 fathoms.  At that level crosscuts will be made to the east and west lodes.

In driving east towards Tinline’s Lode the ground is now easier.

Driving north at the 70 we are nearing Waterhouse’s Shaft in a promising lode.

The crosscut running west at the 60towards Peacock’s Air Shaft is in hard rock with bad air and air pipes are being put in.

Sulphurets are taking the place of carbonates at depth.

The clearing of Roach’s Shaft below the 60 continues, but because we have to haul water, mud and stuff 80 fathoms with a windlass and wheel, to Peacock’s, we are not making the progress we could wish.

Ayer’s is being cleaned from the 50 upwards.  We have been down from the surface to the 20, where it is full of stuff, which fell in from the surface when the top of the shaft was removed.  Eventually we hope for some tribute pitches here.

By the end of the month we hope to have Bunce’s Shaft down far enough to crosscut east and west towards the lodes.

Open work is being pushed on as fast as possible with the number of hands at our disposal, but some are frequently leaving for higher wages for short term jobs in well-sinking etc.

We have secured nine Cornish miners from a recent arrival at Port Adelaide.
