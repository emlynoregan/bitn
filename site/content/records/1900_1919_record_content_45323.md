Burra Hall.

The tablet bearing the name of the hall was unveiled by the Mayor of the town, Mr E.W. Crewes, on Saturday morning at the request of the Society’s President, Mr W.J. Sowden.  The donations from the Burra Town and District roughly equalled the cost of the hall and their contribution was being acknowledged by naming it the Burra Hall.  The hall will also contain a picture of the great demonstration at Burra on Carnival Day, which was opened by the Governor.  Mr Crewes gave a stirring speech.  Burra Cheer-up Society had now raised £1,500 in cash. Of which about £360 had been invested to help local boys in particular.  In the district about £15,500 had been raised for the war effort by various agencies and funds.  Lately they had concentrated on the local hospital and had raised c. £600 for it.  [‘They’ here means the community rather than the Cheer-up Society.]  Some 300 men had now enlisted from the District.  The tablet was unveiled.  Under the direction of H.J. Henderson it had been artistically prepared from Burra copper.
