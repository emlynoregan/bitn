Burra Football Association

A special meeting of delegates was held 19 August with S. Kellaway as Chairman.  He was disgusted at the way one club had sabotaged the picking of a team to go to Peterborough so that with excuses and refusals to go the team had to be picked three times involving hours of work and also the difficulties with transport.  There had also been defamatory remarks about the sobriety of the team and as a result one parent refused to allow her son to go.  As a father of two of the players he strongly objected to the remark that the team picked was a ‘pack of drunks’.  Mr Rosewall said the whole trouble of a weak team and the transport had been due to the Aberdeen Club not fulfilling its obligations.  No one could cast a reflection on the team’s sobriety.

Mr Morgan of Aberdeen said that he had promised two cars, but when their own team had turned down the trip he kept his cars at home.
