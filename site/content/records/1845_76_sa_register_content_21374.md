Obituary.  Anthony Evans died at Llwchwr near Redruth on 23 November aged 104, in the house of his daughter Mrs Edwards.  He was born at Llanelly in South Wales on his fatherâ€™s farm, where he worked until he was 24.  He then married and worked then at a furnace in the smelting works at Llanelly for 28 years.  He then moved to Swansea and continued to work there at the smelters until aged 85.  At that time his daughters, Mrs Edwards and Mrs Morris of Port Adelaide, with their husbands and families, being employed by the English & Australian Copper Company to come to SA, brought him with them, with the consent and assistance of the company.  On his arrival he obtained employment at the Smelting Works as a watchman for 22/- a week.  He held the appointment at a reduced wage until his 98th year.  Being then unable to do much walking he retired and the company paid him 15/- a week until he died.  Had she survived his eldest daughter would have been nearly 80 and the youngest is about 50.  His wife died when he was 65, so he has been a widower for almost 40 years.  At the time of his death he had 118 descendents.  He was a man of very regular habits and drank no intoxicating beverages except sparingly of ale and beer.  He took care to vote at each election.  He died quietly at breakfast time, expiring before Dr Dashwood arrived.
