Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 11 Feb.  Dealt with the petition to the Government re the Bon Accord Bridge.

The bridge it said was required because:

The present crossing is inconvenient, annoying and dangerous.

The road is used heavily for stock sales every fortnight and by wheat traffic.  The present crossing is small, unprotected and dangerous to life and stock in time of flood

The Town council has inspected the site and is unanimous in saying the work is a matter of urgency.

Twenty-five copies to be printed and 100 circulars for distribution.

The Railway Commissioners wrote to say a man would be sent to report on the dangerous crossing at the Bon Accord.

Ordinary Meeting, 16 Feb.

The Mayor reported that the Bon Accord memorials had been printed and everything was ready for collecting signatures.

Cr Rabbich asked if the obstruction in the watercourse at Messrs Bagot, Shakes and Lewis’s sheep yards had been removed.

The Mayor said that Mr Lockyer had cleaned the watercourse, but Mr Lewis had not.

Cr Sampson moved to have information laid against Sara & Dunstan for destroying kerbing in front of the new Elder, Smith & Co. offices and for having verandah posts obstructing the footpath.  Not 2nd.

Cr Sampson then called attention to the contractors having promised to restore the footpath in front of the same offices and it had not been done.

Cr Watt told him to wait until the work was finished.

Cr Sampson’s next motion to instruct the contractors to make the footpath good was not 2nd.

He then tried to make an issue of the contractors leaving rubbish and timber in the watertable, but this also failed to get support.

Cr Sampson then turned to Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s failure to remove the obstruction from the watercourse.  The Council had authority to do the work and charge the company for it.  Not 2nd.

He moved then that the Mayor interview Mr Lewis as soon as possible with reference to the matter.  Carried.
