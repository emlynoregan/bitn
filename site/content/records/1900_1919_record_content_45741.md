‘Ratepayer’ writes condemning any move to shift the court house from Redruth.  Repairs must be cheaper than ongoing rent.  Quietness would be out of the question in Pearce’s Building with three nearby garages.  The present location is quieter, has good areas for horses and vehicles, has four hotels for accommodation and is nearer the station.
