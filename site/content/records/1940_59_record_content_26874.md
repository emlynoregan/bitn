Burra Town Council, 3 June

Cr Harvey was farewelled after six years’ service.  A minute of appreciation was recorded and congratulatory speeches given.  There will be a public tribute on 14 June.  Councillors regretted that Cr Harvey was leaving the town.  [Details in ⅔ column.]

The Fire Brigades Board estimated the cost of the station for twelve months at £414 – an increase of £51 due to increased equipment costs.

Council voted not to have special lighting for the Victory Weekend.
