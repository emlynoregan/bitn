Burra Community & Sports Club AGM Report from President R.W. Secomb.

It has been a relatively quiet year for expenditure.  We have built a new coach’s box on the oval for $2.216 and sealed the ‘new’ netball court with a Colour Court preparation for $3,008.  The Hanson Soldiers’ Memorial Hall Committee has generously loaned their piano to the Sports Club.  The Ladies Auxiliary has been busy with catering and raised over $7,000 above their own requirements and this has been transferred to our funds.  Trevor Wall has again done a great job as the bar manager and has handed over nearly $7,500 to the General Committee.  We have 250 sheep on Redbanks Reserve and have tailed approximately 250 lambs so this should return a worthwhile income.

Elected were: President, Paul Wilson; Vice-President, Jeff White; Secretary, Cynthia Robinson; Treasurer, Di Day and Administrator, Des James.
