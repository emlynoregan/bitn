Pat Bolam writes of visiting Burra after a long absence.  She lived in the town in the 1930s and is very pleased to see the beautification of the creek and the Heritage Trail and the restoration of the Paxton Cottages.  She speaks of Burra in the early 1930s mentioning:

Walking to Copperhouse to visit relatives who lived there – the Robins.

The visit of Smithy and his ‘Southern Cross’ when he gave joy flights foe 30/- and of Pat Hogan who managed the Shell Depot and got a free flight for having arranged the refuelling and for putting up a wind sock.

Walking to St Joseph’s Church on Sunday across the Mine Paddock, with dire warnings about taking care.
