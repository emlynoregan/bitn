Burra National Trust has raised concerns re the grinding of the slate footpaths in Market Square.  The grinding is to reduce the danger of tripping pedestrians.  Council director of operations, Peter Bowden said the grinding was the first step.  The longer term is to further smooth the ground surface, age them chemically and fill in open joints with flexible grout.  Apparently no heritage advice had been taken.
