Special Meeting of SA Mining Association

The Chairman Mr Beck listed the topics on the agenda.  He noticed a gentleman present connected with the Register and remarked that he thought those present would agree that it was a private meeting.  He requested the production of a voting certificate and to his astonishment it was produced.  No further objection was raised.\

It was agreed unanimously on a proposal by Mr Graham, seconded by Captain Allen, that the qualifications of directors be reduced to 20 scrip (of £5 each).

Mr Neales moved to do away with the existing voting monopoly which allowed one vote per scrip.  He proposed:	1 scrip	1 vote

5	2

10	3

20	4

30	5

40	6

50	7

60	8

80	9

100	10

And for every 25 more 1 vote with scrips to be registered 14 days before voting.  Seconded by Mr Stocks.  Mr Mildred was opposed.  Mr Neales explained that on a previous occasion when the majority of scrip-holders had wished for his election, he had been dumped because every person lumping for himself gave him no chance.  Mr Peacock thought the old plan worked well.

Considerable confusion followed and Mr Peacock rose and seemed to justify his conduct.  Mr Bruce objected to the Register’s representative taking notes – especially if it were with a view to publication.  Mr Neales begged the gentleman to continue taking notes and anyone else also, to expose the rank jobbery of the meeting.  A majority of scrip-holders seemed to approve of our reporter’s presence and he claimed the right to be there by virtue of his voting certificate and that right being assented to by the chair, how could they prevent his taking notes.

Mr Neales was particularly keen to ensure the registration of votes 14 days previous to the time appointed to vote and thus to prevent the system of jobbing.  Any system worked badly if it put a candidate at the bottom of the poll who had a majority of votes.  Mr Peacock said Mr Neales had spoken untruths.  Mr Neales said he did not speak of a man’s personal character.  He alluded to his capacity for office.  A show of hands indicated that the voting should remain unaltered.  It was subsequently put to a ballot.  The majority in favour of the old system was 480.  Mr Neales facetiously remarked: ‘Ay, it’s just as I said one large shareholder can carry anything he likes.’

Mr Graham said no shareholder held 480 scrips.

‘Mr Neales: No, but Governor Graham holds 420.’
