Burra Town Council

A letter from T.W. Wilkinson as trustee of the Wesleyan Church says that the work done near the manse was not ordered by the Wesleyan authorities and they refused to recognise the amount claimed by the Council.

J. Jenkins was appointed dayman at 6/- a day.

Cr Linkson expressed concern at the number of Afghan hawkers around the town.
