Burra Food & Wine Club has bi-monthly dinner meetings.  Canapés and champagne are followed by a three course dinner.  Each dinner a winemaker from the Clare valley is invited to discuss their wines with members.  Membership is $25 and dinner is $35-$40 for non-members.  Meetings are at Glynne Ryan’s restaurant.  The first meeting for 2002 will be on 8 February.
