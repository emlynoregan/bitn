Early in the year the National Trust acquired the land containing the two remaining dugouts and it will now be the task of the trust to restore them.  The proposed visit to Princess Royal Homestead has had to be postponed due to Mr Andrew Tennant’s ill health.  The visit in November would have coincided with the release of the book Historic Homesteads of Australia in which Princess Royal is featured.

In conjunction with the District Council the dugouts area has been cleaned up and the Trust now awaits prices for the restoration work.

Adult Education ran a School on Historic Copper Mines of SA early in May with Mr Ian Auhl giving a paper on Burra.  The climax of the school was a bus trip to Kapunda and Burra with lunch at Princess Royal.  The Burra Branch of the National Trust supplied afternoon tea for the visitors.

In August we were requested to roster people at the Museum in the absence of Mr Woollacott.  This will also be needed next year when Mr Woollacott and family are abroad.  This year the Museum had 1,530 visitors compared with 1,140 last year.

In November two members, Mr O’Connor and Mrs Radford attended on Adult Education School on Folk Museums and we look forward to making use of new ideas from them.

We are indebted to Mr & Mrs S.J. Woollacott for opening the Museum on Friday and Sunday afternoons.

In the year a plaque has been made in memory of Thomas Pickett and it is now ready for erection near the site of his shepherd’s hut on the bank of Diprose Creek.

The Museum also now has a tinted photographic copy of the Bentley painting recently presented to Head Office.  With the permission of the District Council many of the relics from the mining era were moved from the mine to the area adjacent to the Museum.

This year we printed another set of five cards making ten in all.  Thanks to Mr Maurice Perry for permission to draw on his splendid drawings.  A sketchbook of Burra is in the process of being printed at present and we thank Mr Auhl for transferring his royalties to the Branch.

We have had a visit from the Renmark Branch and an exhibition of paintings by a group of artists who previously spent a week in the town.
