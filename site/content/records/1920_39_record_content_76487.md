Burra Rifle Club fired the 7th stage of the Burra Record Trophy at which the best results came from E.C. Hopkins, A.C. Ford, D.H. Field & J.E. Harris.  The committee met on Saturday to decide whether matches should continue while members belonging to the Militia are in camp.  It was decided to postpone the Championship to 1940, but to continue with trophy shoots with the Militia members being allowed to shoot over the ranges they miss whilst at camp, on dates to be fixed.
