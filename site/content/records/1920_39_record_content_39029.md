Obituary.  Miss Annie Sleep died at Burra Hospital on 17 August.  She was born at Kooringa in 1850, the elder daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Sleep.  Her parents were pioneers; the first to be married in the old Kooringa Wesleyan Church.  Her mother was Miss Cotton.  Miss Sleep was for 50 years a scholar and teacher at the Sunday school.  For the past two or three years she has had heart trouble.  She was the last surviving member of her family.  Two brothers, Fred & William, died some years ago and her only sister, Miss M.E. Sleep, died in April 1926.

[Born Ann Sleep 12 May 1850 District of the Murray.]
