Betsy & Peggy Gossiping

The column carries on the attack on the Days with respect to the cutting of a girl’s hair and has particularly unpleasant reference to Mrs Day.

‘Peggy: Lor.  I thought it was Japanese or something like that – me no savvy suchee big talkee.  My father and mother died when I was young, and that accounts for my bad training and uncontrollable temper.  I used to listen to everybody’s business, but my own, until I got quite deaf, an now I fancy everybody is talking about me.

Betsy: Maybe you are not mistaken, Peggy.

Peggy (Pulling up the end of her large white apron and looking two ways at once): It’s hard to think so, but I have spent days and nights looking and asking for sympathy, and I haven’t got as much as will fill this ‘ricee’ bag; they larfe at me and say –

Husha-by; Peggy, don’t you cry

You’ll be a sorter angel by-and bye.

Betsy: Why, Peggy, you are getting quite poetical, well –

I must leave you in despair

But don’t cut off any more hair

For if you do you’ll surely freeze

Just like you have in this cold breeze.

P.S. Peggy: I understand that there’s going to be a hair cutting and clothes snatching contest at Victoria Park on Boxing Day, but I believe a com-a-tea will call in the police and stop it.’
