Betting Control Board Inquiry – Should Burra Have a Betting Shop?

The inquiry was conducted by Col. Hanson, Mr J. Jelly & Mr A.G. Alexander.

Witness 1.  C. Samuel

He was the person organising a petition requesting betting shop facilities.

Had been a resident for c. 20 years.

Was the first licensed bookmaker in Burra.

In his time no one aged under 21 had been convicted for betting.

The average number of punters had been c. 150 each Saturday.

There were at present about 5 illegal bookmakers in Burra.

The betting shop had not affected sport.

The average age of the punters had been 35-40 and there had been only one woman.

At present bets could be made in the street, making it easier for minors to bet.

2 shilling betters predominated, though richer betters contributed more money.

Witness 2.  J.E. Hogan

Was a telephone linesman.

Had lived in Burra for 50 years.

Had been interested in sport, but at present local sport was at low ebb.

Had visited all three betting shops in Burra when they had been going and had found them mainly frequented by men aged over 30.

The same group now bet illegally in hotels, lavatories, one the street, etc.

All the law did was to make it more inconvenient.

The Bookmakers had learnt the game of avoiding police detection.

Witness 3.  F. Leonard

A presently unemployed barman.

Knew of six illegal bookmakers in Burra.

Hotel keepers did not like betting in the bar, but there was nothing to stop a punter from betting in a hotel.

Hotel keepers that he had worked for had not encouraged illegal betting.

It was possible to get a bet in hotel lounges frequented by women.

Witness 4.  J.P. Sara JP

Tendered a declaration that when betting shops were in business he had had difficulty collecting his accounts.  (This evidence was not accepted.)

Witness 5.  Rev. A.S. Barrett

Spokesman for the Ministers’ Fraternal

There would be a race meeting in Burra on 8 June.

Legislators were against betting shops.

In one year betters had lost an average of £146 each per shop per month to the bookmakers.
