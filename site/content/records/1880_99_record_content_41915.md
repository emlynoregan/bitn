Burra Institute, Half-Yearly Report.

Mr T. Edwards, President.

At the meeting in January it was announced that a contract had been let for new dressing rooms, stage, proscenium and other renovations, to cost in all £329-6-8.  It was subsequently decided to increase the expenditure in order to do a good job and the work has now been completed.  In order to make an easy approach to and exit from the escape door it was necessary to put in a passage which required a division wall which reduced the size of the lodge room.  A verandah has been erected which provides a covered way to and from the escape door.  Though smaller the lodge room is more private and warmer.  The inner room which was previously practically useless is now fitted with pegs and a door cut through to the lodge room so it serves as a cloakroom.  These changes materially increased the cost, but were highly desirable.

The seating has been changed to provide passages either side: doing away with the central aisle.  The unsightly central chandeliers have been removed and six bracket lamps with siagarn burners which throw a good light have been substituted.  Two extra bracket lamps on either side of the stage give it light when the footlights are not in use.  Three of the old chandeliers have been used: one in each dressing room and one in the Council Chamber.  The stage should have been two feet deeper, but will suffice.  Two roller scenes have been provided: a forest and landscape and a drawing room which is reversible for a kitchen scene, along with other furniture, filling and footlights.

The verandah has been concreted and the parapets and all outside cement work has been recoloured.  An extra closet has been erected and a fence placed around the excavations.

Subscribers stand at 90, though we ought to have not less than 100.

No much has been done in elocution yet, but I hope to see something started.  The hall was successfully reopened on 22 April and Mr Roach also provided a first class concert from which we received a nett £15.  The total expenditure on changes and renovations was £552-17-2.

Our current overdraft is £171-14-3 and I hope within the present half year to see this reduced to c. £100.
