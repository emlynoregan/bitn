Burra Town Council, 15 April

A special up-to-date picture of the King in uniform is being prepared for his Silver Jubilee.

The premises recently occupied by H.J. Button were approved as a betting shop.

T. Harrop asked for a ramp to his premises in Thames St to enable him to bring his pie-cart out of the yard.  East Ward Councillors will inspect the premises with power to approve at Mr Harrop’s cost.

Work for the unemployed was discussed, but any payment to them would mean loss of rations and yet the Council had too little money to subsidise any significant amount of work, so it looked as if rations would have to continue.  (Despite the fact the unemployed needed money for clothing etc.)

Cr Kellaway said: ‘While the Government continued its present rotten scheme it seemed impossible for any controlling body to try and help men who were honestly trying to help themselves.’

The Town Clerk confirmed that if the Council used its funds to subsidise a man earning 15/- a week with 3/4 that man would have to live on that for three weeks.

Cr Dow said that unless the Council had quite a sum of money to spend the policy of the Relief Council was of no value to this Council.

The Mayor said numbers on rations were lower than in 1934 both at Burra and at Mongolata.

He also reported on the Deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works re the Aberdeen Quarry.  A good case had been made, but no reply had yet come from the Railways Department.  The Mayor was disgusted by the apathy shown by the Government and the SAR.

The Governor Sir Winston & Lady Dugan will visit Burra soon, but the details will depend on the Governor’s health.

Celebrations for the King’s Silver Jubilee will run from May till June and it is expected the Governor’s visit will fall within this time.  A Grand Ball is being planned.

One idea of the Mayor’s was to get the drinking fountain erected in honour of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee in 1887 into working order.  This should cost comparatively little.

The Mayor thought the main celebrations should take the form of a big affair for the children to instil in their minds what loyalty and patriotism stood for and to impress upon them how the king wanted nothing but peace and goodwill to prevail.  In the evening of the 7 May they would have a big patriotic demonstration in the Institute.  Cr Jennison gave his support and promised the wholehearted support of the RSL.

Other Councillors offered their support for these proposals and the fountain project was approved.
