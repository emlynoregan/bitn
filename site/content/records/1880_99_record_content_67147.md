Burra Slag Extraction Co. at the Smelting Works.

At various times the idea of extracting copper from the old slagheap has been raised as technology of the time was known to be inefficient in extracting the metal from the ore.  Tests have been made several times and results suggested to many that a profit could be made.  Mr Paynter, some years ago erected a small crushing plant and put a considerable parcel of slag through, but due to unforseen circumstances had to discontinue and sold his plant.  Since then others have decided it would be a profitable exercise if modern machinery and some capital were employed.  A syndicate was formed with James Martin & Co. of Gawler at tis head, called the Burra Slag Extraction Co.  Arrangements have been made to treat some hundreds of thousands of tons of slag.  A site was chosen, a little to the south of the heap on suitable falling ground on the east side of the creek and on which an elaborate crushing and concentrating plant has been erected.  It is to be managed by Joseph Martin of Gawler with Mr Matt. May for Block 10 of Broken Hill as concentrator.  A trial crushing should begin in a few days.  The plant is housed in a structure erected by R. Latter of Gawler.  A good water supply has been arranged ‘which can give many points to that meagre arrangement called the town supply’.  A well has been provided some 150’ deep into which plunger pumps have been fitted driven by a Martin & Co. pumping engine and the water fed to two enormous iron tanks at the works proper.

‘In treating the slag considerable care will be necessary . . . on account of the savings been [being?] in a matalic [sic: metallic?] state’.  But as work proceeds if necessary other appliances will be added consisting chiefly of an elaborate new vanner [sic] being patented by Mr May, in which material will be reduced with little if any loss of water.

The slag will be trucked along tram lines to a pair of cages at the foot of large bins then hoisted up 50’ and tipped into the bins then through a powerful stone breaker, going thence per launder to an enormous pair of rollers to be further reduced then elevated to the trommels and a section having been treated by battery the classifier and jigs will carry it to the final stage of concentration.  Motive power is a high pressure engine fed by two large Cornish boilers.  The site has its own blacksmith’s and carpenter’s shops, store and office.  The engine and pumps were run on Sunday when many visitors went to the site.  The plant should be in full working order in a week or so.  There is a heavy 10-head battery.

[A vanner is a machine for separating minerals from earth etc.  A trommel is a rotating cylindrical sieve.  A lauder is a trough of water used to carry material or in separating materials.]
