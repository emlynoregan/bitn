Burra Mine is edging closer to World Heritage listing.  Last week Burra was visited by representatives of the Cornish Mining World Heritage administration: Co-ordinator Deborah Boden and Cornish Baird Terry Johnson.  Both Burra & Moonta sites are already State heritage listed and are being considered for short-listing for National Heritage listing.  World Heritage status was granted to Cornwall and West Devon sites in 2006.  A successful bid would have considerable economic benefits for the area.
