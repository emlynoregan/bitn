Scandinavian Cyclists.  A group of one Swedish and three Norwegian cyclists passed through Burra earlier this week on a Bike for Peace ride.  They started in Fremantle on 8 October and plan to be in Sydney by 8 November.   The organisation began in Norway and aims to develop a grass roots concern for the environment and to create an understanding of the consequences of actions by individuals, communities and companies.  Examples of other rides are the 1978 Northern Ireland event, the 199 Beijing to Bergen ride and a ride in 2001 in Canada.
