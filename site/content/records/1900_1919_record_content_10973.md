Burra Waterworks.  The Government advises that no instructions have been given to cut water from the public water troughs but in a fine example of double speak it also advises that the policy is that no free supplies of water are granted in county water districts and unless the Town Council pays 2/- per 1,000 gallons for such supplies those ‘instructions’ will be enforced.
