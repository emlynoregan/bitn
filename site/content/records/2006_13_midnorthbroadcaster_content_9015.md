Burra Community School Year 8 students have visited the Burra AGL information centre as part of a project to report on renewable energy.  Each small group that the class was broken into had to produce four minute presentations.  One group was selected to deliver their assessments to the AGL information centre.  Its manager, Naomi Builder was impressed by their research.
