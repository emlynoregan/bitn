Characteristics of the 1911 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements both local and otherwise.

Page 2.

A few notices and personal advertisements.

A mixture of small and large local advertisements including stock sales.

Some very large advertisements for International Harvester Co. motor buggies and tractors.

News mixed with small print advertisements extends usually for 1 to 1½ columns.

Editorials are very rare.

Page 3.

A mixture of news and advertisements, many of which are disguised to look like news.  Sometimes there is padding out with humorous items.  The reporting of the Town Council is brief and uncontroversial.

Page 4.

Dominated by large advertisements.

Usually there is a column of civic information.

The political line of the paper is not very strong editorially as editorial columns rarely appear, but the general tone is anti-Labor and pro-Liberal.  Liberal Union activities are very well reported and in small items an anti-Labor stance can sometimes be detected.  Strikes are never justified and wages should never rise and the Liberals are the only Party that seeks to govern for all rather than for sectional or class interests.  But generally matters beyond the local district’s immediate interest are not much discussed.
