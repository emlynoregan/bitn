In the modern mine the production of copper oxide has reached its planned level for stage 1.  Local and interstate markets have been obtained in the fertilizer field and overseas negotiations continue.  Planning for stage two continues and this should be operational within 12-18 months, boosting treatment to 1,000 tons per day.
