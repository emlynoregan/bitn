Elders Jazz in the Monster Mine attracted a large number of visitors from outside the district as well as local residents on Saturday.  The 400 tickets were sold out early on the day of the event.  The weather was cool, but kind.  The event was planned for an area beside the Mine Pool following the announcement of the last Twilight Jazz Affair at Tilley’s Petherton Homestead.  Sponsorship was obtained from Elders, SA Tourism Commission and T & R Pastoral and organisers were lucky to obtain the services of Australian jazz trumpet great Bob Barnard and the Adelaide band Eddie White’s Allstars and the Marryatville High School’s Ecstatic Jazz.  [Photo.]  Organisers are encouraged to hold the event again next year.
