Aberdeen Football Club held a meeting on Wednesday and decided that owing to a lack of playing members it would be forced to go into recess for the 1975 season.  The President Mr M. Broad informed the secretary of the Mid North League, Mr M.A. Bannear, that they would be unable to field any teams for the season.  He asked that clearance of players to take positions with other clubs be expedited.  The Mid North League will now have five rounds of matches with no byes.  Mr Bannear felt that this could well be the last year of the Mid North League, with every possibility of joining with the North Eastern League in 1976.
