The SA Budget is discussed in ¾ column.  Railway fares and freight charges rise due to the award of a 44 hour week to some employees and by Arbitration Court awards.  General Revenue will also have to fund part of the cost of the developmental railways.  There are heavy losses in revenue due to the previous Labor Government and prospects of an unfavourable harvest that will also reduce revenue.  Water rates will rise by 25%.  Amusement tax is doubled.  The Government has reduced expenditure by £300,000.  Railway staff will be cut.
