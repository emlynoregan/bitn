Local Board of Health

The Medical Officer Dr Steven discussed privy pits and whether they posed a threat to the townâ€™s water supply [apparently in response to a query from the Central Board.]  He concluded that given their distance from the source of water and the cleansing effect of the earth any effluent material would pass through, the threat of contamination was very slight.  The Central Board would be so advised.
