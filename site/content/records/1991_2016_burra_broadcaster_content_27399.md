Burra Town Hall now has the aid of three local people in a support role through Employment Directions, ASK and the Work for the Dole Scheme.  Town Hall Manager Llew Jones has welcomed Shelley Diekman, Kevin Olsen & Travis Woods.  They will be involved in maintenance & administration.  Burra Cultural Centre Committee is a registered volunteer organisation with Centre Link and so can have volunteers, especially unemployed, referred to it by Centre Link.  Such volunteers can have the Town Hall and Art Gallery work count as a mutual obligation activity.
