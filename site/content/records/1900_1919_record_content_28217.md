Booborowie District.  There is a 1-column article inspired by the closer settlement scheme.

To North Booborowie (just purchased by the Government for closer settlement) you go southwest from Hallett through Cartapoo, through some magnificent farms.  Previously it was worked by Alf. Coon and John Wise, the latter now a successful dairy farmer at Burra and a bacon producer.  The country around Cartapoo and Petherton was once owned by C. Goode, but is cut up into agricultural blocks.

Nearing Booborowie you find the old stock road growing wheat and hay.  You can get a history of the area from Ted Wall, a very old resident, who runs the Booborowie Eating House, Post Office and store etc.  Booborowie currently boasts two churches (Methodist and Catholic), a District Council Chamber and a public school.

Booborowie was first taken up by the Doctors Brown in 1845 and after the death of Doctor Brown in 1897 it was divided.  The Homestead and southern half was retained by Mr Brown, the Doctorâ€™s son and the present owner.  The northern half was bought by Messrs Dutton & Melrose and they produced magnificent sheep and cattle.  Booborowie Station was managed for 20 years by Mr J. Loudon and since his death by Mr B. H. Beaven.  Now that the Government has bought the greater portion many changes are in store for the district.
