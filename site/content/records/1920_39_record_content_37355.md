James Kelly of Hallett turned 90 last Friday.  He is at present a patient at Burra Hospital having broken a leg nine months ago.  He was born 20 February 1841 at North Terrace Adelaide.  His father is said to have been the first school teacher in SA.  Later he took land at Morphett Vale.  James came to Burra with Richard Reed and his brother and then took land at Mt Bryan, being among the first to grow wheat north of Burra.  When Broken Hill was discovered he went there and secured an interest in the big mine.  He was also fairly successful in WA, but lost heavily in later ventures.  He married Sarah, daughter of the late James McInnes of ‘Blink Bonnie’ who died many years ago.  Mrs George Tiver Sen. of Hallett is a daughter and J.D. Kelly of Hallett is a son.
