Football.  Last Friday Burra Football Club left on a visit to Renmark.  The last of three cars left for The Gums at 11.20 and got there at 12.30.  Blowing dust had reduced the visibility to 20 or 30 yards.  Rabbits were numerous.  Lunch was taken at Morgan at 1.15.  In the afternoon the dust gradually abated and the team reached Renmark at 6 p.m.  They attended a ball in the Town Hall that evening.  Saturdayâ€™s game saw Renmark 8.10 (58) defeat Burra 3.6 (24).  On Saturday night they went to the cinema.
