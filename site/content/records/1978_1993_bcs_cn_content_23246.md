Television Reception

There should be improved reception of ABC television next month when a new translator begins operating on a small hill one kilometre northeast of Burra.  Work and equipment at the site cost about $238,000 and the facility could be expanded to accommodate more services.

Burra gets fringe reception of metropolitan stations and can pick up commercial stations operating from Port Pirie.  The Burra translator will receive ABC SA programming off the AUSSAT satellites.
