Marriage.  At Bright Church, World’s End 2 February.

Ida Duldig, 2nd daughter of F. Duldig and

Emil W. Pfitzner 4th son of the late Charles Pfitzner.

The reception was at the home of the bride’s parents at which there was a sumptuous spread in a pavilion specially erected.  The afternoon saw singing, recitations and games followed by another fine spread for tea.  In the evening the celebrations continued with recitations, chorus singing and solos.  Supper was served at midnight, comprising a knife and fork spread with toasts.  Two farces were then staged: Lodgings to let and Black Bachelor.  A continental followed with singing and games and the ‘Mystic Band’, which played new music on kerosene tin instruments with bells and rattles.
