Christmas in Burra.

On Christmas Eve the streets were crowded and the shops were decorated with seasonable goods.  The Burra Band made proceedings lively.  Music was played till about 10.15 and then the Band played carols in various parts of the town from about 11.15 to 4.30 a.m. Christmas morning.  Christmas Day passed quietly without sports in Burra, but Boxing Day saw the United Friendly Societies’ Sports, and the Salvation Army’s Boat Service in the Barracks was a great success.  Thursday was also a holiday, but nothing formal was arranged.  On 28 December Burra cricketers went to Saddleworth where they were defeated by a few runs.  [Scores not printed.]
