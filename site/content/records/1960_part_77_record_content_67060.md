Legislative Council Reform.  There have been major changes to the Legislative Council.

All persons qualified to vote for the House of Assembly will now automatically be on the Legislative Council roll and be entitled to vote.  (Though voting for the Legislative Council remains voluntary.)

The five electorates will be replaced by a single state-wide electorate returning 22 members â€“ each serving six years with half retiring every three years.  They will be elected on the basis of proportional representation using optional preferential voting.

The minimum age for candidates for election has been lowered from 30 to 18.

The Burra Record and other newspapers went metric from 25 June 1973.
