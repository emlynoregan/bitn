Booborowie Hall Project

When the extensions to the hall were opened in March 1957 an appeal was made for donations and it was said a list would be published in the Record.  We regret not doing so before.

[The list is then printed with a total of £448-2-0 being acknowledged.  A barley crop was sown on half shares with the Anama Pastoral Co. and those who gave help in that project are also listed.]

The cropping project of 100 acres yielded 424 bags (of which 9 were stolen from the paddock!) and the committee’s share is expected to be between £200 and £250, which will substantially reduce the overdraft, which at the end of 1957 stood at c. £700.
