Pte Ben Kotz was given a farewell at Miss Warner’s Café on Thursday evening.  Attendance was small due to the lack of publicity.  Also, the Mayor could not attend due to a family bereavement and S.C. Genders was absent due to the grave condition of his wife.  Mr A.B. Riggs as Secretary of the Soldiers’ Welfare Committee presided and presented a silver cigarette case and a cheque.  A.L. Clode spoke, as did Sgt Clarke AIF recently returned.  At present we hear that Pte Kotz is in the Burra Hospital suffering from measles.
