The Burra Branch of the National Trust has received some wonderful items from Mrs Lorna Benn.  The items of half-slips finely worked, perfume bottles, sequinned or beaded headbands, bags and toiletries originally belonged to Alma Mary Wicklein whose father Mr Lou Wicklein was a jeweller in Burra in the early twentieth century.
