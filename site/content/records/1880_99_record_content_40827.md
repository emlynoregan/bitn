Burra Town Council, Special Meeting, 24 March.

The Mayor said it had been called to consider the matter of Cr Rabbich as provided for in Clause 44 of standing orders.  He regretted it, but the standing orders had to be carried out to maintain the dignity of the Council.  He hoped the breach could be healed and was quite willing to meet Cr Rabbich fairly.

Cr Sampson endorsed the remarks and hoped all could be settled, but the dignity of Council and its standing orders had to be maintained.

Crs O’Leary, Watt, Butterworth and Parks concurred.

Cr Rabbich was called on to make an explanation.

The mayor said particulars had been sent by letter which Cr Rabbich had endorsed and returned.

Those are the conditions, but you refused to avail yourself of them and consequently the question has advanced a stage and will have to be dealt with under By-law 44 which required Cr Rabbich to show cause why he should not be amoved from his office as Councillor.

Cr Sampson would ask before the By-law was enforced for a reconsideration of the matter, and that if Cr Rabbich would withdraw unconditionally his explanation to the Council he would move that the fine be rescinded and the minute be expunged from the minute book.

Cr Rabbich said he would not have taken his seat if he thought he was guilty of any infringement of standing orders and as he was not guilty he had no apology to make or fine to pay.  He had not only his own opinion on the matter, but was satisfied he was in the right.

Cr Sampson asked that the explanation made in writing by Cr Rabbich be read.  It was:

‘As a representative of the ratepayers intrusted with the rest of the Council in the spending of public money, I left the Council on the evening of February 20 last, with the idea in my mind that the business transacted re the accepting of tenders for road metal was not consistent with honourable and independent action consequently I would not have any further to do with such.’

Cr Watt asked the Mayor his opinion on Clause 40 [44?] of standing orders.  The Mayor said the By-law was clear enough of itself.

The mayor then read the letter sent to Cr Rabbich with the conditions he would not avail himself of.

The Mayor said the Council had been treated diabolically, especially in reference to the meeting held in North Ward, which had been called without asking him - he had felt slighted in the way they had gone about it.

Cr Butterworth denied any intention to slight either the Mayor or Council - it had been done on the request of North Ward ratepayers.

Cr Watt wanted the matter amicably settled.

Cr Rabbich said that Cr Watt was very submissive tonight, but at the last meeting had insulted him.

Cr Sampson then moved ‘That Cr Rabbich be now amoved as a Councillor from this Council, he having failed to show cause to the satisfaction of this Council why he should not be amoved and that his seat be now declared vacant’. 

Cr O’Leary said he could not see any other move was possible and so 2nd.

Crs Parks and Watt concurred.

Cr Sampson said he [Rabbich] had not only reflected on the Council, but had vilified it in a letter to the Burra Record published on 4 March and he ventured to say he would not sit with him till he had apologised publicly.  The motion passed with only Cr Butterworth opposed.

The Mayor then declared Cr Rabbich’s seat vacant and ordered the Town Clerk to make the necessary arrangements to fill the vacancy.  The meeting was then adjourned.

An ordinary meeting immediately followed with Cr Rabbich still in his seat.

The mayor asked if he intended to withdraw and Cr Rabbich said ‘No.’

‘Then we will have to get the police to remove you.’

‘Perhaps you had better do that.’

Cr Sampson moved that Mr Rabbich be now asked to withdraw.  Cr Watt 2nd.  Carried.
