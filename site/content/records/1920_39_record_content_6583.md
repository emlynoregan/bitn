Burra Town Council, 17 December

The Mayor suggested tar dressing from Eyes & Crowle’s to the Commercial St Bridge.

There were complaints of cattle in the streets and of a calf being kept in the reserve near Railway Terrace.

Cr Collins drew a laugh when he said one of Drew & Crewes’ horses was one of the worst offenders.

The Inspector said he had been trying to catch it.  The Mayor (Mr Crewes) said he would not know the firm’s horse if he saw it.

Cr Bartholomaeus suggested getting the use of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s yards for a pound, but the Mayor said he had heard they were to be pulled down and the site used for building and Cr Collins said he had enquired and the firm would not hear of it.

There was some discussion over unemployment in the town and whether the Council was doing its best in this regard.

Cr Collins thought tarring the footpath on one side of the road from Miss Bentley’s to the station was extravagant, as it got little use.
