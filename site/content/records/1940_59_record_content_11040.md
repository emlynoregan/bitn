‘Common Sensence’ [sic] writes in support of publishing the court proceedings.  He reports at some length an example of how the reporting on an inquest into a woman’s death led to her husband being discovered to have drowned two previous wives – a discovery that would not have been made had the proceedings of the coronial court not been published.
