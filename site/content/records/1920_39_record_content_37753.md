Mongolata Goldfield

Messrs W. Salter & Jack Hogan are prospecting in a gully between Mr Morgan’s and the late Fred. H. Jones’s on Mr J. Barker’s property, almost on the boundary of Mr Morgan’s.  Mr Salter told us he head been prospecting since he was 16.  They have found gold in both the clay and the stone and he feels they are on the edge of the reef.  They have named the place ‘The Iron Battler’.  He believes there is alluvial gold there, but it would need deep sinking.  He agrees that what is needed out there is a battery.
