Letter from ‘Living Yet’ wondering why the bridge on Ayers St is called Deadman’s Bridge.  It was placed there by public subscription in the days before either a Town or District Council and speaks well of the old virtue of self-help.  The fund available would not permit a direct route and the position was chosen on account of the foundations.  I hope the old bridge will be preserved ‘to the memory of men that once lived for the Old Burra’.
