Editorial.  A Retrospective on 1888.

Locally the year has been most unsuccessful with the prevailing depression.  This had prevailed elsewhere in the colony for some time, but became really known here as the railway became finished and drew away carrying business, which had been so important for us.

[A part is missing here from the microfilm version, but appears likely to have said that not only was business affected by the completion of the railway to Broken Hill, but that the dry season had severely affected both the farming and pastoral sectors and hence businesses in the town.]

Business and social affairs have been dull.  The year began with a good harvest, but winter was dry and the year closed on one of the worst of seasons.  At the start of the year excitement in connection with the Barrier Mines was setting in and it rapidly grew to a climax and the anticlimax has been extreme.  At one time it seemed that the colony would find its own Broken Hill as silver discoveries were reported all over SA, but in grasping at shadows many have lost the substance.  Locally this was as evident as elsewhere and our own mines have not yet justified all the expectations concerning them.

Sales of new leases in pastoral country to the northeast have done little to stimulate activity due to the drought and little development there has so far resulted.  One ray of brightness is the news at the close of the year that the Burra Mine has changed hands.  As long as SAMA owned the mine it was clear that it would remain moribund.  Now with British capital we may hope it will again become a busy hive of activity.  Before the next year has closed we may expect the old activity will be revived.  The local committee probably promoted the sale, as we understand they were prepared to take up the mine had the London buyer not been found.

The health of the people has been good and we have not lost any prominent citizens, but sympathy has been widely expressed for W. Pearce Senior who in the last four months has lost two daughters, one son and two sons-in-law.  Other public institutions have continued their even course.  Mr Rounsevell and Mr Holder have taken their share in the not very profitable Parliamentary sessions of the year.  Council affairs have been quiet till the last few weeks, when they bid fair to beat the record for difficulty, but now peace reigns again and we hope matters can be brought to a satisfactory issue.  The Hospital Board, School Board of Advice and the Institute have had a satisfactory year.  In the clergy the only change has been the substitution of Rev. W.H. Hodge for Rev. J.H. Hadley at Redruth Wesleyan Church.  The Friendly Societies have continued to foster thrift, industry and mutual providence.

Across SA there is a feeling that the depression is passing.  Most of the Barrier Trade has been done with SA to the benefit of both out trade and labour and very significantly of our railways.

The Alma and Victoria Gold Mine, after an arduous struggle, has finally paid a dividend.  A copper mine at Mutooroo has also paid a dividend and those on Yorke Peninsula have never been busier, helped by the high price of copper, which the French Syndicate can evidently control.

Politically the Chinese question has claimed precedence.  Stringent measures have been passed by all the Australian Parliaments restricting almost to prohibition the influx of Chinese.  SA has adopted the Federation Enabling Act.  The new Land Bill sets the law relating to Crown Lands on quite a new basis.  The relative authority of the governors and the colonial Governments has been challenged and changed, though not really clearly defined.
