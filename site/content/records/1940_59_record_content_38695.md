Scotch College, Melbourne had about 60 pupils on a tour in SA last week and Burra was on their itinerary.  They travelled in three coaches and each coach was separated by about 24 hours.  In Burra they were entertained at Mr & Mrs D. Barratt’s Royal Exchange Hotel.  The Mayor and Mayoress had dinner with them on Wednesday evening and told them something of Burra’s history.  The boys also visited the Flinders Ranges, Leigh Creek, and the Barossa Valley.
