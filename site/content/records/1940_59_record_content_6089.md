Burra Buffalo Lodge is well represented in the Second AIF and in the RAAF.  When members return on leave a friendly gathering is always arranged, as in the case of Ptes Charles Herbert and Reg. Schwier recently.  They were presented with inscribed cigarette cases.  Last Tuesday evening a similar compliment was paid Aircraftsman Bob Morton.
