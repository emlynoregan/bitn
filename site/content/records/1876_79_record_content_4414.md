Further details are similar to the editorial comments. Cr Geake 2m1. Cr Wilkinson amended the sum to £400 to meet the expenses of the new bridge. Cr Batchelor 2’ and Cr Roberts eventually withdrew his motion and Cr Wilkinson’s then passed unanimously. 
The Mayor again brought up the removal of Constable Wilson and felt that the Council had been ignored despite its paying a proportion of the police salaries. A letter is to be sent to Mr Rees MP calling for it to be inquired into in Parliament. 
It was resolved to get Mr Rees to come and look at the approaches to the new bridge which were still causing concern.
