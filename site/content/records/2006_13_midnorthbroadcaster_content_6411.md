Burra’s Unicorn Brewery has been revived after a 106 year absence and will soon be quenching the thirst of Burra, Adelaide and SA drinkers generally.  The original brewery was established as the Unicorn Brewery in 1873 by William Banks and closed in 1902 under the ownership of the Walkerville Brewery, when strict licensing laws spelt the end of many of SA’s independent breweries.  The new company will produce a Classic Pale Ale (5% alcohol) and a Miners’ XXX Stour (6.2% alcohol), with three other varieties to be added soon.  The beer will be available in bottles and on tap at Burra hotels and elsewhere across the state.  The company occupies offices in part of the original buildings and will use the bluestone cellars for functions and events.  The beer is currently being made in Sydney and Adelaide, but the management is assessing sites for building its own brewery.  In its heyday the old brewery supplied beer to a wide area of SA, transporting it by rail throughout the Mid North and to Broken Hill.

Celebrations to mark the re-establishment will be held on Sunday 16 November and will include a street parade starting at 11.15 a.m. and ending at the old brewery cellars, where the official opening ceremony will take place.  A highlight will be the Unicorn Brewery’s team of Clydesdale horses.  The SA Pipes and Drums will lead the parade with Highland Dancers, followed by floats and other groups and a district band.  The SA Pipes and Drums will hold a concert in the Town Hall on Friday at 7.40 p.m. After the opening, fine ales and stout will be available, along with wines and soft drinks.  Food will also be available in the Burra Creek picnic area.

The Season.  The outlook is grim after a promising start.  Six weeks ago it grew dry and now there is no subsoil moisture.  Canola has also been adversely affected by high winds.  Many crops are being cut for hay, although it is really too early, but there is no chance now of further improvement.  In addition fertilizer costs have at least trebled.
