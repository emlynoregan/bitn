Letter to the editor about the apparent lack of concern of the Board of Health re typhoid in Burra.  There was a case a few weeks ago at the Burra Hotel, but nothing was done.  Now three more cases are in town and a walk down many of the rights of way, even in the centre of town reveals ‘festering swamps caused by the constant soakage of impure liquids.’
