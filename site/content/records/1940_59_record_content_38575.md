Burra Racing Club held its AGM recently.  Three committeemen retired and were replaced by J. Gebhardt, G. Gask and K.J. Murphy.  Mr M.W. Bednall, who was chairman of the Committee for many years expressed disappointment at not being elected, but said he would continue to further the interests of the club in any way he could.  Mr L. Boothby was elected President in place of E.C. Collins, who declined to stand again.  The financial report showed a loss of Â£42 for the last three meetings.  This was attributable in the main to poor weather conditions.
