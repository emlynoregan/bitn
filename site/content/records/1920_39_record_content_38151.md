Burra Basketball Assoc. AGM was held 15 April in J. Allenâ€™s rooms.  The balance sheet shows a credit.  Elected were Patron, L.W. Gebhardt; Chairman, P.W. Hogan; Secretary & Treasurer, J. Pocock.  There will be four teams.  The Institute Committee will be asked to lower hall hire fees as so many players are presently unemployed.
