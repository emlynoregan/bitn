Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 16 December.

Leane’s Adit.  At 70ft level continued to drive south to 23ft over an average leader width of 3”.  Stopped when the leader cut out.  Since then have taken out fill at 90ft and 100ft levels and sampled same, but no values by pan test.
