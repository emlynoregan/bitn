Obituary.  Dr W.G. Torr died at Way Cottage Brighton last week.  He spent his early life in the Burra District.  On his verandah at Brighton was a church seat from the old Bible Christian Church at Kooringa and a stool which was the pulpit chair from the Cartapoo Church, used when he conducted his first service.  He had a long and distinguished scholastic career and a fine record teaching and preaching.  After Way College closed he gave the rest of his life to the training of young men for the Christian ministry and local preaching etc.  He constructed the Brighton Training College which afterwards became Wesley College and is now used for the welfare of young children.  In later years he distributed literature to needy young men.  He was 86 when he died last Wednesday 13 September.  Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook late of the Kooringa Circuit and Rev. J.A.
