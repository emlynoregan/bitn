Burra Burra Hospital Inc. held its annual meeting last Thursday.  Chairman Mr S.J. Woollacott reported that in the past year the hospital had maintained adequate staff.  This year saw the introduction of the hot water system that has proved a great improvement.  The boiler house in Burra bluestone is in keeping with the other buildings.  In order to maximise the collection of rain water, the guttering has been renewed and altered and water can now be pumped between any of the storage tanks.  Several rooms have been repainted.  A new fence has been erected.  [In the northeast corner.]  A new glassed-in enclosure has been erected at the back of the hospital.  A new Gothic washing machine has been bought for the laundry.  Thank go to Rural Youth for £20 towards a ramp and the Women’s Auxiliary has given invaluable support.  This year income has exceeded expenditure.

Mr Woollacott urged all to join a Medical Benefit Hospital Fund.

[Presumably because of the great financial benefit the hospital gained from assured payments of its accounts.  He also thanked a range of individuals and the Burra Electric Supply Co. for its good service over many years.]
