Editorial.  The Year in Retrospect.

The year was peaceful internationally except for the Egyptian scene, which has now passed.

Unrest in Ireland, Germany, Russia and France.

The murder of Lord Cavendish and Mr Burke.

Locally it was a bad year for grain farmers, but pastoralists have recently had good rains.

There has been speculation in mining and in land, especially in the metropolitan area.

SA has been politically uneventful.

In Burra it has been a quiet, but progressive year.  The town has been less afflicted by party feeling and more unified.

The town has been improved.  The roads and footways are much better than five years ago.  There are new bridges in Chapel and Kangaroo Streets and more trees have been planted.

The Recreation Ground will be a fit place for use for football and cricket next year.

There is a stylish new manse for the Wesleyan Church, worth c. £1,200.

Mr Tudor has a new shop at Redruth.

Dr Brummitt’s house has been considerably enlarged and improved and it becomes the first place in Burra to be lit by gas from a machine on the premises.

In the course of erection are two large houses for Mr C. Drew and Mr T.W. Wilkinson.

[C. Drew’s was Heathmont on Limestone Hill and T.W. Wilkinson’s was behind the Institute on Mount Pleasant.]

The old mine has been idle, but with a possible sale a renewal of work is expected.

The prosperity of the town has been limited by the almost total failure of agriculture in the Hundreds to the east where the farmers have been saved only to the extent that they have been able to resort to wool and wood carting.

Bishop Benson of Truro is to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

Kerbing has been resumed in Best Place.

Christmas Day was cool and passed quietly.  A band of carol singers could be heard in the streets.

The Largs Bay Pier and Railway were opened last Saturday.

C.C. Williams has made a 3,500-gallon corrugated iron tank for G.A. Gebhardt of Mackerode.

John Dow has been appointed Inspector.

The Recreation Ground Concert last Tuesday in the Institute grossed £14.  The Burra Band played some nice selections outside.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School Anniversary on 24 & 25 December saw a large crowd of children.  On Christmas Day the school made a procession through the town with the brass band and more tea provisions had to be obtained.  The school now numbers 180.  Collections and the tea raised £29.

Cricket in the holidays.

25 Dec. near Drew & Co., Aberdeen. Burra True Blues 150 defeated Manoora 30 & 73

Tuesday, near Drew & Co., Aberdeen.  East Adelaide 132 & 82 Burra 103 & 18 for 3

Thursday. Burra 153 I. Zingari 58 & 90 for 5 wickets
