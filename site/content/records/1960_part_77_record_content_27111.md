The 1965-66 Harvest has been delayed by rain and though the Burra silos took their first delivery on 24 November, only about 20,000 bushels have since come in.    This is about one day’s taking in a normal year.  The quality of the grain is good, but the quantity will be down.  Mr Graham Heinrich for example at Worlds’ End reaped an 8-9 bag crop, but this year only a 3 bag crop.  The late rains evidently did more good than was expected and many farmers are reporting better results than they had feared.
