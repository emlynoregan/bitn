Burra Rifle Club.  The first stage of the W.G. Woodman Trophy was fired over 500 and double 700 yards.  Pat Hogan had an excellent day, scoring a possible over 500 yards and again over the second 700 yards.  He only dropped on shot on the first 700.  H.R. Woodman also scored a possible over 500 yards, but crashed badly on the succeeding ranges.
