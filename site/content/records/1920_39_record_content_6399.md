The Christmas Carol Festival at the Institute on Thursday drew a large crowd. There was an orchestra of 20 and chorus of 135.  It was a good performance, if a little less polished than usual for Mr Dane’s work, having been rehearsed for only three weeks.  We cannot compliment the audience for their meagre applause, which was not in keeping with the complimentary remarks heard afterwards.  Of the gross proceeds of £47-8-3 the Institute will benefit by £38-6-9.
