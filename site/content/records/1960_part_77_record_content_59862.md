Steelton Post Office finally closed on 29 January 1972 after over 100 years of service.  It is thought the office opened in the 1860s or earlier when Steelton was established as a result of the discovery of copper at Burra.  Steelton was on the copper route to Kapunda via Black Springs and Marrabel.  Steelton then had a blacksmithâ€™s shop, a hotel and other buildings.  A school was set up and the first school teacher was Mr Henry Parkins who became the first postmaster.  The early mail service came from Saddleworth.  Names of early mail contractors are not known, but in the motor car era some have been: Harry Butler, Mr Becker, Norm Tank, Edgar & Harold Milde, Bert Milgate and the present one is Ivan Milde.  The first post office was on the main road and existed for nearly 100 years.  Henry Parkin passed the office to his sister and soon afterwards she passed it to Harry Parkin, clerk of the Waterloo Council and later overseer of the Saddleworth Council.  He carried it on until about 15 years ago, when it was taken over by Mr & Mrs Vern Schmaal, who held it till its closure.  About 12 years ago the old building was in a bad state of repair and the site was changed to the present one, some 500 yards north on the property of Mr Ben Schmaal.  Locals gathered on Saturday morning to see the arrival of the last mail bag to Steelton.  Residents will now be served by a road-side delivery service or private boxes from Saddleworth.

[Opened 1 September 1861 according to Matin Walker The Post, Telegraph & Telephone Offices of SA & NT (2004).]
