The Holidays.  Good weather prevailed.  Crowds were down somewhat due to the smaller population.  Mr H.H. George, the stationmaster, allowed fruit arriving by the late train between 7 & 8 on Christmas Eve to be removed at once, so saving losses and catering better for the public.  McGilchrist & Co. specialised in toys and the interior of the old auction mart was transformed.  The town was remarkably free of drunks.  In the absence of any band this year, the Salvation Army serenaded a number of residents with carols.
