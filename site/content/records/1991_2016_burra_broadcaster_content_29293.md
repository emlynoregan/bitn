The Cemeteries Advisory Committee of Goyder Council is a small group keen to preserve the Burra Cemetery and maintain its history.  It works within a budget to restore and preserve early headstones.  Monumental mason Steven Pearse of Clare handles restoration work.  Attention is also given to maintaining the surrounding stone wall.  A monument to stillborn babies and other children in unmarked graves has also been erected in recent times.

Hallett celebrated the 125th anniversary of the formation of the Hallett DC in 1877 with a pooled tea and a dance afterwards in the Hallett Hall.  The following day the Hallett Uniting Church celebrated its 125th anniversary. Rev .Ted. White introduced Rev. Gowan Armstrong as guest speaker.  Rev. Armstrong was minister at Hallett in the early 1950s.  Other past ministers present were Revs Trevor O’Brien, Claude Cotton and Graham Pitman.
