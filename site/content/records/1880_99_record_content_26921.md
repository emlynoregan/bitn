Ratepayers’ Meeting, at the Institute, 21 Nov.

F.W. Holder in the chair.  On the platform: P.L. Killicoat & John Sampson, candidates for Mayor with T. Davis, H. Pinch, W.T. Rabbich, H.T.H. Morris, D.J. O’Leary & retiring Cr Anderson.

The Mayor read the main items of his report.

J. Sampson agreed with the report, but for the Jubilee Avenue, which he said was incomplete and whose trees would not grow in the made soil.

He was against the Waterworks and always had been - there had never been a greater waste of money.  They were not necessary and handing them over to the Government was not a solution.  The water was unfit to drink and killed plants.  The Waterworks should ‘be got rid of’.  The deficit should be met from the guarantors.

Ct Tiver supported Sampson on the Mayor’s actions, but thought if they gave over the Waterworks they would be taxed more by the Government.  He was concerned over the £200 bond due next year.  He thought a ¼d levy per head of cattle sold might raise the money.

The mayor replied that he had not said that Cr Sampson had promised anything for the Avenue - he was one of only four who had refused a donation.

P.L. Killicoat agreed with holding the Waterworks till next March.  The Government had dealt unfairly by ceasing to use the water for the railways.  They would receive a grant of 5/- in the £ for every £ spent on main roads before the 1 June.  As for the Avenue he felt they should have either let all wards contribute to its upkeep, or increased the Park Lands rate.

Cr Sampson said it was nonsense to say they could keep the Waterworks till March.  The Hydraulic Engineer, Mr Mestayer, said if he took them over he could make them pay.  Cr Anderson had been to the fore in reducing water rates and now the deficit was the result.  He had been told the Government could only rate those where the mains passed by and could only do so when it was declared a water district.  The sooner they got rid of the Waterworks the better.  If elected he would see the salaries of officers employed lowered.  The Town Clerk’s would fall from £80 to £50.  He would have Jubilee Avenue left to the whole town, not just to East Ward and would not spend money watering trees.  The eastern row of trees would simply fall over in the unconsolidated earth.

W.T. Rabbich had some ideas on reducing expenditure and supported the idea of a levy on animals sold in the town.
