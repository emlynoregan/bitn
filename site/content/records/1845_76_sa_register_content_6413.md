Advertisement.  Kooringa Election.  [Advertisement inserted by the Committee to elect H. Mildred.]

Mr Kingston advances as a claim for our votes that he is a Burra Director, that his interests are ours, and that in seeking his own good, he will be promoting ours.  We deny that the interests of the inhabitants of the townships and of Mr Kingston are identical.

High wages benefit the miners and labourers and through them the storekeepers and tradesmen, but low wages add to the profits of the Burra Mine and thus to shareholders.  As a legislator he would have a say in the control of public funds for immigration etc.  Excess immigration could depress wages.  So much for the claim that Mr Kingston’s Directorship recommends him to our votes.

He denies universal suffrage.  A property qualification is unjust except in a country where a man’s wealth is taken as a measure of his worth.  The rest of Mr Kingston’s principles have been advanced in a manner leading us to suppose him unconvinced of any convictions, but willing to make any promises or profess any principles, however inconsistent, in order to gain a post of honour for which he is unfitted.  Mr Mildred supports universal suffrage, vote by ballot, triennial Parliaments, Government aid to education, the granting of leases to the discoverers of mineral wealth, the reform of import duties, the repeal of the Distillation Act and cheap and efficient government.

He opposes Church grants, hereditary rank and entails.

With only 16 elected members (the others being nominees of the Crown) one unfit man may involve the colony in years of misgovernment.

Let us accept the SA Mining Association’s letter and vote fearlessly and according to the dictates of conscience and reason.
