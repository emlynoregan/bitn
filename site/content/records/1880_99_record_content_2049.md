Redruth Court 22 October

Stephens v. Gray for wrongful imprisonment.  An action for £100.

Stephens was arrested for cutting a wire fence across a road near the Courthouse Hotel that Gray had bought and closed.  Gray said the road was useless owing to a creek cutting off access to it since the land had been fenced and the bridge built.  He said Stephens was the worse for drink.  Stephens admitted being at the Pig and Whistle that day.  There were further complications in the long story and the verdict was ultimately for the defendant.
