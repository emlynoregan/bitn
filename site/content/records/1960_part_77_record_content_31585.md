The Burra Show was held last Saturday in perfect weather and attracted about 1,900 people.  The $545 gate set a new record.  [Claims of records need to be taken with a pinch of salt.  This was the best gate for many years, but the 1926 gate for example was Â£276-15-6 or $553 without making any allowance for inflation!  Admittedly for a two-day show.]

In most sections entries were up, though there were fewer ring entries.

Mr G. Stanley Hawker opened the show.

The sheep section could do with a lift, though it was stronger than usual.

The Flower Pavilion looked a treat.

The schools deserve to be congratulated for their display.

Grain, fruit and vegetables, cookery and needlework all received strong support.

Sideshows this year lacked variety and those present complained of a lack of business.

Burra Rural Youth and the Burra Youth Club had creditable displays.

Industrial displays were about average.

[The speeches by President M.G. Stockman and Mr G. Stanley Hawker are printed.]
