Local Board of Health.

Burra Hospital writes referring the Council to the Health Act [for its power to charge for the hospitalisation of infectious diseases cases.  The whole matter of who was responsible for both the treatment and the payment seems to have been quite confusing for the Local Board.]

A conference with the Hospital Board will be arranged.
