Weather/Floods.  Hot weather was followed by rain on Thursday which merely raised the humidity.  A spectacular electrical storm that night produced little rain.  The conditions continued on Friday with some heavy showers, but the main falls were elsewhere.  Burra recorded 88 points.  At Farrell’s Flat 280 points fell and nearby Walter Ley recorded 437 points.  To the south of Burra rain caused the Burra Creek to run past ‘The Gums’ in flood.  F.J. Duldig at World’s End said the flood could be heard from some miles away.  At Cappeedee Station Hallett 88 points fell in 12 minutes.  Falls at Mt Bryan sent a short lived flood down Burra Creek.  Floods did considerable damage around Farrell’s Flat and across towards Black Springs where Mr Hentschke’s homestead was flooded when 2 inches fell and waters from further upstream added to it.  Falls to the east were erratic: 48 at ‘The Gums’, 130 at Woolgangi, 40 at Sturt Vale, 28 at Quondong, 16 at Oakbank, 126 at Kia-Ora, 174 at Pandappa etc.
