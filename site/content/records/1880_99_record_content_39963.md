All the characters in the drama lived near each other at Hampton.  There had been gossip in which Lucy Gully had been accused of taking a staple out of Mrs Hendy’s door and stealing the (or a) carpet.  The verdict was, after a column of evidence, in favour of the Gullys in the sum of £1 plus costs in each case.
