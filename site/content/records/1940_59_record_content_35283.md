Burra Milk Vendors Refuse to Deliver Milk

When the Price Controller recently ruled that no more than 4d a pint could be charged for milk, local vendors met and decided they could not make a profit unless they charged 5d a pint.  As a result there were no deliveries of milk in Burra today.  Mr R.H. Garrard said he had been a milk vendor in Burra for seven years come September and when he started he had been receiving 4d per pint.  Since then the cost of living had risen and so had the cost of producing milk.  He was prepared to supply milk at 4d per pint to customers who called at his residence for it.  Unsold milk would go through the separator and be sold for butter.
