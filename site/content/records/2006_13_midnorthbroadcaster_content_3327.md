SAFM’s Rabbit and Amber came to Burra on 4 June as part of a competition.  The contest involved answering in 25 words or less, why the contestant wanted a trip to Paris.  At the climax each of five finalist SAFM listeners got a key that would potentially unlock Amber’s cell at the Redruth Gaol.  The winner was Emma Johns.
