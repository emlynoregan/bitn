James Linkson with his wife and family left for Broken Hill on Monday.  He had lived in Burra for over 20 years, having spent much of that time in the grocery business.  He had to give that up due to failing eyesight, but after treatment with Dr Hamilton his sight is now better than ever.  He has bought a grocery business in Broken Hill.
