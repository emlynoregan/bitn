Decimal Currency.  Today is the first anniversary of decimal currency.  The public has made many complaints about the continued use of £.s.d. in advertising, but from 1 August no contract entered into in £.s.d. will be enforceable.  75% of business machines have been converted and more than 75% of monetary transactions are done in decimal currency.  Nearly all business machines will have been converted by 1 August.  Most 3d pieces and half-pennies and pennies will have been returned to banks by then (though they remain legal tender for amount in multiples of 5c. (6d).  One of the biggest conversions yet to be completed is that of 100,000 price computing petrol pumps in 30,000 sites around Australia.
