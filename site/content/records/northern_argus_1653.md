Pat Brereton.  An article tells of this Burra artist who has a studio, previously the Hanson tennis shed, close to her house.  She has spent the past eleven years mastering watercolour.  In 1972 art classes started in Burra and in 1975 Adelaide artist Eddie Taylor took Pat under his wing and taught her some basics.  She had her first exhibition at Hawker in 1982 and since then at Clare, Tea Tree Gully, Woodville, Victor Harbor and Whyalla.  She has been married for 31 years and has 4 daughters and 6 grandchildren.  [Photo.]
