Profile by Rosemary Opperman

I am married to Peter and with our sons Matthew (21) and Michael (18) we own and operate Oppy’s Burra Foodtown.  I enjoy cooking, gardening, and watching telly in my spare time.  I was born at the Burra Hospital in 1955 and educated at Burra Primary & High Schools.  On leaving school I worked for Bence’s until I married in 1974.  I joined the Ambulance Service in 1981after doing a First Aid Course and then became a Volunteer Ambulance Officer.  In 1997 I was proud to be named Burra Citizen of the Year for my work in the ambulance Service and felt the award was received on behalf of all members of the station.  I have been Team Leader at Burra for 13 years, overseeing the daily operations of the service.  Being a member for 18 years has been a most rewarding experience.
