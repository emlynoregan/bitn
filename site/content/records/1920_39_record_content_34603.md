Burra Burra Hospital Board, Meeting 23 June

Resolved to interview the Chief Secretary with a view to having the subsidy increased to the old figure of £1,500.

Resolved to object to moves to relieve Suburban Councils from contributing to the Adelaide Hospital – any more than country ratepayers who are rated for the purpose of contributing to country hospitals.

An automatic ironer is to be purchased.

Chairman W.G. Hawkes advised he would be resigning from 30 June and an acting chairman would be needed until the new board takes over.  He thanked all for their support over the years.

Mr Warnes moved a vote of appreciation which was seconded by Sir John Melrose.  Other members of the board spoke in support.  Dr Steele regretted an emergency case prevented his attendance, but had voiced his appreciation of the chairman’s work.
