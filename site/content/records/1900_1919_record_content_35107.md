British & Foreign Bible Soc. Annual meetings were held on Sunday 20 July when the deputation, Rev. J.H. Sexton, preached at Redruth in the morning and at Kooringa in the evening.  A united young people’s service was held in the Institute in the afternoon.  Ensign Meade represented the Salvation Army and Mr Tovey the Anglicans.  Mr Sexton gave an address.  In the year the local branch had sent £27 to the cause.  They regretted the death of Mr Philip Lane, treasurer of the local branch for over 30 years.  Mr Winnall, President for 10 years, will continue with F. Harris as treasurer and Secretary.  Vice-Presidents are W. Davey & H.H. Thomas.
