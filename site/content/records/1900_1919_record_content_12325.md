Charles Kickebusche of World’s End had a narrow escape when working on a windmill with his brother, Julius.  A whirlwind frightened the horse which took off.  Julius held on to the reins and was dragged a considerable distance.  When Charles went to assist he fell and the dray’s wheel grazed his head and passed over his arm near the shoulder.  Amazingly, though very painful, it was not broken and is improving under the care of Dr Sangster.
