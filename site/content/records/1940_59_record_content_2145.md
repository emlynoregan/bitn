Burra Burra Show Inc. meeting at the Eastern Telephone Buildings yesterday decided to cancel the 1940 Show.

The executive committee turned itself into the Burra Burra Show War Committee and will devote all its efforts to supporting the war with the object first of supplying an ambulance or an aeroplane.  The society voted a donation of £100 and Messrs I.J. Warnes & Sons Ltd donated £250.  Other donations at the meeting ranging from £5-5-0 to £25 brought the total to £444-7-0.

Mr Warnes said the turn the war had taken in the past three weeks had forced this decision.  If a show were held it would distract the efforts of those most involved in Red Cross and other patriotic efforts, it would involve the use of much petrol.  He recommended they turn their efforts to raising money for an ambulance or an aeroplane.

S.H. Robinson moved there be no 1940 Show.  H.J.B. Jennison agreed and supported the motion as did Rex Warnes and Mr Gare.  The motion was carried.

Mr W. Lloyd moved the Society donate £100, seconded Mr Lockett and carried.

The next meeting of the new committee will be 18 June.
