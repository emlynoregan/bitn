Mr Winship and the Burra Miners

A short time ago Mr J.B. Winship of the Australian Agricultural and Coal Company in NSW came to SA for the purpose of securing miners to work in the company’s Newcastle coal mines.  He was very successful.  He went to Burra and secured 100 miners and their families, whom he took back with him on his return to Newcastle.  In addition he either engaged or made such representations to two to three hundred more that made them believe they were justified in quitting their work and selling up preparatory to moving to Newcastle.  Many did so and are now waiting in Adelaide, reduced almost to beggary.  A letter just received from Mr Winship puts and end to all their hopes:

‘Australian Agricultural Company

Newcastle Nov. 21, 1862

‘Dear Sir – I wish you would write to Thomas Chaple at Kooringa, saying that for the present you cannot give passages to any more men who may be desirous until you get further instructions from this end.  And please tell them you can on no account can you give them a passage unless they pay for it, and then, of course, you have no alternative.

‘Our coal trade is very slack and we cannot take any more men just now.

‘Yours Faithfully,

Jas. B. Winship.

‘Messrs G. Bartleet and Co.

Merchants, Adelaide.’

In the absence of Mr Winship’s explanation we cannot tell the extent of his responsibility for the misery brought upon so many.  But it is clear from the letter sent that there must have been some understanding with the man left behind or instructions would not have been sent to stop the exodus.  The sooner he seeks to exculpate himself from the charge preferred against him of violating his engagement with the miners the better.  We hope he will not be slow to make compensation for the injuries he has inflicted, if the statements made to us be correct.

It is said that the men who have already taken employment under Mr Winship are dissatisfied with their bargain and have written to their friends recommending that they should not leave their employment here.
