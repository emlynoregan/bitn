The St Joseph’s Concert at the Institute on Wednesday to raise money for the school had to contend with bad weather, threatening rain.

[It is interesting to note that the performers were not confined to the town and district’s Catholics but included others like Miss Bentley, Miss M. Pearce and Mr C. Fuss.]
