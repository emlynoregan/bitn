Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

The mid-1850s was the period of greatest prosperity for the mine with Morphett’s Engine installed, ore prices high and the smelters going satisfactorily.  Above ground operations were simplified though the organisation of wood supply, hay, wheat and bran to feed the horses (at least 100) and candles still needed attention.  There was a good ford to the Smelting Works.  Increasingly some of the hay needed was grown closer to Burra.

[He then details the assay arrangements between the mining and the smelting companies.]

Woollacott delivered wood at 17/- a ton.  He had a series of contracts, one for 2,000 tons at 16/9.  (At the rate of 300 tons per month.)  A year later James Pascoe and W. Holmes got contracts at 16/9 a ton for 700 tons and W. Woollacott for 10,000 tons at 17/3 a ton.  In July 1860 there was a contract for 400 tons at 17/6.

The Smelting Co. in 1860 paid 20/- a ton for the supply of 600-800 tons per week.  Wood was obtained under licence. (Costing £5 for 12 months on Crown Land.)  Woollacott for instance sought a protection order for 8 squ. miles near Ulooloo Creek.  Wood had to be weighed and it was not unusual to see teams lined up 50 deep north and south of the Mine Bridge waiting their turn.  In 1860 wood licences were sought by Josiah Thomas, James Thomas, Luke Teddy, William Holmes & Henry Collins, of whom only Henry Collins of Mt Bryan survives today.  [He died 18 October 1929]

[Treloar then goes on to give prices for fodder from 1857 to 1860.]

Tallow was also a problem and in short supply especially in 1857-58.  In February 1858 the stocks of candles ran down to 7 days reserve and in 1859 they also got down to a few days.  In 1860 the candle maker asked SAMA to erect a shed for him 3-ft x 17ft x 6ft and when they refused he gave a month’s notice.  Wilson had been very satisfactory and when his successor arrived he had to be retained to initiate him into the mysteries of the office.

The Karkulta Mine kept giving occasional pockets of good ore, but they always petered out.  Most of it was 3-4%.  This was of use as flux and hundreds of tons were sent to the Smelters.  In June 1858 Tiver & Pickering applied for a lease for 21 years on 1 acre of land near the cemetery for brick making and it was later granted for £10 p.a. and they made good bricks at 65/- per 1,000.  The good years for the mine were:	1857	11,105 tons raised

1858	12,486

1859	14,094
