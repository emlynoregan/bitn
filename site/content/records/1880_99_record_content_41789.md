Burra Town Council, 23 June.

Mr Geake’s tender of £4-5-0 per quarter for lighting the lamps on Henderson’s Bridge and in Market Square was accepted.

Tenders for work on the drain near Bagot, Shakes and Lewis’s yards came up for consideration.

Cr Rabbich asked for the specifications to be read.  He considered them inadequate and was not prepared to vote on their basis.  He asked permission to retire - granted.

J. Snell’s tender of £7-10-0 was accepted over that of Fitzgerald & Herbert of £10-15-0.

Council endorsed Cr Sampson’s view that the iron urinal that cost £26 would be better [for the Avenue site] than if they erected something unsightly.  They now have to get the Institute Committee’s concurrence.
