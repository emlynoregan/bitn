Land Improvement.  A major land improvement program is about to get under way from Robertstown to Canowie.  It is an initiative of the Hummocks Soil Conservation Board and the Clare Office of Primary Industries and Resources SA.  It will aim to reduce water erosion, improve soil structure and fertility, reduce flooding and silting of roads and improve farming sustainability generally.  Landowners will be involved in extensive consultation.
