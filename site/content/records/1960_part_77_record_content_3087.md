Bence’s Sale drew a record crowd.  155 cars at one time lined the main street.  Only a portion of the crowd could be admitted at one time.  Mr Len Bence reports a terrific volume of business, but says there will be plenty of bargains for the rest of the week.  [Further half-page advertisement on page 7.]
