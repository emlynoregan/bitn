Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 23 January

The Commissioner of railways has sent a plan and proposed works to which the Council agreed.

[This was in response to the Councilâ€™s objection to the obstruction placed in the Burra Creek, which presumably was placed there in October 1892.

See: XIV, 215, 26 Oct. 1892, page 3
