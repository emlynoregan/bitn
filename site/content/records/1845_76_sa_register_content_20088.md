‘Cosmopolite’ writes to complain that far from being an improvement on Mr Rounsevell’s coaches, the service of Cobb & Co. is ‘a vast falling off’.  He complains of overcrowded buses on the run to Glenelg – and moreover, fares have risen sharply.

‘A Traveller’ writes to complain that Cobb & Co.’s promises of reduced fares have not been kept:

Their charges are the ‘reverse of moderate’, which is what they promised to deliver.

[Instances of their fares are then cited.]

He also complains that accommodation in their conveyances is ‘generally very inferior’.
