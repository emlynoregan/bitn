W.T. Rabbich writes in reply to W.H. Hardy who had accused the Burra Town Council of being extremists in passing the new by-law and asserted that the members ‘are now bereft of their reasonable faculties.’  In fact, says Rabbich, Cr Hardy was a prime mover in getting copies of similar by-laws as used in other places.  He was on the committee that drew up the by-law and principally selected the one which, with certain alterations, the committee unanimously agreed to.  But as a weathercock, Cr Hardy swung round at the Council meeting when it was brought forward for consideration.  The Council departed from legislation in other towns by making the exceptions that it did.  Cr Rabbich goes on to hope that Cr Hardy ‘will have in future some little respect for the decision, not only of a majority of his fellow Councillors, but for gentlemen living in other towns, who have for years tolerated such as the matter in question and that under like circumstances not ascribe unto them foolishness.’
