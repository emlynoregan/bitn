Burra Primary School

The school achieved a 100% pass rate in the Qualifying Examinations this year, from the 23 candidates.  The headmaster, Mr L.P. Davis has a near perfect record in preparing students for this examination, with only one of 320 pupils he has coached, failing to get a certificate.

During the year the enrolment fell from 181 to 151, but in the last few weeks has risen to 162.  There have been a number of staff changes.  Since December 1940 teachers have been: Mr N. Lowe, Mr W. Battye, Miss Chrystal, Mr T. Corry, Miss M. Peake and Mrs H. White.  The present staff are Messrs P. Davis, T. Corry, Miss M.V. Pearce and Mrs H. White.

Religious instruction had been introduced during this year.

The Schools’ Patriotic Fund has been most active, with donations, waste collection and knitted garments.  They have earned 92 badges, 133 bars, 17 wings and 2 aeroplanes.

Waste products collected are valued at £98-5-3 and 785 bags have been sent away by rail.  Cash donations totalled £49-1-8.  War Savings have amounted to £422-8-10

The school dux was Barbara Jennison.  [Other wards winners are listed.]
