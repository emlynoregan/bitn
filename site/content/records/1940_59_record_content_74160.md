The River Murray Flood Appeal in Burra was launched on Friday in Market Square by Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and the Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr M. de N. Lucas.  The present total of £715 includes:	I.J. Warnes & Sons Ltd	£250

Mr & Mrs Rex C. Warnes	£100

Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant	£100

Mr J.R. Barker	£100

Mr S.A. James, Mayor of Renmark, has made a further appeal for food, as there are presently over 400 volunteers to be served three meals a day.  Burra CWA has promised help.  Donations of fresh meat may be left at the cold stores.  Spalding CWA is sending a truckload of food on Wednesday.  Booborowie donations may be left at Dinham Bros’ shop.

Fourteen members from Burra RSL went to Renmark at the weekend and delivered 3,500 bags provided by Mt Bryan and Burra graziers.  A considerable supply of foodstuffs was also delivered.  [The page 5 article of some ⅔ column outlines what happened at Renmark.]
