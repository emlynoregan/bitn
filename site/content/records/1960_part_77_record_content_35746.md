Burra Rural Youth Annual Report compiled by Past-President Phil Lannon.

The stand at the Burra Show was a creditable effort by the members and the Show Dance went well.

There were successful dances on Christmas Eve and Easter Saturday.  A concert early in 1967 aided the Burra Hospital.  Inter-club activities have increased and included:

A visit by Gawler for the Burra Show weekend.

A sporting evening with the Crystal Brook Club.

A bowls night with the Clare Club.

A visit by Saddleworth Club for our Christmas Social

A visit to Pt Lincoln over the Queen’s Birthday Holiday weekend.

Burra also hosted the Stud Merino Tour and again reached the finals in Zone Debating, only to be defeated by Gladstone.

[Lannon continues to detail their agricultural, cultural and social program.]

Through the year numbers on the roll increased from 49 to 63.  Average attendance has been 40 in recent months.

Richard Riggs was a successful applicant for the Beef Stud Tour.

Geoff Dare was awarded a Leader’s Badge.

Bob Neill and Geoff Dare hosted an overseas visitor, Bill Hamilton.

Mary Woollacott won the Public Speaking at the Spalding Rally and now proceeds to the State Finals.
