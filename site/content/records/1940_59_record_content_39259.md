Burra Rifle Club attempted to fire the 10th stage of the Woodman Trophy on Saturday over 600 and double 700 yards.  The wind was very strong and inconsistent.  The 600 range was completed satisfactorily, but anxious eyes were alert for thunderstorms.  The first 700 yard range started with shooters contending with gale force winds.  Anything up to 14Â° changes had to be made while the shooting was on, which meant that the wind was blowing bullets out of direction by anything up to seven feet.  Nevertheless, things were satisfactory at the shooters end, which was partially sheltered.  In the pits however, the markers were struggling with the targets, which were exposed to the full force of the gale.  Eventually number two target snapped off, to be followed soon after by number one.  The rain then descended in sheets and the shoot had to be postponed.
