Article celebrating Burra Community Print’s 10th Birthday

[Actually this date celebrated the 10th anniversary of Terry Wilson’s arrival as owner/editor and the transformation of the publication from a largely advertising medium to a more conventional newspaper.  The Burra Broadcaster began in 1991 and the information in the 100th issue indicates that Burra Community Print predated the Burra Broadcaster:

Issue 100, 24 February 1993 page 1: The Burra Broadcaster

This issue is the 100th since changing to the present format.  All in all the advertising medium put out by the Burra Community Print has seen 415 editions and editorial comment has been running for 112 editions.  The Broadcaster began when BCP moved to new premises in December 1990.

In fact the origin of Burra Community Print as a business appears to be in August 1984, with an announcement in Burra School & Community News of 16 August 1984

[An insert] Burra Community Print 7 Bridge Terrace, Burra.

From the beginning of August we announce a new printing service for Burra and the Surrounding Areas.

Design – Artwork – Print – Collate – Bind

Trevor Walshaw.

The reference to editions before January 1991 is unclear, but presumably refers to material distributed by insertion in Burra School & Community News.  I have noted advertising inserts in that publication from 1985 onwards.  These insertions were certainly printed by Burra Community Print and frequently carried large advertisements for that business.]

When Terry Wilson took over in 1993 there was one casual employee, Cory Heneker who then became an apprentice.  Within a few months the business needed another employee and Julie Pawelski was taken on as a Graphic Arts apprentice.  The business was then located where Mongolata Gold now operates, but this proved too small and a move was made to the Jennison Building, which had previously housed Burra Video and Photographics.  Equipment was updated, allowing full colour works and the whole gamut of commercial printing.  The opportunity to offer the Eudunda community a newspaper content they had not enjoyed for more than twenty years was a challenge that was eagerly embraced.  An office was opened in Pt Pirie and one briefly in Pt Augusta.  Danny Smith completed his apprenticeship with Burra Community Print early in 2003.  Helen Stockman has been the editor for much of this year.  Burra Community Print produced Maureen & Barry Wright’s 7th edition of their book River Murray Chart; a project involving more than three tonnes of paper and board.  [5 photos.]
