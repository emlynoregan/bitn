W.V. Ford writes on returning to the town after an absence of 38 years and being dismayed to find that Aberdeen no longer exists.  He was sorry to see such a small attendance at Redruth Methodist Church.  He believed the mine area was a tourist asset going to waste.  He was glad to renew acquaintance with Jock Bernhardt, Stan Woollacott, Hedley Pearce, Cliff Turner and Sid. Scroop.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells asked to be remembered to friends.
