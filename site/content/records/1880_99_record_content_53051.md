Burra Military Sports.

The Mounted Rifle Company was founded about two years ago with Government inducements and numbers at one time reached about 40.  A short time ago the Government cut military expenses and the Mounted Rifles suffered along with others.  The cost to volunteer rose and some had to drop out.  It is to the company’s credit that they have journeyed to Adelaide and other centres for exercises.  Captain Watt decided a few weeks ago to organise an afternoon of sports for 21 February.  Col. Gordon was elected Patron and Mayor Killicoat the President.  The day brought perfect weather and businesses in Burra closed promptly at noon.  A parade was held from Market Square to the Hospital and then to Redruth and Aberdeen, led by the Burra Band and finally to R. Austin’s paddock in Aberdeen.  By late afternoon at least 1,000 had assembled at the ground.  Preparation for cleaving the Turk’s head saw Pte Schutz’s horse collide with Capt. Watt’s.  The Captain was thrown forward and with difficulty regained his seat, but couldn’t get his feet back in the stirrups before the horse bolted.  In attempting the road fence the horse struck a post and broke it off; both horse and rider fell.  The horse got up, but the Captain was almost unconscious and his nose and upper lip were badly cut, each needing three stitches.  He was taken to the doctor’s and Lieut. Blott took over the rest of the day.  The events contested were:

Best Drilled Section	Tilting at the Ring

130 yd Handicap Foot Race, Boys <17	Cleaving the Turk’s Head

Tug-of-War, Mounted Bareback	Tent-pegging

Race with Polo Balls	½ mile Camp Race

Thread the Needle Race	135 yd Handicap Foot Race

Rescue Race	¾ Mile Flat Race

Afterwards there was a social evening at the Commercial Hotel.  The accident to Captain Watt saw this somewhat curtailed with no musical items after the toasts and most left about 9.30 p.m.  The ball that followed saw only a fair attendance.
