Dr Smith asked if the Board was really out of line in refusing Nurse Mosey’s request and Mr Hawkes conceded that they had a right to decide.  When Dr Smith tried to elicit who would benefit by her studies Hawkes equivocated.

Dr Smith: ‘If an employer [sic] refused to do his duty until you withdrew insulting words, what would you do?

I would dismiss him but I would not put him on again.’

[The context needs ‘employee’ rather than ‘employer’.]

Asked if the Hospital could continue with one doctor Mr Hawkes was sure it could not.

Dr Smith pointed out to George Hann that if you went to a public hospital you could not expect to choose your own doctor unless you paid 10/- for private accommodation and then if your own doctor doesn’t attend it is his fault.

Mr Treloar was recalled and said he had notified Dr Ashton of his appointment as an honorary Surgeon with the same status as at the Adelaide Hospital – Dr Ashton had not accepted the position.

Sister Mildred, Matron since March 1917 and previously charge sister since November 1915 (except for 6 months sick leave) said she had no complaints about Dr Williams or the Board and was not aware Dr Ashton had made any complaints about her to the Board.  On one occasion he wanted to operate at 11 a.m. and she had said it was very inconvenient, as they were short handed and she requested any time after 6 a.m. or 4 p.m., so she might have the aid of the night nurses.  He had said ‘Be damned to you, it is none of your business, you want to manage my business.  If you don’t do as I say, I will report you to the Inspector-General of Hospitals.’

The doctor’s desired arrangement was a practical impossibility.  The charge nurse was away on examination, there was only one junior nurse, a probationer, on day duty, the ward could not be left and the witness required help in the theatre.  The operation was postponed.

Dr Ashton’s preferred time for operations was to start about 8 p.m., which meant the nurses who had worked all day were up till 1 and 2 a.m., as there was no one to relieve them.  So far as the matron could judge some of the operations were not urgent.  Some cases had been in the hospital a fortnight and other arrangements could easily have been made.  She had reported the matter concerning the patient whose case had initiated the trouble to the Board.

One day Dr Ashton came to the hospital at 11.40 and asked a nurse if she had the patient in the theatre at 11 a.m.  The nurse said she knew nothing about it.  Dr Ashton asked the Matron if she had not received an order from the night nurse to prepare the patient.  She had not.  He said he had instructed Nurse Fuss to do so for 11 o’clock.  Nurse Fuss subsequently said she had received no such orders.  Dr Ashton told the witness the staff was not sufficient and Matron said by the Board’s orders she had tried to get help and could not.  Dr Ashton said that was not his affair whether the staff was sufficient or not, if anything happened he would refuse to give a death certificate and would report the matter to the coroner.

It would be an advantage to hospital administration if all orders for operations were given to me.  There were not always consultations before operations.  In most hospitals certain days and hours are recognised for operations: in Burra the hour was determined by the operator’s convenience except in emergencies, and not by the necessity of the patient, or the convenience of the staff.  It would be easier if there were a recognised rule and the lack of such caused all the friction so far as I am concerned.  The doctors used to make it a point to visit daily at meal hours.  She asked the doctor not to go into the ward at meal times and the reply was ‘it suited him and he would do so’. 

Mr A.J. McBride, Chairman of the Board, submitted the minutes and other documents and said he believed the trouble was largely due to the Board’s desire to control admissions.  Mr Hawkes was the first to object to their having sole control and the regulation fell into disuse.  As far as memory served the alleged discourtesy to Dr Steele occurred 12-18 months after the Nurse Mosey case.  In the context of the occasion Mr Warnes had appealed to the Chairman re the doctor’s power to intervene and the Chairman had said to the doctor ‘You mind your own business.’  But it had been neither intended nor taken as an insult.

Dr Ashton had been given the reason ‘disregarding instructions’ as the reason for his dismissal.

He was appointed Honorary Surgeon because a father of a boy patient wanted him to operate on the boy.  Dr Ashton still had the power of sending anyone to the hospital.  He had not acknowledged the letter appointing him Honorary Surgeon.

In operations he thought the interests of patients and staff should be considered before the convenience of the operator.  The causes of the trouble were: the hours of operating, the method of giving instructions, the refusal to attend Board meetings and the method of admitting patients.  Many patients treated as ‘poor’ by the hospital and not made to pay, had been charged by the doctors.  A man named Honeychurch, a poor farmer of Baldina, was charge 25/- per week for 11 weeks’ nursing medicine etc. (£25-5-0) and Dr Ashton charged him £34 for the operation.  Under the rules as Dr Ashton was a paid officer he thought the hospital could have charged the patient a fair thing for the operation, but that was not contemplated.

[Two other examples of Dr Ashton’s charging poor patients are cited.]

Dr Smith queried whether Dr Ashton could legally claim such fees when he was an employee of the hospital.  Mr McBride thought he could not.

Matron Mildred was recalled and further questioned re the 11 a.m. operation called when staff were unavailable.  It was postponed for about two days.  ‘I did not go into the theatre because of friction between myself and Dr Ashton’.   She was questioned on appendix cases and the need to disinfect the theatre after septic appendix cases.

Mr Mitchell found the evidence amazing: ‘it looked as though the doctor wanted to operate on another patient before the theatre had been disinfected after a septic case.’

Mr Crewes.  Dr Smith asked Mr Crewes: ‘You think that the doctor should have the power to do as he likes in regard to hours, upset the meal times of the nurses and the arrangements of the hospital generally?’  Crewes said: Yes for cases of urgency.

Mr Crewes considered his position of Mayor and member of the Board produced a conflict of interest and he wished to say as little as possible.  He did consider that in the case of Dr Ashton alleging he could not get his orders carried out no finality could be arrived at in the enquiry because Dr Ashton refused to attend any meeting.

‘In my opinion he was very foolish not to attend.’

Dr Smith asked that if all the trouble results from Dr Ashton’s foolishness what should be done.

Mr Crewes was not passing judgement, but if the Board had lost the confidence of the people it should resign.

Dr Smith asked: On the other hand if a paid employee of a Board refuses to do his duty, whose duty is it to resign?

Crewes: There is only one thing to do, pass him out.

Dr Smith: Did you satisfy yourself that Dr Ashton had refused to carry out the written instructions of the Board?

Crewes: I felt the time was inopportune for dismissal and fought unsuccessfully for deferral until another letter had been written asking him to attend.

Mr Mitchell: Several letters had been written by the Board and Dr Ashton had been interviewed and he would not do as requested.  How long do you think the patience of an employer should hang out?

Dr Smith: Do you know that the ex-officio appointment of the Mayor of Burra as a member of the Board is illegal under the Act?

Mr Crewes: No.

Nurse Fuss said she was temporarily acting as night nurse on the occasion when Dr Ashton alleged he had given orders for a patient to be prepared for an operation at 11 a.m.  Dr Ashton had given her no such order.

Mr I.J. Warnes said he had brought the account sent by Dr Ashton to Miss Store to the notice of the Board.  It had been said he obtained the lawyer’s letter demanding payment by unfair means.  It had been handed to him by another member whom he understood to have got it by fair means.

Subsequent statements by Dr Ashton had shed a different light upon the case.

The enquiry was adjourned.
