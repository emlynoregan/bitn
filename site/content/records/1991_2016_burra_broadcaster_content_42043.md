John Brak has tendered his resignation as Goyder Council CEO, effective from 31 December 2016.  Mayor Mattey said he and the Council had received the news with regret.  John Brak said it was a personal decision, made more difficult because he headed a group of motivated employees, had a good working relationship with the Mayor and Councillors and the Council was financially sustainable.  He said however, the excitement of the job had waned and maintaining motivation to lead the organisation to greater heights had become a struggle.  [Photo.]

After resigning, Mr Brak intends to take a ‘gap year’, spending time travelling, with his family and at home.  This may not end in retirement – ‘who knows what opportunities may present in the future.’

Mr Brak has spent 43 years in local government service.
