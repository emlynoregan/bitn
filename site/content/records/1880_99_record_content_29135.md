Common Sense’ writes in reply to ‘Adult’ pointing out that Bands of Hope are in fact aimed at the instruction and amusement of children, to bring before them the many evils of intemperance.  If ‘Adult’ is not satisfied perhaps he should start monthly temperance meetings for adults.  His proposals for meetings would not meet the needs of children.
