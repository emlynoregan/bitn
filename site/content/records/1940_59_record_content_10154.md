Burra Institute asks the Council for Financial Assistance

On 4 May the Finance Committee of the Institute comprising Messrs A.B. Riggs, F.C. Worth, F. Reed, R.T. Bowles, H. Jennison and S.C. Genders waited on the Council and asked for financial assistance.

Mr A.B. Riggs said that for 12 months ending January 1942 the Institute had been without a committee and thanks were due to the four trustees who had carried on.  The Burra Corporation was one of the largest that did not have a Civic Hall of its own.  There was no agreement between the Corporation and the Institute about the use of the Council Chambers.  The Committee found it was the rule in SA for Councils to assist the Institutes and they thought this Council could do likewise.  He suggested the Council strike a 3d rate for the purpose.

Mr Genders said the committee was finding difficulty in making ends meet.  The library was one of the best outside Adelaide and his committee was keen to put the affairs of the Institute on a sound financial footing.  A goods committee had been elected this year, but did not have a penny to spend on renovations and it was a pity to let such a fine building deteriorate.  He also hated to think the library could be closed and dispersed.  Expenditure had been cut to the bone.  Other Corporations had assisted Institutes in their centres to the extent of £100.

His Worship said that in other words the committee wanted the Corporation to collect money for the Institute Committee to spend.

Mr Bowles asked if a special rate had been struck to aid the Institute last year.

His Worship said that when rates had been struck the Institute had not been taken over by the Council.  At a meeting held on the subject a unanimous vote had been recorded for the Corporation to take over the Institute.

Mr Genders said all the money would not be spent on renovations because interest and principal dues were in arrears.  The DC had granted the committee the sum of £50 that afternoon.

Cr Lott asked if the Corporation gave a donation could the Council have sole use of the Council Chamber.

Mr Riggs said he could practically guarantee that.

His Worship said the committee had already been given two lots of £60 by the Corporation and had received all the money from the ‘Back to Burra’ and the very furniture in the Council Chamber had been bought by public effort.  The Council would like a room of its own.  Shortly he would call a ratepayers’ meeting and the matter would be discussed.

Cr Kellaway said the Institute had received c. £120 from the Council when he was Mayor.  If the committee received any further assistance from the Council he would suggest it be donated on a rental basis for the Council Room, giving the Council sole use of it.

The matter will lie on the table till the next meeting.
