Burra High School Break-up

As usual the year ended with a concert at the Institute and the presentation of prizes and awards.

[Concert items are described in about ¾ column.]

Mr Charlesworth said the school’s activities for the year had been reported weekly in the Record and so he would make only a short address instead of repeating all the events.  The school had broken a record this year when attendance reached 65 compared with the previous record of 62 in 1931.  For the whole year removal and sickness saw the average attendance fall to 54, but this was still a record high, beating the previous best of 52.8.  He especially had to thank Miss Isom for her help with all plays and dances and strenuous work at the piano, on top of all her regular duties.

Dr Steele gave an address as President of the High School Council.  In the Centenary Year he felt it did no harm to look back over a century of achievement by the pioneers and their successors.

Awards were presented.

After interval the entertainment continued.

[A further ½ column of detail is provided and the list of awards fills another ½ column.]
