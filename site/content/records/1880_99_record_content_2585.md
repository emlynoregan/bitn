Letter from ‘The Old Billy of All’ who again thanks the good people of the town for the general immunity the goats have enjoyed from the Inspector’s gun, and from O’Leary’s Pound (with few exceptions) and from ‘ecclesiastical anathemas’.

‘we have been allowed perfect freedom to walk either in the middle of the street, or on the model pathways, we have entered open gates, and when closed we have jumped over them, we have refreshed ourselves on nice young trees and have enjoyed a delicious bite or two at small flower-beds etc. etc.’

‘Wishing all those who have nice gardens and a splendid lot of trees a “Happy New Year.”’
