The Season.  Nick Wadlow of Old Ashrose, Booborowie says the crops are just hanging o.  5.5 mm last week freshened them up, but did not add to soil moisture.  They had received only 201 mm so far this year and only 112 mm in the growing season.

The Website www.burra.history.info has been set up by Rosemary Ros, a resident of North Carolina, USA, in return for research done for her [by Meredith Satchell of The Burra History Group].  Her partner, Andrew Pearce is descended from the Pearces of Pearce’s Buildings in Burra.  The site promotes Burra Town Hall and Burra’s history in general, with timelines, maps, photographs and histories of local places and buildings.
