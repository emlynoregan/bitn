Burglary.  On Friday 24 December thieves broke into the powder magazine, where Drew & Crewes store explosives, and stole c. £3-15-0 worth of dynamite and an unknown stock of powder.  Having got through the outer door by breaking the lock, they used ¾” piping to lever away the inner doorframe after drilling between it and the wall.
