East Lynne was produced at the Burra Institute on 3 April to a fair house.  It was staged very effectively and all parts were well carried out.  On their return the company will present Uncle Tomâ€™s Cabin.

[The company is not here named, but was presumably the Wilson-Forbes Dramatic Co. referred to in issue 411.]
