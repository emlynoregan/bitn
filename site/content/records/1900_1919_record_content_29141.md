The Sports Syndicate.  F. Treloar secretary of the syndicate reports that Mr Albert Gebhardt of Mackerode has made a gift of 23 acres to be added to the sports ground at the north end of the town, so now there is adequate land for the showgrounds and a racecourse.  This is a valuable gift, seeing that the rest of the paddock sold last week for Â£10 an acre.  Mr Gebhardt was a member of the original syndicate.
