Trevor John Underwood

From Booborowie and married to Rhonda and have 1 son and 3 grandchildren

Lived at Booborowie for 15 years, prior to which was in the RAAF for 9 years

Have been involved in various committees and managed the refuse depots at Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett

Believe it is necessary that the smaller towns get representation by a person prepared to voice their opinions and needs as well as representing the community as a whole
