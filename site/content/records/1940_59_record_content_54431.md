Burra Burra DC, 7 April

The Highways & Local Government Department approved spending an extra £1,000 on the main Booborowie-Black Springs Road. [It is unclear to me which road is meant.  Booborowie-Hanson perhaps and then which?]

A.R. Downer MP advised that the World’s End telephone exchange was now open two extra hours daily, Monday to Saturday, i.e. 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and also that a rural automatic exchange operated at Hanson from 2 April 1952.

An invitation was received for the Council to attend Anzac Day Service 22 April [sic: error for 27 April.]
