Kooringa News, 6 March

St Mary’s is about to lose Rev. D.H.J. Ibbetson.  I believe he is appointed to St John’s Adelaide and will leave here next week.  Rev. Mr Fulford is mentioned as his replacement.

The forthcoming election has not so far aroused any interest here.

There is great dissatisfaction with the mail service between here and Kapunda.  The accommodation of passengers could be much improved and should be attended to if the contractor wishes to retain his monopoly.

It is to be hoped that the recent fire will be a salutary lesson to the town.  Precautions against such events have habitually been disregarded here, with highly flammable items stored in unsuitable places and fires carelessly suffered to exist so that it is a wonder the whole town has not been consumed long ago.
