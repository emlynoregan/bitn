W.J. Lee and R.C. Lott, as candidates for West Ward, made short speeches in which they promised to do their best for the ward and the town.

Mr F.L. Worth made a long speech [in which he devoted considerable effort to overcome the disadvantage of not being born locally and in being a relatively recent arrival.]

He presented an argument with figures to show that the swimming pool would need to make a profit of £60 p.a. to repay in ten years the interest and principal of the debentures that were planned to finance it.  While he supported the pool in principal, he could not give it unqualified support until he had thoroughly investigated the financial viability, so that ratepayers would not end up saddled with a debt.  On Sunday sport he was personally tolerant, but believed it should be decided by the weight of public opinion.  He was in favour of the Council acting to protect local businesses from the activities of hawkers.  The health aspect of hawkers’ goods being unprotected from contamination by dirt and flies was also a consideration.  He supported moves to see that Burra took its proper place in the State’s Centenary Celebrations; appropriate to its role in the history of the State.
