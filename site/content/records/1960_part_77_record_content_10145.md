Burra High School.  The Parents & Friends’ Association had about 80 persons at their first meeting for the year.  The present credit balance was £360.  This is a good start towards financing two tennis courts, two half-cricket pitches and a sprinkler system to water a grassed area for football, softball and athletics.  The Education Department has granted £135 for the initial ground formation of the ‘Flat’.
