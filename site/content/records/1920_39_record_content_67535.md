Fire.  At 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday last fire broke out in the kitchen of Mrs C. Woollacott at Redruth, probably from a box iron, but it was soon extinguished.  This was lucky as the fire engine firstly wouldnâ€™t start and then fused its lights near the post office.  The old Ford is always hard to start in cold weather and it is time a more up-to-date appliance was acquired.
