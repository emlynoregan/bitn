Electric Lighting Scheme Revived.

At Burra Town Council on Monday Messrs Christie & Gardiner, consultant engineers of Melbourne, offered to draw up a report and give an estimate of the cost of lighting Burra with electricity.  The report is to be gratis.  The cost of the plant would be £5,000 to £5,400.  The engineers had inspected the town at the Mayor’s invitation.  They considered a scheme would pay and suggest a powerhouse site between Kooringa and Aberdeen.  The railways would be a customer.  They showed balance sheets from various plants they had installed with the cost to consumers, and each was very payable.  The mayor though something needed to be done at once if at all since several residents were on the point of installing private schemes.  Mr Lord had already done so.  Mr Crewes had just had time to cancel an order for his firm and Mr Clark was holding off on a Council decision.

Cr Radford moved the offer be accepted.

‘The present lighting scheme would be a disgrace to a wayside pub.’

The Mayor said £5,000 at 6% would cost £300 and at present they paid £150 per year for 20 miserable lights, which often would not burn.
