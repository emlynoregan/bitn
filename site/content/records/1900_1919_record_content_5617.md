Boer War.  There was a social at the Institute on Thursday last to welcome home Cpl Gully and Trooper Sangster.  It was a great success with Mayâ€™s Brass band playing outside the hall and the Burra Defence Rifle Club forming a guard of honour.  The Mayor, E.W. Crewes presided and gave a stirring address on The Australian Soldier.  Various others spoke and the guests then graphically described some of their adventures.  Others responding were F. Edwards from Petersburg & L-Cpl Harry from Adelaide.  There were songs and then refreshments.
