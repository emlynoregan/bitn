The Orroroo Railway was opened last Tuesday.  A special train left Adelaide at 0630 and reached Burra at 1030, carrying the Governor [Sir William Jervois] and MPs.  They transferred to the narrow gauge at Terowie and reached Orroroo c. 1400, where a crowd of c. 1,500 had assembled.  After a banquet at the Institute, the official party started back c. 1600.
