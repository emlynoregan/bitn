Burra Town Council, 4 Feb.

Cr Rabbich moved the proposal of the Commissioner [re the Waterworks] be accepted.  Cr O’Leary 2nd.

Cr Pinch moved it stand over to 30 June to see what was happening with the Mine.  Cr Sampson 2nd.  He thought the Waterworks a bad bargain.  Amendment lost and motion carried.

Mr Packard retained as Council solicitor at a fee not to exceed £10-10-0.

Cr Hardy moved Council secure the carrying out of the agreement between Mr Ridgway and Council re the Aberdeen Reserve in which he was bound to spend £5 a year on it. Motion lost.

Cr Rabbich said they had no right to interfere till the end of year 7 when they could see if £35 had been expended.
