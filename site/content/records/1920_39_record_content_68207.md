Burra Bowling Club AGM Burra Hotel 8 September

Membership was the best since 1933.  Of the seven inter-club matches Burra won only one, but that win regained for Burra the Burra-Kapunda Cup.  In December last year a Syndicate was formed which paid off the overdraft at the bank and the property has been transferred to them.  The amount paid was £526 and the interest on that sum is the club’s rental.  The Club now has the right to purchase at any time for the same figure.  Thanks to Mr Bednall for rendering his services free of charge in effecting the transfer.  Elected were Patron, Dr D.M. Steele; President, Mr S.H. Robinson; Vice-Presidents, M. Pearce & H.W. Mumme and Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.
