Accident.  Cliff Turner had a narrow escape while bringing in a load of furniture to Burra on Thursday per trolly.  About two miles out of Spalding the horses shied and Mr Turner who is well over 6ft fell in front of the vehicle and the four wheels passed over his body and feet.  Fortunately they were rubber-tyred.  His employer was following in a dray and drove Mr Turner to Gill’s for assistance.  He was attended to at Spalding Hospital and transferred to Burra on Friday by Rev. Cannon of Spalding.  He has broken ribs and other bruising.
