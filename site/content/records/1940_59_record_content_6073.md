The Commissioner of Public Works advises that the Government intended to enter into a lease of the Ballast Quarry at Burra North as a result of the case recently put to him by the Town Council Deputation.  Mr Woollacott said he understood the lease would be for a considerable period of time.  If re-opened the quarry would provide much employment.
