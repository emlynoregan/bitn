Burra Hospital

The new theatre and casualty block at the Burra Hospital is nearing completion.  The new building will have the same floor level as the remainder of the Hospital and its tiled floors, shining fixtures and fittings will lend itself to sterility and efficiency.  A diesel plant automatically comes into operation when a power fault occurs; the changeover takes fifteen seconds and this is covered by a battery operated second auxiliary, whose batteries are automatically kept charged.  As soon as the new theatre is ready the old theatre block will be reconstructed into domestic quarters, a board room and a sewing room.  Despite the difficult seasons lately the Departmental Inspector reports that the district has raised $12,565 to the 29 February.  The Hospitalâ€™s financial position is satisfactory.  Average costs have fallen because occupied bed strength has increased by 2.3 per day and this has resulted from the increased use of beds by pensioner patients.  Mrs G. Stanley Hawker and other members of her family have presented a painting The Bark Painter by George Chaloupka, which will hang in the main hallway.  It is a memorial to their mother the late Mrs E.M. Fetherstonhaugh.
