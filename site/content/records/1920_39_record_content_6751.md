Editorial on Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

The memorial is now complete except for the finishing touches.  The figure was put in place on Thursday evening [19 January].  The unveiling is due in February and in all probability the Prime Minister Mr Hughes will perform the ceremony.  The PM has said he will do his utmost to accept the invitation in about six weeks.  An appeal has been made for all to send in promised funds and for further donations to cover extra expenses.
