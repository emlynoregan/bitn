Letter.  Don Lloyd recalls coming into Burra on 15 August 1945 in their school-bound phaeton and hearing the Redruth Church bell announcing the end of the war.  He remembers the excitement when he arrived at school.  There would be no more need for air raid drills in the slit trenches dug in front of the school in 1942 by parents.  The large room used to make camouflage netting could be returned to classroom use.  In the afternoon a large crowd gathered at the Town Hall for speeches and general celebrations.
