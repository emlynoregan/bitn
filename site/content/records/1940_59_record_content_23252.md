F/Sgt Harry Quinn has written to his sister May concerning POWs.  He is one of the crew of a Liberator flying supplies from Sydney to Darwin and returning with POWs.  While in Darwin he went to see the Oranje, which had just arrived with a new load of former POWs.  After the able bodies had left the vessel he went to see the stretcher cases, many of them missing limbs.  He described some horrible cases and says people are ‘mad…to think the Japs are getting away scot free’.  He also described a remarkable forced landing of a Liberator when two engines had failed.
