Inquest, Wednesday.  P. Lane JP as coroner and J. Snell as foreman of the Jury.

Richard Roscoe recalled seven weeks ago when Mr Jeffrey Pearce’s haystack was burnt.  He saw the smoke about 9.30 a.m. and followed the fence down and saw a little boy, Patsy O’Connor, on the east side of the stack about eight feet away.  The fire was on the east side and the whole face was ablaze.  Coming round the stack saw the girl Johanna O’Connor approaching from W. Young’s dam.  Patsy O’Connor’s brother, William he believed, was inside the enclosure.  He asked the children ‘Who done this?’  Then he said he must clear out or someone would blame him for the fire.

The children left.  Roscoe said he did not see matches or a pipe and had not either himself.

Johanna O’Connor, daughter of William O’Connor said that morning she and the boys went towards Pearce’s haystack.  She and Patsy were in Mr Young’s paddock and Willie was on the road.  Willie went to the side of the stack facing the road.  Patsy and Johanna went to the dam, but then Patsy left.  Johanna saw the fire and when she asked who did it Willie said nothing, but later said he did it.  She recounted the meeting with Mr Roscoe.  Willie had afterwards told her he had a pipe.  Willie will be 12 on 17 December.  He is a cripple.

Patrick O’Connor largely confirmed his sister’s evidence and added that after the dam he had joined Willie, but did not know how the fire started.  He had seen Willie with a pipe and matches, but not that day.

William O’Connor, father of the children said he did not know if Willie had caused the fire.  Willie was at present in Adelaide with his sister.
