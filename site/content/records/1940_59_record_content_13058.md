Welcome to Local Members of the Forces

The Institute was crowded last Friday evening for a social welcome and supper of tea & sandwiches and cake.  Between 400 & 500 were served.  The Mayor received the visitors and welcomed them.  Dr Steele then spoke and also Mrs S.C. Genders as President of the RSL.  Pte Bert Davey spoke for the soldiers and Sgt Dick Crang sent apologies â€“ he had gone to Wentworth to see his parents.  Cpl Mervyn Cox & Pte Charlie Jesser supported Bert Davey.  [The men present are not listed for censorship reasons.]
