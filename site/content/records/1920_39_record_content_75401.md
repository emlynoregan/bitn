On Monday 12 June a station hand found the woman walking and took her towards Faraway Hill and police found her in his charge.  She said she had grown sick of Cook and left him on 11 June.  She said Cook was headed towards Bendigo Station to steal Tom Penn’s new Morris 8/40.  On Tuesday 12 June the car was found bogged in a rabbit hole at Salt Bush Dam on Sturt Vale.

With Cook on foot in dense scrub the police sent for Jimmy James and they arrived with him at Sturt Vale at 6.30 a.m. 13 June.  With 1½-day-old tracks it was hard to follow Cook.  James tracked him six miles the first day and on Thursday at 2 p.m. Mrs Olive Earle of Quondong sent a phone message relayed by Mrs O’Brien of Sturt Vale that Cook was coming through Quondong Homestead gate.  Police rushed to Quondong – the only station in the area they had not had a policeman at.  When Cook arrived he talked with the sixteen shearers, had a wash, a good feed and a smoke and told the residents all about himself and his exploits.  When police arrived he disappeared into the scrub and James’s services were called for.  He was found in a washed-out gutter.  He was brought to Burra and formally charged on Friday afternoon and remanded to Adelaide to face further charges.
