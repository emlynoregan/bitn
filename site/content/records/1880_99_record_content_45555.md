Mr Fenton, at the Burra Hotel Yards on Wednesday last bet James Daly, a Queensland cowboy, that he could ride any unbroken colt in 10 minutes.  The latter guaranteed he could make a colt tractable in less than half an hour.  Daly managed to saddle the colt and mount it in 35 minutes, but it only moved to try to dislodge him.  Fenton then tried and caught his colt in less than three minutes and with just a halter on it was on its back in another three.  Fenton uses no whip or weapon of any kind and the horse raises no perspiration or excitement.  Within an hour the horse was perfectly quiet and any could ride it - one man mounted and played the accordion without the horse objecting.
