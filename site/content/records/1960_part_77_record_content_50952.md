There is no space for the Overseer or for the plan storage he needs.  The present space is too small to reasonably accommodate Council meetings.  There is a lack of secure storage (in a fire-proof walk-in size strong room) for records.  These include assessments, accounting records, wage records, the leave register, road rental records, cemetery leases and burial records, dog registration, minutes of meetings for Council, committees and Board of health, machinery working records and quarry returns, among others.

Planning consideration has been given to the useful spaces at the Burra Town Hall – with its lack of toilet facilities and meeting rooms.  The Burra Library is in a remote location and could be moved to the present Council Chambers in Commercial Street where it could become a greater asset.  The Council decided after considerable discussion to approach a firm of architects to present plans of possible solutions for their problems.  The proposal includes:

A new block of administrative offices and Council Chamber on the block between the Town Hall and the [former] Post Office property.  [The eastern elevation is shown as a sketch on page 1, with a ground plan on page 4.]  This proposed new building would include:

A Council Chamber

An enquiry area and general office

A store room and strong room

A ledger room (for an accounting machine)

Offices for senior officers

Toilets

All records would move to the new office

The Reception Room in the Town Hall (formerly the Mayor’s Parlour) would be renovated.

Burra Library would be relocated to the existing Council Chamber in Commercial Street.

The existing Town Hall rooms would be remodelled to include a meeting room and toilets for both sexes.

A smoke lounge would be added on the south side.

The existing steep front steps would be replaced by two levels of wide steps.

Council staff at present comprises:

District Clerk

Two assistants

Health Inspector & Weeds Officer

Works Overseer

Ganger

15 Members of Council

[Items of Council plant for road works etc. are then listed.]

Ratepayers can be assured of continued improvements to services, especially with growing tourist interest.

The architects were Messrs Brown, Davies, Reynolds & Doley Pty Ltd.  The completed work is estimated to cost $75,000, of which the new office and administration block would account for c. $60,000.  Changes to the Town Hall would amount to c. $15,000.

It is hoped ratepayers will approve of this forward move.  Detailed enlarged plans are on view at the Council.  Questions may be addressed to Councillors or the Council Office.  The Town Hall would still have a rather Spartan stage, no theatre lighting, lack of backdrop changes and difficult changing from picture theatre to concert hall etc.
