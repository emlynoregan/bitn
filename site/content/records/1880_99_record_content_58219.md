Editorial on The Wool Sales.

The prices for wool show a gratifying rise.  Thomas Warnes of Koomooloo realised 7½d lb against 6½d last year.  13,783 bales were offered and 12,856 were sold at an av. of 1d to 1¼d per lb.

Unwise management of the colony has not seen our sheep numbers rise while those in other colonies have done so.

2nd Leader on the State Advances Bill.  The writer agrees with Sir John Downer that it is a mistake and will not achieve what is claimed for it.  The Savings Bank is offering £200,000 at 4½%, on better terms than the proposed bill and yet people are not taking it up.  The management of the proposed money to be made available is also questioned.

E.W. Crewes lost a mare valued at over £20 by snake bite at Baldina last week and a very young foal of four weeks is left orphaned.  An attempt is being made to rear it by hand.

Hon. W. Haslam MLC delivered an interesting lecture on the Northern Territory at the Burra Institute on Friday night.  It was illustrated with the aid of a powerful lantern.

D.S. Packard was taken seriously ill last Wednesday evening and has remained unconscious ever since.

Kooringa Wesleyan Church Anniversary was held last Sunday and Monday. Rev. A.H. Carn officiated.  The congregations were good.  The usual tea meeting was held on Monday.

Mr J.A. Kennedy was presented with an address on Friday 20 September before his removal to Glenelg, in recognition of his work at Burra.  On the morning he left the School Fife & Drum Band farewelled him at the station.

Burra Homing Club.  The Champion Club Race was flown on 25 September from Mannahill, but was spoiled by rain so that only 6 of the 24 birds homed within the time limit.  The winning birds of J.A. Pearce covered the 105 miles 1,445 yds in 254¾ minutes.
