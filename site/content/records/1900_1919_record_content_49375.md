Burra Town Council.

J.B. Griffiths resigns as lamplighter for North Ward.

Cr Dane said the sag in the new swing bridge was increasing and he understood this could be rectified and several bolts were wanting in the decking.  The bridge will be attended to.

Mr Pryor was appointed lamplighter for Aberdeen.

Woollacott & Wall’s tender for £4-4-6 was accepted for the walls of the approached to the new swing bridge (labour only).

The co-operation of all towns on the line will be sought for the reinstatement of the Saturday night train.  Cr McBride thought this train was useless – he had often been the only passenger to get off at Burra.
