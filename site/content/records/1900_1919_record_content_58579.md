Disastrous Fire.

The biggest fire in the history of the district broke out on Friday 24 January.  It covered over 30,000 acres in an area 12 miles by about 4 miles.  The day was a ‘brick-fielder’ on which there was a strong hot wind raising dust.  Clouds of smoke were seen in Burra about 10 a.m., followed by calls for help.  Soon choking smoke enveloped the town and the fire was coming down the Copperhouse Hills and had entered Aberdeen.  The sale at Elder, Smith’s Stockyards was interrupted when the fire entered the yards.  In places the flames advanced at 30 m.p.h.  The fire leapt the 100 yard gap of the railway quarry.  It ran along Firewood Creek and was finally stopped when the wind dropped towards evening.  Murkaby Dam, 40 miles away, was covered with cinders.  Amazingly there was little loss of stock.

At night from hilltops it looked wonderful, if tragic, with haystacks, fences and stumps alight like an illuminated city.

The fire started at Mr J. O’Dea’s property at Booborowie and he attributes it to phosphorus from poisoned rabbits that dogs took under a haystack to eat.  The phosphorus being left in the entrails that were left.  Little damage occurred there, but the fire spread quickly into J. Barker’s ‘Corolinga’ and thence to A.D. McDonald’s and to E.N. Finch’s (late John Stagg’s).  From McDonald’s it also crossed the road to R.J. Fairchild’s and into ‘Wildotta’ paddock, where it was split by the lagoon.

The south arm took ‘Blink Bonnie’ (rented by Henry Collins & Co.), W.H. Field’s, Mrs C. Sandland’s ‘Koonoowarra’ and thence across the road to Messrs Thomas and Gare’s & Josiah Thomas’s, cleaning up D. Bailey’s small holding.  Part of this fire then ran through Copperhouse; down through Mr Austin’s paddock to Aberdeen, engulfing the showgrounds, greatly damaged Short’s and Robertson’s and went through Drew & Crewe’s woodyard, Elder, Smith’s saleyards and at Ford’s paddock went on to Firewood Creek, where it finally stopped.

The north arm travelled to M. Reilly’s, thence to J.G. Oates’s across the stock route and into E.N. Finch’s ‘Pencarrow’, across the railway line and up the hill.  It continued through E.N. Finch’s ‘Wandillah’.  From ‘Coralinga’ it spread to ‘Wildotta’ across the stock road and into the forest and thence to ‘Mackerode’, where it stopped.

‘Coralinga’

There were some 3,000 sheep there.  With superhuman effort the homestead was saved with the very doormat being burnt.  3,000 acres of grass were lost with just 300 acres in one corner being saved.  The sheep were saved in a neighbour’s paddock – Mr Symons receiving notice to remove them before dawn.

A.D. McDonald lost 500 acres of grass and almost all his fences, but sheds and the homestead were saved.

E.N. Finch lost 2,000 acres of grass and 150 tons of hay along with the chaff house, chaff-cutting plant, sheds, etc.  The implements on ‘Wandillah’ were saved, but the losses on the two properties are not less than £4,000.

Messrs Thomas & Gare lost all grass: c. 900 acres, and 150 tons of lucerne hay.  The residence and sheds were miraculously saved.

R. Reed jnr lost c. 200 acres of grass – the rest of his country had been previously burnt.

W. McBride lost about 400 acres of feed and c. 25 sheep.

R.J. Fairchild lost 30 tons of hay and 500 acres of grass.

J.G. Oates.  All that survives on his property is the scorched and blackened house that was somehow saved.  This year he was on halves with Mr Tohl who lost c. 400 acres of feed and fencing.  There was just time to save the stock.  Miss Marjorie Field galloped to Mrs Oates’s assistance and released the horses.  Mrs Oates and her niece, Miss Crittendon, had a lucky escape.  The large forest reserve nearby was swept from end to end.  Damage at Oates’s is estimated at £4,000 – little of it covered by insurance.

W. Field.  They rushed from here to assist when the fire was on A.D. McDonald’s property, but the blaze came swiftly on.  The Misses Therese and Marjorie Field quickly saddled horses and mustered all their stock on the fallow and gave Mr Duell on ‘Koonoowarra’ the alarm.  By then the fire was on their property.  W. Field galloped back, but Stan Field and Mr E. Carter had to run to ‘Monavea’.  They tried to save a load of hay, but it burnt and even the woodheap was burnt.  Mr Field’s haystack was a record size and was destroyed.  The Misses Field several times had to beat out flames that caught their hair or clothes and W. Field fell over a burning wagon, cutting his face and fracturing his jaw.  His losses are less than others as his wheat was all at Burra Station and his implements and large sheds were saved.  The fire scorched the house, burning one verandah post.

Mat Reilly.  All that was saved was the house, a binder, a buggy and a wheelbarrow.  His pigs were roasted in their styes and nearly all Mrs Reilly’s poultry were burnt too, along with 400 bags of wheat.  He is uninsured.

A.G. Gebhardt was in Adelaide and the women had hard work to save the house.  With the aid of help from Mt Bryan and elsewhere the house and sheds were saved, though c. 2,500 acres of feed and all fencing was lost.  The stock was saved.

‘Koonoowarra’  Here the woolshed with two years’ seed wheat, a winnower, wool tables, etc. was destroyed along with six sheep.  Also lost were a calf, sheep yards, three large loads of firewood and two large haystacks valued at £300 each.  The stock had been mustered and run to fallow land, which left no time to save equipment, except for some harness from the harness room.  The cottage of the overseer, Mr Duell, was saved.  Here even the timber lining of the well was burnt to water level.  Fortunately a recent fire had burnt around the homestead allowing it and the large implement shed to be saved.  Poultry was largely killed by smoke without even being singed.  Damage is at least £3,000.

In fact on all holdings on the main route of the fire the fences are largely gone.

Copperhouse.

Feed was abundant here, especially in the gullies.  The north arm of the fire swept the paddocks in front of Copperhouse, separated from it by only the road.  With almost all the men away fighting the fire, another arm came over the Flagstaff Hills and in 10 minutes from the hill had reached Copperhouse – about three miles.  Residents were almost smothered in the smoke.  They managed to save all the livestock except the poultry.  The shifting wind meant that the town had three visitations.  Mr J. Nickles lost a binder and all his grass, fencing, poultry and a chaff-cutter, but miraculously a haystack survived.

W. Kellaway lost all grass and hay.

R. Nourse lost 20-30 tons of hay, all feed and fences.

Bob Fuss lost all his sheds, outhouses and a beautiful garden, together with a spring dray, six tons of hay, tools, tool house, poultry, poultry yards and a 2,000 gallon galvanised-iron tank.  Mrs Fuss and her neighbours removed the furniture onto the road and soon the back of the house was alight, but was extinguished with hard work.  He estimates his loss at £70.

Mr Lomman lost a haystack, feed, fencing and a fruit garden.
