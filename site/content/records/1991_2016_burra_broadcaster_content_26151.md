Tim Stockman of Stockman Electronics had a busy few days at the Paskeville Field Days fielding enquiries about remote controlled applications for rural properties.  People were keen to explore remote control of pumps, watering points, fans and temperature controls in piggeries and chicken farms and other applications.  He has recently developed a simple control unit, which can be integrated with existing UHF and CB systems and also a GME Electrophone telemetry system as a low cost radio-telemetry system aimed at the rural sector, allowing the user to send commands to outstations 24 hours a day and to retrieve a wide range of information.  Tim Stockman will also have a range of items at the Burra Show.
