Burra Primary School re-opened 12 February with an enrolment of 283 and an attendance of 255.  In 1956 the enrolment was 253 and in 1958 it is expected to be 280 odd.  Forty-eight enrolled in Grade I.  This year there were four young New Australians in the intake.  The lunch room was finished and painted and was expected to prove very beneficial for students in winter, but on the first day it was used to house Grade VI students.  This was a very reluctant decision by the headmaster, but as it was unfurnished, it was the better option that crowding 70 students into one room to have their progress impeded and to impose unreasonable working conditions on the staff.

‘It was, he thought, reasonable to use the lunch room – until the mroning school resumed [sic], a course to which he was strongly opposed.’

[Even allowing that the word was ‘morning’, what does this mean?]

The question was discussed with the Chairman of the School Committee and the President of the Welfare Club.

In the holidays the Superintendent had told the Committee and the Head Teacher that a portable classroom would be erected as soon as labour was available and it was hoped that erection would begin at the latest by mid-April.

The Head Teacher was prepared to vacate the lunch room as soon as it was furnished, but even the respite of a week from teaching two [classes] in the same room is appreciated.  The hiring of an outside hall was considered, but that poses difficulties and inconveniences.  The Head Teacher appreciates the reasonableness and friendliness of the discussions with the Committee and the Welfare Club representatives.

Since then the Minister of Education has promised the Member for the District, Mr P.H .Quirke, the classroom will be finished by the end of April.

Some improvements were made in the vacation, with a new ablutions trough installed and lights put in four of the classrooms.
