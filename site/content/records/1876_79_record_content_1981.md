Burra Creek burst its banks near the Unicorn Brewery and formed a second channel parallel to the main one. By 5.30pm it was level with the roadway in Bridge Street and then it broke through to form a channel between the bridge and the Bible Christian Church. Lower Thames Street was flooded as were most houses between Statton & Henderson's [Market Square] and the Primitive Methodist Chapel. Fences and outbuildings between Thames Street and the creek were swept away. Houses on the western side of Paxton Square were flooded to 6-9".

At 7.OOpm the Bridge Street Bridge was swept away which allowed the water level to fall quickly by some 2-3'. The bridge structure remained fixed to the eastern buttress and both ended up about a mile downstream.

At Aberdeen there was a sheet of water from Opie's Hotel to the new railway embankment. And water 2-3' deep with a strong current was flowing up the road between the White Hart and the Aberdeen Hotels. Near Tiver's Corner it was 3' deep and the Aberdeen Hotel was flooded to several inches. This stream re-entered the main creek between Orchards and the Burra Mill.

Ridgway's store was flooded as were most houses between Tiver's Corner and the White Hart Ford. The Bank of Australasia was surrounded, but not flooded.

Five to six feet of water flowed through the White Hart with damage estimated at £400-£500. The Bushman's Home was also flooded with damage put at about £200. The Mine Paddock was under water.

At Redruth the bridge was swaying with the pressure of water and police stopped traffic, fearing it would give way, but it survived.

There was considerable damage to the road to Hallett and the formation for the new railway was extensively damaged, especially near Hallett's Woolsheds. A mile south of Willogoleech [ee] the Waukaringa Mail Coach was overturned by water and two horses drowned, though all passengers escaped injury.

This was the worst flood for 30 years. [In view of the floods of 1851 this may not be strictly true.]
