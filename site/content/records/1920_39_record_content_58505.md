Messrs T. Tyack and K. Fennessy, at Booborowie, have constructed a glider and have made a trial run, launching it with the aid of a tow rope attached to a car.  The first flight was short and ended in a bump and some minor damage, but the two mechanics are hopeful of success after some adjustments.
