Booborowie & Murray Water.  A meeting at Booborowie Hotel on 29 January discussed the possibility of a branch line to bring Murray water to Booborowie.  Mr A.D. McDonald MP outlined the existing water schemes and their general inability to pay interest bills.  He said Government policy was that any new scheme should pay 4% interest on the capital cost.  Since Parliament had not yet sanctioned any branch line services from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline he thought it advisable to wait until some other schemes could give a guide as to the likely costs involved.
