SA Gold.  It is rumoured that gold has been discovered on the Light about four miles from Kapunda.  We suspect it to be an exaggeration of an earlier rumour.  The rumour at Burra, that 40 miners had, as a consequence, left Kapunda, is not true.

A great number of parties did leave Adelaide yesterday to prosecute searches on the basis of reports by Mr Stephen.  It is reasonable to hope that in a few days the best hopes may be realised.
