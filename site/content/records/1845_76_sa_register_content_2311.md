W.W.G. Nicholls’ Sermon

‘At the outset he was greeted by cheers too vehement to be sincere, and from time to time sundry missiles were hurled from the heretic fingers of certain dastardly dissentients, whilst a gentleman in the boxes, more merry than wise, kept the audience in a convulsion of laughter a great part of the evening by a running fire of burlesque commentary on the Preacher and his subject.’

Nicholls obtained a hearing while denouncing a sort of spurious patriotism that would intoxicate the dregs of society and send them around the town destroying the property of peaceable people.

He had had his windows broken for no better reason than the love of mischief or the recklessness of intoxication.  ‘He made a formal apology for certain unfounded attacks which he formerly made against the Roman Catholic Religion.’

He glided into the subjects of the English poor laws and the suppression of the monasteries, but when he ventured into the Irish question the response from the audience became uproar.  Eventually he responded to calls to sing a socialist song.  [The text of the song is printed.]

Mr Nicholls was most cordially chorused by the whole congregation, which shortly after broke up.
