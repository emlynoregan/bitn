Offences. Robert Perkins got 7 days for stealing two coats and a pocket-handkerchief from the White Hart on Sunday.

The police charged that as P-C James was leaving Opie's bar a man named Parker challenged him to a game of billiards and added if James lost that he (Parker) would punch his head. P-T Le Levieure corroborated, but three other witnesses called by the defence said no such language was used and the case was dismissed.
