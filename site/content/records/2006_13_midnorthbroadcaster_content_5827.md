Burra’s James Martin (25) is currently serving on HMAS Stuart in the Persian Gulf, guarding two Iraqi oil terminals and running down contraband runners in Gulf waters.  He is an able seaman, specialising as a cook.  He has visited the Solomon Islands and much of South East Asia while in the navy, but this is his first experience of active duty.

A sister, brother and two-brothers-in-law are also in the military and his father served as a Royal Navy pilot.  The force is part of Operation Catalyst – Australia’s defence force contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq.  [Photo.]
