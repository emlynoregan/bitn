Burra RSL held its AGM on 12 March when only eight members attended.  Elected: President, Mr R. Steele; Vice-Presidents, Mr Duance and Mr R. Opperman; Secretary, W. Fridd and Treasurer, Mr Ben Kotz.

In the year maintenance work was required on the premises.  Renewal of guttering and white and treatment cost considerable money.  Attendance at the annual dinner was down, but the event proved most enjoyable and thanks are due to the Ladies’ Auxiliary for again preparing a sumptuous meal.
