Jack Parker, Overseer of the District Council of Burra, mentioned to us that gold had been found at Mongolata 25 years ago at least.  A wandering shearer T. Hawkins brought in some in a strychnine bottle.  It later sold for about £46.  Lack of water and feed for his horse drove him off the find between Newikie Creek and Byles’ Mine.
