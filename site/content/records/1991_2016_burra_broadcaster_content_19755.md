Pub Church is an initiative to suit all people of a mixture of ages in a setting where they are comfortable.  Pastor Michael Dutschke has been ministering to the Victor Harbor Lutheran Church and has been a part of the Pub Church that has been held in Victor Harbor and the surrounding area for the last five years.  He will bring a team of musicians and entertainers from Victor Harbor to introduce this different style of church to Burra at the Burra Hotel on Sunday evening 29 August.
