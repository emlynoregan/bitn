Burra Ambulance Committee has decided too purchase a Volkswagen Ambulance and to launch an appeal for £2,000 on Tuesday and also to call a meeting to form First Aid Classes.  A representative of an Adelaide firm brought a Volkswagen Ambulance to Burra for inspection.  Both Doctors L.G. Miller and R.B. Pitcher said that such a vehicle would ably serve the district.  The ambulance would not cost as much as £2,000, but funds would also be needed for a building to house it.
