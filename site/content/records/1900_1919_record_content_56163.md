There was a lengthy discussion initiated by Cr McBride over the inspector’s power to have diseased animals killed and to decide if animals were diseased.  McBride thought the inspector ill qualified to judge.  The mayor said if animals proved to be free from disease the value could be recovered from the Board.  McBride thought the meat could not be condemned until inspected by the chief inspector.
