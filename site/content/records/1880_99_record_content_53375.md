Hilda Mann died as a result of a gunshot wound on Sunday.

Mr & Mrs Mann and family went to chapel except for Hilda aged 19 and Emma who stayed home to prepare dinner etc.  Hilda completed her work and went to the room of a lad named Karl Petergelt who was sewing his trousers.

Miss Mann picked up a gun which was loaded and the accident followed.  The lad immediately informed the parents and they returned to the scene and informed the police.
