Burra & the North East Agricultural, Horticultural & Pastoral Society.  (The Show Society)

The AGM was held in Burra Institute last Friday.  More than 60 people attended and P.L. Killicoat presided.  Secretary Mr Frank Treloar tabled the balance sheet that showed the society to be in good funds.  He said that the past two years had given the district many new residents and he had therefore sent out circulars to newcomers as well as old supporters.  After discussion the date of the next show was chosen as Wednesday 5 October.  Officers elected: Patron, Hon. J.J. Duncan MLC; President (for two years, when a new president must be appointed) P.L. Killicoat; and a number of Vice-Presidents.

[Stewards are then listed.]

It was decided to hold a sheepdog trial in connection with the show and Mr W.G. Hawkes & Mr T.H. Pearse moved it be on 2 August.  Carried.

[It is surprising then that an advertisement immediately after this article gives the Show date as 5 October and the dog Trial date as Wednesday 10 August.  Subsequently this was proved correct.]
