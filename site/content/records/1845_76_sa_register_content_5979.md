Reputed Dismissal

It is stated that a young man named Hosken has lately been discharged by Captain Edward Phillips, from work at the Mine, allegedly because his father signed some objections to voters at Kooringa, of whom Captain Phillips happened to be one.  We cannot believe that the Directors would sanction such a proceeding after the liberal way in which they expressed themselves to miners recently on the subject of voting.  We hope soon to hear that they have rectified this disgraceful occurrence or that the whole affair has been misunderstood or grossly misstated.
