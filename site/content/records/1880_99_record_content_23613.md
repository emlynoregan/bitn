A report from there on 15 October (18-20 miles or c. 30 km NW of Manna Hill) says that some 150 men are now on the fields and the prospects of gold there are said to be promising.  [Note that Manning in Place Names of SA appears to have confused the station property and the mine, placing the latter near Yunta.]
