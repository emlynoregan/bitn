Tess Hopkins will retire from the position of Teacher/Librarian at the Burra Community Library in about two weeks.  She began working in Burra in 1975 part-time, until in 1897 she took over from Colin Fidock in the full-time position when he transferred to Adelaide.  Tess and her husband Terry will be leaving Hallett almost immediately to make a home in Athelstone.  [Photo]
