Local History Room Opened

The first BCS Principal Mr Chris McCabe officially opened the room on 26 September.  He was standing in for Mr Ian Auhl who was unable to attend, but who had prepared a thought provoking speech that Chris delivered – spiced with his own thoughts.  He described Ian as a catalyst in the quest to record and preserve Burra’s History.  Guests were welcomed by Sue Warnes, Chairperson of the Library Board who invited Colin Fidock to address the group.  He took as his theme ‘People Make Local History’.  He paid tribute to Ian and Evan Auhl and a number of others who had supported the preparation of the collection for use in this purpose-built room.

Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from the Auhls for the provision of research and then cut a ribbon across the stairs leading to the room.  Roger Henderson also spoke.  As immediate past principal of BCS he had been strongly committed to the development of the rooms during his time in Burra.  He presented the Board with two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall upstairs; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that the Education Department had advised that it would fund the position of Educational Officer for Burra from 1988.  Afternoon tea followed during which Colin Fidock cut a cake to mark the 9th birthday of the Community Library.
