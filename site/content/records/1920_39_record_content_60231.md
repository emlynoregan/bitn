The Sturt Vale trip during the shearing was held again and Mr Codrington, instructor from the School of Mines was on hand with advice and answers to questions.  Another such trip is planned for this year.

Elected were: Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, S.H .Robinson & A.B. Riggs and Secretary, M.S. Edwards.

This year’s Sturt Vale trip would be held on 20 April.

Mr E. Finch referred to the Centenary Hall project on the showgrounds.  He thought it should be placed east-west in order that the light might be thrown in from the south, as it was in the city wool stores.

Mr Bednall said the response to the call for donations had not been great and until money was in hand it was not much use considering plans.  He thought a date should be set for laying the foundation stone and one also for the closing of subscriptions.

A.B. Riggs thought that at least half the money should be in hand before the project was started.

The President said the essential question was whether to build and tolerate an overdraft of £383 or not build.

Those present were unanimously in favour of building.

The position is that some time ago £233 was collected for a sheep shed.  Then it was suggested converting one of the existing buildings for that purpose and using the money collected for the proposed hall.  The President had promised to match funds raised £ for £ to a total of £250.  If this were done and the hall built, the overdraft would be £383.
