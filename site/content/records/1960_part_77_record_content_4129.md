Redbanks Sports Day

[This report offered the first indication that the event was organised by the Small Bore Rifle Club.]

Have you ever been to Redbanks Picnic Grounds c. 10 miles east of Burra?

The Baldina Creek runs past the grounds on the south side.

The grounds are ideal for sports and barbecues.

Kookaburras are numerous and the clear running water adds to the beauty of the scene.

In the first season of the Small bore Club the purchase of the Old Drill Hall by the PMG Department forced them to remove all club gear and erect a suitable clubhouse on the range itself.  The club had and still has no funds and this activity was only possible through several persons being prepared to act as guarantors at the bank.

The [range] area has been beautified by working bees.

It is with a view to raising some money that this sports day etc. has been organised for 5 November.

Among the attractions it has been arranged for several go-karts to be present and for demonstrations of powered model aircraft.  There will be a publicanâ€™s booth and an ice cream and cool drinks stall.  Fireworks will be on sale for those wishing to join in the evening.
