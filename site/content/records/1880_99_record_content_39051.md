J. Watt: a kindly middle-aged man of healthy complexion, moustached and whiskered.  Sleeps with a naked sword grasped in his right hand and a yard measure in his left.  Uses a forage cap for a nightcap.  His bed curtains are the side curtains of a stage.  Dreams of both military and theatrical glory.  A popular businessman and ‘orficer’.  Never gloried in fiery oratory nor overly keen on sniffing out offending drains or waste of money on children’s treats, but does his duty with painstaking commonsense.
