The Royal Mining Co. at Emu Flats

[After a long and flowery introduction it eventually becomes apparent that the company’s directors visited their Emu Flats mineral lands and the result of their visit was a collapse in the share price from £4 or £5 to 30/- in just two days.]

It seems that the panic was started by one of the Directors, who, having stated there were upwards of 100 tons or ore on the surface, found on his visit that this was not so, and panicked.  No practical man present made the assertion and the Director is merely reacting to not finding the castles in the air that his own unassisted imagination created.  We are assured that many promising lodes lie on the property.  The editor, however, warns that mining shares should always be bought with surplus income and not with the expectation of being able to sell the next day at a huge profit.  Such a buyer is ‘a mere angler for gain, and ought not to be surprised if, instead of a gudgeon, he occasionally hooks a disappointment.’

[The image seems a bit odd, given that a gudgeon is a small freshwater fish.]
