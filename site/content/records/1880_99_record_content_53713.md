Football

Burra Juniors played Aberdeen Juniors.  The aggravation mounted through the game, which ended abruptly with threats of violence and in one or two cases they were carried out after most had departed.

[No scores or other details are given here, but elsewhere on the page there is the brief note: last Saturday Burra Juniors defeated Aberdeen Juniors.  This however, does not match up with the report in the following issue when both the day and result seem to be at odds with the above!]
