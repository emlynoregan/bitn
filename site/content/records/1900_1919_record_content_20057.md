Mt Bryan, at one time quiet, has advanced into activity.  The beautiful tracts of country which could carry ten times more people lay idle until the present Government seen it wise [sic] to buy up land to keep farmers in the state.  Until the past two years Mt Bryan had been a place of retrogression and but for a little lamb and wheat the local railway station was quiet.  The church had lost nearly all of its one-time good congregations.  The once good farms had given way to sheep.  The change that has come extends from three or four miles south of Hallett almost down to Burra.  Settlers have come and it is hoped will stay.  In conversation one cannot but admire their refined manner and genial disposition and when one hears of their hardships in the northern parts of the state one feels they are men of grit.  Nice homes are being built and more goods delivered to the Mt Bryan railway station in the last twelve months than in the previous twenty years.  Settlers are hard at it late and early improving their farms.  Business flourishes and two of Burraâ€™s largest storekeepers run there three days a week and also one from Hallett.  A store if built in Mt Bryan would do well.  Alterations have been asked for in the station yard for wheat and other heavy traffic.  Hotel business is brisk and church congregations are large.  A tennis club has been formed with a nice court in the station yard.  A Literary Society still exists and recently a meeting formed an Agricultural Bureau.  A cricket club will soon be formed.  Mt Bryan is one of the happiest and busiest of districts outside the metropolis.
