Patrick Le Vagueresse writes re Burra Baseball Club Inc.

Unfortunately due to ill health I am forced to sell or close down the Burra Baseball Club Inc.  After about five years and investing more than $12,000 of my own money, I have seen very little interest in either baseball or softball in Burra.  If someone wishes to buy the club and continue, I would be happy to pass on contacts and to help with some school clinics.  If this does not happen I will sell most of the assets separately at a later date.

[He then thanks a long list of businesses and individuals who have assisted over the life of the club.]
