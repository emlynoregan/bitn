Kooringa News, 9 December

The crops around about still look healthy.  Red rust has appeared in one paddock.

Samuel Shirwell was fined 10/- plus Â£1 costs for allowing his team to travel on the Adelaide Road without anyone being sufficiently near to control the horses.  He had stopped behind his team to get some water from a fellow teamster and it nearly caused an accident to the mail.

Daniel Davies, alias Crancky Dan, was gaoled for 14 days for using abusive and indecent language to a young girl in the public streets.
