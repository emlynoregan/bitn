Redruth Court, before J.D. Cave & W.R. Ridgway, 9 August.

Thomas Philip Halls was charged with assaulting and unlawfully beating William Dunn of Aberdeen on 28 July.

D.S. Packard for the informant and H.V. Rounsevell for the defendant.

Rounsevell objected that the case was bad in law, but it proceeded.  Rounsevell then asked for a cross information for common assault against the informant to be heard together and eventually the information was received.

Dunn is the landlord of the Bon Accord Hotel.  He said on the 27 July Halls was using bad language in the bar and when asked to leave began to assault him until he was rescued by Mr Pettman.

Dr J.I. Sangster testified to having attended Dunn for rheumatism and heart disease for some time.  Irregular action of the heart was not evident before the fight.

Pettman essentially corroborated Dunn’s story.

Rounsevell said they had failed to establish any link between the effects alleged and the fight and the doctor was only called a week later.

Pettman was unable to swear that Dunn had not tripped Hall who was then trying to release himself.

The case was dismissed without costs and the associated cases were then withdrawn.
