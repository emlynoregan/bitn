Burra Town Council

Cr Dunstan moved the Council supply the 200 yds of 2½” metal demanded by the Road Board as it would cost £30 and be cheaper than fighting the issue in court.  Crs Rabbich and Sampson tried to negate the move, but the motion was carried by one vote.

Cabstands have been established in Young St, opposite Mr Tiver’s store, facing south, and in Market Square, opposite the printing office, facing north, one chain from the kerbing.

Cr Lockyer’s resignation was accepted and the usual fine waived.
