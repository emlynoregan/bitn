Hyland’s Circus visited Burra and performed to fair houses on Friday & Saturday nights.  The horsemanship displayed was the highlight and the wire-walking by Miss Hyland was exceptional.  The performance was at the rear of the Commercial Hotel.  At the conclusion of one performance a youth in charge of the horses somehow allowed two of them to go on the narrow footbridge which spans the creek leading to the circus ground, but two horses got onto the bridge from the other direction.  On of the horses did a miraculous turn, but Sovereign the most valuable animal in the circus fell about six feet into the creek.  Fortunately it was not hurt.
