Cottages for the Elderly

Four new cottages for the elderly may be built in the town.  The tow-bedroom cottages have been planned for Kingston Street near Paxton Square.  The plans are currently with the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning, which will decide whether or not they blend in with Burra’s heritage environment.  They will then go to the Council’s works committee.  If approved the project will be a joint venture between the SA Housing Trust, who will build the homes, and the Council, who will provide the land.
