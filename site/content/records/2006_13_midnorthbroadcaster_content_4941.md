The Smoking Ban in hotels has resulted in decreased revenue from gaming being reported across the Mid North.  In Burra the Commercial Hotelâ€™s licensee Shane Darwin says the change is not great and the beer garden has no doubt compensated and so has the warm weather since the ban in November.  The Burra Hotel has no gaming and so has seen no change.
