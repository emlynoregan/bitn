A report on progress towards the establishment of an old scholars association was presented to the School Council at its AGM on Monday night.

The school would be closed early in 1987 so a review of the school’s philosophy and practices can be held.  Members of the school’s curriculum committee would meet at the school in 1987 to discuss plans for the future.

Five new members were elected to the School Council.

One student received first prize in the Sir Mark Oliphant Science Competition.
