Mr & Mrs L.L. Wicklein were given a farewell in the Council Chamber last Wednesday evening.  The Mayor presided.  Mr Wicklein had been a Councillor for five or six years and had done careful work in that capacity.  Mrs Wicklein was the daughter of an old and respected Burra family.  Mr Wicklein’s empty shop in the town would be another sign of the prevailing depression.  He presented Mr Wicklein with a travelling rug.  Others who spoke in support of the Mayor were A.B. Riggs, C.J. Pearce, S. Kellaway, Mr Rosman, Mr G.E. Dane (who said Mr Wicklein’s father had kept the Earl of Zetland Hotel in Adelaide), Town Clerk E.J. Davey, L. Gordon, A.L. Walker (neighbour in business for 30 years) & Max Pearce.

Mr Wicklein said he had tried to live a good life, give everyone a good deal and had worked hard on Council for the West Ward.  The bridge in Chapel St was long known as Wicklein’s Folly, but it had been a godsend to many and he had got another erected in Church St, which had been useful and he had raised the question of altering the school windows, which was then pushed by Mayor John McLaren until changes were achieved.  He was leaving for the sake of his health and to be nearer his children.

Mrs Wicklein was given a farewell at the Methodist Lecture Hall on Wednesday afternoon.  President of Guild Mrs G.C. Hutchinson took the chair.  Mrs Wicklein’s parents [James & Mary Chynoweth] had a long and honourable connection with the Primitive Methodist Church.
