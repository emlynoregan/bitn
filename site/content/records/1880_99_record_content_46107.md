Frederick Selby of West Broken Hill writes about the strikers.  In doing so he states that the writers of the letters to the Advertiser that caused such a backlash in Burra were Morton and Hardy.  He dismisses the effusions of Mr Morton as the ravings of an imbecile.  Hardy he answers more fully, regarding him as foolish and quick to rush in and come to conclusions without really understanding that of which he speaks.  Mr Hardy cannot have seen the very real poverty in Broke Hill if he believed the miners to be overpaid.  He cannot be aware of the high cost of living there or of the impact of lead poisoning etc.
