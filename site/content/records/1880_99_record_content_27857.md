Editorial on rabbits and the problems of destroying and containing them.  On leases falling due this year there is no covenant for the destruction of vermin and they are a great breading ground for vermin.  Both rabbit and dog destruction should be a requirement of lease renewal.  This should see a reduction in the plague without the dangers of some recent suggestions such as the release of chicken cholera among them, resulting in the death of all native birds and poultry.
