Peace Day, Mt Bryan, Saturday 19 July.

Celebrations began with a public luncheon in the Hall.  A meeting at 1 p.m. was chaired by I.J. Warnes where patriotic songs were sung, heard a fine address from the chairman and Commonwealth Peace Medals were presented to the children.  The Mt Bryan War Loan Honour Flag was flown for the first time publicly.  [This is described as white with a red border with the Union Flag in the top left quarter and on the right side six deep blue bars for subscribing six times the quota for the seventh war loan.]

There was then a procession to the oval and sports for the children and a football match in which Hallett 6.8 (44) defeated Mt Bryan 3.5 (23).  A bonfire was lit at 7 p.m. and Emperor William was burnt in effigy and fireworks were let off.  In the evening there was a welcome home social for Pte Ben Mattschross [sic. – Mattschoss].  Supper and dancing followed.
