Temperance in the North

In the recent weeks there has been more than usual activity in the movement.  On Tuesday 6 September a large tea preceded a major temperance meeting in the Congregational Chapel at Kapunda.  Speakers:

John Williams, Lecturer to the SA Temperance League

G.W. Cole, for many years the Hon. Secretary of the SA Total Abstinence Society

Thomas Barlow an old campaigner in the cause.

On Wednesday Mr Cole addressed a gathering at the Primitive Methodist Chapel at the Head of the Light.

On Thursday 8 September Mr J. Williams gave a lecture at the Bible Christian Chapel at Butcher’s Gap and the next night he resumed his theme at the Primitive Chapel at the Light.

On 9 September at Zion Primitive Methodist Chapel at Redruth Mr G.W. Cole gave an address after which several people signed the pledge and assisted by Mr Aaron Cole, he then opened a new Tent of the Independent Order of Rechabites.  The principal officers elected were A. Cole (CR), S. Bath (DR) and William Dale (Secretary); the Tent to be known as ‘The Burra Tent’.

On the following Monday Mr J. Williams delivered an able lecture at the Wesleyan Schoolroom in Kooringa.

On Tuesday Mr Williams addressed a meeting in the Wesleyan Schoolroom at Redruth and on Thursday he addressed a meeting at the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Kooringa.  Throughout much of his attention has been directed against the free distillation movement.  On Friday Mr Williams addressed a meeting at the Bible Christian Chapel in Kooringa, which was also addressed by Mr G.W. Cole.  Messrs W. Pearce, J. Bone, Williams & Richard Dale were appointed agent to enrol members and collect subscriptions for the AE Temperance Association.  In the fortnight at least 140 new persons have signed the pledge and many old members have been reinvigorated and will become more regular subscribing members.
