Redruth Court, 16 January.

William Hedley McWaters, Inspector of Vermin, Burra DC v. R.M. & E.W. Hawker for failing to destroy rabbits at Baldina.  He gave evidence about rabbits on the property.

Ernest Hugo Hammerling whose land is across the road also gave evidence of high rabbit numbers (on sections 63 & 64).

Carl H. Mann who had a crop on section 95 also complained of damage from Hawker’s land – though rather oddly he also said – ‘Don’t think I would have got more had there been no rabbits.’

Peter B. Armstrong, manager of Baldina Downs, said trapping had been undertaken and rabbits were thick on the stock road.  The problem was that trappers were virtually impossible to get and poison carts were unobtainable in SA.

Henry Hemp was employed to keep rabbits down and supplied the number of skins etc.  Fine of £2-10-0 plus costs with a stay of proceedings to allow an appeal.
