‘Short & Sharp’

Boy Scouts still hard at work.

Balloon ascent on the park on Saturday was a sensational affair.

The Bishop of Pt Augusta visited Burra on Sunday.

Kooringa Methodist Church Hospital Service next Sunday.

Fire threatened L.W. Gebhardt’s wheat crop on Saturday.

The usual Hanson Methodist Church Anniversary will be held on Sunday with the tea meeting on Christmas Day when arrangements have been made for the trains to stop.

The first three of these items deserve further attention.  The balloon event is particularly interesting, but receives virtually no attention.

The Municipal Elections are another example.  S.M. Lane is said to be elected unopposed to East Ward.  Then at the Ratepayers’ meeting he speaks, but does not appear in the results.  The election for East Ward appears to elect Mr Ockenden to that position, but at the end of the year he is retiring through the effluxion of time, making it clear that the election was for the extraordinary vacancy created by Mr Crewes’ resignation to stand unsuccessfully for Mayor.  This is typical of the careless handling of material this year.
