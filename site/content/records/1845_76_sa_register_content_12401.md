James Rule was called, but was so intoxicated that he was locked up.  Other witnesses agreed that Banin and the deceased were on good terms and that Banin had not left his lodgings that night.  Rules suspicions seem to be based only on the fact that upon seeing the body Banin had said that, ‘he had not done that’. 

The verdict was of accidental death caused by falling over the bank of the creek while under the influence of liquor.

[The death is registered as Alexander McDonnell, died 5 June 1859, Kooringa Creek aged 28.]
