Burra Mine.  One day last week machinery enabled men to break orey stuff, fill and empty 430 trucks each of 1½ tons capacity; each having been hauled about 6 chains and elevated 130 ft with the assistance of the ‘fire whim’.  The engine could do more work if there were more room for the labourers to break the stuff.
