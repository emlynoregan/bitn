The Cost of the Waterworks

Cr Ridgway moved that the Waterworks Committee be requested to prepare a memorial to the commissioner of Public Works asking for particulars on the cost of the Burra Waterworks.

After much correspondence they had managed to extort some particulars from the Hydraulic Engineer, but only enough to make them anxious for more.

Item 1 was the old Aberdeen Works, of which all that was leased to them was 40 chains of old mains, (The services along which had been paid for by the users.)  plus one standpipe, two water troughs and 15 meters.  £832 had been devoted to this and £65 had been repaid unexpended and that had included the pipes in the railway yard and doubling the size of the railway tank, which was understood at the time to have cost £300.  They were being charged £960.  This was more than twice the worth even if the works were new.

If the whole cost only £800 they were leasing about half of it and that half partly worn out, and instead of £400 were being charged £960.

Item 2 was mains and laying.  At £3,161, even though he had no figures to go on, this was a staggering amount.

Item 3 was the tank.  This was priced at £380 and any contractor would jump at the job for £250.  Not only had the Engineer refused information, he had made it impossible to get details.

Item 4 was the charge of £930 for 185 services.  From the Public Works Report he was satisfied they had not cost over £4-10-0 each, averaging the ½” and ¾” services.  The charge for service pipes, which were promised at cost, was put at 4d per foot when the government paid 2¼d per foot and they had been charged 6d for what had cost 3⅛d.

He believed that overall the Hydraulic Engineer had charged 75% on actual cost.  There is a clause in the lease, which said at intervals the particulars of cost should be ascertained and the interest paid on the certificate of the Hydraulic Engineer.  A fair reading would infer that a copy of the particulars should be supplied to the lessee.  The claim of the Engineer that getting the details would require extra clerical assistance is absurd - the details had to be got before he could certify them.

They had been charged £94 interest for six months too, instead of £88-10-0, which was another blunder.  Cr Sampson 2nd.  Carried
