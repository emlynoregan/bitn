Hallett Garden.  After the fine war memorial was erected a brave attempt was made to establish a garden around it.  In a town without a constant water supply this was a problem that defeated the matter in summer.  The garden was then taken over by Mr Summers, the local postmaster and the allotment is now enclosed with a thick hedge of clipped pine and on a recent visit we saw blue cornflowers and Shasta daisies and other beds set our for summer.  Mr Summer is erecting a large rustic summer-house to be covered with climbing roses which are already in place.  A bore costing Â£90 has been installed and paid for.
