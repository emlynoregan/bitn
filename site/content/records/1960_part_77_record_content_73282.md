Two aspects of the consecration of interest were the taking possession of the church and the sealing of relics into the altar.  In taking possession the Bishop wrote the Greek and Latin alphabets in sand spread in the centre of the church.  The idea is that Christ’s possession of the church can be so symbolised, as he is the beginning and end of all things, the alpha and omega or in the Latin alphabet the A and Z.  The relics of saints are enclosed in every consecrated altar.  The new altar was consecrated and then Mass was celebrated.  The Altar, Lectern, President’s Seat and Tabernacle Stand have all recently been constructed from local stones, copper ore, pieces of malachite and azurite, to give a typical local flavour.  The design is the work of Fr Kevin Matthews and was done by David Loffler with Fr Matthews as labourer.  Ross Drew and Mike Warde laid the new carpet over the extended sanctuary and the candlesticks on the walls were made and donated by Darius Ross of Ross Lighting in Adelaide.  Ross and Dianne Drew presented a cushion for the seat to match the new carpet.  After the consecration there was a reception in the Town Hall.  Mr Jim Quinn, as Master of Ceremonies, gave a brief summary of the early history of the parish.  He pointed out the connections with the Austrian Jesuits who founded Sevenhill and the early foundation of a church-school in Commercial Street in 1857.  The ruins can be seen on the corner of Kangaroo Street.  He mentioned the great work of the Sisters of St Joseph and others over so many years.  Bishop Gallagher responded and pointed out that owing to the illness of one of the priests Fr Matthew would now also have responsibility for the Parish of Spalding-Booborowie as well as Burra.

Fr John Morley of St Mary’s [Anglican] Parish spoke on behalf of local clergy.

On Saturday evening St Joseph’s was filled again for a Mass of Thanksgiving.

On Sunday a Parish Picnic was held at Aberdeen Oval and an altar had been erected there for an open air Mass, celebrated by Fr Matthews.  Special mention was made of Brother Shutz [sic] SDB, an old identity of Burra and Sister Helen, who had taught at St Joseph’s School for many years.  John Fahey of Hallett, with the help of others, conducted a program of sports and competitions for children and parents.
