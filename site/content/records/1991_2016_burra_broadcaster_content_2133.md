The Red Shed Company will present the acclaimed comedy-drama ‘Sweetown’ at Burra Town Hall on Friday 29 October.  Melissa Reeve’s play was first produced in late 1991 and is set in 1965 in a country town.  The local historical society, CWA, Apex and the school are researching for events to put the town on the map.  Unexpectedly they uncover a long-buried atrocity against the region’s Aborigines.  This provokes a conflict between those who want to bury the past and those who wish to integrate it into their lives so they can go forward.
