Burra Regional Art Gallery.  A good crowd attended the Gallery’s AGM on Thursday 24 November.  After the business meeting and election of officers the gathering thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of ‘Starry starry night’.  Chairman of the Board, Peter Harvey said the Gallery had continued a policy of pursuing a diversity in exhibitions and always showing at least a representative sample of works by artists of the region.  In addition there had been arrangements for touring exhibitions, either co-ordinated by the Gallery or from Country Arts SA.  Attendance for the year was 3,844 adults and 153 children.  Total income was $17,192.70 compared with $15,821.90 the previous year.  Mr Harvey thought to be really viable the income needed to be in the range $20,000 to $30,000.  He thanked the wonderful team of volunteers and the ‘hanging team’.
