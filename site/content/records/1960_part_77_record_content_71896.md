Burra Women’s Branch of the LCL held its AGM at the Kooringa Hotel on 24 June.  The Leader of the Opposition Dr Bruce Eastick was the guest speaker.  His theme was Federal Labor’s gallop towards Socialism.  He also spoke against the State Government’s expenditure on projects like the Adelaide Railway Station Complex, the Windy Point Restaurant and Monarto.  All were unnecessary.  The country vote needed to be heard more.

Elected were: President, Mrs Ron. Collins; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames W. Klem & R. Pearse; Secretary, Mrs Finch and Treasurer, Mr C. O’Connor.  [The report on the branch activities for the year runs to a little more than one column.]
