The Burra Community & Sports Club Ladies’ Auxiliary was disbanded on 21 June.

The complex opened in October 1982 after a sustained period of fundraising.  Much of the money came from the men’s group who had a contract for garbage collection and the women who provided teas for Council meetings and catered for other occasions.  The Auxiliary started in July 1983 and set about acquiring crockery, cutlery, a deep freeze and other necessities for catering.  It took out a loan to get a gas oven and deep fryer – still in great condition more than twenty years later.  They were catering for weddings and special dinners as well as regular night meals after home matches, where from 140 to 200 meals were commonly served.  As time went by the numbers dwindled.  In 1989 the building was debt free.  When a fire destroyed the building in 1991, most of the kitchen equipment was salvaged and within six months the facility was again up and running.  Since then just a handful of ladies, assisted by members of the community, has worked and re-equipped the complex.
