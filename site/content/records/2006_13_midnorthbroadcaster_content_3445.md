A.H. & C.Y. Woodgate of Booborowie write re the Broadcaster’s story on 14 June of the Woodgate Bros. wagon.  A.C. Woodgate has the wagon all his life and as his son, I Ashley, knew the wagon well.  It was kept in a store [sic: perhaps stone?] walled straw shed except when out working.  Many times I helped load the wagon with straw and bagged grain.  To cart wheat to Andrews we would put on 80-100 bags and used 8-10 horses to pull it the 12½ miles from our farm at Booborowie.  It was an all day trip.  Dad took the farm in 1910 and that’s where the wagon was kept.
