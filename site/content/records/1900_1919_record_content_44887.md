Burra Town Council.

Main Road Grant for 1916: £277.

Position with respect to bridges.

A deputation from Council had waited on the Commissioner of Crown Lands and asked that the three bridges destroyed in the floods be replaced, as the Council had no funds.  This was unsuccessful.  Later an inspector came up and reported on the sites and said the bridges would cost £1,200 or £400 each.  Another deputation then asked the Commissioner to grant £600 on the assumption that the Council would fund the other half.  The Commissioner said that money was tight and he would do what he could.  The Council was to call tenders for one bridge and erect that and when money was freer the other two could be considered.  After considerable debate Cr McBride moved that the Commissioner be informed that the Council would accept the tender of Harland for No. 1 type of bridge and, if the Government approved it, asked them to grant the money as promised.

The Mayor reported that the tar heater would be completed that night.

Cr Lane moved that tar dressing be carried from the Post Office round Commercial St.  Carried.

Cr Radford moved tar dressing be done in North Ward, where previously carried out, except for two chains in front of Ridgway’s which were not in a fit state for it.  Carried.
