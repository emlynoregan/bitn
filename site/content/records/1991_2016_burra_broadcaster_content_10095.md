Council Amalgamations

Hallett DC Chairman, Peter Mattey updated residents on the amalgamation issue at meetings in Terowie and Hallett last Tuesday and Wednesday.  He said there was no alternative to amalgamation and that Hallett Councillors considered the western cluster with Crystal Brook and Red Hill to be too remote and sought discussions with Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda Councils.  A phase two memorandum had been signed with Peterborough Town and District Councils, but a number of issues were still to be resolved.  An alternative to going with the north or the south grouping was to split Hallett and so go both ways.  The Wednesday meeting asked the Council to enter phase 2 negotiations with the southern grouping and if possible to re-open the discussions with Jamestown and Spalding.
