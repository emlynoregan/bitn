Burra Show Inc.

Final preparations are in hand for the show on 4 & 5 October.  The Governor will attend and has expressed a desire also to see the school children and the hospital and will attend a civic reception.  The President said in view of the Governorâ€™s visit he would give a luncheon again this year.  Automobile Assoc. guides will operate both days.  Mr Oborn, the headmaster, wrote to say the Society had ignored suggestions about the school class section at the show and the teachers will not now act as stewards.  The President said the suggestions had come in late when the prize list was practically completed.
