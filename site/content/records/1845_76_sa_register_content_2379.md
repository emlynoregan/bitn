The Burra Hunting Club

This club is composed mainly of tradesmen and shopmen.  A number of the members started out from the township last Sunday morning with the hounds, under drenching rain, which continued all day.  After a few fruitless runs, in which the game escaped into the scrub, they returned in a sad plight, trophyless, some with sore heads and others with sore bones from falls.  One returned without his steed, which is yet to be repossessed.
