M-C Benham, in charge of Kooringa Police Station is to be replaced by M-C Jamison, presently at Clare.  M-C Jamison has suppressed Clare’s notorious larrikinism in the eight years he has been there.  [In a brief report of his activities the name is spelled ‘Jamison’ four times and ‘Jemison’ once: subsequently it usually appears as ‘Jemison’.]
