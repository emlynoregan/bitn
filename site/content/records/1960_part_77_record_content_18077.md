St Mary’s Church was packed on Sunday for services conducted by Bishop the Rt Rev. Donald Redding, who had been Rector in Burra from 1933-39.  The service began with the dedication of two new stained glass windows given by Lady Swift and Mr Andrew Tennant in memory of their mother the late Mrs Margaret Barr Tennant.  Those windows are in the church porch.  Sir Brian Swift and his daughter Mrs Andrew Tennant and Mr & Mrs John Barker were the donors of windows in the porch.  Mr Andrew Tennant unveiled the windows as the Bishop dedicated them.  The service continued after all had returned to their seats and twenty-four candidates from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett and Farrell Flat were confirmed.  A splendid supper in the church hall allowed many old acquaintances to be renewed with the Bishop.  The portion in red needs clarification
