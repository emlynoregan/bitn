Burra & District War Memorial Committee has decided to push ahead with getting the oval in order.  Twenty-five sawn blue gum posts have been ordered for the oval fence and punt cables have been ordered from Morgan to ropw off the playing area.  Speciafications for a suitable entrance gate have been called for. Application has been made to have the three roads on the north, south and east sides of the oval closed and added to the oval.  This would prvide more room if the walls were removed.
