Everyone knows the NDL is ‘set for the defence of the money bag and land monopoly.’

‘They have other purposes to serve than such as will contribute to the easing of the burdens of those who are least able to bear them.’

The fact the Mayor paid his own way is not relevant; he was there as a representative of Council and if by paying his own way a delegate feels permitted to and feels justified in voting against his own Council then the Council’s interest would be served by paying him to stay home.
