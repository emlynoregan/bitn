John William Barton, local Burra chemist, became an Australian citizen at Februaryâ€™s Council meeting and was presented with a native eucalyptus tree.  Cr Barton migrated to Australia with his parents 31 years ago when his father became managing director of David Brown Tractors in Sydney.  The family later moved to Adelaide.  He decided to become a citizen after experiencing the customary delays in getting a British passport for an overseas trip.
