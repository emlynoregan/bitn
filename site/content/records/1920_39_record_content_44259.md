T. Hawke Editor of the Country News writes stating that at no time has a reference to the Burra Town Council appeared in the Country News.  [While it was the Mayor who had made reference to the ‘Guttersnipe’ press accusing Burra Council of having political parties, it was Cr Button who had identified the paper as the Country News.  See 53, 49, 7 Dec. 1932, page 1.]
