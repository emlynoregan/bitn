Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk Mr E.R. Davey said he had been given information that the Highways Dept. was to build a bitumen road from Booborowie & Spalding to feed the North.  He wondered if Burra was being passed by.  A letter from the Minister for Local Government on 4 February 1946 said a Saddleworth to Burra road via Black Springs was a priority, but nothing has been heard lately.  Mr G.S. Hawker MP will be asked to find out why there is no action despite the Burra road being part of the main route to Broken Hill.

The response from the Local Government Minister on using rating on unimproved land values is non-committal.  The Government was considering increasing the maximum rate permitted by 33â…“%.  Several country councils operating on unimproved land value were in a desperate financial position, though city councils seemed to be doing better.
