Burra Regional Gallery will open its latest exhibition ‘The Eyes Have It’ on 6 April when artist Harry Sherwin will officiate.  The exhibition features a most varied collection of portraits.  Another exhibition to be opened at the same time is ‘Cartoons by that odd Mr Sprod’.  At the centre of this are cartoons drawn by George Sprod while a POW in Changi Prison and on the Burma Railway in WWII, now in the collection of his nephew David Sprod.
