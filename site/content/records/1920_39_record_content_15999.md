Obituary.  John Sleeman died 21 May in Adelaide.  He was born at Bodmin Cornwall in 1849 and arrived in SA aged c. 24.  He came to the Burra district where he started farming at ‘Blink Bonny’ on the Leighton Road.  A few years ago he sold this and went to Charters Towers, but not succeeding there he returned to SA and lived in Aberdeen till ill health forced a move to Adelaide.  He was for about 50 years a member of the Rechabite Lodge and also a member of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge.  He was single.
