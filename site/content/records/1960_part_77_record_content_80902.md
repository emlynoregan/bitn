Burra Swimming Pool will remain closed until more parents volunteer to help with supervision and the canteen roster.  Poor attendance at a meeting last Wednesday led to this decision.  Another meeting is scheduled for 5 November.

A Film Night at BCS on Monday 8 November will feature the 1924 Buster Keaton classic The Navigator and a modern film.

Burra Golf Club Inc. AGM 22 October elected: President, A.M. Gebhardt; Vice-Presidents, A. Day & D. Villis; Captain, Stan Longford; Vice-Captain, R. Hillman; Secretary, H.C. Burnett & Treasurer, J. Duance.

The retiring President Allen Baulderstone reported on a successful season.  Renewed interest saw an increase in membership for both men and associates.  Most Saturdays saw over 40 players hitting off.  Stan Longford won the Club Championship and Kies van der Does won the ‘B’ Grade, with Don Lloyd winning in the ‘C’ Grade and Roger Buckley in the ‘D’ Grade.  The open day was successfully held on 15 August when Dean Harris won the Open Championship and equalled the course record.  Financially the club has almost overcome the trials of building the clubhouse and is almost back to the credit balance of 1975.  Two payments have been made off the clubhouse loan and $1,000 spent on a tractor and equipment.  The annual cabaret on 17 September was a financial success and should nett in excess of $300.  A cheque from the Burra Sports Syndicate has not yet been used and is in a fixed deposit.  The associates have again been a great support and the catering for open day was notable.  The tree planting program under Ern Zanker has continued.
