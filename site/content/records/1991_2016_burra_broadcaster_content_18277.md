Denton’s General Store, Farrell Flat

The store had been run by the Denton and Przibilla families since 1904.  It was sold last year.  Since it had been a store where nothing was ever thrown away the contents included items from the early 1900s.  They all went under the hammer last Friday 29 January.  Collectors had a great time.  The highest price was $5,000 for an old National Cash Register.
