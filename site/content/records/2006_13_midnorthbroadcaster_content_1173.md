Letter to the Editor from Adrian Smith, Chairman of the Farrell Flat Management Committee, Aerodrome Sub-Committee.

The sub-committee has spent five years trying to encourage the Goyder Council and the Clare & Gilbert Valley Council to take an interest.

The only airfield in the district is on private land and provides a 750 m dirt strip and one of 450 m.

The committee spent much time with CASA, Transport SA and PIRSA to provide reports to local councils.

Elsewhere in SA, airfields are much more common.

They have concluded that what was needed was a runway 1,500 m to cater for aircraft of 5,700 kg (12-18 passengers).

This meant a new site and one near Hanson was a possibility.

MNRDB seemed uninterested.

Mr Robert Bradley, owner of the present site says it will be resumed for agricultural purposes from 1 December 2006.

Tourist operators regularly express interest in being able to fly in visitors.

Clare & Gilbert Valley Council lost interest as soon as the airfield might be developed outside its area, despite its effort to develop its ‘regional status’.

An airport is important for:

Fire-bombing operations

Crop spraying

Personnel and clients for winemakers and other businesses, including pastoral and farming clients for annual sales and auctions.

RFDS operations

Tourism

Businesses associated with airports – see the examples of Murray Bridge and Goolwa

Conference access

Recreational use by local pilots

Economic viability needs to be tested and a business development plan produced at a cost of c. $10,000.  The sub-committee feels that it has gone as far as it can and the matter now needs to be placed in the public area for discussion.
