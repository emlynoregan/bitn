Burra Co. RVF.  Report from F.W. Holder, Captain Commanding.

Since the first enrolment on 6 May 1885 there have been 74 names on the list of whom 8 have withdrawn, (Mainly because they have left the district.) leaving 66.  Attendance could be better, but still 63 men attended at least 15 recruit and 10 other drills.  Few had fired at a target before so results there are not so good.  The band of 16 players is setting a fine example.

Finances are satisfactory.  Uniform costs have been £230-12-11.  The public has subscribed £76-3-9.  Many thanks are due to P. Lane JP who collected much of that, and to Rev. G.E. Rowe and to Ex-Mayor J. Dunstan Jun. JP, and to Mr W. West for getting £5-5-0 from SAMA.  Several members of the company subscribed a total of £47-13-0.  There was £91-10-0 from the Government for a total of £215-6-9.  Some £24 has been spent on instruments so the current debt is £34-5-10.

There is hope of a drill instructor within a month.
