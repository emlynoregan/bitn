The Murray Railway

[Editorial: The proposal for a line to the Murray is a great work.  It deserves an informed public debate.  The route and the cost are the main issues.  There is a great difference between a line via Light’s Pass to Moorundee and one via the Burra Mines to North-West Bend.  The first would require about 90 miles of railway, while the latter would need about 150.  Surveys have been undertaken and we hope the results will be put before the public.  A railway not only passes through country, but also has the potential to open it up to development.  The Burra route would pass through a vast tract of good country, though doubtless the problems of the Burra Ranges would counter some of the route’s advantages.  The greater length is a problem of immediate cost, but that need not be a deciding factor.  The longer route may for instance facilitate greater production in the colony, cheapen food in the Adelaide market and increase exports.

The City to Port Adelaide Railway cost about £25,000 per mile, of which about £10,000 was for the permanent way and the rest for rolling stock, stations etc.  The 8,240 miles of railway in England to the end of 1855 are estimated to have cost about £35,000 per mile.  Railways here can be cheaper; single line, lighter rolling stock, and simple stations until traffic justifies more.  However economically we work, it will nevertheless be an expensive project.

Messrs Stevens & Coke have decided to send a barge with flour up the Murray to the Victorian Gold fields.  This has sparked great interest in the other colonies, with talk about the implications of both river trade and railways.  The likely extension of Victorian railways to the gold fields means that the development of SA lands along our railway must be a major consideration and not just the benefits of tapping any inter-colonial trade.
