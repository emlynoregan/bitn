There was a Wesleyan Bazaar in the schoolroom on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to aid trust funds.  There was a great variety of fancy work, engravings, clothing and every type of farm produce.  The first day raised almost £200 and the three days £382, since when several lots have been sold to bring the total to over £400.
