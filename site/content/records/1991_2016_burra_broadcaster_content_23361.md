The Hanson-Burra Agricultural Bureau has closed.  The branch had been in recess since 1994 and was it was finally decided to wind up its affairs at a meeting on 4 October.  The final funds of $218.95 have been donated to the Burra Hospital Auxiliary.  The Hanson Agricultural Bureau began in July 1928.  In 1982 falling attendance led it to move its meetings to Burra and in 1987 it changed its name to the Hanson-Burra Agricultural Bureau.  Poor attendances eventually led to its demise.
