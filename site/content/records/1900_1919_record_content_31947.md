Dobrilla’s Club Swinging is reported in ¾ column.  While he continued his endurance event two dances were held in the hall on Thursday & Friday nights.  A crowd assembled to see the completion of the 58th hour.  Dobrilla toyed with the clubs quite freshly and when time was called the Mayor congratulated Dobrilla on his achievement in setting a state club-swinging record.
