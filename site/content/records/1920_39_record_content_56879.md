LCL Burra Men’s Branch held its AGM in the Liberal Union Room last Friday.  Elected were: President, Mr A.D. McDonald; Vice-Presidents, Messrs S. Robinson and G.G. Hawkes and Secretary, M.S. Edwards.  Attendance was small and interest lacking.  Mr S. Hawker blamed some of this on the extended length of Parliament to 5 years.  Elections stimulated interest.
