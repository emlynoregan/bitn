Burra Railway Station

After a public meeting a couple of years ago Roger Cross and Peter Harvey worked on a proposal to turn the station into an outreach museum for the SA Museum – under the auspices of the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  SA Museum director Tim Flannery has endorsed the idea to display some of Australia’s megafauna, being found at Redbanks Reserve, in the refurbished station.  The owners of the building are Australian Southern Railway and negotiations continue concerning a structural lease proposal.  Much also depends on obtaining restoration funds.
