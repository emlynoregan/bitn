Salvation Army.  Many gathered at the Citadel to hear Major Ron Smith assisted by his father Major W. Smith.  Major W. Smith (79) recalled many pleasant memories of Burra and visited the place where he was born (a minerâ€™s cottage in the bank of the creek*) and met old friends from his second term as an officer here in 1915.  His father built the first railway station in Burra.  Major Ron Smith also had memories of a boyhood in the town, of the school and the creek.

[*Walter Smith was born in Kooringa 23 November 1873.  This seems a very late date for a dugout in the creek.  Most other references suggest they were abandoned by about 1860.]
