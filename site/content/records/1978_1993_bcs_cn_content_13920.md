Olive served two years as President of the Hospital Auxiliary, three years as Gold Associates Captain, was a member of Red Cross and a keen player at the Bowls Club.  She has been Uniting Church organist for over thirty years and a music teacher.  She has always been willing to oblige when asked to play for concerts, weddings, funerals, choir music, luncheons, Melbourne Cup fund raising days, mannequin parades, carols by candlelight and community singing at the hospital, as well as at church services.  For thirty years she has come in from Poonunda (18 miles east of Burra) for choir practice and again for the Sunday service.  She is also renowned for her cooking, especially yeast cooking.
