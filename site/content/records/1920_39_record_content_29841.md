CWA Annual Meeting was chaired by Mrs I.J. Warnes, President.  Secretary Miss Minnie Rogers reported a branch had been opened at Spalding and in the Metropolitan Area.  Treasurer Mrs P.J. Pickering reported they were in credit Â£3.  Mrs Warnes said she called the meeting early in the year because she was going to England on 7 March.  She was pleased with the advance of the Spalding Branch.  She appealed for the Association to support the Anti-Cancer Campaign.  In England she would represent the National Council of Women at an International Conference for 10 days.  All officers were re-elected.
