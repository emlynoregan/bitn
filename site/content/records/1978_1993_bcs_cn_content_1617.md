Burra Conservation Study

This week a closer look at a specific precinct of the town: Precinct 3, Kooringa.

National & State Significance: it was the first company town in Australia.

Local Significance:

It includes the historic commercial centre.

No freehold was granted in the lifetime of the Mine.  [Not strictly true; freehold could be bought from 1869 and mining finally ceased in 1877.  It was true from 1845-69.]

No local government till 1876.

History:

Kooringa was laid out in 1846 as a company town.

It was not anticipated or expected that any other town would be surveyed – certainly no on Section 1.

The Mining Company tried to prevent subdivision outside its section.

Until 1862 no through road directly joined Kooringa with the ‘outside’ town of Redruth-Aberdeen.

Domestic architecture in Kooringa is a mixture of cottages dating from the earliest company cottages to the more substantial residences of the commercial and post-mining period and modern buildings – the latter not always sympathetic.

There is a fine collection of Victorian structures – commercial, Government and public in Market Square, which by 1877, when the Mine closed had become a lively commercial centre and a service centre for the district’s expanding pastoral and agricultural industries.

[Actually it would be hard to find a Government structure in Market Square from the Victorian era.  I’m not sure what exactly is encompassed in the term ‘public’, but Market Square’s Victorian buildings are essentially shops, a nice stock agency office (now the Tourist Office), a hotel (whose character is dominated by the upper storey of 1912) and perhaps a fine bank building; if you ignore its address as 1 Market Street.  The point being made is certainly valid for Kooringa, but not, I think, if you limit yourself to Market Square.]
