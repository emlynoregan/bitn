‘The Man Who Sees’ considers that to say the Council is impotent to prohibit Sunday games, can at best be a half truth.  The light of Sunday Observance has been burning brilliantly too long to allow any interference to either diminish or extinguish its power by any individual, group or society; in any community; and can anyone be so unwise to believe that communities have been left without any protection from intrusion of their Sunday Observance.  The writer says the Municipal Act gives the Corporation power to act in all sorts of emergencies and in particular one clause gives it the power to act ‘For the better observance of Sundays’.  Furthermore only the Council has the right to exercise full control as set out in the Act and not the leaseholders.  Also the lease can only be granted for 21 years and must be approved by the decision of the Ratepayers.

‘The very essence of the 40 hour working week in the light of reason is an added safeguard to strict Sunday Observance.’
