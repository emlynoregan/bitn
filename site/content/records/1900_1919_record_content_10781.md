Salvation Army.  The Biorama at the Barracks on Thursday exceeded all previous cinematographs to visit Burra.  The Biorama Co. had the latest bioscope projector as well as a powerful compound dissolving lantern.  The pictures were the most brilliant ever seen in Burra.  The Biorama overcomes the quivering, which is not at all pleasing to the eye caused by other machines.  The orchestral music was appropriate and pleasing.
