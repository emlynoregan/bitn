Christmas.  There were no public amusements on Christmas Day.  Shops were open on the 28 December, but closed for a holiday on 2 January when picnics were commonly indulged in.

The United Friendly Societies held a picnic in Mr Need’s paddock four miles south of Burra on the Adelaide Road.  Among the sports played was a 150 yards foot race for men and a 150 yards foot race for boys under 15.

W.H. Vivian cleared 4 ft 7 inches to win the high jump and T. Threadgold won the hammer throw.  E. Topperwein came first in the blindfolded men’s wheelbarrow race, with A. Schmidt winning the similar event for boys.  There was a three-legged race and hunting the pig with a greasy tail.  A band from Gawler played for dancing.  W.F. Coglin umpired the sports and attendance was 500-1,000.

In the evening a Musical Entertainment saw the Burra Hotel Assembly Room filled to capacity.  Rev. Stanton rendered his noted recitation Drat the Cats.  There were items from a group of Christy Minstrels.  W. West of Redruth wrote an appreciated prologue and Dr Dashwood JP presided.

Agriculture.  Reaping continues apace and in places yields in excess of 30 bushels per acre are reported.  Lowest yields are about 12 bushels per acre and the average seems likely to be about 20 if the weather holds.

Captain Paull is making a recovery under Dr Dashwood’s attention.
