Ratepayers’ Meeting, Institute, Tuesday 31 March.

Mayor, John Dunstan Jun. in the chair.

Cr West introduced the motion to borrow £500 against the Parklands rate and explained it in the terms used at the Council meeting.  The debt would be paid in seven years.  The savings in interest would be £140 and £1,200 would be spent on works with the loan, while without it the Council could do nothing to improve the town or relieve unemployment.  He pledged that there would be no overdraft if this one were paid off.

Mr Holder 2nd and supported the loan as a repayment of an overdraft already incurred.  It was easy to be wise after the event and he could now see it would have been better to have had the bonds redeemable at longer dates.  The other advantage of bonds was they had a fixed term, but the overdraft repayments would be uncertain.  Of course there must not be another overdraft.

Cr Coglin had opposed the loan at first and had never liked debt, had never had a loan in his life, but he had been compelled to see it would not add to their overall indebtedness and would enable them to get all the Government subsidy they could while it was still available.  He would certainly not countenance any future overdraft.  He hoped the proposal would pass without a poll which would cost £10-£15.

Mr Lane was assured the loan would pay off the overdraft.  He then spoke against the scheme.  He doubted their ability to keep the pledge on no future overdraft.  He pointed to the council’s failure to save money on salaries and effect other economies and brought up the cost of administering work (as mentioned in the editorial).  He thought they could dispense with one constable - after all he had been away for four months out of six.

The Mayor then corrected some of Mr Lane’s figures.

Cr Coglin said he had certainly tried to keep his pledges on economy, but had failed to carry the rest of Council.  He would never stand again and would resign but for the £20 for doing so.

Cr West was also aggrieved by Mr Lane’s charges.

Cr Ridgway was also sure the Council had done its best and if they were not able enough the town should have elected better men.  He would have opposed the original loans, but having entered upon a particular policy they must carry it out and he supported it, though he would not have done so on the general rates.  He thought Corporation overdrafts immoral and one Council should not anticipate the revenue of the next.

Cr Sampson expressed has sympathy for the loan, though he regretted his motion for the readjustment of offices had not been carried.

Ambrose Harris asked where the Parklands were and did they not belong to SAMA.

The Mayor listed the Recreation Ground, the Redruth Reserves, Welsh Place etc.
