RSL plans for an avenue of trees on the eastern approach to Burra cannot be realised because they can only plant on one side [northern] and so cannot create an avenue.  Mr Vern Riggs has 160 trees: 160 sugar gums and 60 pines [sic] ready to plant out.  Gaps in the row already planted will be filled as will gaps in the CWA planting of pines, but a place for the rest is still being sought.
