At about 11 a.m. smoke was seen coming from the top storey of the small engine house close to Morphett’s Shaft and later grass nearby was also noticed alight.  Residents in the area beat out the grass fire, but not realising how serious the fire was, they failed to raise the alarm and tried to put it out themselves.  Between 2 and 3 p.m. it has assumed such proportions that fighting it was out of the question and soon the fire spread to the big engine house over Morphett’s Shaft.  The woodwork of immense proportions burnt like matches.  Towards midnight quite a crowd collected to see the blazing poppets fall, which supported the platform on which the big pulley wheel was fixed, used when the mine was working, for drawing ore up the shaft.  On this also stood the life-sized figure of a miner holding a round stone hammer and chisel.  This figure had always been revered by the miners and even the present generation felt regrets when it, in company with the wheel, crashed to the ground.  The wheel, five feet in diameter and at white heat, broke, but the figure was not badly damaged.  Morphett’s Shaft is heavily timbered and is now burning fiercely.  On Saturday night the sight was very beautiful with flames leaping to a great height.  On Sunday hundreds gathered to see the large columns of smoke ascending from Morphett’s Shaft and the beam timber could be heard falling away and crashing into the water below.

The property belongs to Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride of Adelaide.

Police are investigating, but it is generally alleged the fire was caused by some lads smoking out pigeons, of which a large number live in these buildings.  Many old miners say it could be weeks before the fire burns itself out.

The following week the paper apologised for saying the figure carried a hammer and chisel.  It was in fact a pick and miner’s gad.  The head had a miner’s hat and place for a candle in front.

At the December meeting of the Town Council it was decided to approach Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd and request them to present to the town the effigy of the miner brought to the ground in the recent fire.

Johnny eventually found himself on top of a pole at the mine entrance, where he remained until vandals cut him down in 1967.  The second Johnny Green was too broken to be given another lease of life and was pensioned off to the jinker enclosure while his ‘ghost’ still hovers above.  It is appropriate that the new Johnny Green was fashioned and presented to the Burra National Trust by the new mine owners Samin Ltd.

[See the report of the fire XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3.  The report in the paper seems to indicate that the fire occurred on 12 December, but the boys who started it appeared in court on 10 December, which would seem to make the date of the fire Saturday 5 December rather than Saturday 12 December.  In XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3 the court case is also reported.  This reveals that the boys were attempting to smoke out rabbits (not pigeons) from under the floor of the engine house near Morphett’s Engine House.]
