Dick Halliday’s Football Success

C.R. (Dick) Halliday was awarded the R. Lee Trophy when playing for SA against WA in the amateur League Football Carnival in Perth last Saturday.  He kicked three goals.  Last year he won the Howe Medal for the SA Amateur League last year.  He resided in Burra for some years and played with the local Association.  He is the brother of D.A. Halliday of Burra.

Aberdeen Tennis Club held a Victory Ball in the Burra Town Hall to celebrate winning the Premiership for the 1947-48 season.  The Catherine Orchestra provided the music and Mr G. Heinrich was MC.  The Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston presented the shield and also congratulated the club on gaining a 21-year lease on the reserve where the courts are located.  Mr Marston was pleased that this would enable the club to carry out improvements there.
