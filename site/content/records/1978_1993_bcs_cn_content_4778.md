Frank Ford

The opportunity to choose from four candidates is rarely offered.  I would if re-elected do my best to serve the interests of the people of Burra.  As a Councillor I have been its representative on the Tourist Committee and as Chairperson have seen it go ahead in such a way that we can be proud and have one of the most successful tourist offices in SA.  With the help of volunteers it is self supporting and costs the ratepayer nothing.  The town and district has an outstanding history and we should do all in our power to take advantage of this as it could well be the answer to the survival of the commercial core of the town.  I feel that there is an ongoing job to be done and if re-elected would certainly try to do it.  I hope I have always been ready to see beyond the town to the needs of the district as a whole.
