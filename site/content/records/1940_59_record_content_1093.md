Burra Town Council, 1 April.

The Under-Treasurer has granted 12 months to spend the money borrowed for the swimming pool.

The Burra Seaside Committee is considering the request to hand over £50 towards the pool.

£1-1-0 was donated to the Children’s hospital.

Council decided to economise on the rapid wearing out of flags by flying them at the Institute and at Burra North only in daylight and not on rough days.

Mr Golding, the architect of the Swimming Pool Committee’s plans, has volunteered to assist voluntarily in the building of the pool.

The Mayor thought they should be able to build it this year.

Council seeks a final financial statement from the pool committee.
