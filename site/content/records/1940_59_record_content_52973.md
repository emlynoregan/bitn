Burra Burra DC has been advised that it is not known when bitumen will be available to seal Main Road 45, as other busier roads have priority.  The present sections of the Main Road via ‘The Gap’ have been repaired for the Robertstown and Burra Districts.  The bad stretch, where most accidents occur, is in the Saddleworth District.
