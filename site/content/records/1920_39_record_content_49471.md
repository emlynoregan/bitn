Obituary.  The late Martin Pederson who died early Monday morning was born in Denmark 20 October 1856 and migrated to Australia when about 20.  He was first employed in Burra by the late J.T. Walker, now Walker & Sons.  He was still a young man when he struck out for himself.  His excellent workmanship, marked integrity and business acumen saw him make a success of the undertaking which he continued to control until a severe illness recently forced him to hand the reins to his son Jack who was in partnership with his father.  He took a keen interest in town affairs and served as a Councillor during the Mayoralty of the late Dr R. Brummitt.  He was also a member of the Institute committee.  He was a keen member of the Bowls Club and soon a great interest in gardening and physical exercise.  He took long brisk walks.  He was a staunch member of the Kooringa Methodist Church and was the oldest of the trustees.  He twice visited his native country, making his second visit after he turned 70.  A brother, Dr Soren Pederson Krage was recently knighted by the King of Denmark and he and a sister survive in Denmark.  Mr Pederson was twice married and is survived by a widow, three surviving sons and four daughters.  His second son Pte Will. Pederson was killed at Pozieres in the Great War.  Others are: Martin Pederson (Reade Park, Adelaide), Annie Mrs W. Jeffcott (Devon Park), Bessie Mrs W. Willis (Ottoway), Percy Pederson (Beulah Park), Dorothy Mrs Ray Jones (Woodville), Olive Mrs W.H. Spier (North Adelaide) and John Pederson (Kooringa).  There are 15 grandchildren.  He was also a member of Kooringa Masonic Lodge and the Oddfellows Lodge.
