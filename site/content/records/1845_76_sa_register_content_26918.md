Political Meeting at Kooringa, 10 December

A meeting was held at the Assembly Room at the Miners’ Arms this evening to discuss the Government’s policies and the rejection by the Legislative Council of the Stamps Duties Bill.

Mr Lane presided and explained the meeting had been delayed by Dr Antliff’s series of lectures in the town.

Dr Stephens moved a motion supporting the Government’s policies to advance the colony.

Thomas Moody seconded the motion, which was carried with acclamation.

William Pierce [sic: for Pearce] proposed a motion condemning the rejection of the Stamps Duty Bill by the Legislative Council by one vote as unconstitutional in principle and opposed to Parliamentary usage, given that it had the unanimous approval of the assembly and the almost universal assent of the elective body.

He accused Sir Henry Ayers of acting out of jealousy; contending that Ayers would have supported the move had he been on the Treasury benches.

F.W. Holder seconded.  He thought it was time to amend the constitution.  He expected that out of the present evil it would emerge that one third of the Council would have to resign at each dissolution of the House of Assembly.  Passed without dissent.

O. Harvey moved that the action of Sir Henry Ayers and those who voted with him against the other half of their own House justifies those who elected them in now demanding their resignation.   Seconded by C. Lowe and carried.

C. Lowe proposed the time had arrived for an amendment to the constitution limiting the powers of the Legislative Council and calling for the formation of an Association to be called The Kooringa Legislative Reform Association.  Carried unanimously, after being seconded by Thomas Moody and supported by William Woollacott.
