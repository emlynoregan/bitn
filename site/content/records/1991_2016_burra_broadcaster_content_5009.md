Harry Dighton will run a Cob b & Co. style stage coach from Market Square with routes varying from ten to fifty minutes.  The first day of operations was yesterday, with a journey from Market Square to the Bon Accord Hotel.  The coach was recently built in Melbourne by Cobb & Co. Horse Drawn Carriages, run by Ben Hall â€“ a great grandson of the infamous bushranger.
