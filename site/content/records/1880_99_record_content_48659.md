Burra Town Council

The Mayor asked for confirmation of the minutes of last meeting.  Cr Linkson objected to the Mayor’s Report and wanted to know why he was ruled out of order.

The mayor said if a vote was not taken on the minutes he would adjourn the meeting.

Cr Linkson said the Mayor’s report was most untrue, though it was not possible to know if it was true or not in some respects as the Mayor took it away with him after the meeting.

The Mayor threatened to adjourn the meeting.

Cr Hardy said if three Councillors remained the meeting could be carried on.

Cr Linkson rose on a point of order.

The Mayor asked the Town Clerk if the minutes were correct.

He said yes.

The Mayor again called for a vote.

Cr Parks then said members of Council objected to the part of the Mayor’s report where he made reference to Cr Linkson.  He said he had since looked up Standing Orders and thinks now the Mayor was wrong.
