Burra Town Council, 18 January

Cr Kellaway said it was rumoured that ballast quarries were being opened and that the Government was getting supplies from the Adelaide foothills and it was then carted to Mile End: something should be done about the Burra Quarry.

The Mayor said enquiries had been made before and the Government would do nothing unless the Council took full responsibility.

Cr Kellaway said the Burra ballast was the best obtainable and moved the Minister be written to with a view to having the quarry opened.  Carried.

Cr Lee moved a footpath be made from the small footbridge across the creek near the hospital to Mr R. Garrardâ€™s.  Residents living there had no means of getting back and forth in winter without getting their feet wet.  Carried.

This meeting was a very short 20 minutes, but it is believed the shortest ever was under S.M. Lane as Mayor on the night of a very special entertainment at the Institute when the minutes were read and the Mayor declared there to be no other business and the meeting closed: all within 5 minutes.
