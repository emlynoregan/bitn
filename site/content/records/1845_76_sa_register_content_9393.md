Election Dinner at the Burra

G.S. Kingston’s election was celebrated by his supporters with a dinner at the Burra Hotel on 27 September.  Dr T.H. Mayne took the chair and Mr T. Bath the vice-chair.  Mr Thomas Burgess proposed the toast to Mr Kingston, extolling his virtues in extravagant terms.  He said Kingston’s opponents had cast around for a candidate and had approached men of whose political opinions nothing was known and only at the last had they hit upon Mr Mildred, who had come out in haste.  His professed principles were the same as Mr Kingston’s.    Burgess said he had been employed by the SA Mining Company for seven years and had never been intimidated and always felt free to vote as he wished.  All the objections to Mr Kingston were based upon his being a Burra Director, but why should that disqualify him, asked Mr Burgess.  Mr Burgess stressed the importance of getting their supporters properly registered for voting.  This would be even more important in the future because it was probable that the next election would see universal [male] franchise and the secret ballot.

Other speakers were Jos. Wood, and Mr Challoner who in proposing a toast to the Town and Trade of Kooringa, reminded the storekeepers of the town that every penny of their prosperity had come up in the kibbles, yet they would not sell them green ribbons, though they gave them blue ones.  He trusted they would be more mindful of their obligations to the miners.

[The report of other toasts indicates the presence of J. Pearce, Mr Barker, Mr T. Burgess, Mr H. Fry, Mr Sampson, Mr T. Bath, Mr Bryant, Mr W. Woollacott, Mr J. Wood and Mr Henry Miller.]
