Burra Homing Club.  The race from Parachilna on Saturday was won by P.J. Byrnes.

Lambing Rates in the inside country of the district (western portion) will average c. 75%, which is good considering that the season broke late and ewes were in poor condition.  In the east the rate is 75 to 80%.

Scouts.  A meeting of ten adults and about 40 boys from 11 to 16 at Burra Primary School last Monday resolved to form a troop if a scoutmaster can be found.

Mrs W.H. Quinn is 88 on 8 July.  Mrs Quinn, who now lives in Adelaide, was formerly of Mt Bryan.

Mr John G. Sara of Burra North was 90 on 5 July and many friends and relatives gathered to wish him well.  Mrs Sara [88] made a birthday cake.

Constable Wilson was farewelled by the Burra JPs when he retired on 30 June.  He was presented with a reading lamp.  Mr & Mrs Wilson will make their home at Victor Harbor.  Senior Constable Chambers is presently in charge at Burra North, but Sgt J. McInerney of Morphett Vale has been appointed.

Leighton Hall is to be renovated at a cost of Â£210.  This will cover repainting of the hall and supper-room and some repairs to the outside walls.
