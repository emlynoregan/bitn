The Mayoralty.  With S.M. Lane’s decision not to stand again Mr Crewes has again been approached – particularly as the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial will be proceeding in the coming year and he has been much associated with it.  Mr Radford decided not to stand given the numbers requesting Mr Crewes to see the memorial through.
