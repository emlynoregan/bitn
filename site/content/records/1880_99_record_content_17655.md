Burra Company RVF.  Meeting in Institute last Friday.

Rev. G.E. Rowe said no one could but regret that a place with over 2,000 inhabitants had been so very long without a rifle corps.  He gave a synopsis of the regulations.  He said there was a move for the Government to supply uniforms, but he feared it would fail.  There were men in the town who would supply uniforms for those unable to afford them, in return for them pledging their capitation grant which would pay for it in two years.  “Efficients” received 30/- p.a.  He moved a rifle company be formed to be called the Burra rifle Company under the Rifle Company’s Act.

Dr Brummitt 2nd though he felt his duty lay elsewhere.  If later it became necessary he would join.  The motion was carried unanimously.

The Mayor then read a letter from J.J. West requesting formation of a junior volunteer force for lads 13-16.

Mr Kennedy felt that now that the joining was for the good of the country those joining should have uniforms at the cost of those not prepared to join.  They could not afford the time and money too.

Rev. S.F. Prior said if they went as volunteers they should expect nothing of this sort; they were unpaid and freely gave their services.

Mr F.W. Holder said ‘those who were not prepared to join themselves, or to make sacrifices of time and money or to risk their lives, should at least provide uniforms for those that did more than they were willing to do, and who were, perhaps, not nearly so well able to afford it.’

He moved that a Patriotic Fund be started to meet the expenses of the corps - he believed £50-£100 might easily be got.

Mr Murphy 2nd. Carried unanimously.

Neither the Revs G.E. Rowe nor S.F. Prior liked the tone of Holder’s remarks.

Holder refused to withdraw anything and held to his view of the least that non-joiners could do.

A list of almost 40 names of would-be joiners was made.

A committee to take charge of the Patriotic Fund was formed
