Mr Hardy gives a further account of the goldfields in the MacDonnell Ranges in Central Australia.  He says he would be very willing to return there if anyone wants to fund a party: he would go either as the leader or a member of the group.  He says he is responding to questioners interested in the prospects of gold in the MacDonnell Ranges.  Despite adverse reports about parts of the country he says he is still favourably inclined about it as a whole.  At Winnecke’s what has been found has often been in disturbed country and the origins of the gold are yet to be determined.  He also expressed some faith in the discovery of payable alluvial gold between Winnecke’s Depot and Ruby Gap to the east along the Hale River.
