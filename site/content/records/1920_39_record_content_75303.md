Burra Town Council, 8 June

The Mayor reported there would be a public meeting about tree-planting to be held in Pearce’s Building 14 June to be addressed by Mrs L.A. Lewis.

Cr McWaters said C.R. Bevan was doing a good job of repairing the cemetery wall.  28ft of the eastern wall wanted pulling down and re-building.  Mr Bevan offered to do it for £4 if the Council found the material.  On the north wall between the two gates salt damp had appeared and the wall needed re-pointing with cement.  Council accepted Mr Bevan’s offer and resolved that necessary work to the wall be done.
