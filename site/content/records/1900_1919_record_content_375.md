Boer War.  The Wesleyan Church held intercessional services for the war last Sunday and a special collection in aid of the Nurses Fund raised Â£4.

Nurse Bidmead of the Burra hospital left for Adelaide last Saturday.  She has been chosen as one of the six SA nurses to go to Transvaal.  She was presented with a small purse of sovereigns.
