The new scenic road will be open by next weekend 24 October.  It will not be a 60 m.p.h. road, but a plain access road to be updated as time moves on.  Access is at the bend on the road between Burra and Burra North, known as Carpenter’s Corner.  From there it crosses the creek, turning south, skirts the old mullock dump and joins the old scenic lookout road at the top end of the dump.  You can then follow the road to the lookout point over Burra and carry on around past echo point to the old powder magazine.  From there you can look down on the new processing plant under construction and also into the open cut.  The site engineer, Mr R.E. Hope, emphasises that tourists are not allowed within the fenced mine area.
