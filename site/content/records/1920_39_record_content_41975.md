Burra Town Council, 16 May

It was resolved that the Town Clerk write to the solicitor of the Municipal Association concerning the appointment of a Council representative on the Hospital Board.

Much of the meeting was devoted to the approval of raising and carting road metal and of various work required on roads and footpaths.

Wire netting on Kingston St Bridge is to be repaired.

Cr Bevan moved that a post be placed at the corner of Megagissie St [sic] to throw the traffic more to the centre of the road.  The Mayor questioned the name of the street.  The Clerk said it was correct.  [But actually the name is Mevagessey on town maps, although the town in Cornwall that is its origin is Mevagissey.]

‘The Mayor: It’s “Cowdung Hill” is it not? (Laughter)’

There was speculation about possible road work under the Federal Unemployment Grant to SA – mainly on roads, but also basketball and tennis facilities for the State School.  A list was drawn up to be submitted with the claim for funds.
