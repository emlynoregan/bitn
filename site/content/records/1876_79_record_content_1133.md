Burra Mine report by Capt. Sanders

Morphett's Shaft to 85 fathoms (510') Work clearing out debris etc. continues on several levels. Work continues in the 60 crosscut driving towards Peacock's air shaft and at 60 fathom level 6 men clearing to Roach's to ventilate the level but water is entering at 700 to 800 gallons per minute and slowing progress. Ayer's old shaft now secured from the 50 to the surface & ore being extracted by whim. Open cut work continues apace.
