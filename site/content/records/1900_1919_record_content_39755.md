The Parklands

The rate for the year had to be increased from 2d to 6d to pay for the purchase of the Burra Creek and another block of land bought by the previous Council.  The sum was £184-6-0.  The Parkland account, after very careful management is in debt £42-18-3 which is a good result.  600 trees have been bought, but held in reserve due to the drought.

Council wishes to form and plant gardens in previously unsightly spots.  This year one has been made in Chapel St and named ‘Holder Garden’.  Others are in course of construction in West and North Wards.  It is also planned to plant the Burra Creek and the west side of the road from St Mary’s to the Mine Bridge.
