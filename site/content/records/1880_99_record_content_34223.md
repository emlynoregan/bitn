Tree Planting.

Tree Planting has not come from general funds this year and I have raised £16-19-6 for tree planting in Kingston, Queens, Commercial, Kangaroo and Mt Pleasant Streets and in several North Ward Streets.  Trees in the avenue are doing well and the changes wrought in the town’s appearance are now becoming very apparent.
