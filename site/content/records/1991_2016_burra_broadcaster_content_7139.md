The Exhibition ‘Burra & Beyond’ was opened at the Burra art Gallery on 11 June.  Centrepiece of the exhibition was the large, 13 foot long painting by Allyson Parsons, commissioned by the Burra Burra DC as part of Burra’s J150 celebrations.  More than 100 people were waiting for the gallery doors to open to the public.  The exhibition comprises 16 new paintings by Marie Parsons, 10 new paintings by Allyson Parsons and a number of other works by Allyson that have been loaned for the occasion.  After the exhibition Allyson’s painting ‘Golden Days, Now and Then’ will hang in the Burra Council Chamber.  Visitors to the exhibition were impressed by stage 1 of the renovations at the gallery, which will be officially opened later in the year.  [Photo.]
