Burra Town Council – Mayoral Election

It is thought that the election on Saturday resulted in a record number of votes being cast.  The result:

Stan Kellaway	172

F.T. Marston	193

Informal		    8

373

[As usual, it is well to be sceptical of claims about records.  In fact, the votes for the Mayoralty in 1934 totalled 492 and the figure of 365 for valid votes had been exceeded on five other occasions.]
