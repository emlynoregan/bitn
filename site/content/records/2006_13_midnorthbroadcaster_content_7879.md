The Jim Barry Clare Valley Regional Awards

The award for General Business with a Tourist Element went to Gaslight Collectables and Old Books.  It is the second year in succession that Jill & Bob Perry have won this award.  The store has recently been with an improved street frontage.  Another Burra identity, Jessica Dames, won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Tourism in the Region by an Individual.  She was the tireless organiser of the SALA Arts Festival.
