Henry M. Smith wrote a letter concerning Parliamentary statements about connecting the colony’s northern areas with the coast.

The extension of the northern railway from Farrell’s Flat to Jamestown will not meet the prospective requirements of many of the northern areas.  It will serve the Belalie area only.  Farmers of Gulnare Narridy and Booyoolie, living from 14 to 32 miles from Jamestown would not take their produce there and then pay for a 140 mile carriage to Adelaide.  A better solution would be a tramway or railway from Caltowie to Pt Pirie, a distance of 53 miles.  There is only one place on this route where the gradient would require a significant cutting.  This line would satisfy the North Broughton and Broughton Extension farmers, Caltowie, Gulnare, Narridy, Booyoolie and Crystal Brook (as yet unalienated) areas.

[He then goes into details of distances, travelling times and farmers’ time given over to transporting their produce.]

The Hon. Member Mr Angas stated that extensive roads would be needed to cart wheat to the line.  In all probability they would be district roads, not Government roads and the farmers themselves would have to maintain them through District Councils, which before long must become institutions with us.

In addition the suggestion to connect two second rate ports as Wallaroo and Port Wakefield by rail is absurd.  It would parallel an existing post road at no great distance and serve but a handful of farmers in the Green’s Plains District.
