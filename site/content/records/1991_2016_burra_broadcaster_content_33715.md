Burra Community Development Committee had a crisis meeting last Thursday night to recruit members needed to keep the Town Hall open, with its Telecentre.  Nineteen people turned up and this suggests that the management of the hall is assured.  The Internet Centreâ€™s future is less certain, as it would need significant volunteer support.

Theft.  Six cars were interfered with at Burra North yesterday morning; two had damage to their ignitions and a Holden HQ Kingswood was stolen, but later abandoned near the passport gate at the Burra Mine.

Andrew Glen of the Burra Visitor centre has initiated a new driving trail through the Lower Mid North Region.  The Heartland Trail encourages visitors to visit Gawler, Kapunda, Eudunda, Burra, Mintaro, Auburn and Two Wells.  It allows also for side visits to Freeling, Robertstown, Point Pass, Farrell Flat, Balaklava and Mallala.

Copies of the brochure are available from Burra Visitor Centre.
