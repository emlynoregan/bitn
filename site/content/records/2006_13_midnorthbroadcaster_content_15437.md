A beautiful golden cypress wind break at the end of Bridge Terrace has gone.  A 10 metre pine (not an Aleppo) was removed last week and other from various places around town have gone too.  It seems anything not a eucalypt is in danger.  Why has nothing been done to tidy up the trees damaged by galahs around the town?
