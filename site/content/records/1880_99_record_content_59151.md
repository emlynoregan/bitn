Burra Town Council.

There was a conference with the District Council over the Cemetery Road.  It was decided that it was desirable if it can be arranged to have a road from the south end of Ayers St to the cemetery and along its eastern side to Mr McCulloch’s gate dedicated to the local bodies concerned.

Lamp lighting tenders accepted:  W. Geake’s for two lamps in Kooringa at £13 p.a. and C.G. Tiver’s for one lamp in Aberdeen at £7-15-0 p.a.

It was reported that the bridge leading to Mitchell’s Flat was completed and also the ford across the creek at Aberdeen.

Rates for 1896 will be: General 1/-, Health 4d and Parklands 2d.
