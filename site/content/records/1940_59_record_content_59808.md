Burra North Red Cross held its AGM at the Croquet Club Hall on 1 July.  Meetings have been held in the Croquet Hall each month.  Although there are 64 members only a few stalwarts attend.  The main income is from trading tables.  The November meeting took the form of a garden party and a hospital fete took the place of a Christmas Tree and Children’s Party.  A street stall was held on 27 March from which £40 was sent to Headquarters and we have recently donated £30 to the local hospital.  We regret the death of a former Vice-President, Miss Rogers, who was an active supporter for many years.
