If the Corporation took over it would have to pay the 5% interest to the State Bank half yearly.  As a member of the Institute Committee he said that for the last 8 years Burra had been very apathetic about the Institute.  Attempts to raise money had met with little or no response.  The Government had cut out the subsidy and there was little response to calls for library subscribers.  The committee could not afford a decent supper room or to give the Corporation a decent set of rooms for offices.  The Institute could pay its way, but could not effect any improvements.  The town would be getting a Town Hall for the cost of servicing the debt – far cheaper than the Town Halls at Clare or Peterborough, which the ratepayers had to bear the capital cost of.  If the Council took over, the Government would have no say in it at all.  A rate of 2d in the £ would cover the interest and 6d if there was no income at all.  In fact Mr Dane’s rent for the pictures amounted to a trifle less than the interest.

This motion when put was carried 22 to 19.

A poll has been called on both counts.
