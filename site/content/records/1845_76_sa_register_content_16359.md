James Osborne was charged with stealing a pair of trousers, one vest, one silk dress and other articles from Henry Collins on 3 January.  Samuel Collins, the prosecutorâ€™s brother, had been driving a dray north from Burra when he gave a ride to the prisoner.  [He then recounts the details of the theft.]

The prisoner was sentenced to one month in gaol and ordered to pay the costs of the three witnesses.
