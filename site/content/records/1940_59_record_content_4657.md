Pte S. Eig of Burra visited the town briefly on Thursday and was presented with a watch and parcel at Warner’s Café.  The Mayor chaired the meeting.  Pte Eig was a Burra boy who had worked himself up to a position in the Post Office, but had put that aside to join the war effort.  Alf Walker spoke in support of the Mayor’s comments.  Mrs Eig’s eldest son had gone to the Great War and now her youngest, Stan, was off to this one.  Mr H.E. Fuss spoke for the RSL.  Mr P.L. Rosman also spoke and Mrs S.C. Genders made the presentation.
