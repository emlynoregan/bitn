The release of the State Budget has clarified the position somewhat.  Burra hospital will remain open and continue to offer twenty-four hour emergency service and other services in line with community needs, which may include expanded primary health care, aged care, support observation beds and respite/palliative care beds.  Pt Pirie will become the main hospital for the area and will offer the same services as Clare.  Jamestown and Crystal Brook will maintain birthing and some surgical services as well as in patient services.
