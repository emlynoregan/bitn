The Salvation Army welcome the Hindmarsh Corps Band on Saturday evening.  They played in front of the Citadel at 8 p.m. and at the usual Sunday meetings.  On Sunday afternoon a program followed the Anzac Service and was a fine climax to a very successful day.

[The items presented by the bands are listed.]
