Redruth Correspondent.

W.J. Richards made a trip to The Gums station on Monday to deliver a motor [bike] to Norman Pearse for use on the station.  He covered the 30 miles in 1 hr 10 mins and then took 3 hours to ride back on a [pedal] bicycle.  He reported feed to be good along the way, but that water was getting short.
