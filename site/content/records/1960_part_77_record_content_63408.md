Burra Show

The gate takings reflect the increased number of visitors.  $1,075 compared with $655 last year.  Door takings at the Ball in the Town Hall were $875 and for the teenage dance in the RSL Hall $165.

The Show was opened by the Governor of SA Sir Mark Oliphant in fine weather.  Show President, Mr R. Mason, introduced the Governor, whose speech is printed.

The display of farm machinery and cars was much larger than usual.

Art attracted a great diversity of entries with a strong junior section.

Budgerigars attracted entries of varying standard.

Cookery was of high standard and the children’s section was very pleasing.

Flowers were a poorer standard than usual, but the children’s entries were good.

Goat entries were larger this year, but of varying quality, though the best were excellent.

Needlework was of a higher standard than usual.

Pigs were revived as a section this year and all the exhibits were good types.

The Sheep Section produced good commercial sheep in both the restricted and poll sections.  The Champion Poll Ram was outstanding.  Entry numbers should have been better.
