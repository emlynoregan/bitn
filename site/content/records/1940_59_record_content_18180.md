Burra Town Council, 3 July

The Mayor’s allowance was fixed as for 1943-44.

Committees were appointed.

Cr Kellaway was elected the Council’s representative on the Hospital Board.

Dept. WOI replies to a query saying additions etc. to buildings can be carried out without a permit if the cost is not over £25.

Cr Harvey asked if Council was going further into the matter of the ownership of the old Burra Mill, as it was in a very dangerous condition.  The Town Clerk was instructed to find out who owned it.
