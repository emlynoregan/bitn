Burra History: According to a ‘women’s weekly paper’ of 14 June 1967 in an article by Bill Beatty.

In 1845 when the colony was only seven years old and on the verge of ruin a child gathering wildflowers brought news of a patch of pretty blue ground in a valley called Burra Burra, near where she lived.  Her father investigated and found traces of copper, then worth a king’s ransom. Miners were brought from Wales, Spaniards and mules from South America and for the next twenty years 1,000 men were employed on a twenty-four hour shift that yielded copper worth millions of dollars.  Today they are a memory and the Burra is a centre of a farming and pastoral area.

Ian Auhl writes commenting on the article.

While it is true that the Burra Mine did save the young colony from ruin, the other aspects of the above article are wrong.  The colony was nine years old not seven.  The mine opened on 29 September 1845 with the firing of the first blast and closed on 29 September 1877 with the dismissal, with a day’s notice, of 360 men employed.  The mine thus had a life of 32 years rather than 20.  Miners came largely from Cornwall rather than Wales, though Welshmen came later to work in the smelting works of the English & Australian Copper Co.  The story of the discovery seems to have been confused with that of the Kapunda Mine three years before.  Copper was discovered at Burra by the shepherds Streair and Pickett.  Streair was working for James Stein who held a pastoral lease along the creek when he found copper near the southern boundary of what is now Section 2 of the Hundred of Kooringa.  He kept quiet about it and in June 1845 tried to sell his secret in Adelaide.  An Adelaide mining syndicate refused to give him £6 for it.  He went to the Rundle Street shop of Bunce & Thomson, where he sold the information to Bunce for £8. Streair then fades out of the story.  A company formed under George Kingston (later Sir George) went to investigate the claim and while there heard of another discovery further up the Burra Creek by a shepherd called Thomas Pickett who worked for William Robinson on his ‘Gum Creek’ lease.  Pickett had a hut near a spring on Diprose Creek and its ruins are still to be seen on the north bank a little east of the junction of the roads from Kooringa and Aberdeen to Morgan.  Neither of the shepherds was married or had wildflower-picking children.  Pickett was driving to his hut with provisions from Gum Creek when his wagon wheel broke off a rock to reveal the ‘blue ground’.  The discovery soon became widely known and the difficulty then was to find the £20,000 in SA that was needed to purchase the 20,000 acre special survey.  Governor grey insisted on payment in gold sovereigns.  Neither of the rival companies in SA could raise this much and to forestall a Sydney company waiting in the wings, they united to get the survey.  Once the survey was made though, instead of combining, they drew lots to see who should have Streair’s find and who should have Pickett’s discovery.  In the long run the SA Mining Association obtained Pickett’s discovery and made £5,000,000.  The rival Princess Royal Mining Co. got Streair’s find and lost £5,000.  Streair made £8, which in the final analysis was not a bad result for a failed mine.  Pickett received a bonus from the SA Mining Association of £1 per week for life.  He continued as a shepherd on Gum Creek Run about eight miles north of the mine and a few years later was burnt to death.  He was buried at Kooringa, probably in the old cemetery across the creek from the present Burra Cemetery.  Perhaps the names of the shepherds will live on and Burra like Kalgoorlie with, Paddy Hannan, will have a statue to its discoverer.  When the mine was a success Pickett was sent for and asked what he desired as a reward and it was his choice to opt for £1 a week and a team of bullocks.  He ended tragically.  After buying a small keg of rum he went off in his dray and the next morning some drovers found the burnt fragments of the vehicle, the iron hoops of the keg and beneath it the charred remains of the old shepherd.
