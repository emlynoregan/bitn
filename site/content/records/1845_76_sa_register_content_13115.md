Political Meeting

A meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on Monday evening to allow Mr Kingston to address the electors.  Mr E.B. Gleeson was voted into the chair.  Mr Kingston said he was pleased to be a candidate for the fourth time.  He thanked the 300 electors who had signed a requisition asking him to stand.  He recounted for newcomers to the colony his role in the passage of the Constitution Act for SA and the establishment of a liberal form of Government in place of the old nominee system.  He claimed a role in getting the vote for all over 21 instead of the previous £10 franchise and for the introduction of the secret ballot, free from intimidation, though to his knowledge no such intimidation had ever been practised.  Indeed men had voted against him and continued to be employed at the Mine until they left of their own accord.  He also claimed credit for the system of mineral leases now in operation to the benefit of the miners.  Now discoverers of mines could obtain a lease, whereas before they had to compete with anyone else at an auction to buy the land.  The advantage was clear from the recent sale of one of their leases by Messrs Chambers & Finke for £40,000.  He then turned to a discussion of the sale of agricultural land.  He advocated a deposit of 50% at auctions; this would do much to eliminate land sharks who, having paid a small deposit, immediately went out and sold at a premium before they had to meet the rest of the payment.  He also spoke in support of Mr Torrens’ Real Property Act as being a great benefit to those purchasing real estate.  Mr Dale asked if he was in favour of payment of Members of Parliament.  He was not.

He was also opposed to Government aid for schools where doctrinal teaching was given, having helped to abolish state aid to religion.

A motion declaring Kingston a fit and proper candidate for election was proposed by Mr T. Bath and was negatived by a large majority.

Mr Dale was called upon to address the meeting.  After some hesitation he did so.  He questioned Mr Kingston’s success in serving the community.  Where was the Redruth Bridge?  Having received £1,900 during the last three years as payment in the House, his opposition to payment for Members seemed inconsistent.  Kingston now said he opposed immigration, but this conversion had only happened when it was clear the electors would support it no longer.  What had he done for the District?  He had opposed railway extension.  True he had supported the new constitution, manhood suffrage and the ballot, but he also supported the gagging clause and the obnoxious Militia Act.  Dale also complained of Kingston’s support for the Mineral Leases, which had detrimental effects as well as advantages for some, for unfair impounding regulations and unfair taxation.  Mr Dale said great partiality had been shown to the squatter.

At the end of the meeting Mr Barnden proposed that Messrs Dale, Lennon and Cole were each fit and proper candidates and each proposition was carried unanimously.
