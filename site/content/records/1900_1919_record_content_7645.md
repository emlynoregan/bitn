Paul Neydock was charged with indecently assaulting Katherine Bennett, aged 4, on 1 April at Kooringa.  The evidence strongly suggests he was intellectually disabled and Dr Sangster said he thought the accused was ‘not mentally sound’.  The bench was not convinced of that and he was committed for trial in Adelaide.
