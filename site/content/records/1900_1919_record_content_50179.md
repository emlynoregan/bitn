Burra Town Council, Monday.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis have presented an account for 5/- per load of crusted slag taken without permission.

Mr Crewes wanted the matter referred to the solicitor, as he believed the Council could take any road material on payment of a royalty.

Cr Dane said it would amount to c. £3 and moved it be paid.

Cr McWaters 2nd, saying it had been wrong to take it without permission.

Cr Radford moved a letter be written stating the Council thought there would be no objection to taking the slag, that the price was unreasonable and should be reduced.

The Mayor said the tar was hot when the suggestion was made to try the slag.  He was not aware it was on Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s land.

Cr Harris thought it was on the English & Australian Copper Co.’s land.

Cr Killicoat said the firm was simply making a point.  The men had made a mistake and took from the wrong end of the heap.  The opposite end would have been on English & Australian Copper Co.’s land for which permission had been granted.

The motion was altered to pay for four loads at the rate quoted with a quotation sought for quantity.  Carried.

Cr McBride said if the heap was worth 5/- a load it was worth the assessor’s attention!

J.S. Pryor forwarded his resignation as lamplighter for Kooringa unless the pay was increased to 1/6 a lamp per week.  The contract for lamp lighting was cancelled and new applications will be sought for Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Ed. Bowen’s quote to paint the Mortuary Chapel was accepted at £10-5-0.

Cr Dane said the continuous telephone service was failing at times when the exchange could not be raised.  The postmaster’s attention will be drawn to it.

Members for the District are to be asked if it is intended to restore the Saturday night train and if not then a deputation to the Commissioner will be arranged.
