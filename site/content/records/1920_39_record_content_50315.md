Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s by Solomon Williams of Glenelg.

Reading Frank Treloar’s history has sparked old memories of the mine and town where I spent the first twenty-one years of my life.  To begin by taking a walk around Market Square and Commercial St.  The Institute was the building farthest north.  I remember it being erected and have several times attended lectures there by Rev. D.J. H. Ibbetson and others.  South of the Institute were several houses, one of which was occupied by Dr Maurau who with Dr Mayne were the mine doctors.  Then came the mine surgery and then the general store of David Bayne – two of his assistants were H.T. (later Dr) Burgess and Mr Martin Burgess.  This store was burnt down and rebuilt by the Insurance Co.  Later T. Bath and W. Pearce were the occupants.  Then came the National Bank; R.G. Wilkinson and later Mr Rosman were the managers.  Then the small shop of Ewing, confectioner, then T. Richards, bootmaker.  Nearby was Joseph Parker, chemist, later Greenwood, Dyer & Wilkinson.  The descendant of the last is still in possession I believe.  T. Park’s bakers & grocers were next.  Then Marks & Gollin, later Stanbury.  Now on the corner comes Samuel Drew & Co. sometimes called Young & Drew, Mr Young being a partner and other Drews coming in later.  Now comes H. Dawson’s saddler’s, then Mr Splane a bootmaker and Thomas Jordan watchmaker and jeweller.  Under this was a spacious cellar used as a wine and spirit store and kept by J.C. Jenders.  Next came F.T. Jones, later Jones & Builder, metal workers & ironmongers.  Adjoining this was W.H. Batchelor, paints, glazier, bookseller etc.  Then there was a vacant space before David Mackay’s ironmongery.  Next came J. Winnall’s drapery store with assistants T. Hosking, J.S. (later Rev.) Green, Miss Parsons & Chris Moody.  Then three or four small shops – one occupied by Mr Holder, a butcher and David Well’ carpenter’s shop.  Then a blank space and a shop I can’t recall before Baker’s blacksmith’s & wheelwright’s.  A private house next was occupied by Mr Harrison, a painter on the mine.  One of his sons, Dan, learnt his business with Mr Batchelor, and then joined H.L. Boss & Co. of Adelaide and became their foreman painter.  Crossing the little creek we come to old Mr Gordon’s house and then Dr Mayne’s residence and surgery where I remember being vaccinated.  Then Turley’s & Hosking’s in the hollow of the creek.  Somewhat further on and across the road the Burra Hotel was kept by Mr Barker.  The large assembly room was used for all entertainments by travelling artists, election meetings, Freemasons, Oddfellows etc.  The Burra Brewery was nearby, but further back from the road.  Returning after some open space to some cottages: one was occupied by Mr Oakford a schoolteacher and another by Mr Coglin the Crown Lands Ranger.  A little further on and nearly opposite Dr Mayne’s surgery there stood a large old gum tree; I think it was the only one left in Burra after those in the creek were felled.  Under this tree was Mr Hattam’s blacksmith’s shop and then the residence and workshop of Mr Cox a cooper.  An open space before coming to the Catholic Church and across the footbridge to Mr Gubbin’s bootmaker’s shop.  Across Kangaroo St was Pickering’s another Bootmaker and then Mr Grafe a baker and confectioner before John Roberts grocer and fruiterer and then W. Pearce tailor and Orchard a fellmonger, whose tannery was three miles down Burra Creek.  Bruce’s furniture shop came next before Bock, hairdresser and tobacconist.  Johnson watchmaker and jeweller was on the corner of Queen St.  Across Queen St on the corner was the residence of Dr Wilkinson with a chemist shop managed by T.W. Wilkinson.  Adjoining was H. Dawson’s residence and then J. Harden’s carpenter’s shop and Mardon’s bakery and grocery.  J. Edwards had a butcher’s shop on the corner of Chapel St and across the street was the Police Station on the end of a row of cottages.  I remember policemen Rollinson, Hunter & Catchlove.  In the row lived Hill, J. Beal & Knuckey, a son of Mr Knuckey became a surveyor and was associated with Sir Charles Todd in the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph Line.  On the corner of Thames St was a tailor named H. Chory.  Across Thames St was J. Stephen’s carpenter’s shop and then Jones a blacksmith, later B. Preece then Haskard, Hudson wheelwright was next and then the Miners’ Arms Hotel conducted by Fred Cowper.  Adjoining was George Bennett’s ginger beer brewery and later Wade’s tailor shop was built.
