Weather.  On 20 March between 7 & 7.30 p.m. a heavy thunderstorm with torrential rain struck Mt Bryan East.  At Old Mt Bryan Sheep Station 110 points fell very quickly.  On the southern edge of Mt Bryan East 70 points were registered, but on the northern edge Mr C.W. Dare recorded only 2 points.  Dusthole Creek carried a moderate flood.  There were heaps of hailstones in the flood rubbish for the following 42 hours, despite the heat.  A week before the storm 35 points in the southern end of the district soaked into the soil.
