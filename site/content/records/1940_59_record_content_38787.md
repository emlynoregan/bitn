Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd Centenary

100 years ago a 26-year-old wool-broker from Yorkshire set himself up in business in Melbourne.  This business has grown into today’s Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd.  Richard Goldsbrough received professional training from age 14 in Yorkshire in the heart of the wool world.  He established his own business in early manhood and then migrated to Australia, attracted by the quality of Australian wool.  He established himself as a wool-broker on the corner of Flinders and William Streets in Melbourne in 1848.  Within two years he had become the leading wool-broker in the Port Phillip District and had bought out another firm and moved to the corner of Flinders and Market Streets.  In 1851-53 he replaced his wooden store with a commodious bluestone building.  His enterprise between 1848 and 1878 caused wool warehouses to be equipped on a scale which to other seemed impracticable.  He attracted English and Continental buyers to Australia and more than any other single person established wool selling on a large scale in Australia.  When he died in 1886 at the age of 64 his humble business had a capital of £3,000,000.  Later in 1886 the firm took over the business of Mort & Co. Ltd of Sydney.  Its founder, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort came from Lancashire and had also migrated as a young man and displayed a similar degree of enterprise in the wool trade.  He had also showed considerable foresight in pioneering the frozen meat trade and his business and community service made him an honoured figure.  Neither Goldsbrough nor Mort lived to see the amalgamation of their firms.  Today Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. has more than 100 branches across Australia and last year had a turnover exceeding £29,500,000 and received 334,000 bales of wool, sold 4,150,000 sheep, 280,000 cattle, 110,000 pigs and land worth £2,250,000.
