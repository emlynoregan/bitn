Letter.  ‘The Man Who Sees’ writes condemning the degree to which Council business is being conducted behind closed doors.  One such matter is the decision to change the contract with the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd.  The minimum charge contemplated is now to be 12/6 as against the previous 5/-.  This means all who have, by strict economy, been able to keep within the minimum charge of 5/-, will now pay a further 7/6 less meter rent.  All consumers above the 12/6 unit value, suffer no disability, but benefit from the elimination of meter rent.  The writer wants to know the role of the Council in this change.  Was the contract altered by the contractors themselves or recommended and agreed to by the Corporation?
