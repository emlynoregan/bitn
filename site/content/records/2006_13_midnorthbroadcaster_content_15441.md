A 150-year-old pine was levelled in Bridge Street East last Wednesday on the excuse its roots were interfering with drains.  It is strange it should suddenly cause such problems after 150 years.  ‘Trees as well as buildings tell us so much about our pioneers, their homesickness at planting trees familiar to them and in respect to them I argue that trees should be left to give that uniqueness, so evident in Burra.’

[150 years is probably something of an exaggeration.  Photographs of the town in the 1870s reveal almost no trees at all.  Plantings were undertaken from the 1880s onwards, following the establishment of the Town Council, nevertheless, this hardly alters the argument.]
