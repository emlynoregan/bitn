Burra Tennis Club faces an uncertain future due to dwindling numbers.  The club has gone from fielding six senior teams to one.  The club has been a strong contender in the Burra & District Tennis Association, which includes Booborowie, Hallett, Spalding and Andrews Tennis Clubs.  The declining interest saw the folding of the Farrell Flat Club this season.  President Travis Thamm said the junior numbers are quite healthy, it is difficult to find senior player.  This season it proved hard to get one senior team together.  The fear is that the whole association would fold if Burra cannot get sufficient members.
