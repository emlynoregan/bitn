Proposal to Dam Burra Creek

Cr S.J. Woollacott said the creek could be dammed back from about opposite the Church of England for about £1,000.  He raised this point because of a letter from the Under Treasurer about financial assistance in 1936 for a Public Works Scheme to build a swimming pool for £400.  The State and Federal Governments were to provide two thirds of the sum under an interest scheme extending over ten years at 4½% interest.  The Under treasurer now wanted a definite statement of the Council’s intention.  The Town Clerk Mr E.R. Davey said that under the scheme the Council was supposed to pay 20 half-yearly payments of £20-19-2 with the last payment due in January next.  If the Council did spend the amount the money paid in (£337-6-8) would revert to the Council and the Council would lose the Government subsidy.  That meant that there was over £1,000 available to construct a swimming pool in Burra: £400 from the loan, £500 from Centenary Celebrations and £140 of public donations.

The Mayor said a War memorial would be needed and so long as a swimming pool was incorporated in the scheme for a Memorial, he could see no reason why the amounts as above could not be used.  They should point out that owing firstly to the war and later to the shortage of material it had not been possible to build the pool.  The Council had prevaricated from the start and it was time for a decision.

The Mayor said he would suggest a weir across the creek opposite the Church of England to form a reservoir extending back to about opposite Mr Johnson Carpenter’s.  [I.e. the Mine Entrance.]

General beautification then of the banks and gardens and lawns and the inclusion of a swimming pool would entitle the use of the £400.

Cr Woollacott said he had taken levels and the fall in that distance was c. 8 to 9 feet.  He was sure a concrete dam could be built for the money in hand.

A dam near the bowling green would be much more expensive because the fall was too great.

When a swimming pool had been mooted, he had offered to sink the hole as his contribution.  He would still do so if necessary.

Cr Woollacott said the upkeep of the dam would be next to nothing.

The Mayor said were money to come from another effort like the Centenary Celebrations a further £1,000 could be raised – lawns, gardens and tennis courts could stretch from Burra to Burra North.

Cr Woollacott estimated the dam at c. 8 feet high had 40 yards across.  He was convinced that seepage would not be a problem.

A special meeting will be called to discuss the Council’s response to the Under Treasurer.
