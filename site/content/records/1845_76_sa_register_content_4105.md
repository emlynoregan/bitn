‘A Mine Grantee’ writes from Adelaide 29 October 1849, in response to ‘Tre-Pol-Pen’.

[He defends the expertise of W.H. James and disputes the description of Cornwall as being all in private hands.  Also he says mining grants there are often in the first instance given to the finder, who undertakes exploratory work to establish whether it is worthwhile for a company or partnership to embark upon the concern.  He also says that even in a short residence in the colony he has been made aware of many instances where mineral discoveries have been kept secret because those who know cannot at present buy the sections.]
