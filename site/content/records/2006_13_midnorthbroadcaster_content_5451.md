More Wind Farms are planned for the Mid North.  Roaring 40s Renewable Energy Pty Ltd has applied for three new farms to be located at Stony Gap, Robertstown and Waterloo.  [Map printed.]

The company has had agreements with landowners for some years and the Federal Labor Governmentâ€™s renewable energy policy has made the development feasible.
