Weather.  Thunderstorms have delivered some rain locally to bring the total to 31 points for the week.  On Wednesday at 2 p.m. a terrific storm broke with much thunder & lightning, a sharp fall of rain & hail and gale force winds which blew down the chimney of Mrs C.L. Phillips in Chapel St, damaged hoardings and broke boughs from trees, but fortunately it was all over in about ten minutes.

To the east torrential rain fell in some areas.  Koomooloo recorded 189 points in one hour and similar falls were reported from Woolgangi, Hogback & Wyoming.  The watercourses have come down and several travellers reported confronting streams 500-600ft wide.  A. & L. Kellock and Stan Woollacott en route to Braemar found they had to turn back from water courses in places one to three miles across and too deep to wade through.  I.J. Warnes says it is the best start to a summer season he has known.  Damage to fencing is far outweighed by the benefits to the country.

Balah recorded 273 points at Hideaway Hut and 112 at the homestead.  Oddly, in those places which missed the downpours dust storms raged on Wednesday.

The agricultural areas are doing wonderfully well and lucerne paddocks at Booborowie are a picture and the area is also producing mushrooms 6-8‚Äù across with similar finds between Hallett & Mt Bryan.  In the storm on 5 November R.L. Steele at Ayers Forest had two sheep struck by lightning.
