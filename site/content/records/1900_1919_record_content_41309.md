James C. McCarthy, farmer of Hundred of Hanson:

Owned a double-barrelled breech-loading gun – missed it a month or five weeks ago from a trap in the buggy shed, also about five cartridges, some of them Eley’s speedites.  Cartridge produced is similar.  The cartridge had been knocked about and McCarthy recognised marks on it where he had had trouble extracting it from the gun in February when he had used a pocket-knife for the purpose.  Harold Escott was present on the hunt on that occasion.  He described features of the gun which made it highly likely to be the same one, but would not swear to its being the one.  Harold Escott had been staying at their place from before New Year till sometime in February.  (About 2 months)  Saw Harold at my father’s on 16 March: he arrived about 9 p.m.  Said he was on his way to Farrell’s flat to have the horse shod.  It is about 5 miles to Escott’s from our place – it might be covered in about half an hour on a good horse.
