The Piggies Bike Club visited Burra last weekend.  They are a group who describe themselves as a drinking club with a cycling problem and have been meeting for nearly 15 years.  Their first dayâ€™s ride saw them looping from Burra to Mt Bryan and back, covering in all about 100 km.  On Monday morning they gathered outside the Burra Hotel before setting off to Robertstown where they intended to camp on the oval overnight.
