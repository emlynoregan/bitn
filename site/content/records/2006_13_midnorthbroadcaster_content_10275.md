Anne Royal writes on the possible dewatering of the mine by Phoenix Copper.  She reports on the results of the last such occasion when this was done in the 1970s and cites evidence that one consequence was the production of a five km diameter cone of depression of the water table.  At least one bore operator had to be compensated when their supply well dried up.  She urges people to respond to Phoenixâ€™s submission to PIRSA.
