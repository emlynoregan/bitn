Sale of Mineral Lands

Last Thursday at the courthouse in Weymouth Street 60 sections were offered for sale and one was offered on a 14 year lease.  One of them, near Sod Hut, was temporarily withdrawn pending a decision on the route of a road.

[For 23 sections, their area, the names of purchasers and the prices are listed.  The location of each section is not given, but the following would seem to be worth further investigation for those interested in the Burra area:

The leasehold of section 3 of 36 acres went to F.H. Dutton, John Hart & others for £700.  This is not section 3 Hd of Kooringa, unless it is part of the section.

Paxton & others for the Royal Mining Co. section 2503 of 53 acres.  £1,010-1-0.

Paxton & others for the Royal mining Co. section 1522 of 72 acres.  £123.]
