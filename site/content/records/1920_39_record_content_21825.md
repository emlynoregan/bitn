CWA

The movement is now firmly established under Mrs Warnes as President.  She has such a gracious personality with tact and charm that any woman or girl feels that can approach her and be sure of a kind reception.  The same remarks apply to her lieutenant in Mrs Maurice Collins.  The committee comprises two women from every district and town around Burra except Hallett which has not yet decided to participate.  The constitution was hammered out at the meeting last month and Mrs T.R. Bowman, President of the National Council of Women, has agreed to be the Patron.  Mr & Mrs Wilkinson have given and furnished a large room at the back of their stationerâ€™s shop as a rest room and this was opened on 17 December.  The room offers a comfortable refuge and caters for the needs of women, children and babies.  Mrs Wilkinson declared it open.  Mrs Wigley & Mrs Tennant contributed some of the furnishings and a number of people a collection of lesser equipment.
