Early Bakers in Burra

[There had been some discussion about early bakers in the town, but I did not note it because it was vague and generally uninformative.  You will get some idea of the vagueness when I now note that one of the bakers had been referred to as Mr Holman or Hallman or Aulman.  This issue now says he was Mr Ullman, who at one time owned the property now known as ‘Stud Park’ at Mt Bryan and the land on which the Mongolata Gold Mine was later situated.  He was a bachelor and c. 1901 returned to visit his former home in Stuttgart, Germany, for a holiday and died aged 95 in Adelaide.  He was a great uncle of Mrs May Cox of Burra North.

It is difficult without further knowledge of the family to be sure about these facts, in part because bachelors leave few records and because I do not have easy access to relationships in Germany before migration.  But evidence from the Burra Record in 1902 suggests that Mr Ullman the baker operated in Kooringa on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Kingston Street from c. 1869 to 1902.  The landowner at Mt Bryan would seem to be Charles August William Ullman 1830-1891.  He and his wife died in November 1891 in an influenza epidemic.  May Cox was his granddaughter.  If the baker was a great uncle, he was a brother to C.A.W. Ullman, but this connection is not traceable in SA records.  The reference to the baker’s returning to Germany is verifiable from the Record:]
