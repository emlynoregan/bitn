Weather.  In a nine day period Burra has had 153 points of rain and snow.  This was accompanied by high winds.  The cold snap was the worst for 50 years.  Snow fell last week on Wednesday, Thursday & Friday.  The fall on Wednesday morning lightly covered roofs and hills and falls continued intermittently throughout the day.  On Thursday the town was still snow covered and there was another fall on Friday morning and occasional falls into Friday night.  Rain in between falls meant that it did not accumulate to any great depth.  Mt Bryan was covered in white and the thaw brought many local creeks down in bankers.  [Some recollections of the 1901 fall are printed.]
