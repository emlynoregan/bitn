Burra’s Victory Day Celebration

People turned out in force despite the inclement weather on Monday last week.

Persons from all the services marched from the old RSL Clubrooms at 11 a.m. led by ‘John Bull’ Mr Jack Allen, who has been filling this role for more years than most can remember.

Mr Lindsay Thomas led the returned servicemen, followed by representatives of all patriotic bodies and the pupils of Burra and Copperhouse schools.

The route went from the RSL rooms to the Hospital and back to the Memorial in Market Square, where a short Thanksgiving Service was conducted by Revs Barrett and Hobbs.

Mr L.H. Thomas placed a wreath on behalf of the RSL and Mayor T.H. Woollacott placed one for the people of the town.

There was an adjournment to Victoria Park for a picnic lunch – the weather saw many people enjoying themselves in the shelter of their vehicles.

Children’s sports followed.  Despite a short rain break, these were completed as scheduled, but the Lightning Basketball Championship had to be abandoned in the rain.

Mr R.C. Lott had organised and had charge of the fireworks and had hoped the trench mortars set up on the school hill would land their ‘lions and tigers’ on the oval, but when the rockets exploded at their zenith the wind caught them and carried the object to and beyond Brewery Hill.  Nevertheless some youngsters pursued the rockets for miles to retrieve the remains of the effigies – and returned wringing wet.

The football match, whose results were printed last week, was a good game.

No fireworks could be obtained for the evening – though strangely enough they were available for city celebrations.

The Thanksgiving Service on Sunday night featured a combined choir of 45 under the baton of Mr W.H. Gare with Mr Clem Davey as accompanist.  Rev. Hobbs gave the address.  Not many attended, perhaps because it followed the ordinary church services on a cold and blustery night.
