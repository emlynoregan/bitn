Ulooloo Diggings.  Frank Parrington writes from Port Wallaroo regarding Ulooloo.  A fortnight ago when he left there fewer than 100 people counting women and children remained.  When the greatest rush took place there were about 200 at the ground.  A little while ago the English, Scottish & Australian Bank had bought 200 oz of Ulooloo gold.  Since then allow for 50 oz more, which Parrington thought unlikely, this would mean about £940 worth had been won.  Divide this among the hundreds who have been there over 16 months and see what wages they have won.  It takes a lot of silver to find gold.  Those who go were better to prospect for it than to work in a place already worked out.  He says ‘I was there since Christmas, and made wages for two months out of the five, and in the other three months I did not earn salt, but was paying out of pocket for cartage.’
