The Redruth Guild Diamond Jubilee luncheon was attended by about 100 people.  It was a luncheon and musical afternoon and as it was to be the Guildâ€™s final gathering before closure, it was attended by many former ministers and their wives.  Redruth Wesleyan Church was established in 1851, but later demolished.  A second church was built in 1857 and the present building was erected in 1874.  When Burra became a town with just one Methodist Church, the services were held at the Kooringa Church, but the Guild continued for many years, finding fellowship and raising funds for the church.  The final act of the Guild will be to donate its funds to the renovation of the Redruth Church so it can be used as a worship centre for the Redruth Camping Centre or for a museum.  Reta Jennison was the Guild Secretary for some 52 years and then became President up to its final meeting.  The Guild has been operating for 61 years.
