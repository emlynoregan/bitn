Burra Swimming Pool

At the last Council meeting Cr Dow asked why no steps had been taken to raise money.

The Mayor said the plans had to be drawn up by a competent draughtsman and Mr Bednall was making arrangements to issue the debentures.

Cr Dow still wanted to know why there was no action.

The Mayor was given leave to explain by reading relevant sections of the Local Government Act, particularly Section 425 requiring that a proposal to issue debentures or raise money be preceded by a statement of the proposed expenditure with plans, specifications and estimates to be drawn up and made available for ratepayers to inspect and notice of the proposal be given in the Government Gazette and local papers for a period of not less than one month.

Some other technicalities of the Act were discussed and after further bickering between Crs Dow & Riggs, the latter moved that tenders be called, but he was ruled out of order.

The Mayor then read the specifications from a rough draft and after further discussions these and the estimate of Â£400 were adopted.
