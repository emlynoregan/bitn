Redruth Court, 20 July.

Mr Queale was charged with having a stray cow on 21 June.  He challenged the date, declaring he was home all day on the 21st as it was the day of the railway accident and the cow was not straying.  This so confused the matter that it was dismissed.  No one present noticed that the railway accident actually occurred on the 20th!  Whether Mr Queale knew that remains a moot point.

Henry Seaford was charged with mutilating a copy of the magazine Graphic at the Institute, but got off as no one actually quite saw him do it, or could swear the magazine was not previously cut, and the bench ruled there was no more than a very strong suspicion.

[The most amazing aspect of this whole case is that both sides had briefed counsel and the report of it extends for c. 1½ columns.]
