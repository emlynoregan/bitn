Editorial on Our Trees.

Several trees in Jubilee Avenue have been broken down and others near The Mill.  Police are investigating.  Tree planting began about 1884 and has made great headway since then.  Much money has been expended and we should all take a deep interest in preserving the trees.  The unsuitable soil in Redruth No. 2 Reserve has seen trees make poor headway there, nevertheless Redruth and Aberdeen have many other nice trees and some small reserves are doing well.  Jubilee Avenue is progressing well.  We would like to see both sides of the road planted.

In Kooringa the best area is around the Brewery and towards the school.

Mr Lockyer’s trees in the Brewery Yard are among the best in town.  We are sorry to see some persons have no better object in view than the breaking down of trees - as in Thames St a few weeks ago and between Redruth and Kooringa last week.  The response was quick and soon £5 was offered to get a black tracker in to find the guilty.
