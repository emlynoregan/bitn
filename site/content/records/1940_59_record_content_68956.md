Burra Primary School

The Welfare Club and School Committee are to have a Â£1,000 lunch room erected at the school.  The committees will raise half the sum needed.  The room will be 50 ft x 20 ft and be of concrete bricks with a wood and iron roof.  It is proposed to place it in the northeast corner of the playing area. At present children only have use of an open shed, or in wet weather, a classroom, which prevents proper airing of the room.  Actions to raise the money will begin at once.
