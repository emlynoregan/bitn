Explosion.  On Tuesday a lad, Fred Voumard [16], was attending to the street lamps in Thames St when an explosion at the generator badly burned his face.  Fortunately it seems his eyes have not been damaged.  A younger brother who was on the ladder lighting the lamp was hurled to the ground, but was unhurt.  The lamp was also intact.
