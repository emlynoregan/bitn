New Kerbside Collection System

The state governments move to reduce the number of landfill sites and encourage recycling will soon see the closure of local rubbish sites in the district.  The Goyder Council will introduce an additional bin to allow for recyclable material to be collected fortnightly.  The service charge for rubbish collection will increase from $90 to $158 p.a.  This compares with $160 for Clare and $130 for the Wakefield Regional Council (which is closer to the landfill site).  All seven landfill sites in the Council area will be closed and capped and transfer stations will be established at Burra, Eudunda and Hallett.  The household waste will be collected weekly in the new red top 140-litre bin and the larger bin currently in use will become the recycle bin.  The new bin will be delivered (without charge) in mid-June.
