Accident.  A drawbar coupling a truck to a semi-trailer broke when it was on Moonlight Hill allowing the semi-trailer to roll backwards down the hill.  With no brakes it mounted a three foot embankment and came to rest 70 yards inside Eberhard’s paddock.  The semi had broken down on the way from Morgan and was being towed to Pt Augusta.  It has now been decoded to effect repairs on the spot.
