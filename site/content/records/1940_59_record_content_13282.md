One Market Day a Month

The editor writes a strongly worded protest against the decision of the Rural Industries Division (run by Dr A.R. Callagan) of the Department of War Organisation to award Burra just one market day a month instead of the present two.  This, he says, is a good way to kill country towns and the arguments in favour of it – saving travel - won’t eventuate either.  100 buyers will come on one day rather than 50 on each of two days as now.  Will it save manpower?  No, it will take twice the manpower to draft 2,000 sheep once a month as it takes now to draft 1,000 fortnightly.  Against it also is the lack of locomotive power on the broad gauge which will see animals hanging around and being cared for well after the sale day and arriving in a poorer condition at the abattoirs.  So, protest to State & Federal representatives, to the War Organisation Department, to the Agents’ Assoc., to head offices of stock firms and to the Stockowners’ Assoc.  Other towns have fought such reductions and won.  So can Burra.
