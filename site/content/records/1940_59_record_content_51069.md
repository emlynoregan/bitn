The 5th Choral Society Concert at the Burra Town Hall on 29 June drew only a small attendance despite presenting a program of high standard and having some of Adelaide’s best as visiting artists.  The program was well presented within the limitations imposed by numbers and the soloists were excellent.  The small attendance is discouraging and it would be a pity if lack of patronage limits such visits and occasions.
