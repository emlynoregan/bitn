The Mid North Local Government Association held a meeting recently.  Mayor Woollacott was a delegate and spoke strongly about the government muddle over the demobilisation process.  On all sides they heard of shortages of homes, neglect of roads and bridges, shortages of supplies and lack of materials, but thousands of men in the forces had jobs to go to and could not be discharged because of a ridiculous points system instituted by the army.  A man with four years’ service and a job to go to with 99 points could not be released, but a man with five years’ service and no job to go to could be released.  The whole process needed speeding up and the senseless red tape needed cutting.
