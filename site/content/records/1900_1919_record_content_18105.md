The Corricks attracted a great deal of excitement with people assembling on the steps before 7 p.m. by which time at least 200 people were present.  Sales of 1/- tickets were suspended at 7.20 and 2/- ones at 7.40 when there was no more seating available.  Forms were set in the aisle and right up to the stage.  People crammed like sardines onto the wings of the stage and many were turned away.  The program was intensely funny and particularly refined.  Monday saw another bumper audience.  Mr Chris Young convulsed the audience both nights.
