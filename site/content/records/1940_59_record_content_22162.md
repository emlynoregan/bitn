The Burra centenary Committee is endeavouring to get the SA Police Band to attend the opening day of the centenary celebrations.

The Burra Institute has been taken over by the Town Council.  A couple of signatures all that is needed now to finalise the transfer.  At the Red Cross Ball on Friday night the Mayor said that it was probably the last function to be held in the Burra Institute whilst the hall was owned by the Burra Institute Committee.  Discussions concerning the transfer have been going on for some years and the unravelling of the red tape involved has taken several months and is not yet quite complete.

Last night Mr A.B. Riggs as President of the Institute Committee and Secretary to the Trustees, waited upon the Town Council and produced the Deed of Conveyance, to which the Mayor and the Town Clerk affixed their signatures and the Council Seal.  The Trustees of the Institute had already affixed their signatures.  The document set out that the Council would take over the management and assets connected with the building from 1 July and the necessary transfer of the property and the finalising of the whole business would take place at the end of the current quarter â€“ 30 September.
