Cr Riggs congratulated the overseer and staff on the work done at Gully’s Wharf, but he felt that it should not all be borne by the North Ward as the bridge would be used by the whole town, especially in view of the new showgrounds.  The cost, including approaches was c. £85.  Consideration of his point was deferred.
