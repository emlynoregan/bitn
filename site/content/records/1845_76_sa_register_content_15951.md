Mr Thomas Waterhouse, who has just returned to the colony, was appointed to the Board in place of Mr J.C. Boord, who had resigned preparatory to his departure for England.

At an extraordinary general meeting that followed the ordinary meeting the Directors were given permission to dispose of their mineral lands not presently in use.

We are sure that our readers will be gratified, with ourselves, at the continued prosperity of the Burra Burra Mines.
