Obituary.  Mrs Thomas Keys who died on 10 October had been thought to be getting better when another heart attack supervened.  She was born at Bungaree near Clare on 7 April 1858, a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs T. Hutchins who in 1880 came with their family to Redruth.  She married Thomas Keys on 5 December 1889.  Mr Keys died some years ago.  She was an earnest Methodist and is survived by one son and three daughters: Cyril Keys (Hawthorn), Mrs C.L. Temperly (Queensland), Mrs J. Harvey (Aberdeen) & Miss Dorothy Keys (Aberdeen).  There are three grandchildren.
