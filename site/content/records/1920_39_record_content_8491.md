Robert Willshire writes as Hon. Sec. of the Aberdeen Football Club saying that instead of the half-truths uttered at the recent meeting of the Kooringa Football Club a full disclosure of the facts were made it would be seen that the blame lay with the Kooringa Club.

[He does not himself reveal what those ‘truths’ were.]
