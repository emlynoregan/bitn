Obituary.  Mr John Williams of Hampton died on 13 May.  He had been a lifelong townsman for almost 80 years and was keenly interested in minerals. He had been prospecting around the district for many years and although happy to show specimens of his finds, never disclosed their location.  He was born in Kapunda 19 July 1862 and came to Burra when quite young.  Later in life he married Miss Ada Lomman of Paradise and they lived at Hampton.  Five of a family of seven survive: Grace, Mrs H. Butt of Edithburgh; Mr Jack Williams; Dorothy, Mrs George Kakoschke; Olive, Mrs Fred Seaford, all of Burra North and Pte Darby Williams of the AMF.  There are ten grandchildren; eight boys and two girls.

[Born 19 July 1862, Light Bridge: died 13 May 1942, Burra.]
