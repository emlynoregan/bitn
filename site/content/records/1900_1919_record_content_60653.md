‘A Returned Soldier’ writes expressing disgust at Mr McLaren’s suggestion that a place to feast is a suitable memorial for the sacrifices made.  The remarks of ‘Esperanto’ he dismisses as an insult to a man’s intelligence and says most returned men support the Mayor’s idea of a monument in Market Square.
