Copperhouse School pupils visited the Exhibition in Adelaide on 6 May, with costs paid for by the School Welfare Club.  They travelled by the morning railcar, reaching Adelaide soon after 10 a.m. and got a good view of Adelaide from the roof of the Shell Building before proceeding to the Exhibition.
