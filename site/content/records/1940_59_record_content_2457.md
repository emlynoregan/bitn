Aberdeen Croquet Club.  Opening of the Hall on 22 June.

Mrs Gare gave the land and the hall, which she declared open.  The hall had been a stable and had been a gift from her father to Mrs Gare.  Mrs Gare had also had the room remodelled for use.  E.J. Davey as Town Clerk accepted the deeds into the Council’s safe keeping.  Trophies for the season were presented.

Open Handicap Singles	Mrs S.H. Robinson.

‘B’ Championship	Mrs D. Watson & Mrs J.G. Sara [?]

[Would seem to be a misprint for the next trophy.]

Doubles Handicap	Mrs D. Watson & Mrs J.G. Sara
