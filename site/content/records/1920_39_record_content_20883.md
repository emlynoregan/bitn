Obituary.  Kenneth Beaton aged 60 has died at Orange NSW without a will.  A call is made for any relatives as he was believed to have had a married sister in SA probably near Burra.  [If he was born in SA he seems likely to have been either Kenneth Beaton born 3 July 1866 in Adelaide to Roderick & Catherine nee McLachlan, or John Kenneth Beaton born 16 October 1867 at Sandergrove to Duncan & Jane nee Scott.  Neither suggests any obvious sister with a Burra connection.]
