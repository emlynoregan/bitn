J. Denton’s General Store at Farrell Flat closed its doors for the last time on 29 July 1983.  The store dated from the town’s earliest days.  In the late 1800s it was Reilly’s Store and then Sexton’s.  Mr J.O. Denton acquired it in 1907.  He also had a wheat store, now the Ford dealership.  Myra Przibilla (nee Denton) was the last shopkeeper.  She was born in the house attached to the store and has lived there since 1912.  There were seven children and all spent some of their early life at the shop.  It was a general store selling everything from paint to chaff and hardware and groceries.  For a time before 1915 the Post Office was also located there.  In 1957 service was reduced to three days a week until the store closed.  [Photo.]
