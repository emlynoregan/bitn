Fire partially destroyed the wash-house at John Drew’s in Kooringa on Monday.  The washing had been done and the fire removed.  Miss Drew was there for some time an hour later and a man from Drew & Crewes was there subsequently and neither saw or smelt any sign of fire.  It was well ablaze when found, but Mr Drew and his son Allen managed to put it out and prevent it spreading to the attached woodshed and coach-house.  Clothing and bedding to value of c. £25 was lost.
