Kooringa Weather.  Heavy rain has fallen in the past week and it has been unusually cold.  On Friday there was a severe fall of hail, which coated the streets and stayed long enough to give the inhabitants a feeling of winter in the midst of summer.  On Saturday rain fell in torrents and by 8 p.m. a formidable stream was again flowing down Commercial Street to the dismay and discomfort of residents in the business part of town.  On Saturday night it was rough and stormy and this did not abate till Sunday night.
