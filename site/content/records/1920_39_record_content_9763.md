Burra Town Council, 18 December

The local fire brigade asked for two poles to be erected for the drying of hoses.  No action was taken.

The assessment for 1923 was £10,711; about £300 more than for 1922.

A decision on the rates for 1923 was deferred.

Cr Kellaway said the deputation that had waited on the Council concerning establishing a Fire Brigade had said they could raise £200 from subscription, but only about £50 had been raised and the gap would be reflected in rates.  It was resolved to ask the deputation back for further discussion.
