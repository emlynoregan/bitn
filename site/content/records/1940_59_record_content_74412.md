Accident.  A car driven by Brian John Nankivell of Queen Street Burra ran into a horse and cart from behind at about 7 p.m. two miles south of Gawler on Saturday, 8 September.  Nankivell’s car then lurched across the road and came to rest with its front section resting on the bonnet of a car travelling in the opposite direction.  Nankivell’s car and the cart were almost totally wrecked and the other car extensively damaged.  Amazingly none of the people involved was seriously hurt. The other car was driven by Maxwell George Cadd of Angaston and the cart by Sydney Clare Draper (90) of Gawler.  The horse also escaped injury.
