Obituary.  Last Tuesday John Newcomb left The Gums Station with his two-year-old daughter for medical treatment, but before he reached Mr Bell’s place at Baldina the child died and his horse was knocked up.  On examining the child Dr Brummitt said she had suffered convulsions caused by falling on a bottle with which she had been playing.  About six weeks ago the family had been travelling through Baldina on foot in a terrible state, not having had food for several days.  They were helped by Mr Kiekebusch who fed them and took them to The Gums where Newcomb found work.
