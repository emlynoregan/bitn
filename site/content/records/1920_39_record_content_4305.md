Mrs George Cowan nee Eleanor (Nellie) Mary Lewis

There is an article of almost Â½ column on her service during the war and that of her husband.  He was Assistant Commissioner and later Commissioner of the Australian Trench Comforts Fund.  His wife was in India when war broke out and travelled to England with her brother Major Gilbert Lewis early in 1915.  She did voluntary work at Endsleigh Palace Hospital as a scullery maid, then at Eccleston Square Hospital as head cook.  Later she was a canteen worker in France and then took work in regimental canteens in England, rising to be an area superintendent (of whom there were only 12) and controlled about 300 canteens in southern command.  In France she had a Carnet Rouge which admitted her to the zone of the armies.
