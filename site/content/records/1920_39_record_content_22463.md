Obituary.  S. Lindsay G. (Joe) Halls died at Adelaide Hospital on 2 March.  He was the youngest son of Mrs Isabella Halls and the late T.P. Halls and was born in Burra in 1895.  After leaving school he and his brother carried on his father’s cab business and on the latter’s death managed the business for his mother.  He had a wonderful disposition and a generous and optimistic character.  About 18 months ago he slightly injured his arm and before he sought medical assistance blood poisoning set in and despite operations and the best medical care he finally died.  He married Miss Hilda Harry, 2nd daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John Harry of Kooringa, in 1919 and she is left with three little children, the youngest only a fortnight old.  He is also survived by his mother and sisters, Mrs C.J. Pearce (Snowtown) & Mrs Lindsay (Adelaide) and his only brother Mr Thomas Halls.

[Born Samuel Lindsay Gordon Halls 14 October 1896.]
