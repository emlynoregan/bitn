8 September

While the above inquest was being held a message came for the doctors that a fall of earth at the Mine had resulted in a man named Pryor sustaining a broken leg and smashed kneecap.

[See correction 13 September page 3.]

Business here is dull, but shearers are beginning to pass through on their way north and northeast.
