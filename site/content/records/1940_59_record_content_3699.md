Red Cross held a games evening at the Institute last Wednesday in conjunction with VSDs.  Games included 7 shots at Hitler’s or Goebbel’s head for 6d. [Presumably with a ball.]  There were also stalls for strawberries and cream, ice cream and a buffet supper.  A flag was sold on the Bugler System.  There was an ugly man competition and a whole series of competitions and guessing games.
