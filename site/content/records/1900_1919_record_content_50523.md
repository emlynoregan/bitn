Burra Town Council, Wednesday.

The Committee of the Burra Coronation Band asked permission to hand any instruments in good order to the Cheer-up Ladies’ Band and to dispose of the rest.  Granted.

A manufacturer has forwarded a specimen of a new acetylene streetlamp for trial – to be placed at the Mine Bridge.

T.A. Lewis writes complaining of the nocturnal depredations of stray cows in Aberdeen.

Cr Radford endorsed the complaint – he had seen two or three lambs actually tethered in one of the gardens there.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis wrote that Council must not remove further slag without an agreement.

E. Simpson requested a footbridge over the creek in George St. [Pig & Whistle crossing.]  The Councillors agreed it was needed, but there were no funds.

W.S. Pryor offered to light 20 lamps in Kooringa and Aberdeen at 2/- each per week.  Not accepted.  Applications will be called for at 30/- a week.

There was difficulty in getting men to raise [road] metal.

I.J. Warnes was thanked for presenting to the town an oil painting of the Burra Mine.

Condolences were sent to the Rule and Tiver families.
