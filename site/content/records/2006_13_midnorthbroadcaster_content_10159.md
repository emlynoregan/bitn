Mt Bryan Progress Association has managed the extraordinary feat of raising $30,000 in 6 months to enable the purchase of a community tractor and ride-on lawnmower.  Fundraising efforts realised $5,600.  The regional Council of Goyder provided $3,000 through the Capital Fund, $5,000 through the Sport & Recreation Fund and $3,000 from Ward Funds.  AGL gave a Community Fund Grant of $7,500.  Donations from around the district raised the rest.  The ride-on mower received funding from the Dept. of Families, Housing, Community Service and Indigenous Affairs with a grant of $2,990.  The tractor will be ‘put to good use maintaining grasses and other potential hazards’.  [Perhaps reducing other hazards?]  The Progress Association has done much for the small town since 1992.  The old railway yards have been beautified.  Toilets have been erected.  There is a new fire shed and the radio tower was transferred.  A sheltered barbecue area was formed with a gazebo with seating, mini golf and the planting of hundreds of plants.  Playground equipment from the former school was transferred to the roadside area after the school closed in 2001.  The area is used by locals for community events as well as by passing travellers.  There are plans for the development of the East Terrace ‘meeting house’, which was formerly the Mt Bryan Tennis Club.  It was repaired late in 2009 and is used for association meetings.  A shed has been erected to house equipment and it is intended to rehabilitate the tennis courts and mark them for multi-purpose use.  It is intended to create a recreation area there away from the highway for local children to use.  The small group of 11 people currently can be proud of its achievements.
