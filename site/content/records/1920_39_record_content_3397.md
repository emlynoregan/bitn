Burra Institute Committee, 14 February

Theatregraph proprietors have offered to provide a free picture night on the occasion of the re-opening of the hall.  The date is left in the hands of the President, Secretary and Mr Dane.

The gas plant is to be dismantled and sold.

Mr I.J. Warnes has offered 7/6 per chair for 176 blackwood chairs in the main hall.  To be delivered on the arrival of the new chairs.  Offer accepted.

[It would seem likely that Mr Warnes would have acted for the Leighton Hall.]
