Redruth Court, 4 October

Robert Oliver Robinson v. Francis Clifford Humphris for assault on 17 April 1922 in which the plaintiff’s jaw was broken in two places and he lost a quantity of blood resulting in a stay of one month in Burra Hospital and being unable to take solid food he lost weight and suffered other medical complications.  The injuries have resulted in permanent muscular damage and disfigurement.  He sought damages of £490.  The plea was not guilty on the grounds of self defence.

Dr Steele gave medical evidence of the nature of the injuries.

Robinson had an agreement with Humphris to work the former’s property in half shares (from 1 March 1922).  At Easter Robinson sold his property to G. Hawkes.  The defendant said Mrs Robinson told him he would get £250 compensation.

Robinson said Humphris had appeared to be well satisfied when Hawkes gave him a cheque for £250.

On 17 April after an exchange of comments about where the cows were grazing Humphris punched Robinson in the jaw twice and followed with several blows to the chest.  Robinson claimed not to have struck the defendant.

Under cross-examination Robinson clarified the position of who owned which cows, but maintained he had not struck Humphris; neither did he expect the defendant to buy back the 17 cows purchased from him at the same price of £15 per head.

D.J. Dullea, manager for Bennett & Fisher confirmed the evidence of the £250 compensation.

Christina E.E. Robinson, wife of the plaintiff gave corroborative evidence.

Humphris said he had accepted £250 compensation and a stack of hay and was quite satisfied.  He said the plaintiff had come and the first thing he had said was ‘Are you going to buy these cows?’  When the defendant said he would not at the same price he had received the plaintiff got angry and asked who left the gate open in the paddock.  He said the plaintiff rushed at him and hit him with a right hand that just grazed his eye.  He then struck back in self defence.  Plaintiff got up and rushed at the defendant again and the latter struck him again.  Defendant’s wife then ran between them and Mrs Robinson said, ‘Stop hitting my husband.’  Defendant’s wife said, ‘He hit mine first.’

Humphris denied threatening Dullea if he gave evidence and denied swearing.

Lily Victoria Humphris, wife of the defendant gave evidence in corroboration of her husband’s account.

Frederick H. Greenfield, farm assistant, gave evidence supporting Humphris.

The bench awarded £50 damages.

Mr Winnall for the defendant said there would be an appeal.

The SM said there could be no appeal as regardless of who struck the first blow the defendant’s own testimony showed he was unnecessarily violent.
