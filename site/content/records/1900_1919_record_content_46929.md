Bright & Bright sued T. Halls Senior for legal costs of £21-5-4, which arose out of a case that T. Halls Senior brought against T. Halls jnr for assault.  A dispute arose over which Mr Bright had been engaged – W.S. or T.R. – who had to come up from Adelaide.  Under all the circumstances the magistrate thought there should have been a written agreement and gave a verdict for £11-5-4 plus costs.
