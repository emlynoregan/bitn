Remembrance Day.  A crowd of about 150 including some 100 from BCS gathered at the War Memorial in Market Square on 11 November to pay their respects on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the armistice that ended WWI.  Rev. Michael Hillier conducted the service.  Burra RSL President laid the first wreath and others then followed.  Roger Cross placed historical documents in the rotunda including a list of the resting places of the fallen named on the memorial.  [3 photos.]
