Obituary & Inquest.  The adjourned inquest on George Ernest Steinert* was concluded on Tuesday.

Katherine Cameron, Matron of Burra Hospital, said he had arrived at 5.30 p.m. on 21 February from Terowie by train and Halls’s cab.  He said he had been staying at Sam Davis’s hotel.  He said his arm was bad and he thought he had been stung some five weeks earlier.  He had been drinking for three weeks.  Dr Sangster saw him the next morning and Dr Brummitt in the afternoon.  He was unmarried and aged c. 40.

Dr Sangster said his arm was in a state of mortification and death was inevitable.

Dr Brummitt said he had been away the previous day and when he got back late at night the message from the hospital had not indicated any urgency.  When he did see the patient his arm was in such a state that it is extremely unlikely anything could have been done for him on admission.  Could find no cause for the state of his arm.

There is extensive evidence running for two columns, much of it concerning the deceased’s time in Terowie.

It concluded he died from blood poisoning, probably aggravated by very intemperate habits.  He had been at the Terowie Hotel from Friday to Tuesday and not three weeks as he had stated.  No blame is attached to the hotel manager who sent him to hospital as soon as he complained of his arm.

[* Note that oddly enough in his registration of death his name is given as George Ernest Hennett, aged 45, labourer of Terowie.]
