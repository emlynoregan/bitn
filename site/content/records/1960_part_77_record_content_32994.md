Burra National Trust met at the Mayor’s Parlour on Wednesday and discussed the future of the Redruth Gaol.  The building stands on 8 acres of Crown Land and until recently was the property of the Gaols & Prisons Department.  The Lands Department has agreed to give the Wardenship of the building and grounds to a local body.  The Burra Town Council and the National Trust have both been interested in preserving and partially restoring this fine example of early SA architecture.  It has long been an attraction to tourists and without any local authority having responsibility for it has been subject to an increasing amount of vandalism.  The meeting decided it was best regarded as a joint undertaking of the National Trust and Council.  The Council should be the body to approach the Lands Department and it was also in the best position to approach the Tourist Bureau for financial help.  The fate of other historic buildings in the town came under discussion.  Tourist interest in the town is rapidly increasing.  Burra is fortunate not to have become subject to ruthless changes and remains a rare example of a town whose history can readily be traced by any exploring visitor.  Its tourist potential is great, but is only gradually being realised.

The Gaol was erected in 1852 at a cost of £3040 and occupied in 1853.  It was the first Gaol outside of Adelaide and served the whole of the north for many years.  It could hold about 30 prisoners.  The first gaoler was Mr Thomas Perry, who was paid £168 p.a.  There was also a turnkey and a warder.  ‘It remained a Gaol well into this century when for a few years it became a Girls’ Reformatory.’

[This information is incorrect.  The Gaol was built in 1856 and operated until 1894.  In 1897 it was refurbished as a Girls’ Reformatory and had this role until 1922.]
