Repeal of the Nock’s Act. [After Mr Campbell’s speech re the repeal of the Nock’s Act he was reported in the Advertiser in a scathing and scurrilous way.] 
There was a large meeting at the Inst. on Wednesday to hear Mr Campbell’s reply to the attack on him. 150 were present and the Mayor was in the chair. Campbell had been grossly insulted and attacked and the paper’s tone had sadly deteriorated since the death of John Henry Barrow and William Harcus. Campbell said it was not a question of whether he or the Advertiser was better at trading insults, the principle was much more important. He felt that the liquor trade could be wisely and well regulated. The Advertiser wanted to go back to open slather on the grounds of ‘liberty of the subject’. The editorial writer also sheltered behind his anonymity and the privileges of the press. He had been charged with irreligion and unfitness for ministerial office and dragging in the mire the religion of meekness, charity and love. 
The Advertiser had said since the Nock’s Act Sunday drinking had doubled, Sunday drunkenness had doubled and the old way was, by comparison, paradise. But no statistics to support these allegations were available. It was useless to look at figures of five years ago for comparison. Since then there had been a large population increase. [This and much more.]
