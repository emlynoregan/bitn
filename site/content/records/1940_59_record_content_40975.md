Anzac Sports on Saturday saw record gate takings of £113, up from last year’s £83.  Eight speed cars attended.  Because of dust the car races were transferred to the racing track.  The female impersonators in the Dar Devil Cycle Race were Messrs A.L. Bence, L. Phillips, Bill Kotz, R. Burchell & T.C.A. Radford.  Mr Radford was the winner with R. Burchell best dressed.  The evening dance was also very successful.  Results a re printed.
