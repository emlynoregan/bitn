Hanson Memorial Hall (From the secretary)

Several meetings have been held about a Soldiers’ Memorial Hall at Hanson.  Moves began in 1922 and money began to be raised.  They now had £172.  A few weeks ago it was considered there was enough to consider erection.  On 8 July plans and specifications and quotations for prices were tabled and it was clear there was every possibility of proceeding.  Messrs Fendler and Pattullo drew up a proposed constitution and presented it at a meeting on 4 August.  The constitution and rules were adopted.  The objects are to erect a hall to the memory of the soldiers who fell in the Great War, to establish a library and provide other means of education and physical entertainment.  Membership will be 2/6 p.a.  A committee of seven will run the hall.  A general meeting will soon be called to elect officers, the committee, etc.
