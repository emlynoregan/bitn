Envoy R. Winfield left Burra this morning.  He has rendered great service while in charge of the Salvation Army here and been active in patriotic causes.  We understand he leaves due to ill health.  He is succeeded by Lieut. O.M. Hateley, who is a young lady officer who originally comes from Victoria, but has recently been at Prospect.
