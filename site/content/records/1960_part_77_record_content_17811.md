Burra Hospital

Plans for a new private room wing have been drawn up and examined by the Board last week.  The plans are for four private rooms, matron’s office and a secretary-manager’s office.  The building would make the hospital more compact and easier to run.  The cost of the new proposal is estimated at £15,000.  Government subsidy is available on a two for one basis and an appeal has been launched to raise the £5,000 needed.  It would be a continuation of the present Women’s Ward, extending out and beyond the men’s yard, with a verandah.  It would have an entrance hall between it and the Women’s Ward.  It would harmonise aesthetically with the Women’s Ward and would improve the overall ‘semmetry’ [sic] of the hospital with a balanced frontage and common entrance for visitors.

Donations to date: £372-10-0.
