LAC R.M. (Ross) Humphrys was given a farewell recently.  The Mayor presented him with the usual gift and Mrs Scroop presented a Comforts parcel.  Mr Woollacott said it was not a pleasure to say farewell to these boys of 18 when it was remembered they were going to fill the places of other lads who had fallen or been discharged.  He wished Ross Godspeed and a safe return.
