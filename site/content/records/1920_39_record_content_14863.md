Obituary.  Mrs Thomas Read died at Burra Hospital on 13 January.  She was born at Liskard Cornwall in 1841 and arrived in SA aged 22 in the Addment in 1863.  She came directly to Burra to the home of her uncle the late Captain Killicoat.  She married Thomas Read who carried on dairying on the south side of Kooringa.  Mr Read died some years ago.  She leaves one daughter, Mrs Frank Griffiths, and three grandsons.  There are also a number of step-children.  [She was Mary, but too many Marys married a man named Thomas Read in Kooringa to identify her further.]
