Steve Symons Managing Director of Roaring 40s writes to correct inaccuracies in the recent article ‘Wind Farm Debt No Surprise’:

Roaring 40s is a 50-50 joint venture between Hydro Tasmania and Asia-Pacific energy business CLP.  Roaring 40s does not have an outstanding debt to either and the venture has a solid financial foundation.  I also deny the statement that we have never turned a profit because of disappointing wind speeds.  As a new venture any surplus funds have been reinvested as is normal practice.  A profit was not expected in the first five years.  This year we expect to break even.  Though wind speeds have been revised the Roaring 40s projects remain world-class.  The Waterloo Farm is performing strongly and produces enough energy to power more than 46,000 homes and will result in about 300,000 tons of CO2 being abated annually.  I also reject any suggestions that environmental impacts are not carefully considered.
