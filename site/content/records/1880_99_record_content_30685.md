Burra Town Council, 10 December 1888.

‘Gentlemen - Circumstances have arisen since I accepted the position of Mayor of the town which have caused me to determine on resigning the same.  Therefore I beg to place my resignation in your hands.

I am faithfully yours,

P.L. Killicoat’

Cr Rabbich moved acceptance subject to Clause 54 of the Act.

It was well known that the resignation was due to a personal feeling against one of the councillors newly elected.  That person [Cr Sampson] had several years under ex-Mayors and been elected at the head of the poll for the extraordinary vacancy and under these circumstances the resignation was an insult to the ratepayers.  Under the Act the Mayor was subject to a fine and he felt they should let the law take its course.

The Town Clerk said the Mayor was anxious not to put the town to any expense and would pay the cost of a new election.

Cr Hardy 2nd the motion and felt the action contempt of Council and of the ratepayers.

Cr O’Leary moved an amendment that acceptance depend on the Mayor paying the cost of the election, but he did not feel a further penalty should be applied.

Cr Sampson said such an undertaking had not been given in writing.

The Town Clerk said he would personally guarantee the cost of the election.

Cr Sampson then said the action showed the ignorance of the Mayor and proved that the affairs of the Council had been bungled as alleged at the ratepayers’ meeting.  The full penalty allowed by law should be imposed.

Cr O’Leary wanted to know on what authority Cr Rabbich relied for stating that Cr Sampson was the cause of the resignation.

Cr Rabbich referred to a conversation he had had with the Town Clerk, but was not very specific in his answer.  He felt the question of penalty must be left till afterwards.

The chairman ruled the amendment out of order as the fine could only be remitted on subsequent application.  The amendment was withdrawn.  Motion carried.

Nominations for the position of Mayor will close 24 December.

The election, if required, will be on 31 December.

Cr Sampson moved that the Town Clerk inform the Mayor of the condition of acceptance and that he might apply for remission of all or part of the fine if he thought fit.

The Town Clerk estimated the income for the year at c. £820.

There was a debt of £270, bonds of £200 and interest of £120 plus salaries and office expenses.  The health account had a debt of £80 and the parklands a credit of £50.
