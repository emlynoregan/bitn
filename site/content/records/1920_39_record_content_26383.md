Burra Town Council, 2 April

There was a request from the Vacuum Oil Co. forwarding plans for the erection of an oil depot which the company proposed erecting on a block opposite the Bon Accord Hotel.  Approved.

A petition was presented from Frank Treloar and 19 other ratepayers asked for horehound to be cut, the gutters to be cleaned out and other work to be done in Kangaroo & Queen Streets.

Cr Riggs thought it was not in order and should not be received.

Cr Allen was offended that the matters raised had not first been brought to the attention of West Ward Councillors.

The Mayor ruled the petition in order.

Cr Collins concurred with Cr Allen.

Cr Riggs said the petition was only able to be received when signed by a member [of Council] and presented by one.

The Mayor stood firm saying the Town Clerk had presented it and he was in a sense a member of the Council.  Crs Woollacott & Pearce moved it be received.

The Mayor agreed that the petition was a slur on the Ward Councillors and those presenting it should have known that the correct thing was first to approach their representatives.

It was received on the casting vote of the Mayor.

A petition was presented signed by Mrs Sara and 17 ladies asking for the use of a certain portion of land to the left of Gully’s Wharf after crossing the creek from Aberdeen, for use as a croquet lawn.

Received.

The Mayor said he and Mrs Sara had inspected the block near Mrs Reed’s residence.  The site was well suited and there was a little unclaimed block and the Council would have to close two bits of useless roads.

Cr Riggs thought the whole Council should inspect the site as it would involve two roads permanently and that could be awkward in the future.

Cr Woollacott moved the request be granted.

The Town Clerk said the Council could charge rental for a lease on the unclaimed allotment or collect rates on it.  The roads had not been used for 70 years.

Cr Riggs continued to be concerned about the road closures and Crs Pearce & Collins were unsure about there being sufficient space.

An inspection was set for 7 a.m. the next day with the request to be granted if the inspection was favourable.

Mr Lomman of Aberdeen was permitted to erect a motor garage.

200 yards of metal are to be raised for the Railway Station Road to ease the unemployment.
