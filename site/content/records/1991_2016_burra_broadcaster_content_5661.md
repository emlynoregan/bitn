Australia Day Breakfast

The J150 Chair, Mrs Robyn Page launched the Jubilee 150 year.

The breakfast was sponsored by the Burra Burra DC and organised by members of the Burra Traders’ Association.  Council Deputy Chairman Mr John Quinn introduced special guests and welcomed the crowd of about 350.  Mr Barry Wakelin Federal MP for Grey presented the Citizen of the Year Award to Graham Kellock and Daphne Lines accepted the Certificate for Event of the Year on behalf of the cratering group for the Riley Car Club Visit.  Mr Wakelin also cut the Australia Day Cake prepared by Colleen Spackman.  Members of the bush band, the Wild Matildas who were staying at Paxton Cottages, supplied music for the breakfast.
