‘A Shareholder’s Friend’ writes a letter addressed to the Shareholders of the Burra Burra Mine.

Burra Burra Mines, 11 October 1848

Are you fully aware of your present position and have you seriously reflected on it?

You know that work here has completely ceased and that must defer your next dividend.  Has the present reduction in wages been made on your suggestion and by your consent, or is it simply the partial decision of the Directors?  If it is the latter are you satisfied to see your capital idle?  If so gentlemen, I would like to arouse you from your lethargy.  A great many of the usual expenses are still being incurred and yet not a hammer-blow of work is going on.  Furthermore it is likely that surface work will also cease in a week or two.  Should the water whims also cease stop and consider the consequences as the water rises.  The losses then would run into some thousands of pounds.

The salaries of your officers are continuing with not a penny of income to meet those expenses.  Is all this occurring with the consent of the majority of shareholders?  If it is not, then a public meeting of shareholders is an imperative.  Also, gentlemen be aware that at this very time some of your most practical miners and their families are leaving for New Zealand and other parts.  Can we expect our commissioners to keep sending us emigrants when we absolutely deny them even a comfortable living after their arrival and can the editor of this paper continue to offer his advice in favour of immigration?
