Burra Swimming Pool Opened
A large crowd attended in perfect weather to see Mr G. Stanley Hawker open the Burra Swimming pool free of debt.  At about 3 p.m. the President of the Committee welcomed all present and thanked all those who had donated cash, materials and labour and announced that the pool could be opened free of debt, due to the recent arrival of a Government subsidy cheque.  There were still things they needed â€“ a filtration plant could be added later.  Mr Topsfield was glad to see the presence of Mr & Mrs R.G. Jeffery (now of Clare), who had been holidaying at Port Broughton.  Mr Jeffery had done a wonderful job as Secretary etc. towards Burra obtaining such a fine asset.  Mr & Mrs Shaw were present too.  Mr Shaw had been the architect for the pool.  Mr Hawker was then asked to open the pool.  Mr Roy Jeffery moved a vote of thanks to Mr Hawker, whom he said had always been ready to assist as MP for the district.

[The editor said that when Mr H. Quirke took over as MP for the district he too had given what assistance he could.]

Mayor Baulderstone also spoke of the wonderful way the pool transformed this section of the creek bank and beautified the whole area.  He listed some who had given much assistance like H.C. Cummins and Keith Spackman.

Mrs Hawker presented the Learn to Swim Campaign Certificates.

The official party had afternoon tea in the Town Hall.  The committee presented Mr Shaw with a silver tray for his services.

[The results of the carnival that followed are then printed.]
