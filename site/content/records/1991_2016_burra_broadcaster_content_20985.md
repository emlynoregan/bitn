Sealing the Roads

Burra traders Association met with Council representatives on 9 December to discuss sealing the Kooringa Road and the Heavy Vehicle Detour.  They spoke in support of their petition calling for the sealing of the Kooringa road to take precedence.  Chairman Howard Matson said they had read with some alarm that Council gave the sealing of Kooringa Road a low priority.  While the sealing of the Detour would reduce custom for the town, the sealing of Kooringa Road was likely to increase it.  Council re-iterated its contention that the detour should be sealed by Transport SA.  The Heritage Advisory Committee supported the move to get funding for the sealing of the Detour.  At a meeting of Council since 9 December it was resolved to forward a submission to the Local Roads Advisory Committee for the reclassification of the Detour from rural local to rural arterial.  Secondly the Director of Operations will investigate the costs of sealing the Kooringa Road, to be considered as part of the Local Road Sealing Priority List.
