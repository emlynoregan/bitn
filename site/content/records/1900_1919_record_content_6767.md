Obituary.  The death is announced of Mr John McDonald. [Corrected in the next issue to Mr Donald McDonald.]  The deceased was returning from delivering a message to The Gums Station and called at the residence of Mr W. Hills to get some furniture.  He could not then ride in the cart and so walked along side.  He got food at O’Brien’s on Sunday 26 October about 6.30 p.m. and then apparently fell over an embankment in the dark.  Search parties set out on Sunday, but failed to find him.  [Apparently this was on 2 November.]  On Monday Mr J.C. Sandland found the body, much decomposed after one week.  He is believed to have been washed about 100 yards down the creek by recent rain.  His horse travelled on about a further 1½ miles with a dog before coming to grief in Baldina Creek, where it may have lived until drowned in heavy rains on Friday night.  The flow from which half covered it with sand.  McDonald was aged c. 58 and was well known in the district, having worked on both Caroona and The Gums and been employed on several holdings as a boundary rider and general hand.
