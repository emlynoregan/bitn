Mr Rosewall said that except for G. Grubb all the other Aberdeen players had turned the trip down due to injuries, but they thenal took part in a match on the same day at Kooringa against the Old Buffers.

The general feeling of the delegates was that Aberdeen had served the Association poorly.

There was a letter from the Secretary of the Aberdeen Club refusing to play again under Umpire Harris and complaining of the roughness allowed in their last match.

The Chairman said that Mr Harris had been appointed to umpire and according to the rules the appointment had to stand.  He agreed that as a spectator he had judged the game to be rough.

Mr Read of Farrell’s Flat said his side disagreed and was quite satisfied with the umpire.

After much discussion the opinion was that if Aberdeen refused to play they would have to pay the fines etc. as per the rules.

It was also stated that Aberdeen had no wish to forfeit.

Mr Bevan an Aberdeen delegate said he would try to get his club to reconsider.  They did not allege Umpire Harris was unfair, but that he allowed players too much latitude.

The letter was received, but the contents were not entertained.
