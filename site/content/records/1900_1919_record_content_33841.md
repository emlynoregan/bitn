Note.  Although there was no other printed announcement, this was the first issue to bear the legend ‘Printed & published by the Proprietor E.F. Marston.’  There was no editorial comment either by Davey concerning his departure or by Marston about his acquisition of the paper.  The ‘Topics in General’ column which starts the news reverted to an earlier habit of omitting headings and of moving confusingly from one topic to the next unannounced.  This was a practice resumed elsewhere in the paper as well.  (In this issue column 7 on page 2 offers examples.)
