Obituary.  The late Mrs George Schwier, who died on 28 April, was, before her marriage, Miss Harriet Hall, daughter of Mr & Mrs James Hall, who were among the first settlers on the Mongolata country.  She was born at Little Para on 2 October 1861 from where her parents went to Paratoo, where they lived for three years.  They there weathered the big drought of the early 1860s.  They then came to Aberdeen before moving to a property at Firewood creek, north of Burra.  From there she walked each Sunday to attend the old Church of England on Limestone Hill (since demolished).  About 1877 her father took up land at Mongolata and they moved there.  He retained it till his death.  In 1884 she married George Schwier, who was then the boss of a Government rabbit camp.  Later they kept a store at Aberdeen near the White Hart Hotel.  Here their eldest son, Mr J.H. Schwier, was born.  When Broken Hill started to boom Mr & Mrs Schwier went there and stayed till 1893, when they returned to Mongolata and settled on Mr Schwier’s father’s property.  They also acquired more land.  The old home is still retained.  In 1924 Mrs Schwier, who was then a widow, came to reside in Kooringa, leaving the property to her sons.  [Mr George Schwier died in 1916.]  She was a regular attender at St Mary’s Church until her last illness.  She is survived by three sons and three daughters: James H. Schwier, Phil Schwier, Cyril Schwier, Miss Mabel Schwier, Miss Ethel Schwier and Mrs J. O’Loughlin of Kilkenny.  There are four grandchildren.
