Aberdeen Croquet Club.  The lawn was cut for the first time on 8 December and it looked very good.  A busy bee did good work.  R. Fuss has now finished the pavilion and club rooms.  E. Steer will now paint the roof red and the woodwork white.  J.G. Sara will kalsomine the walls.  J.G. Wardle will oil the shelter-shed.  F.M. Pearce has carted to the place furniture bought recently from the Mine.  Formal handing over to the Burra Town Council is fixed for the third Saturday in February.
