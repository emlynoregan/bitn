Burra Town Council is considering a superannuation scheme for Council employees.  Council would have to find a sum equal to 3½% of wages and employees would contribute 3½% of their salary, with benefits payable at 65.  The benefit in a lump sum taxable at 5% for the year it was received only.  The problem being considered is that the payout would prevent recipients from getting the aged pension.  There seems to be no incentive in saving up for an independent old age.
