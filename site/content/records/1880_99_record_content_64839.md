The Burra Show was a financial success.  The previous show was held in 1896: the poor season in 1897 having caused the cancellation of that show.  The show last Wednesday was good in some classes, but there was a lack of interest in others.  The committee fought hard to overcome some stubborn problems to make this show a success and they are to be congratulated. Agricultural produce this time was far better.  Dairy produce was conspicuous by its absence, but the last 12 months have been most adverse and lost stock will take two or three years to replace.  Poultry entries, though down on last show in numbers were of a high standard.  Draught stock was not up to previous standards, again due to a bad 1897 season.  Blood and roadster stock was not well represented.  Cattle were moderately represented, but dogs were to the fore.  Large owners of sheep were not represented.  (Koonoona was absent, though previously it had scooped the pool.)  But the Gebhardt Bros did well.  This time there were six entries from the saltbush country for the first time.  Vegetables, fruit and flowers were similar to 1896.  Cookery, arts and industries were up to expectations.  W.J. Richards displayed a variety of bicycles.

There were the usual sideshows and Professor Felton was there too.  Messrs F. Harris and F. Gebhardt supplied refreshments and H. Muggee an excellent lunch for the Governor who arrived by the midday train with the Hon. L. O’Loughlin, Minister for Crown Lands and the Hon. J. Lewis.  They were met at the station by the Mayor, Mr J. Sampson, Mr E.C. Lockyer (Chairman of the DC) and P.L. Killicoat, President of the Burra and North-Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural and Pastoral Society.  The lunch produced the usual speeches and toasts.  An address was presented to the Governor who responded appropriately.  Two years ago on his visit to Burra he had received news of the death of Mr Gillen and this morning came news of the death of Sir George Grey, one of the earliest Governors of SA.  In the afternoon the Vice-Regal party travelled to Princess Royal where they were guests of Mr A. McCulloch, leaving on Thursday afternoon for Adelaide after visiting several public institutions in the town.

The prize list is then printed.
