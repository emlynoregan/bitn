A Local Credit Union?

Members of the community in Burra and Eudunda have expressed an interest in establishing a credit union in the district.  Representatives met with:

Brian Hawson of the Credit Union Services Corporation

Tony Randell of SA Office of Financial Supervision

Goyder Councilâ€™s Finance Committee.

It would be possible to set up a credit union, but would require a commitment from residents and many towns have found it easier to get an existing credit union to come in.  Meeting on this matter will be held in Burra Town Hall on 27 August and Eudunda District Hall on 28 August.
