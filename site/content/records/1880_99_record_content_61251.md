[The exchange continued somewhat longer.]

Mr West was the only candidate present to give an account of his stewardship.  He said the accounts spoke well for the economic management of the Council.  The year had been a peaceful one and the Mayor and Councillors had worked harmoniously together.

The Mayor said he had reluctantly consented to stand again.  The next year would see them out of debt and then rates might be reduced.  His action with respect to the wood was the same as it would have been had he been dealing with it in private life.  This coming year would assuredly be his last in office.  He apologised for the absence of Cr Pederson, who was ill in hospital, but Cr Pederson would contest the election if it were the wish of ratepayers.

Cr West would stand again.

Mr H.S. Dunn would be a candidate for North Ward.  He had no great policies, but would deal with whatever came before Council to the best of his ability.

Mr Snell thought the high rates were driving people to leave the town.

There were some further exchanges over rates and the meeting closed.
