Underground Water Supplies in the district have been falling on many farms and owners are having to adjust usage.  Barry Eberhard at Mullaby is only able to draw on about a quarter of the usual flow â€“ down from 400 to 120 gallons per hour.  East Bungaree reports a serious decline and so do Tony Gebhardt, Bill Gebhardt and Richard Riggs.  There has been no significant recharge to underground supplies for eight years or so.
