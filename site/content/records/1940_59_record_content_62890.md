F.T. Sara and some hired help filled this up.  Rev. W.O. Harris, with an army of lads, removed pepper trees.  Then came fencing, the erection of sheds, laying on of water, etc. with the help of Messrs McWaters, Fairchild, Radford, Riggs, Thomas, Fuss, Pearce, Woollacott and Clode.  Then a bit later Mr & Mrs Gare donated the hall and its block of land.
