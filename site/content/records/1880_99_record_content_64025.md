Editorial on Federation:

After twenty years or more of discussion at last a definite proposal will be put in June.  It, if accepted will give the Federal Government control over trade and commerce, defence, banking, bankruptcy, conciliation in trade disputes, posts and telegraphs and other matters.  There will be two houses of Parliament – each state having six members in the Upper House and one for every 50,000 population in the Lower House.  Thus NSW will get 25, Victoria 22, SA 7, Tasmania & WA 5 each and Queensland if she comes in 9.  There will be a Governor General and a High Court.  Free trade is to operate between all states after two years except for a concession to WA which will end after five years.

The editor goes on to endorse federation and to say the savings in Government Departments taken over by the federation will run the new Government with little extra cost – estimated at £300,000 p.a. of which SA will contribute £30,000.  But SA will also benefit by c. £10,000 in increased railway income and will hand over the NT, which is a liability.  Other savings will also be effected.  There is opposition in NSW because too much power is given to SA, Tasmania and WA, but on polling day NSW is expected to say yes.  Victoria and Tasmania will say yes.  WA seems likely to do so and if the rest say yes Queensland will be unlikely to stand out.  SA could not afford to stay out of a federation and we are never likely to get more favourable conditions than those now offered.  Every elector should vote one way or the other on 4 June 1898.
