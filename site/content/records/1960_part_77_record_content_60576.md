Burra Show Society held its AGM on Tuesday night.  The balance sheet showed a credit balance of $238.78.  Elected: Patron, Rex C. Warnes; President, R. Mason; Vice-Presidents, G. Kellock & M.G. Wardle.

Mrs Val Secomb has resigned as secretary and applications are being sought.  The retiring President R. Mason reported on a successful 1971 show, opened by His Excellency Shizuo Saito, Ambassador of Japan.  The morning was cold and overcast, but the afternoon remained fine.  Overall entries were up on 1970 by 239.  Sheep shearing was a highlight, though entries were down.  Miss Show Girl was a popular contest.  This year jumps and hurdles were improved and 250 new poultry cages were available.  Working bees had been well attended.  Horses in Action entries were down slightly.  Wool entries increased considerably.  Sheep numbers were down, but of a high standard.  The Agricultural Pavilion was filled to capacity.  The Schoolsâ€™ Display was excellent.  Industrial exhibits made a bright display.  The Honda Agricultural Motor Cycle Trials were very popular.  Many other sections had increased numbers of entries.  [Thanks are then extended to many helpers.]
