The Bushfire Siren was installed at the Burra Town Hall last Wednesday and was first used on Thursday.  Just after noon a fire broke out on the property of Messrs T.J. & W. Quinn just north of Mt Bryan.  It was quickly controlled, but still destroyed 5 acres of hay stubble, 20 stooks of oaten hay and about 4 tons of baled hay.  The fire started just after the passage of a train.  At about the same time there was an alarm to extinguish a fire near Canowie.

Fire.  A fire broke out on Wednesday night near the home of Mr L.H. Thomas, just after he and Mrs Thomas had returned from a function at the Town Hall.  Mr Thomas was able to extinguish the small fire near the railway line using a knapsack spray.
