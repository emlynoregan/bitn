Burra Institute half-yearly meeting of subscribers failed to get a quorum.  The library has over 3,000 volumes with orders out for over 100 new books.  There are now 64 subscribers.  The debt at present is £20-17-7 and this will soon vanish when in a few days the Government subsidy of members’ subscriptions brings in £47-9-6.
