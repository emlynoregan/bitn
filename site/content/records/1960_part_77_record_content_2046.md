The CWA will hold an 
Exhibition of Antiques, Pictures and Art at the Burra Town Hall on 27 May.  The aim is to raise money for new CWA Rooms in Burra, to be known as the Mary Warnes CWA Rooms.  In 1926 the late Mrs T.R. Bowman came to Burra to speak about what was then known as the Country Women’s Service Association and soon afterwards a branch of this was opened in Burra with the Late Mrs I.J. Warnes as its first President.  Two years later the name was changed to the Country Women’s Association.  Lady Swift, the daughter of the late Mrs John Tennant, an original member, has consented to open the exhibition.
