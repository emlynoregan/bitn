Letter.  Kerry Fitzpatrick writes a letter recounting her experiences in Mt Bryan after buying the school there in 2003.  They expected to be moving into a safe and friendly place, but found they had one contractor who never came back and one who did, but ripped them off.  They awaiting welcoming neighbours in vain and the kids were bullied at school.  Small things were stolen from around their home, including her daughter’s pet rabbit and someone armed with a gun at night terrorised their animals, eventually shooting their pet duck in the back.  Décor Made Easy offered genuine help and support and some of the community gave support and comfort so that things have now somewhat improved.
