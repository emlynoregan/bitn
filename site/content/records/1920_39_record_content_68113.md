Floods.

Heavy rain fell on Wednesday & Thursday last.  It was accompanied by very high wind and by 9 a.m. Thursday 188 points had been officially measured with private gauges over 2 inches in places.  Several large trees fell due to sodden ground.  The creek was the highest for many years and was especially dramatic at the Pig & Whistle Ford where the depth was well over five feet.  It is said by many to be the highest since 1915.  In the past when the head waters were in grazing country run-off was greater, but now with increased cultivation much more is absorbed.  The Burra Race-course area was a sea of water.  World’s End recorded 175 points and Baldina 104.  Falls to the north were lower – Mt Bryan c. 100 points.  There were sheep losses due to the cold, especially at Belcunda where Stanley Hawker lost 100 recently shorn sheep and Mr Michael Gebhardt lost 76.  Miss D. Schubert of Copperhouse was swept off her bike trying to get to some cows to milk them, but was able to scramble out by clinging to a fence.
