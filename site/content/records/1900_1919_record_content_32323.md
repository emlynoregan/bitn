Obituary.  Richard Thomas of Quarry St died on 8 July aged 81.  He was born in Cornwall in January 1831 and came to SA in the Isle of Finnet in 1854 and worked in the Burra Mine for about 30 years.  [Probably not, as the mine closed 23 years later.]  He was cemetery curator for c. 26 years, only retiring about 2 years ago on account of bad health.  He was a member of the Burra Lodge for over 50 years.  He was the father of 12 and leaves a wife and two daughters: Mrs J. Snell of Broken Hill and Mrs Pressick of Burra.  [See also next issue page 2.]
