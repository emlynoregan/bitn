Bench of Magistrates, Adelaide 21 March

Mr Parker applied on behalf of Mr Robert Martin for a licence that had been refused by the Bench the previous week.  He said:

When Port Wakefield was declared a legal port of the colony three years ago the Government decided that a public house would be a great convenience.

Mr Martin’s landlord was then given permission to erect a building on Crown land on provision it be removed when town allotments were sold.

As a result a wooden building had been erected and when the town allotments were sold the gentleman referred to bought one and moved the building to the new site.

Mr Martin had taken the building on lease and had spent £750 erecting the present house.

Mr Martin’s character was beyond reproach and he had carefully kept the house closed at the proper hours.

The Government was so impressed with the growing importance and trade at the port that they had decided to establish a police station there forthwith.

He was confident the Bench would agree that it was desirable that some accommodation be provided at a place frequented not only by travellers from the country, but by sailors.

If the licence were not granted Mr Martin would be reduced to poverty.

After much discussion the question was deferred till the following Thursday.

[It was clear from the discussion that the Patent Copper Company had opposed the licence.]
