Matthew Burnett held a Grand Temperance Demonstration at the Burra Institute last Saturday, preceded by a procession of Rechabites, Bands of Hope Members and the Aberdeen Brass Band.  The Institute was crowded with standing room taken up.  Captain Killicoat was unavoidably absent so the chair was taken by Rev. J. Bickford.  F.W. Holder congratulated Mr Burnett on so far having gained over 500 signatures to the pledge (after adjustments for double signings).  He called for the establishment of a Total Abstinence Society.  Revs. J. Pearce, A.J. Birt and W.A. Bainger spoke in support.  At the end of the night the number pledging had risen to over 700.
