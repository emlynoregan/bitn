Notices, advertisements and some news.

Pages 4 & 5

Generally dominated by the 50 Years Ago and 25 Years Ago columns with advertisements and a little news.

Pages 6 & 7

Generally carries the Cash Column, news, sports results and advertisements.

Page 8

News and advertisements.

BUT  there was really no clear allocation of pages and topics and even the previous regular placement of sales advertising and public notices on page 2 is no longer guaranteed.

A few issues were extended beyond 8 pages.
