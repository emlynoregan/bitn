Burra High School.  Jubilee Celebrations

On Thursday there was an inspection of present classes at work, a ‘back to school’ class and the opening of the new sports area, followed by a concert at night in the Town Hall.

The Headmaster Mr R. Mueller greeted visitors and organised them into seven groups to visit the school.  [Guides as per list last week.]  The back-yo-school class assembled at the rear of the school and marched with the aid of drummer Norrie Baynes to the tennis courts where the teacher was Mr L. Carthew.  [The ‘pupils are listed.]

Five of those attending were from the 1913 class.  Others attending were Mr Joe Statton (the first headmaster), Mr Biddle, Mr Haese and Mr Murray Scriven; all former headmasters.  Mr L.W. Gare, one of the 1913 class, moved a vote of thanks.  From here there was a move to the new sports area and despite a bleak day with gusty winds and a shower or two, the crowd persisted.  [Official guests are listed.]  The Mayor Mr Baulderstone welcomed visitors and Mr Mueller also welcomed them to the school.  He particularly welcomed Mr Statton (Superintendent of High Schools).  Mr Jennison, in his speech as Chairman of the High School Council, said 100 old scholars had enlisted in WWII and eleven had died in that conflict.  The Parents & Friends, Association had raised £1,434-10-0 in the last five years, and today’s project, though not yet completed, would cost £1,200, split equally between the Parents & Friends’ Association and the Department.  It was only a week or two ago that the signal to proceed had come through and much was due to the efforts of Messrs Hirschausen Bros and D.A. Halliday that so much of it had already been accomplished.  Mr A.K. Statton then opened the new sports area.

Football

Keith Warrior of Hallett won the Burra Record Trophy for football in 1962.  Keith was the runner-up in the 1962 Mail Medal for the North Eastern League.

In the Mid North League Kevin Lane of Aberdeen was runner-up for the Mail Medal, which went to D. Maynard of Clare South.

Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club elected at its AGM: Patron, G. Stanley Hawker; President, E. Orchard; Vice-President, H.J. Topsfield; Secretary, D. Clarkson and Treasurer, S. Britton.

The balance sheet showed a credit of £242-5-2.
