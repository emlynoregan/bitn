The WCTU held its annual silver medal competition for temperance recitations by the children last Wednesday in Jubilee Hall.  The winner was Elvie Tiver ahead of Hazel Edwards.  There were songs and addresses from the Chairman, Mr H. Thomas and Captain Day of the Salvation Army.

[Personal interest: one of the songs was from Mr R. Fuss.]
