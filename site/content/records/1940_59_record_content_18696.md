Obituary.  Mr John Rosewall died 25 August at Burra Hospital aged 81.  He was born in Newcastle NSW on 20 March 1863, the son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Rosewall and he came to Burra with his parents as an infant.  On 23 January 1889 he married Miss M. Taylor, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Taylor of Burra.  Mrs Rosewall died shortly after their golden wedding in 1939.  His first job was minding cows at the age of 8.  The owner of the cows was interested in Modern game Fowls and gave him a setting of eggs.  Mr Rosewall was keenly interested in this class of fowl and from then on took many prizes over the years at agricultural and poultry shows.  Later he worked in the Burra Mines and when the mines closed he got a job as Shift Boss at the Smelting Works, then in full blast.1  After that he worked on stations in the north of SA and was at Broken Hill before the discovery of the mines there.  He had a number of dangerous encounters with Aboriginals.  He tells of watching corroborees near where the Burra School now stands and he and other students were much more frightened of the Aborigines’ dogs than of the natives themselves.2  About 1915 he gave up station life to become Overseer of Works for the Burra Town Council and he held this position till he retired about 1931.  He was a member of the Oddfellows Lodge sine 1882.  He is survived by two sons and three daughters: Mrs Watson (Highgate), J. Rosewall (Burra), T. Rosewall (Woodside), Mrs R. Owen (Elliston) & Mrs G.M. Rosenthal (Myrtle Bank).  There are three brothers and one sister: Messrs Josiah, Thomas & Henry and Dora.

[1 Since the Burra Smelting operations ceased in 1864 and in any case could hardly have continued at full blast after the closure of the mine this doesn’t fit in with either the history of the mine, or the age of Mr Rosewall.  He was only 14 when the Burra Mine closed.

2 This reference to Aborigines at Burra is a rare observation.  Other sources such as Ngadjuri by Warrior, Knight, Anderson & Pring (2005) suggest that by 1870 there were few if any Ngadjuri living in the Burra area.  Mr Rosewall could be relating stories he heard of the 1850s when such events are recorded by other pioneers, but given that he could hardly be reporting events from personal observation from before about 1868 the evidence above should be taken with great caution.]
