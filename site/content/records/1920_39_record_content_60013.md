Mongolata Goldfield

Despite the article in The News last Monday, which embodied anything but a hopeful outlook for the field, there is still much interest in activities there.

On Wednesday Curlew sent in a rich consignment of specimen gold for the bank.

Messrs Rampton are said to be working on a lode some 15 ft wide of real ironstone with gold showing freely.

The battery is working full time.
