Burra Bowling Club AGM last Wednesday.

The club had 45 bowlers this season and the committee felt that the heavy expenditure to establish the club had been justified.  President A. G. Gebhardt was re-elected with S.M. Lane and W.H. Sandland as Vice-Presidents.  Mr Chambers stood down as Hon. Sec. and Mr Hann was elected in his place with Mr Chambers as Assistant Secretary.  To meet expenses the annual fee has been increased from £2-2-0 to £3-3-0.  Mr Bit mead, a blind friend of Mr Reed and a keen rose enthusiast presented 100 rose trees and offered to assist in their pruning.  The committee would like to acquire the Council Depot adjoining the green, but the Council would need another site to go to.  The block below the Kooringa Hotel was a possibility and Mr C.B. Warnes, owner of it, was willing to sell.  If the Council were prepared to take that block the Club would be able to acquire the other property.  The purchase would be completed privately with the block let to the Bowling Club for 5% of the capital.  There was a good stone building on the property, which could be used as a club house and there was room for a tennis court.  The Chairman and Secretary will get definite information and report back.

[Presumably the ‘good stone building’ was the old Baptist Church.]
