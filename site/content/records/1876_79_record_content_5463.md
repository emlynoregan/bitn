Report on the Dinner to Ex-Mayor Lipsett. 
A complimentary dinner to E. Lipsett JP as Ex-Mayor was held at the Institute with host Jos. Richardson of the Commercial Hotel. Mt T. Bath in the chair and Ex-Cr Roberts as vice-chair. About 75 attended. 
Cr Geake proposed the toast to Mr Lipsett. He was fulsome in his praise of Mr Lipsett and defended him against an accusation that he had wished to entertain a guest invited by himself at the expense of the Corporation. Believing in no clique or party, he had stood free and independent while he filled the office and he had done his best and had never stood higher in the esteem of the public than now. 
Cr Bartholomæus added some further words of support. 
The Chairman then presented a solid silver cup to the Ex-Mayor. 
Mr Lipsett then spoke in thanks and maintained that he had never deserved the dishonourable treatment he had been subjected to. On arrival 11 or 12 years ago he had not thought to reach such a high position in the town. 
It had been impossible to do much due to the actions of some men who had lost the town £600 in rates [i.e. The Robinites] He still managed to leave the office almost free from debt. He had been drawn into political action in the election to the Colonial Parliament of Mr Rees some seven years ago. ‘He had hoped the ratepayers would have seen fit to return him this year without opposition and it ought to have been so.’ 
‘He did not blame the ratepayers for the clique.’ 
‘Not Dr Nesbitt personally because he was only a tool as everyone knew and he himself (Dr Nesbitt) knew and would (he believed) say if they asked him.’ 
He went on to blame opposition to him on the fact he was well educated ‘this was his greatest sin’ 
His height of 6’6” — one or two don’t like to look up to E. Lipsett 
His age — ‘you are younger than they . . . you ought to wait until you are grey headed.’ 

‘It was no dishonour to be 6’6”, nor to own the greatest drapery establishment out of Adelaide.’ 
When the hospital started others gave £2-2-0, but he had subscribed £5. He had on occasion criticised it with respect to mismanagement, want of extra nurses and two men being allowed to wander nude and mad, having been allowed to get out. As a result he had been grossly insulted. Had ‘those gentlemen said they were sorry he would have gone on with his subscription. He then went into details about the controversy of admitting a man to the Burra Hospital. He claimed he could have overturned the result of the election of Dr Nesbitt in twenty ways had he liked. He accused Nesbitt’s team of keeping a public house open for three days, betted hats, given away garments and free rides down the line. They had disgracefully raked up a scandal against Mr Lane from 20 years ago — all the dirt came from one side. He refers to other allegations raised in the campaign too. 
Rev. Jenkin, who was unable to attend, sent in a speech to be read by Mr Hill. In it he began by attacking the editor of the Record. 
He describes F.W. Holder as: - 
‘a vendor of Yankee notions, dispenser of homoeopathic medicines, general surveyor of our town, town clerk, editor of a newspaper, and in addition to all this a local preacher.’ It is as much my right as his to meddle in local politics. 
Mr Lipsett’s moral character has been trampled in the dust ‘at the very time when his truthfulness and manliness were two essential things to secure his return.’

P. Lane toasted the retiring councillors Sara and Roberts — of the third he knew nothing. [!]  He raised the issue of the Robinites, some of whom he said were gentlemen who did the right thing afterwards, but others were not.  All the difficulty he said had come because a certain party could not endure to see the Corporation as then constituted, but all the pressure brought to bear on the Mayor and Corporation had not affected their unity or desire to do well, though every technicality had been taken advantage of by some parties. 
Some of those who signed the Round Robin were gentlemen and did what was right thereafter, but others were not and had never the interests of the town at heart. As soon as they found the technical incidents they had sent to their solicitor and done all they could to obstruct and they had their tool in J.D.C.  Those men - Dr Brummitt, Thomas Drew and J.D. Cave had looked up an old paper of over twenty years ago — he wondered if their backgrounds were able to bear such scrutiny and hinted that J.D. Cave’s at Lacepede Bay and Gumeracha could not.  ‘There was not a place he had left honourably, and he only held his position here on sufferance under the hands of these men, and why did they keep him? Because he was a tool.’
He [Mr Lane] had held more public positions than any man in Burra and defied anyone to say where he had betrayed their trust and now two men called respectable and belonging to the same church as himself and also the editor of the Record had allowed that thing to be got out to their shame. 
The opposition had said ‘try a case in the local court. Tell everyone there would be no rates to pay for 18 months and the Mayor and Council saw they would at once lose £180-£200 of govt. subsidy spent on public works and told the others the state of the case, but they were not satisfied and when the Council would not yield they sent a deputation with which the Council tried for an agreement, but it would not do so. 
Ever since the Corporation had been formed action could have been taken against the District Council and still could be. He did not think men could be so scurrilous and dirty and yet sit where they had no right to. When he told the chairmen he said it was right and just. Few knew the work the first Council had to do, sitting night after night making by-laws and paying back rates as a result of the action of these men. 
It was impudent to say they had done the best according to their ability for there were men in the first council who turned over more money in a month than the Council did in 12 and more than any 3 or 4 in the town. He referred to Crs Sara, Lipsett and Sanders — yet they talked about ability. They worked for the town well and he hoped to meet them together again. He had great pleasure in proposing the health of Crs Roberts and Sara. 
Cr Sara could not say he was altogether happy at his present position. He could bear out what Mr Lane had said — the opposition was not against measures, but men. He could refute that the North Ward had not a fair share of the expenditure and the books would show that it had. 
Rev. Richards was glad so many of the ratepayers had come to honour a gentleman so worthy of it. He had not known Mr Lipsett so long as some, but had come to regard him as a good citizen, a gentleman and a Christian. Mr Lipsett had borne his rough handling well. He proposed the ‘Town and Trade of Burra’. 
Mr W. Pearce responded and Mr W. West proposed ‘The Press’.
