The Royal Commission on Council Boundaries

The first report recommends reducing the number of Councils from 137 to 72 with boundaries based on community of interest.  The recommendation does not envisage there being fewer officers employed.  In the last 40 years almost all the changes have been the amalgamation of a rural Town Council with surrounding District Council.  Very few boundary changes have been made.  The mergers of Town Councils and District Councils have all proved to be satisfactory.  [Details are given respecting the District Councils of Robertstown and Eudunda, which it is proposed to merge and also the District Council of Saddleworth & Auburn, which it is proposed to merge with the DC of Riverton and of the Clare DC, which it is recommended should be enlarged by absorbing parts of the DCs of Georgetown & Spalding together with all of Blyth.]
