Local Board of Health.

The Inspector visited Rabbich’s slaughterhouse on 16 November and ordered the removal of excess bones and of manure from the pig yard.  This was not done by the return visit of 2 December.  Information was laid and on 7 December Rabbich was fined 5/- + costs.

Copperhouse School closets were unsatisfactory and new and deeper pits are to be dug over the school holidays – lime to be used in the meantime.
