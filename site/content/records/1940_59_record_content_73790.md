Burra Swimming Pool

Pine trees on the site have been removed and excavation is to begin today.  Nett proceeds of the Past & Present Players’ Football match on 14 July was c. £58, although £99 was taken.  Despite the high costs, it was felt to be satisfactory and gave value for the money received.  It had cost about £20 for the Pt Pirie Pipers, the local Football Club will benefit by c. £10 and other expenses were c. £10.  Unfortunately the Shell Pictures drew only a small crowd on an evening of very inclement weather.
