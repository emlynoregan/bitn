C.A. Fuss moved thanks to the retiring Councillors and then the candidates for the Mayoralty were invited to speak.  This was the first election for Mayor for about 15 years.

[Actually the last election had been when John Sampson jun. defeated E.F. Lockyer on 1 December 1897.]

Cr Burns said he had received a requisition to stand from c. 70 ratepayers.  Of Course they had not always seen eye to eye on Council in the year, but after healthy discussion had done what was considered right.  He could not say what he intended to do if returned, but would attend to business promptly.  He did not believe in Councillors interfering with work in wards they didn’t represent.  He was the oldest or next oldest Burraite on the Council and would not lose sight of the work needed to make it even more picturesque.  He was against Market Square being fenced as a paddock, but would not oppose anything tending to make it truly more beautiful.

Cr Crewes said the time had come for personal explanation why he was standing in mid-term.  The Mayor had asked him a few meetings ago if he intended standing for Mayor and he has said no.  As soon as it was known that the Doctor was not going to stand a movement was set on foot to requisition the speaker (Crewes) to stand and the first he had heard of it was the day after the Council.  His opponents had said it was all a concoction of himself and Mr Hardy, which was a falsehood.  He was getting into a cab when Mr Hardy called to him saying that they were getting up a requisition and asking him if he would stand.  He said he needed time to think it over.  He had then tried to get Cr Wise or Mr Winnall to stand, but had been unsuccessful.  On receiving a large requisition to stand he had agreed, not knowing Cr Burns intended coming out.  As soon as he resigned as Councillor his opponents made a spring with a requisition to Councillor Burns.  While he was Mayor he had more work to do than any Mayor before or since as it was during the Boer War, when scores of meeting had to be presided over and he had also attended in Sydney during the Commonwealth Celebrations.  He knew the workings of Council and of 247 motions in the minute book he had moved 117.  He would bring as much zeal and energy to the position as to his own business.  He would like to see the town better lit and trees better protected.  The Jubilee Avenue should be better fenced.  The new Post Office and telephone exchange was the result of persistent pegging.

Cr Burns asked to rise on a matter of personal explanation and when allowed said he had lived all his life in Burra and defied anyone to say anything against his reputation.

The Mayor – That is not a personal explanation.

Burns – I am accused of telling falsehoods.

Chair – Cr Crewes did not accuse you of falsehoods.

[Crewes had said he was surprised that Burns was standing as the latter had said he was heartily sick of Municipal work.]

Cr Wise, when asked, agreed that what Burns had actually said was that Wise would have to find another colleague in West Ward in the next twelve months – quite a different thing.

Burns then objected to Crewes’s saying he had sprung up as an opponent as soon as Crewes had resigned.  The chair said that Crewes had not accused him, but had referred to ‘opponents’ as distinct from ‘his opponent'.
