The Hydraulic Engineer has declined to connect the Waterworks to the telephone system.  The Commissioner will be written to.

Cr Radford said that the £240 to employ returned men might be put with a similar sum borrowed to do Deadman’s Bridge, but he was doubtful of the availability of men.

Cr McBride suggested a swing bridge at the Pig & Whistle.

Mr Crewes wanted to fence and plant creek reserves or to put a bridge at Gully’s Wharf.

Cr Radford’s motion that the Mayor and Town Clerk investigate the Deadman’s Bridge question was passed.

The hose at Lane Garden has been cut open for 8” and the sprinkler stolen.  Lads were also destroying the Rotunda Green.  Mr Crewes said gardens generally were being destroyed.
