Rabbits.  A meeting was held at the German schoolhouse about four miles south of Lapford on 2 April to consider wire netting the scrubby lands of south Baldina Hundred and north Bright Hundred from the agricultural lands to the west.  Burra & Apoinga District Councils were represented.  A major problem is the untenanted Block A.

Mr Flower moved Apoinga Council urge the owner of the following blocks to take action by erecting netting fences to control rabbits: sections 40, 39, 35, 34, 33, 25, E25, S24, 48, 201, 47, 44, 43, 10, 11, & 12.
