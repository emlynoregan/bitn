Kooringa Methodist Church Fete was held last Friday in the Institute.  It was a great success and was opened by Dr Sangster Jun.  The object was to raise the balance of the sum of £130 promised towards the connexional fund concerned with the Twentieth Century Movement.  Last year £700 was raised, but in the interest of local trust funds.  The church has now raised £830 towards this fund.  The takings on Friday amounted to £79-10-0.
