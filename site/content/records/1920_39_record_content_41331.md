The Town Clerk said both matters could be explained.

[The explanation of the former is not very clear in the paper.]

The arrears in rates are largely due to unclaimed properties, which the Council intended selling to go towards liquidation of the debt.  They had been outstanding and accumulating for 20 years.

In the event of the properties being sold the money obtained will pay the rates and the debt will not be handed on to the buyers.
