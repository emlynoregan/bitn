Burra Mine

The foundations for the resited Peacock’s Chimney are to be poured next weekend by voluntary labour under the direction of the builder Me Geoff. Lloyd.  Dudley Cockington reports seeing the sketchbook of Col. E.C. Frome who was the third Surveyor-General of SA after Col. Light and Captain Sturt.  Among the paintings there are some of the Burra area in 1843-45 before the town existed.  They include scenes of Burra Creek, World’s End, Smokey Valley, Razor Back and Mt Bryan.  The collection was purchased last year from London by the SA Art Gallery.
