Burra rural Youth held a social and dance with a barbecue supper at the Show Hall.  At the 9 July meeting Mr T.G. Perry, Secretary of the Burra Show, told members of proposed improvements for the 1956 Burra Show.  On 17 July there was a debate at Clare that Selection by Competition for Rural Youth Trips is preferable to other methods.
