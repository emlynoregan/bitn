Redruth Junior Sunday School was opened 23 November by Mrs J.M. McBride, introduced by Rev. D.B. Bridgwood.  Mr H.H. Thomas had bought the building and offered it to the trustees to be rented as a Sunday school.  The building was thoroughly renovated and adapted.  He hoped it would not be long before a large Sunday school could be erected on the land adjoining.  The children then had a treat of good things including cool drinks and ice cream.  Strawberries and cream were provided on the grounds too and the afternoon tea room was well patronised by the large attendance of parents and friends.  [This refers to a building then immediately east of the Redruth Methodist Church that had previous been Richardsâ€™ bicycle shop.  It was subsequently demolished when the Memorial Hall was built.]
