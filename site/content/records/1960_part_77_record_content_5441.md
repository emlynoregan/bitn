Obituary.  Mrs M.A. Jefferies late of Burra died 27 January at her residence in Colonel Light Gardens aged 92 [93].  She came to Burra in 1870 with her parents and spent all her girlhood in the town.  She went first to Mr Katâ€™s School and later to the Public School.  Her father, the late Mr Simpson, we believe drove the first train from Burra to Hallett when the line ended there.  When refreshment rooms were opened at Burra Mr & Mrs Simpson had charge of them.  Later they took the refreshment rooms at Hamley Bridge and it was there she met and married Albert Jefferies, who was in the SAR.  After the marriage they moved to Wallaroo for five years and then to Adelaide.  Mr Jefferies then left the railways and they ran a shop at Reynella.  In 1912 they purchased a farm at Mt Bryan and were there until Mr Jefferies died.  Mrs Jefferies then moved to Burra with her daughter Joyce and in 1956 to Adelaide where her three daughters reside.  She is survived by her three daughters and one son as well as ten grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren.  Mr Frank Jefferies still lives on the farm.

[Born Mary Ann Simpson (known as Mollie) 10 August 1868: died 27 January 1961 Reade Park.]
