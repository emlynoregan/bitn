Kooringa News, 9 April

Obituary/Inquest.  On Thursday morning W.H. Challoner presided at the White Hart Hotel at an inquest on the body of Edward Connelly or Donnelly.  Duncan Stewart and Alfred Warming stated that on Sunday evening they had called at the hut of the deceased, who had given them some food.  They then went outside and the shepherd came home soon afterwards.  While they were talking to the shepherd the deceased came out and walked towards the sheep yard at the back of the hut.  They and the shepherd entered the hut and the deceased soon followed them, but had no sooner sat down that he went into convulsions.  They administered an emetic, but the poor man died within about 15 minutes.  John Lambert, the shepherd, gave corroborative evidence and said he did not know what had prompted the taking of the poison.  Dr Morgan said he was decidedly of the opinion that the deceased had died from strychnine.  The jury returned a verdict of ‘Temporary insanity’.

[Edward Donelly died 29 March 1862 Chewings Station aged 30.]
