Frank Harding’s Folklore Gallery is at 1 Best Place, Burra North, across the road from the Royal Exchange Hotel.  It is currently run by his daughter, Megan.  So far 14 paintings have been sold since its opening.  Mr Harding left the Police Force 8 years ago to start full-time painting.  He is well known as such in London, America and Australia, though not yet so very well known in South Australia.  The Hardings have another gallery in Renmark.  Mr Harding paints in oils, watercolour, pen and ink and egg tempera.
