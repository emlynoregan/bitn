In some issues jokes were used as a filler on pages 5 & 6.

Generally speaking the paper seemed rather tired and without any depth of reporting in the first half of the year.  The local businesses seem to have almost stopped advertising in it.  From 15 June there was an attempt to revitalise the paper.  There were editorials on a regular basis for the first time in years.  These were not however, especially penetrating or mind stretching and can in no way compare with either the wide-ranging editorials of Holder’s time or with the quite incisive local comments from the early years of Davey’s period.  Much more local news appeared and there was more attention to detail.  There were interesting snippets on present and past Burra identities.  There were household hints and suggestions of interest to the housewife, the farmer and the poultry keeper for example.  There were also quirky items and humorous segments.  The increasing length of the notes from the middle of the year is indicative of this change.

When the new format appeared there was an immediate lift in local advertising and the improvement in the quality and range of local news was maintained.
