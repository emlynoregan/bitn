Public Meeting on Medical and Educational Matters

A well-attended meeting on 14 May at Banks’ Assembly Room discussed what steps could be taken to assure the presence of another qualified medical practitioner in the district and to secure a local hospital.  Captain Killicoat JP Presided.  Several resolutions were passed and preliminary arrangements made.  As our advertising pages indicate an early result can be expected.  There was also a call for the establishment of one or more first-class Government schools in the neighbourhood.  Further meetings can be expected on this matter.
