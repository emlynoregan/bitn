Burra Electro-Magnetic Works

Work in real earnest begins now after the official opening last Saturday when Mr Gall spoke.  The treatment of the ‘dumps’ is seen as the first step in the restarting of the mine.  The Burra Mine had really only been opened down to 300’ and yet had produced something like £4,000,000 worth of ore.  There was every reason to believe that rich deposits had not yet been touched.  He regretted the slow start of the new company, but hoped the Electro-Magnetic Works would be the start of something being done with the mine.

Mr Snow said unforseen difficulties had delayed the start, but they had now been overcome.  Mr Marryat, the manager, had displayed great skill in overcoming problems after the engineer from Germany failed to give the expected assistance and returned to Germany leaving them awkwardly placed.  These were the first such works in the world and they will produce ore that smelters will gladly buy, but whether the concern will be payable is another question.  So far it had not been profitable, but they were hopeful.  Stories that in the early days large bodies of ore were buried in the dumps will be investigated by driving a tunnel through the dump.  He was inclined to think most stories of mine riches were of the ‘fairy’ description.  He said the company would buy ore from tributers as raised without its being cracked – and pay full value for it – cracking can take up to ⅔ of their time.

Mr Young followed this speech with some encouraging remarks.

The Mayor responded.  He was sure there was plenty of ore to be found.  He had arrived in Burra in 1847 and was the oldest resident; he had been in Burra during the strike and thought that Bunt’s shaft would be a good place to start and that Beck’s would also be profitable.

Mr Gall thanked the Mayor.

The main problem was raising capital in SA.

The official party left by the 3.30 p.m. train.
