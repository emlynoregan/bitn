Obituary.  Mr Alfred Bevan died at Burra Hospital on 13 August.  He was born at Blinman on 29 January 1874, where his father, the late Robert Bevan, was the manager of the manager of the Prince Alfred Copper Company, Sliding Rock, Central Australia. [Sic.]  Mr Bevan came with his parents to reside in Burra at an early age and was educated at Burra Primary School.  He married the late Miss Margaret Bolton in 1893 and their family comprised five sons and four daughters, two of whom predeceased him.  By occupation Mr Bevan was a butcher, drover and shearer and during the course of his work, travelled over all part of South Australia and New South Wales.  He was well acquainted with the little known tracks and pastoral holdings in both those states.  In his younger days he was an enthusiastic member of the Burra Rifle Club, a coursing enthusiast and a keen horseman.  As a rifleman he still holds an all-time record of 104 out of 105 scored over open sights.  The score has been equalled once with aperture sights, but never beaten.  At picnic races his services as a jockey were eagerly sought by owners.  He rode quite a number of winners for the late Mr Tom Richards of Morgan. He leaves five sons: Ted of Caltowie, Alex of Burra, Peter of Broken Hill, Henry of Broken Hill and Arch of the West Coast, as well as two daughters, Alice Mrs W. Brown of Menindie and Elizabeth Mrs G. Phillips of Clare.

[Birth not confirmed.]
