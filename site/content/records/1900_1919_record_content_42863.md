Letter from ‘Supporter’ continuing the squabble over the Sheep Dog Trials.  Also did Mr Radford say recently ‘men that are going now are not half as worthy of a social as others who have gone and those who go later should get no send-off at all’?

Why does Mr Radford stay at home?

‘Our roads are in good order now and our ratepayers may possibly be induced to give Cr Radford leave of absence for a few months.’
