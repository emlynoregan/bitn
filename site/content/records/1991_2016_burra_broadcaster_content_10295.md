Letter.  Jane & Peter Strawbridge write concerning the Neil Page Report on Tourism in Burra.

The report recommended a budget figure for tourism the same as last year’s and the establishment of an incorporated association to oversee the tourist office and other site activities excluding the Caravan Park and the Paxton Square Cottages.

‘Although this report sets council tourism ventures in the right direction for privatisation, there are some areas that need careful consideration’

If you have concerns read the report and voice your concerns to Councillors before 31 May.
