Burra Town Council

The new superstructure of the Bon Accord Bridge has been completed by the Local Government Department, which also reported it was unable to assist in constructing a ford at the Pig and Whistle at present.

Mr Cuenow, Chief [Railways] Engineer, reported he did not believe the bridge to the Ballast Quarry was either causing silting or holding back flood waters.  The main problem was people dumping rubbish in the creek.

The SAR will not link the goods shed by telephone because there is already a telephone at the booking office.
