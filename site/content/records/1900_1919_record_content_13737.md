A Subscription Dance was held in the Institute on Thursday evening, but was not as largely attended as was expected.

The Girls’ Friendly Soc. of St Mary’s held a successful bazaar at the old Auction Mart last Friday.

The gross proceeds were £15.

[Personal interest: the Fancy stall was presided over by Nellie Vivian and Greta Fuss.]
