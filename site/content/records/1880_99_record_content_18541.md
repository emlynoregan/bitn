Burra Town Council, 18 July.

John Jenkin (stationman) wrote asking his wages be increased in line with the amount paid to the North Ward stationman.  Cr Coglin moved it be granted and Cr Symons 2nd.

Cr Tiver said when tenders were called the North Ward man had valued his services at 7/6 a day while Jenkins had valued his at 7/-.  He had no reason to complain if Council took him at his own price.

Cr Sampson thought it could not be granted without rescinding the motion to accept his services at 7/-.

Cr Ridgway did not think the request was put very civilly, but would suggest suspension of standing orders so that it might be dealt with.  The suggestion was adopted and the request granted.

Aberdeen Lawn Tennis Club asked permission to use another portion of the same ground, undertaking to fence and plant and pay a nominal rent.

Cr Sampson thought they were trying to get at Council and to get the right to exclude cricketers, footballers, school children and others from the place and Council should refuse the request.

Messrs Roach called attention to the need for improving the approach to their mill and weighbridge.  This was referred to the Works Committee, as was the approach to the White Hart Hotel.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands forwarded a copy of the report sent to him by the Hydraulic Engineer.

[The tone of the Engineer shows him to be highly defensive and clearly annoyed by the Council.]

He says: -

I have never admitted the engine ordered was unequal to the work

The steps taken to ascertain whether any substitution could be effected were taken at the instance of the present Mayor.

I visited Burra on 12 February and the Mayor urged me to order a larger engine.  I said the one on order was large enough and would drive a second pump if required and as the machinery had been ordered some months ago it was too late to change.

The Mayor insisted I try, so I agreed to wait on F. Clark & Sons, but on reaching Adelaide I found the machinery was daily expected, and took no further action.

Meeting Mr Clark one day I mentioned the matter and then informed the Burra Corporation that the arrangement could not be effected.

I did not admit the engine ordered was insufficient.

A larger pump may be needed and there is no objection to one being made now if the Corporation are willing to pay interest on the cost of having reserve pumping power.

‘. . .the opinion expressed as to the relative economy of large and small engines are of such an extraordinary nature and so diametrically opposed to the results of experience as to occasion me the most serious misgivings in the propriety of placing the control of the works in the hands of the present Council.’ (R.L. Mestayer)

The Mayor said the Hydraulic Engineer ‘was labouring under an hallucination’.  In interviews with Mr Mestayer he had gained the impression that the engineer agreed that more horsepower was necessary and correspondence bore out that view.  The question was would the larger engine be better for the council and that point was not addressed.
