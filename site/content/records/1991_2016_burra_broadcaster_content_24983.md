Flinders University archaeology students are back in Burra for another dig along the creek and BCS Years 3 & 4 students gave them a bit of a hand unearthing clues to Burra’s past.  They were excavating the creek banks south of the Pig and Whistle Crossing – an area rich in remains of dugouts.  [Though not particularly rich in artefacts.]
