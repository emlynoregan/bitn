Burra Town Council, 19 March

The Hydraulic Engineer reports that 16 mains have been taken up and further investigations will follow on the poor pressure in parts of the town.

The Post Master General intends to remove the public phone from the station, as it is so little used.  Council will urge its retention.

The police have a fair idea who was responsible for recent acts of vandalism, but have insufficient evidence to prosecute.

Cr Riggs moved that the Post Office and telephone exchange names be changed to North Burra & South Burra.  Wherever one went the name Burra was well known, but not the names Kooringa or Aberdeen, but Burra had no post office.  Burra was used as the name of the station, the Council and a host of sporting and other clubs, so why not for the town?

He wanted the idea debated rather than resolved too quickly.  Cr Woollacott seconded.

Cr Riggs thought it unnecessary to consult the ratepayers, but the Mayor thought it essential and Cr Pearce supported asking ratepayers and moved an amendment that a poll be taken at the next election.  Seconded by Cr Harris and carried.

The bridge near the cemetery is to be repaired.

Various other road matters and drainage concerns are reported along with questions over trees at the oval and elsewhere.
