Clare Tiver, groom, was in front of the Burra Hotel about 10.20 when he saw the fire and ran across the square and through the Record office to see that the fire was at Frank Harris’s.  Someone pulled the box away and F. Streicher kicked in the door and threw some water on the fire.

J. Allen said he had gone through the Record office and pulled the box away.

‘Did not apply to the Commissioner of Water Supply for permission to use the water.’

E.G. Burns saw someone walk from Dalgety’s corner up the lane opposite, but did not see him return.  This was c. 10.10.  Ran to the fire around Miss Snell’s corner.

Annie Snell gave evidence of hearing M-C Queale checking at the back. Soon after heard crackling, but couldn’t believe it was fire so soon after the police inspection.  Soon after she put on a coat to check out the continued noise and by the time she got there the fire was almost out.

M-C Queale said he had not been there, but on Dunk’s corner watching some boys.  Then she said it was someone in uniform.  ‘Heard the crackling noise almost immediately after Mr Queale turned the corner.’

On the Saturday Queale admitted he had been around the back ‘for a private purpose’.

Eva Reynolds, who lived with Miss Snell, gave evidence consistent with Miss Snell’s.

M-C Queale:

Went to Truscott’s house at 9.45 p.m. to get my wife, but she was playing the piano so went across to the Burra Hotel and could hear some young fellows rapping the sign boards on the verandahs opposite with sticks.  Walked to Miss Snell’s and up the side street and waited a few minutes for the boys to appear.  They walked quietly past so I did not speak to them.  Walked on to the lane entrance and c. 2 yards in for a private purpose.  Then returned to the street, passed Mr Harris at his shop and went home.  Did a little in the garden then turned the hose off and saw E.J & F. Harris going home.  Went into the office: it was then 10.15.  Went and collected my wife and heard the cry of Fire!

The jury concluded that the fire was caused by a person or persons unknown.  That M-C Queale was in no way connected with it and his name should not have been brought into the case.  When questioned by Mr Winnall, who was appearing for F. Harris, the foreman said they had not specifically mentioned Mr F. Harris as the evidence conclusively proved he was not connected in any way.
