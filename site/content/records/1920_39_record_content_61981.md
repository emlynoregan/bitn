[The Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey then read the proclamation of Sir Anthony Musgrave, Governor of SA, when he proclaimed Burra a Municipality.

The Mayor then said he would like to mention several things the Council planned to do in the coming year.  Actually he began with a discussion of the refurnishing of the Council Chamber, in which inadequate old cedar chairs, not fit for the use of visiting dignitaries, had been replaced by chairs donated by various men of the town.

He then went on to further detail about the tree planting scheme and the proposal to better light Market Square and place floodlights at the foot of the Fallen Soldiers Memorial.  He said they would also have to consider the widening of the Mine Bridge.  Its narrowness made it dangerous and in the process the footbridge would have to be done away with or improved.  It was not a very respectable looking thing anyway.]

Kapunda and Tarlee Councils have asked both the Burra Councils to assist in getting a sealed road through to Burra.

It seemed remarkable that after sixty years the assessment had only risen by £1,800.  The Council had cut the assessment by £3,000 in 1932-33 and it had not since been replaced.

The question of street hawkers would have to be addressed.

[Mr Woollacott then went on at some length to give details of the Jamestown Swimming Baths and also some information about the Georgetown Swimming Pool.]

At present to stand on the Kingston Street Bridge and look at the Burra Creek would give you sore eyes, but with the aid of water from the operations of the proposed pool there would be a supply to irrigate the area, which could be planted with weeping willows and flowering shrubs, as at Strathalbyn.

Cr Kellaway congratulated the Mayor on his re-election and thanked the electors for their support in his own re-election.  This term would mean that he would serve on Council for 17 years, after which he intended to retire.

Cr Jeffery thanked his electors.
