The Three Methodist Churches in Burra have been working together for some months in evangelical efforts and a series of joint meetings promoting a higher Christian life were held over Easter.  Meetings were also held at Westbury and Stony Gap.

Rev. S. Knight, who is newly arrived, preached at Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary over Easter.  Mr Geake Jun., Sunday School secretary reported 29 teachers and 292 scholars.  Proceeds were about Â£60.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church had three excellent sermons from Rev. A.W. Wellington of Yongala on Sunday 2 April, but none of the congregations was large.  The Good Friday tea meeting was very largely attended.  On the 9 & 10 April the Redruth Primitive Methodist Sunday School anniversary was held and was well patronised.
