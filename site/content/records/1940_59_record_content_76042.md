Fire broke out on the roadside at Koonoona on 9 January and it is thought to have been deliberately lit.  It is the seventh since 1 December 1956 and the second for 1957.  About 1,000 acres was burnt near Mr V. Gilbertâ€™s property at Black Springs.  Volunteers came from as far as Kapunda and Saddleworth.  All fires seem likely to have been deliberately lit.  There were also five fires on Koonoona Properties last summer.  Those on 1 December 1955 and 9 January 1956 were caused by machinery, but the other three appear either to have been lit deliberately or to be due to cigarette butts from passing motorists.
