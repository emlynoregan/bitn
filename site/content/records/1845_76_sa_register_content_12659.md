Kooringa News, 28 September

Last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday a grand bazaar was held in the Institute in aid of the proposed Anglican Church at Redruth.  Monday was very well attended, but unpropitious weather reduced attendance on the other two days.  About £300 was raised, from which about £42 must be deducted for expenses.  This result was far better than expected given the dull state of trade in the town.  Many had predicted failure.

On Thursday the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Lord Bishop, assisted by Dean Farrell before a large crowd despite inclement weather.  A large tea-party was held in St Mary’s Schoolroom in the evening.

Rev. Ibbetson delivered an interesting address on ‘Railways and their Appurtenances’ in the Institute on Friday evening, also in aid of the church.
