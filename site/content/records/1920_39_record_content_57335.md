Burra Town Council, 5 August

Councillors received an explanation of the by-law dealing with hawkers, from Mr Bednall and decided to get an opinion from the Municipal Association on the desirability of drafting their own by-law.

Council resolved to remind motorists, by way of a notice in the Record, of the laws requiring them to keep to the left of silent cops and to drive as close as practicable to the left hand side of the road.

The Town Clerk reported that 114 dogs had been registered.

A rate of 2/3 in the pound was adopted.
