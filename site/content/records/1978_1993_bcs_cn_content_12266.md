J150 Book Project

The BCS Council has endorsed a book writing project in conjunction with the State’s Jubilee Year.  All the children of each family attending the district’s schools will be asked to write down some aspects of their family’s history or stories of the family from today or the past.  Contributions from every school aged member of the family are requested and co-operation of families will result in a record of the community’s history.  The book is due for publication in October.  As a consequence, volunteer typists, sub-editors and proof readers are being sought.  Companies are being approached for financial support.
