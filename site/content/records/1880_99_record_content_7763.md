Editorial on Trees in Burra

The Council will spend £50 in Middle Ward and £40 in North Ward this season.  This follows the approval of tree planting for Government subsidy.  It may be unwise to continue roadside planting from Kooringa to the Mine Store pending alterations to the road contemplated by the Road Board, but the street on the eastern side of the creek would be a good place.  In North Ward there are places near the two bridges on the main road [?] and from the iron bridge to the boundary of North and Middle Wards where room for 60-70 trees is easily made.
