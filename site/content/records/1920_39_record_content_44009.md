‘Fair Play’ writes that the Kooringa Tennis Club is experiencing a drift of members to other courts due to the way a favoured few led by one in particular who appears to arrange all games to his own satisfaction.  This is interfering with practice.  This is written in the hope that it will prove an incentive for all members to work and play together for the future benefit of the club.
