[Charles Barber Griffiths (a grandson of John Barber Griffiths) was 83 in 1967 and wrote an article concerning an incident at the time of building the stack of the smelters chimney at Burra.]

In 1855-56 John Barber Griffiths came to Australia from Cardiff in Wales.  He was a stone mason who built and maintained furnaces.  He came to Burra as an employee of the English & Scottish Copper Co.

With him were his wife Sarah and son Charles Barber and five daughters: Sarah, Addie, Elizabeth, Prisilla [sic] and Polly.  Two more children, John and Francis, were born in Australia.  Charles Barber had been apprenticed in Wales as a stone mason at the age of 8 and was 12 when he arrived in Burra where he continued as an apprentice with his father.

Before telling of the incident, I would like to say something of the building of the smelting works.  It was a well-built place.  The front was about 200 feet long with one big arch after another and the height of the wall was c. 15 feet.  Inside, down the centre was another row of arches and the back was the same.  Both ends walls were, I think, without openings. The whole building had a big iron gable roof.  The furnaces were built at the back of the arches.  The smoke was taken from the earth furnace into a big tunnel, which ran along the back row of arches and then went underground for c. 20 ft before going up the chimney stack.  The tunnel had smoke boxes off the side of it about the size of a room.  I remember there were two of them.  They used to tell me they were used to stop the smoke from turning round and round and if there was too much smoke all at once it would go back into these boxes.  My father used to tell me about the building of this chimney, which was said to be 100 ft high.  It was c. 12 ft square at the bottom and my father said it was 4 ft 6 inches square at the top.

This is the incident about the building of the chimney.

It was built from the inside with all the scaffolding on the inside of it.  When the masons were building the cap to the top of the stack an inspector came and climbed the scaffolding to near the cap.  The masons were commenting on its great height, but the inspector said ‘You don’t call this stack high do you?’

One of them said it was the highest the inspector was every likely to get off the ground.

‘Tell that to the Marines.’ Said the inspector.

‘Why, I’d jump off this thing any day for a bottle of brandy.’

‘Well, jump,’ said one of the masons ‘and we’ll give you a bottle of brandy, but you had better drink it before you jump, for you will never drink anymore after you do jump.’

He accepted the dare and they accepted his wager.

The next day he returned with an umbrella and climbed to the top of the stack and asked if they had the bottle of brandy.  They said they had.

‘Well, I’m going to jump now; you can come down after me and give it to me then.’

His umbrella had chords attached to the top.  They crossed over the top and then were attached to the handle and he then fastened those chords to his wrist.  He then stepped onto the cap on the northeast corner and jumped off.  He landed on a heap of sand and was not hurt in any way.  He got his bottle of brandy.

My father said they all needed a bottle of brandy when they saw him jump, as they thought to see him get killed.

When I was a boy of 8 I used to play in this smoke tunnel.  After the mine closed the furnaces were pulled down and the tunnel where the smoke entered was opened up and another new hole made in the top of the tunnel.  At the foot of the stack we used to get inside and look up.  The stack would sway as all stacks do in the wind.  Looking up you would see blackness and then a thin strip of light would appear and gradually it would grow into a square before slowly narrowing again until all the light would be gone.
