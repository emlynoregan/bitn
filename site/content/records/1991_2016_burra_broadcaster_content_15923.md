The Sporting Car Club of SA will hold a Burra to Morgan run of veteran vehicles on 9-10 May.  This has been inspired by the completion of the bituminised road and celebrates similar runs in the early 1900s.  Three cars that took part in the 1906 run will take part this time:

A 1905 Wolsley formerly owned by the Warnes family and now by Ian & Marie Tilbrok of Clare.

1904 De Dion Bouton formerly owned by Dr Sangster of Burra and now to be driven by current owner John Wien Smith.

Les & Nan Warnes will drive their Newton Bennett.

[The last named could not have been in the 1906 run, as it was a 1913 model car.]
