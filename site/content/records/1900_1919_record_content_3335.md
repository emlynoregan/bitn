Court.

Two men have been taken to Adelaide by M-C Phelan in the past week for being repeatedly drunk: David Maxwell Stewart, after his fourth conviction in a week, and Fred. Camp.

Mrs Howell went at the same time following her failure to pay the fine resulting from the recent case.  Mr Howell has paid his fine and promises a sensational trial for false imprisonment in his wifeâ€™s case.
