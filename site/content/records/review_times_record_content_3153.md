Redruth Gaol has won a $50,000 grant from the Commonwealth Banking Organisation for renovations.  President of the Burra National Trust, Maureen Wright, said they were delighted.  Work to be done includes salt damp treatment, repair of stonework, re-capping, plastering, painting and re-pointing.   Some interpretive displays would also be financed.  The car park would be upgraded and a toilet block erected.  This would enable the facility to be hired out for functions.  The gaol would be the venue for the Redruth drama event during the Copper Festival in October.  When the Trust acquired the building in 1977 the cost of restoration was estimated at $80,000.  The Trust had so far spent about $31,000.  It was worthwhile as the Gaol now attracted about 30,000 visitors per year.  The money is a bicentennial grant and so work would probably not start till 1987.
