Mt Bryan East and the Floods

The rain started on 22 January with up to 40 points at the north end of the district.  Thursday began quietly, but clouds built up and in the afternoon another 30-40 points fell in the north end of the district.  With totals of around 80 points Dust Hole Creek carried a fairly large flood and the areas problems about water supply were solved.  Damage to fencing had been largely confined to where it crossed watercourses.  But more was to come.  On Friday at about 11 a.m. the build-up of clouds finally let fly and the heavens opened.  Many felt the yearâ€™s supply of rain was coming in one shower.  Dust Hole Creek rose higher and carried away large trees and with them any remnants of fences.  Steady rain then continued Friday afternoon and through Saturday.  Dust Hole Creek was in high flood for sixty hours.  Already the country has a green tinge.  Total gaugings across the district varied from 170 to 327 points and damage done was negligible compared with the benefits received.
