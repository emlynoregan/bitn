Burra Town Council, 5 September

The Local government Department allocates £200 from the Unemployment Relief Fund for work on the Clare-Burra and Kapunda-Peterborough main roads.

The Mayor complained that it could not all be used on these roads, as the work was not needed, but it was not allowed to be used where needed.  After discussion it was decided to accept the grant and go on with the work.  [Apparently with an intention of submitting a request to spend the balance after using the £100 needed on the roads nominated.]

Elder, Smith & Co. have offered certain pipes to improve the crossings to the saleyards.  Accepted.

The issue of Mr John Tennant’s road from Princess Royal was discussed as previously noted.

The Mayor said £120 had been spent on a crossing 18 months ago.  East Ward Councillors will inspect.

There was considerable discussion over Mr O.J. Oates’ request to add a stone kitchen to his home.  [The Councillors were annoyed because the contract had gone to a city contractor and no plans and specifications had been submitted.]  Eventually they gave the Inspector the right to give permission if plans were submitted and he approved of them.

Hirschausen Bros replied concerning the ‘interference’ with the Ranger over the cows.  They offered to pay poundage fees for one cow and apologised, though they did not know why they should, as they had asked the Ranger to allow them to take a cow and he had consented.

Cr March moved they accept this offer if the solicitor’s fees and poundage were paid.  These were 10/- for poundage and 10/- for the lawyer.  If it went to court fees would rise steeply.

R.A. Bevan & T.P. Halls complained of unlicensed carriage of passengers to the station.

Cr Bevan said the Act was only being carried out in a half-hearted way and the Mayor agreed that the bus drivers needed a fair go.  [The whole matter was complicated and was discussed at some length.]
