Burra Town Council

A letter from the RSL stated they had inspected the area between the Rotunda and the Memorial and there was not room for a mound, but a concrete structure was suggested.

Mr Hirschausen has done some unauthorised road work near his house.  On inspection it was found to be needed work and was done well.  He is unemployed and the Council resolved to pay him Â£3-15-0 if he completes six chains, though Cr Kellaway was opposed to setting such a precedent and so was the Mayor.

People camping at Victoria Park were destroying seats and doing other damage.  The gates are to be locked.

General Aid Society met 10 July to finalise financial matters.  The balance sheet having been audited was adopted.  Miss Bubb took the chair and it was resolved to re-organise the General Aid Society.  Elected were President, Mrs Helen Rowe; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames F. Pearce Sen., J. Turner & A.S. Field; Treasurer, Mrs R. Chambers and Hon. Secretary Mrs R. Voumard.

Miss Bubb wished the re-organised society every success.  Meetings will be held in Redruth Memorial Hall on first Thursday in each month.
