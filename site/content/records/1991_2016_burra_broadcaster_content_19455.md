Burra Red Cross raised $5,588 in the past year.  Much of this was due to the great efforts of Sarah Jaensch on behalf of her son George, who was the branch’s baby of the year.  The fashion parade ‘From Work & Western’ alone raised $1,018.  Elected for 1999-2000: President, Fay Jones; Secretary, Jan Tiver and Treasurer, Pat Kakoschke.
