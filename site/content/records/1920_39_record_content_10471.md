Burra Town Council, 4 April

The Fire Brigade Board is enquiring into the recent Aberdeen fire.

A series of minor road and path works was approved.

Cr Harris moved the fire bell be moved from the Police Station to the Fire Station.

Cr Kellaway thought that placing it in a conspicuous location like that was courting misuse.

The Mayor thought the Fire station was its natural location.

Cr Kellawayâ€™s amendment that it not be moved was carried.
