A Trip Through the Northern Areas

I travelled by train to Saddleworth at a minimum speed of about 16 m.p.h.  The road from the Saddleworth Station to the town was absolutely dangerous.  The new road from Saddleworth to Auburn was lined with ruts about 3 ft deep and 1 ft wide into which men were throwing metal without draining off the water.  Inattention to drainage is the secret of the defective state of this road.  From Auburn to Clare the road is good and the feed abundant.  There is not much cultivation and the little we saw seemed to want warmth.  From Clare there are two options.  One takes you via Rochester, Collingsfield, Redhill and Crystal Brook to Pt Pirie and the other reached the same place via Anama, Broughton, Gulnare, Georgetown, Narridy and Rocky River.  For the former route the coach leaves Tuesdays and Fridays after the arrival of the coach from Saddleworth and stays overnight at Collingsfield, reaching Pt Pirie at about 2 p.m. the next day (30/-).   On the latter route you leave at the same times and days via the Pt Augusta mail coach to Georgetown and then change to the cross country mail cart, which travels all night and arrives Pt Pirie at about 9 a.m. the next morning (35/-).  The first route is recommended as the latter is very wearisome and dangerous at night.

From Clare to Bungaree the road has been metalled for some distance.  At Bungaree the feed was magnificent and the landscape parklike.  Bungaree has a pretty lodge and a fine entrance with a carriage drive to Mr Hawker’s house, behind which is a substantially built church.  The road undulates through Bungaree Paddock and then crests the range with a mad scamper down to Rochester, bumping over stumps and boulders with passengers spending much of the time in the air to the detriment of their hats.  Rochester is but a smithy and a store.  Our coach was a kind of Hawker’s wagon that had seen better days and its canvas cover much torn by passing trees and its interior much bedaubed with mud.  There were a few paddocks of good wheat about 16 miles north of Clare, but not many homesteads and the area did not look prosperous.  The 18 miles or so from Rochester to Collingsfield is very flat and suited to agriculture.  We saw several wild turkeys at dusk.  At Collingsfield the accommodation was in a little pine hut divided into a kitchen and three bedrooms with plenty of holes in the walls and a chimney so ineffective that the doors had to be left open.  Women are advised not to attempt the journey.  The impudent get the few beds and the modest have the floor.  The area has good looking crops of wheat.
