Mr W.T. Rabbich.  There is a brief and somewhat oblique reference, giving only his surname, to William Thomas Rabbich, a former Burra Mayor who had gone to live in Boulder WA.  He was apparently standing for election, but for what is not made clear.  [Later reference discloses that it was for election as Mayor of Boulder.]  His political opponent ‘stigmatised Rabbich as a political weathercock, a beer and brick politician, a prevaricator, a strange old man, who had been an unsuccessful aspirant for the only position in Boulder that he could satisfactorily fill – the position of Sanitary Inspector’. 

[This suggests he was as controversial a figure in local politics in Boulder as he had been earlier in Burra where he was a Councillor 1880-1882, 1888-1892 & 1894-96 and Mayor December 1892 –November

1893.]
