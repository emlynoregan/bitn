Burra Preschool Kindergarten hosted the first session of Funded Occasional Care last Tuesday.  It aims to give parents a break for shopping, appointments or visiting friends and priority access goes to parents not in paid work, Aboriginal & TSI parents and children not involved in other child care services, from low income families and children or parents with a disability or who are at risk.  Corinna Kelly is the new teacher for FOC.
