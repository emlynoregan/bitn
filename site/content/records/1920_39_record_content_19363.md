Redruth Court

Otto Joroslafsky was fined 10/- for drunkenness.

Peter Moller was fined 7/6 for drunkenness.

John Jones was charged with the theft of Rev. E. Smith’s suitcase from a car at the rear of the Kooringa Methodist Church on 26 April.  The contents were valued at c. £2-10-0.

He was apprehended at Collinsville on 27 April when M-C John Johns recognised a pyjama suit he was wearing under other clothes, as being from the case.  He was sentenced to 1 month in jail.

He was also charged with having two £1 notes and a 10/- note, 23 pennies and a pair of silver sleeve links suspected of having been stolen.  Frederick William Atkins of Mt Bryan described the articles as those stolen from him.  The accused’s explanation for possessing the items was inconsistent and unconvincing and he was sentenced to 6 months; the term to be concurrent with the above sentence.

He was also charged with stealing a bicycle the property of Linden A. Riggs on the night of the 26 April; value £10.  The bicycle was found at Collinsville and he had claimed it was given to him by his deceased brother.  On this he was committed for sentence.

He was further charged with breaking into the house of J.W. Best of Mt Bryan East and stealing a cash box containing various items.  Best had seen Jones walking away from his house and had sent for the police on discovering that items were missing.  On this he was committed for trial.
