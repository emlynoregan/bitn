Local Board of Health

After inspection it was thought a little work could improve the fall in gutters in the town centre.  There was considerable dissension over people who ran waste water into the street.  It was not allowed under the act, but if it was not impure water that created a health hazard several Councillors saw no harm and a considerable unnecessary expense would be imposed on businessmen etc. to make alternative arrangements.  The main cause of the contention was water from washing cars at Glenister & Sams Garage.

Cr Kellaway moved that the provisions of the Health Act be carried out in all cases.  Carried after much debate.
