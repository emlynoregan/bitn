James Vincent Quinn

58 years old and a Mt Bryan Farmer married to Rosemary.  Standing for re-election.  Currently on the Works Committee and chairman of the Finance Committee.  If re-elected it will be my 5th term.  I believe I have acquired the experience needed to help us through the difficult times ahead.
