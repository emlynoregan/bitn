Cr Samuel and Mr A.D. McDonald spoke in support.

The Premier said he could not answer the technical issues and would leave them to Dr Ward and the Minister of Mines.  The Government was anxious to restart copper mining in Australia, which was short of copper in the present circumstances, but it had to be done by private enterprise.  Dr Ward and his Dept. would go into any scheme suggested.  The Government was prepared to subsidise a worthwhile scheme £ for £, but Dr Ward and the Dept. would have to consider all proposals put to them.  Though copper was now pegged at £76 per ton, the price would fall once the war ended.  He did not think the quality of the Burra water was adequate for the Whyalla purposes, but would put it to the Engineer in Chief.  He had placed the scheme before a large mining company that was not prepared to take it on at present.  He would place it before others.

Mr McEwin said that the old records of the mine were fragmentary and not very informative.  Existing plans do not show the workings when the mine ceased and some of the reputed deeper workings were not shown.  Little is known of the Burra ores except that most of the wealth was from carbonate ores.  Some information by H.R. Hancock 40 years ago is useful, but fragmentary.  It is remarkable that no effort seems to have been made to determine the ore bodies below the open cut.  Deeper operations were carried out from Morphett’s Shaft, some 1,200 ft from the centre of the open cut, with no evidence of crosscutting from Graves’ only 360 ft from the centre of the open cut.  The need to provide electric power for two million gallons a day suggests the construction of an independent power plant.  Diamond drilling would probably not obtain satisfactory results in porous limestone country and shafts and crosscutting would be necessary to prove the lodes.  Probably Morphett’s Shaft should be limited to unwatering with crosscutting from Graves’.

The lodes need to be tested before further development.  If the ore carried sufficient copper there would be no difficulty with funding.  The development scheme would have to take into account the costs of equipment, running expenses, including pumping for the whole of its duration.  The Government could not be expected to make public statements calculated to induce investment in a speculative venture of this kind.  There is considerable uncertainty about the success of the project.  A detailed program of operations would be needed before the Government would consider financial assistance.  The Government would be sympathetic to any well-considered proposal.  Remember that the Government funds in wartime are limited, with many other calls on them.

The visitors had lunch at the Kooringa Hotel prior to the meeting.
