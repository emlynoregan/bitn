Mr Hartwell of NSW visited Burra on Friday. He was very pleased to visit his birthplace of 65 years ago: the Market Square Museum, where he lived with his parents, three sisters and four brothers.

[This was Cornelius Greville Hartnett born 30 March 1903 to Jeremiah & Catherine nee Wade.  However, SA Births CD only records two girls and four boys in the family.]
