H.J. Button writes concerning the Council and single unemployed, saying that all unemployed men have the sympathy of the Council, but the married generally are ratepayers who have a greater call on the Council morally to get back some of their rates in wages.  The preference to married men is in reality a preference for children and their mothers, just as when a ship is sinking.

T.H. Woollacott, Mayor of Burra
