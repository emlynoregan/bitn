H.J. Button writes urging recognition that with the Burra Mine the town has a tourist attraction to rival the Blue Lake at Mt Gambier.  During a roam round the old mine property recently he says he found mine records, some dating back to 1850 just blowing round the ground.  It should be preserved and advertised.
