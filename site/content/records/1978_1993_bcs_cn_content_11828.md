Burra Burra DC

26 observers attended the last Council meeting and a petition was presented calling for a halt to Market Square changes until an artistâ€™s impression and plans had been published in the press and a public meeting held.  The petition gained 570 signatures in just four days.  The National Trust also asked that Council seek advice from town planners qualified in heritage areas before proceeding and expressed concern at the unsuitability of the type of lighting pole currently being installed.  Discussions with Highways Department and ETSA and the National Trust are underway.
