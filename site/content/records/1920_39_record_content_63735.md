The Methodist Centenary Tea was held at the Kooringa Sunday School and was arranged by the ladies of the Guild on 6 October.  It was different from previous teas in being served at small scattered tables and folk moved from table to table as they liked.  Having partaken of tea people moved into the church, which was utilised as an overflow lounge.  The Centenary Cake was cut by the oldest living member of the church, Mr Charles J. Pearce.  It had been baked by Mr W.M. Heath and iced and decorated by Miss Dorothy Pearce.  The lower tier was a green and yellow map of Australia and the upper tier held a replica of the old gum tree with an Aboriginal on guard.  Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook presided.  Proceeds exceeded Â£20.  [Some of those present are listed.]
