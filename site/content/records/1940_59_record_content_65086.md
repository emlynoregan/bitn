[The Editor clearly thought the above criticisms were excessive.  He noted that in the past few years approximately 33 trees had been removed from the town area (presumably he meant by Council action rather than by vandalism and natural causes) and these are listed.  The reasons were either because they were dangerous or damaging property or prevented the expansion of business.  And he says that in the past nine years the Council had planted some 300 trees – not including some 200 planted by the CWA and the Ex-Servicemen’s Avenues.]
