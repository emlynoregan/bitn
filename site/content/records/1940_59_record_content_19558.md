Burra Town Council

Community Centre

The Council recently received a letter asking if there were any plans for a Community Centre in Burra and at the last meeting of Council Cr Fisher again broached the subject.  He thought Council should get information about the community centres being established in towns throughout the country.

The Mayor said there should be a Boy Scout Troop.

Cr Fisher said centres were not just for Boy Scouts, but for the whole community, especially the young.

Burra Institute

A meeting of Council on 20 November decided to go ahead with the purchase of the Institute subject to ratepayer approval.  The transfer would carry a loan from the State Bank of SA of £3,160 at 4% interest to be repaid in half-yearly instalments of £112-14-2 with the right to pay off the whole or a portion at any time with three months’ notice.  A meeting of ratepayers will be called to approve the purchase.  100 ratepayers or one-twentieth of those on the roll could demand a poll be held to decide the issue.

The Town Clerk’s Resignation

This was discussed at the Council meeting on 20 November.  The Mayor said that as the Council did not have a superannuation scheme he would suggest the Town Clerk be given three months’ full pay in token of his work for the Council.  A similar thing had been done when Mr Rosewall resigned as Overseer after many years with the Council.

Cr Kellaway asked if the Town Clerk could carry on till the end of the financial year, as it would save the Council about 15 guineas in auditors’ fees, as they would have to come when he resigned as well as at the end of the financial year.  Mr Davey said he would try to do so.

The Town Clerk’s resignation was accepted with regret from the end of June 1945.

Burra Burra DC made a presentation to Mr M.S. Edwards who has resigned as Acting District Clerk to become the Town Clerk at Jamestown.  The various Councillors thanked Mr Edwards who had been Acting Clerk for over three years.  They wished him well.  He was presented with an inscribed walking stick.
