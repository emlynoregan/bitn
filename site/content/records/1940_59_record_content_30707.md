‘The Man Who Sees’ responds to criticism of Ex-Mayor Woollacott’s scheme that brought people to live in Burra in empty houses during the war years.  He awards 12 points:

1 to the Government that welcomed the idea to reduce congestion in the city.

1 to the transferred people who welcomed the move.

2 to the Corporation which gained income from buildings previously producing little.

3 to the owners of the buildings many of which have since been rightly condemned.

4 to be distributed to general businesses and trades who as a result removed to larger premises or into retirement.

1 to those who administered to the transferred people’s sickness and bereavement.

The editor denied that the article was a criticism of the Mayor’s scheme or that it was intended that the people who came be asked to vacate their homes.  It was simply an explanation of why there was now a housing shortage in the town.
