G.S. Hawker MP has been told by the authorities that Burra will not get a bitumen road for at least two years.  The Minister blamed lack of manpower whilst the Highways Dept. thought matters might be speeded up if the Saddleworth Council could do some preliminary work, if they could obtain the necessary machinery.  The Clare-Spalding road is being or is about to be bituminised, as it was built during the war and only had to be sprayed.  This was also the case with the Jamestown-Clare road.  Burra had earlier been told lack of bitumen was the problem for the Burra road.
