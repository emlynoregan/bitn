Storm.

Last Friday, 11 December, the period of hot dry weather was broken by a shower of rain at noon and then at 4 p.m. thunder, lightning and a severe hailstorm was accompanied by a hurricane wind.  Floodwaters threatened many shops.  Water entered almost every room in the Burra Hotel and Drew & Crewes large cellar half filled with water.  The suddenness of the short downpour caused watertables and gutters to overflow in all directions.

[The paper says the fall was 600 points, but the paper’s usage seems to be that 1 point is a thousandth of an inch, whereas later usage was a hundredth of an inch.  Here 0.6” is much more believable than 6”.]

At Mt Bryan Mr Prior’s wheat crop was cut to the ground by hail and wind as if mowed and all surrounding crops suffered badly.  (Mr Prior’s crop at Baldina has been destroyed by rabbits.)

Several houses at Ironmine were unroofed as were several at Baldina.

The Mt Bryan Road was flooded for a considerable distance.

Mr Forder’s windmill was flattened.

At Baldina creeks and dams overflowed and saltbush was stripped to twigs, destroying essential summer feed.

J. Morgan lost his roof from three rooms with the iron carried ¼ mile away.

But the storm was very confined with very little rain at Shafton or at Mongolata.

Correspondents reported hail and storm damage as follows:

Mt Bryan - severe with a fall of 1.10” in a short time

Hallett - severe crop damage

Koolunga - severe crop damage with hail the size of pigeon eggs
