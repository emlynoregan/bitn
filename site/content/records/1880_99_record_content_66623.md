Bicycle Polo Match last Wednesday.  	William J. Richard’s side 11 goals 14 behinds

James Richard’s side 10 goals 17 behinds

This was played on the flat at Aberdeen adjoining R. Reed’s residence.  This is a good site, but small and the polo ground proper would have been better.  The game raised £1 for the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc. and was followed by a smoke social at the Kooringa Hotel.
