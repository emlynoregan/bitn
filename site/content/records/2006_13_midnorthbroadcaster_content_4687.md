Burra Men’s Shed has received a donation of $550 from Peter Opperman of Oppy’s IGA.  The group is still in the process of securing a lease on a property in Smelts Road.  Oppy’s has previously made donations to the Boy Scouts, the Burra Hospital and Senior Citizens.

[Presumably where they ended up; actually in Landore St, which is the continuation of Smelts Road north of Ludgvan Street.]
