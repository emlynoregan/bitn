Letter.  Meredith Satchell writes concerning the WWI activities in Burra of the Cheer-Up Society.  She was particularly concerned about the fate of some 200 photographs that once graced the walls of the Cheer-Up Room in Pearce’s Buildings.  She says that she and Eric Fuss are researching details of the district’s WWI soldiers, with a view to publishing a book detailing them and the references to the in the Burra Record.  She appeals for any photographs that would enhance the publication.
