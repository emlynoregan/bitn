Burra Cards.  The Market Square card is reproduced with the comment that ‘Market Square has changed little since the mines closed down in 1877.’

[This is an odd comment when of the structures shown none were there in 1877.  The scene shows Drew & Crewes Store (1880), Elders Building (Visitor Centre) (1890) Burra Hotel with its second floor (1912), the Fallen Soldiers Memorial (1922) and some shops which replaced those destroyed by a fire in 1883.]
