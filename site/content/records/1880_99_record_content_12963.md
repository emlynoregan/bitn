Elections.  When nominations closed on 15 April the names put forward were:

J.A. Cockburn of Jamestown, Doctor of Medicine.

W. Ridgway of Aberdeen, Gentleman.

W.B. Rounsevell of Glenelg, Wine & Spirit Merchant.

J.R. Stephens of Kooringa, Doctor of Medicine.

The election takes place on 23 April.

‘An Elector’ writes to urge the election of two local men and not W.B. Rounsevell who is in favour of the sale of public land, opposed to payment of MPs, for taxing land, and says nothing in support of local government.  W.B. Rounsevell’s interests in the NT favour nominal rents on long leases and the maintenance of the land monopoly.

‘An Elector’ writes that Dr Cockburn’s tax scheme would tax all land according to its value.  W.B. Rounsevell’s scheme would tax productive land twice and unproductive land once [by imposing both a land tax and an income tax.]

J.W. O’Brien writes in support of W.B. Rounsevell who ‘has represented the district well for the last nine years’.
