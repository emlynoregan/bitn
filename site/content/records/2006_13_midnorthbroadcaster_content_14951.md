Saltbush Clothing Co.’s Burra store will close its doors for good on 31 July after more than 24 years in operation.  It was begun in early 1988 by Elspeth and Graham Radford established the company from their farm just outside of Burra.  When Elspeth was unable to buy hard-wearing and smart moleskin trousers and co-ordinating shirts for her two young sons, she made her own.  Friends requested similar garments and the company grew from a cottage business to one producing more than 40,000 garments annually.  They were retailed through 120 stores across Australia.  They were also available by mail order from a website and from two retail outlets later opened in Adelaide and Victor Harbor.  It 1995 they won the Telstra & SA Government Small Business Award in the category for fewer than six employees.  [The next paragraph repeats this information, but says they were finalists rather than the winners.]  They were finalists in the 1995 Channel 9 Small Business Show Award and in 1996 Elspeth Radford was a finalist in the 1966 Telstra & SA Government Business Woman of the Year Award. In 1996 The Saltbush Catalogue won a bronze medal in the National Print Awards.  In 2000 the company won the SA Regional Tourism Award for retail and in 2001 Elspeth was again a finalist in the Telstra Business Woman of the Year Award.  The business has developed a loyal customer base, but Elspeth said closing it was the right business decision.  The total retail environment had changed and it was time to move on.  When production moved off shore Elspeth personally visited the factories ensuring professional and ethical practices.  Most production became off shore with specific companies.  She said there had been a huge reduction in tourists coming through, even compared with last year, with only about 50% of the number to the same time.  A final sale of fixtures and fittings will be held in mid August.
