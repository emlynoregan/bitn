‘A Friend to the Bushman’ writes in response to ‘Hawker’

[He argues that far from supporting the idea of a home, if the squatters were as against the interests of the bushmen as ‘Hawker’ suggests, they would be encouraging his continued squandering of his earnings, so making him more dependent on them.  As for the alleged unpopularity of the chairman and secretary; even if this were true, they are no guaranteed to hold their position once the scheme was established and certainly one a series of homes was established, they would hardly be controlling them all.  He then takes up the issue of the need of the homes and the accusation of the patronising nature of the movement.  He admits that there are many who do not need either reform or assistance, but to say that there is no role for the idea is nonsense.

‘But it is too true that bushmen of the lower class are improvident, drunken and immoral.  It is well known that after receiving their wages – sometimes a considerable sum – they will go to a public-house, and give the owner their money on the understanding that they are to drink it out and it is no less true that these unfortunate men are fleeced in the most shameless manner.  No wonder that publicans and storekeepers oppose the movement; it would deprive them of their large ill-gotten gains.’

He continues to say that when established there was opposition to the Sailor’s Home, but no one now says that they are degraded by frequenting the home.  He continues with other argument before concluding:

‘A “Home” is much more wanted in Adelaide than at the Burra, where not more than half a dozen bushmen would ever think of spending their holidays.  It is chiefly to the capital that the bushman looks for what he calls his “spree,” and it is there that he requires care and protection more than anywhere.’
