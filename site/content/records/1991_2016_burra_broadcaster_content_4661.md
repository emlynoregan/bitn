Burra Hospital.  Some points from Chairman John Brak’s Annual Report:

The Health Towards 2000 Survey showed unanimous support for the retention of existing services.

The need to upgrade the Casualty & Theatre areas of the hospital was reinforced.

Increases were urged in Women’s Health Services and GP services – the need for a female GP to complement Dr Oswald’s service in Burra.

The development of a walk-in freezer/coolroom and a dry food storage area has been urged by senior staff.

The upgrading of the Casualty & Theatre areas has been helped by the bequest from the estate of the late Miss Agnes Seigert.

The Student Boarding Facility in the former Nurses’ Home has been an enormous success.
