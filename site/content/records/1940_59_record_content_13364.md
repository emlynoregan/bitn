Annual FFCF Anzac Appeal

The committee again decided on a personal appeal instead of Anzac Sports and this has turned out to be a great success with £439 presently in hand with some cheques still to come in, so that the target of £450 seems likely to be reached.  Last year’s total was £423.  Burra’s effort closed last Friday with a long night dance in the Institute that drew a large attendance.  The profit of this was expected to be c. £30.
