Editorial

As we start the third year of publication we are setting targets for expansion to become a part of life in Burra.  Conversations with other printers and newspaper publishers reveal that generally they found 1992 a tough year in a highly competitive field.  Despite the difficulties most also reported that in these difficult times they had found people resorting more to small regional advertising as the most efficient way to increase sales.

The Broadcaster itself has grown and increasingly trades and services from outside the town have appeared in its pages.  In 1992 our sister paper the Jamestown Journal appeared.  This has grown with the support of the local community and has become a profitable medium for both advertising and news.  This in turn has resulted in other larger papers giving Jamestown a stronger focus in their reports.  We hope to do the same for Burra in 1993.

One of the chief complaints about the Broadcaster is that it focuses on politics and sport and is too much of a ‘greenie, feminist’ paper.  This may be so, but we publish what people choose to submit.  We employ up to nine people, but have yet to take on a journalist, so we rely absolutely on public information.

We appeal to all bodies in the Burra community, business, private and sporting to take advantage of the Broadcaster.
