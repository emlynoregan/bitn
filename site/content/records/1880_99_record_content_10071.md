J. Rooney also writes - with the view that the recent court case merely upheld larrikinism.  The cause of this outburst of larrikinism has however been absent from the paper.  On the occasion of the entertainment in aid of the Volunteer Brass Band I criticised the performance of some of that Company so severely in your issue of 4 May - one in particular, T.T. Shortridge, has admitted in court that he completely broke down in his song, that he knew he could not sing.  This criticism led to the preconceived plan to upset the entertainment of which I was the manager.  The conduct was indulged in before the performers began the items and so could not be a result of audience reaction to unsatisfactory performance.  The court case was not proceeded with just because of the actions on the night of the performance.  The abuse continued in the street and extended to others of the company.  Rooney then comments on ‘Cynic’: -

‘wit, however, seems to have been dealt out long before his advent into this “world of cares and sorrows” . . . the ass knows no better.’
