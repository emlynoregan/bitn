The Primitive Methodist Church was opened as a mission in Burra in 1849 when the first church was built.  It was opened by Rev. J. Long who was in charge of the Adelaide Mission.  The church had to close when the men rushed to the Victorian goldfields, but re-opened in 1854 when Rev. J.G. Wright was appointed.  There were 2 members â€“ Mr & Mrs Wright.  By 1857 membership was 84 and in 1885 it was 114.  The church continued to make good progress till Methodist Union in 1901.
