French Flag Day raised £300 for French Red Cross.  Lunches and afternoon tea was provided in Market Square and at the saleyards.  The Band under A.G. Shortridge played in the rotunda.  Badges and ribbons were sold.  Mr Crewes gave one of his patriotic speeches.  A French flag and a French banner were auctioned.

Mr Winnall supported the Mayor.
