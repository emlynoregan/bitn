BCS

Years 5 & 6 Camp at Halbury was very successful.  Students undertook map-making, sketching, weaving, rent-making and hiking.  The evening saw dancing and music-making.  On Wednesday softball and cricket matches were staged with Balaklava School.  Thursday saw a visit to Balaklava swimming Pool.

The Year 12 students visited Adelaide and Flinders Universities and the Career Reference Centre.  They saw two films relevant to their studies: Barry Lyndon and Great Expectations.  They went to the SA Theatre Company’s performance of Coriolanus and also saw the Lhama Theatre of Tibet and the Negro Ensemble’s production of The Story of the Blind Pig as well as a performance of Basically Black; concerning racial discrimination.  Community Week also saw Year 10 & 11 students giving assistance with restoration work at the Bon Accord manager’s residence.  Year 9 students helped with some restoration work at Paxton’s Square.
