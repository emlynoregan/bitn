Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting

After some discussion Mr Pinch took the chair.  The Mayor then gave his report: substantially as published in the Record.

The Mayor was asked by Mr Sampson if the assessment was passed at the meeting of 12 September.  Yes said the Mayor.

Then why was it passed again on 2 October?

The Mayor merely said the one was identical with the other and the chair considered it answered.  Mr Sampson didn’t.

Mr Watt also considered the answer unsatisfactory and asked for further explanation.

The Mayor merely repeated himself.

Cr Hardy rose to account for his stewardship, but received considerable heckling – he said he had been boycotted by people in all parts of the town and that was his sole reason for standing again.

Cr Linkson then reported on his role for the year and that North Ward had gone from a £12 debit to a £9-£10 credit balance.

Cr Harris had little to say.

Mr Vivian asked why £18 had been spent close to Cr Harris’s house.  It was work needed, but not done to meet his requirements. (Cry of bunkum.)

P.L. Killicoat has agreed to run for Mayor.  He had no new policy, but would do his duty and keep strict watch over the town.

W.T. Rabbich also announced he was a candidate – he said the working expenses of Council needed to fall.

How?

He would seek to reduce the Town Clerk’s salary by £10 p.a.

Cr Hardy said he had been asked to come out again for East Ward.

A voice: Who asked you? (Laughter)

He said he could tell some very funny incidents that occurred in Council in the last 12 months, but then decided not to and was then goaded into saying:

‘There were certain monies paid away that should never have been.  He would refer to one chief item which had been paid to the Record office (Laughter and dissent) – last year £42-11-9 went to the Record office. – He could make a saving of £100 at any rate – by amalgamation of offices.’

He said the price of water should be reduced or the scale re-arranged and some property values should be decreased – but not SAMA property.

Cr Harris is also to contest West Ward.

Cr Linkson will contest North Ward.

He thought the assessment was 30% too high.  He said Mr Davey received less than the Town Clerks elsewhere with less to do than him.  He would oppose any reduction in his salary.

Mr Cave would be a candidate again for auditor and with respect to W. Davey ‘Any proposal to reduce his salary could only come from an idiot and a man who knew nothing about business.  (Cheers)’
