Phoenix Exploration Proposal, Public Information Forum, Burra Town Hall, Monday night.

The meeting was held to discuss the proposal by Phoenix Copper Ltd to list the Reserve on the Monster Mine Reserve to enable mineral exploration in the area.

The Town Hall meeting drew about 200 people to hear about the proposal from Phoenix Copper Ltd Managing Director Paul Dowd and to gauge public opinion in Burra.

Among the audience were Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP and Mark Parnell MLC and Shadow Minister for Environment and Conservation Michelle Lensink.

Mayor Peter Mattey chaired the meeting, which was to gauge public opinion before Council made its submission to PIRSA on the matter.

Phoenix Copper’s Managing Director Paul Dowd and chief geologist Mark Manly presented a slide show of the company’s proposal, outlining where they hoped to explore and how they would go about it.  Questions were repeatedly asked about what would happen if significant copper discoveries led to mining development.  Some people were strongly opposed to the proposition and others were clearly excited by the development prospects it offered.  Former PIRSA senior geologist and author spoke for the National Trust and expressed his belief that successful exploration would inevitably be followed by mining and that could not but damage Burra’s heritage, the chances of World Heritage listing and tourism.  The Burra History Group also voiced its opposition in the cause of preserving the town’s authentic heritage.  A local landowner expressed the concerns of a number of people about the effect of mining on the water table and the users of bores in the area.  Mr Dowd said there was no intention to dewater the mine for exploration and before any mining a detailed water management plan would be implemented.  He also again assured people that the preservation of mining heritage was paramount.  The initial testing program would involve five test holes and take about three months.  If the results were unsuccessful they would have to reconsider any further activity, but if the initial results were promising then testing 300 m beneath the mine would follow and that could take up to two years.  Mark Parnell (Greens) MLC spoke for the Ratepayers Action Group and said only 5% of the state was closed to mineral exploration and mining and amendments to the Mining Act were being debated next week and they would consider special places to be off limits to mining.  Maybe Burra needs to be on that list.  Other people spoke up in the almost three hours of discussion and many expressed the need for progress, growth and economic development to keep the town alive and provide employment.  A show of hands at the end of the night indicated a 60/40 split with 60% in favour of the exploration proposal.
