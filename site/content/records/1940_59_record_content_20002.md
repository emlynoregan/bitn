Leighton Christmas Tree & Break-up

The annual event combining the break-up of Leighton and Gum Creek Schools was held in Leighton Hall on 21 December.  There was carol singing, and Father Christmas distributed a gift and bag of sweets to each child.  Progress Certificates* were presented.  The adults finished the evening with a dance. [References to the Burra Primary presentations for 1944 & presentations in 1946 say Qualifying Certificates were replaced with Progress Certificates in 1945.]
