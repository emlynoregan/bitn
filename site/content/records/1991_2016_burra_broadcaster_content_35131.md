Letter from Tony & Kathi Sumner of Hallett in opposition to Felicity Martin’s views of wind farms and offended that she has so little respect for the farmers that live in the area to think that they are unconcerned about the environment.  They will continue to work with the Mid North Grasslands Working Group, the Lofty Block North Threatened Orchid Recovery Team and will also work closely with Wind Prospects to ensure the protection of threatened species.  They also bear in mind the $50,000 a year that will flow to the community to aid local clubs and organisations.
