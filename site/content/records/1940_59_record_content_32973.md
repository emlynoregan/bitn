Obituary.  Mr Harold Doyle died on 12 August as the result of an accident with a Caterpillar tractor.  He was 32.  The deceased was the elder son of the late Mr & Mrs James Doyle of Mt Bryan East.  He was born at Burra North 12 November 1914 and was educated at Mt Bryan East where he lived all his life.  His ambition all along was to become a Merino Sheep Stud Master, which he had practically accomplished at the time of his death.  He was also interested in lucerne growing.  At Canowie he had 200 acres of lucerne and had planted about 100 acres at Mt Bryan East that are doing remarkably well.  He was a member of the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church, a member of the 1st & 2nd Degrees of the Methodist Order of Knights and a member of the Hallett Masonic Lodge and the Burra Mark Masonic Lodge and a member of the committee of the Mt Bryan East Agricultural Bureau.  He married in January 1945 Audrey, fourth daughter of Mr & Mrs H.R. Edwards of Mt Pleasant and late of the Mt Bryan District.  He is survived by a wife, and baby daughter Thelma and two sisters, Eileen Mrs E. Willis of Booborowie and Olive Mrs Ron Pryde of Spalding.
