Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms hotel, Kooringa, by J.D. Cave JP on Saturday 20 November regarding John Roberts who died suddenly while lying on a form outside the hotel.

William Turley, miner, said he had worked with the deceased for about 5 weeks at Waukaringa, and they had arrived in Burra on Tuesday week.  He had seen the deceased several times since and he had seemed healthy.  Last spoke to him on Friday and saw him about 3 or 4 o’clock on Saturday at the Miners’ Arms.  When deceased went to Waukaringa he had complained of a pain in the chest and said he had come out of the Burra Hospital.

Thomas Richardson, landlord of the Miners’ Arms said he had known deceased for 18-20 years.  He came to the hotel about two weeks ago and seemed to be in good health.  Knew the deceased had been in the Burra Hospital about six weeks ago, suffering from rheumatic fever.  He did not drink much.  Had nothing but peppermint that day.  He saw deceased at 10 o’clock when he told him to go into dinner.  Did not see him again till 5 o’clock when Mr Pounce told him there was a man outside lying on the form.  Went out and put him in a sitting position and unfastened his shirt at the neck.  Deceased did not appear to be dead when taken into the house.  Thought he drank some water, but he did not speak and the witness did not notice him breathing.

When Dr Nesbitt came he said the man was dead.

John Vivian, barman said deceased drank gin and peppermint, but with very little gin.  Refused to give him strong drink, having been advised by W. Turley not to do so.

William Pounce had known deceased 14 years and considered him a strong, hard-working man.  Saw him at the Hospital two or three months ago and also at the bar counter on Thursday.  Saw him several times in the bar on Friday.  Deceased appeared to be suffering from former drinking.  He was not drunk then. But looked rather muddled.  Spoke to him about 11 a.m. when he did not complain of illness.

Dr W. Peel Nesbitt said he went to the Miners’ Arms about 5 p.m. and found the man dead.  He considered the evidence insufficient to show a cause of death.

A post mortem examination was then ordered.

William Wilson said he has seen the deceased the last eight or ten days lying on forms at the Pig and Whistle and the Miners’ Arms.  Never noticed him drunk.  Saw him about 10.30 a.m. that morning, lying on the form.  Felt his pulse – there was a great throbbing on the right side.  When he awoke asked what he intended to do and advised he get work at the mine.  He said he was going to work Monday morning.

Dr Nesbitt after the post mortem said the deceased had signs of pleurisy.  The lungs were congested, but otherwise healthy.  The heart was enormously enlarged, particularly the left ventricle and both sets of valves on the left were considerably diseased.  This was the cause of death and the disease had no doubt been brought on by rheumatic fever.  This disease usually terminated in sudden death.

The jury found that John Roberts died from disease of the heart.

[John Roberts died 20 November 1875 Kooringa aged 35.]
