The New Education System is a great blunder.  In towns it is not as bad as private schools are common - of greater or lesser value - but in more sparsely settled areas there are fewer schools than before and the old system was bad enough.  We know one district with 198 school-age children and no Govt. school.  Only about 20 children receive some sort of education at two small places called schools.
