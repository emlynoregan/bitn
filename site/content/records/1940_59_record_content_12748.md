Burra Magistrate’s Court

Sarah Annie Jones was fined 5/- + 10/- fees for the failure of her son to attend school regularly.

Father M.F. Toal was fined the minimum £2 + 10/- fees for a contravention of the Bushfires Act on 15 December when he burnt grass stubble at the back of the presbytery and the fire got away into the yards of the Post Office and Institute.  He has taken precautions and had thought it legal to burn, as Corporation employees had been burning grass at about the same time.

L.M. Wilson was fined £1 + 10/- fees for leading a horse and sulky without lights on the night of 31 December.

Two minors were fined 2/6 with no costs and 1/- with 10/- costs respectively for riding bikes without lights.
