Rev. Gray organised Carol Singers who motored around the town rendering old time Christmas Carols and hymns.  Among many places visited were the Hospital and the Burra Railway Station, where they serenaded passengers of the Broken Hill Express.  They gathered donations amounting to £4-4-5 for the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.  Afterwards Mrs C. Gray entertained to supper at the Rectory.
