4 February 1993

Flood

Reference is made to a flood in the preceding week.  No date/day is given.  Emergency services were said to be undergoing debriefing and arrangements for collecting sandbags are stated as well as for retrieving lost material.

The lowest house in Young Street was threatened, but the implication is that it was saved.

The Eastern Station Road from Hogback Lane onwards is closed indefinitely.

Thank You notices later in the issue indicate that sandbagging was needed at the homes of:

Ron & Betty Thamm

Leonie & Tod Ryan

Barry & Maureen Wright (Saraâ€™s)

Ron & Geraldine Smedley [Added in the issue of 10 February.]
