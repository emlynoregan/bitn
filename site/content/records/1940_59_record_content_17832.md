‘Bull Pup’ writes as another dog in response to ‘Fox Terrier’ – taking the position of a better mannered, well-brought-up middle class dog that ends up regretting that he recently saw a Fox Terrier emerge covered in mud and blood and smelling awful after a fight down the creek, only to be welcomed by a good-looking lady dog with open arms.  As the rival Red Setter observed, ‘Humph! Preference to returned soldiers again.’
