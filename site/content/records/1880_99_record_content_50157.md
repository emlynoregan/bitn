Burra Town Council

The work at Vivian’s Hotel is to be proceeded with.  [Opie’s]

Cr Linkson wanted to know if the Corporation Bonds could be paid off by borrowing money as this could be done for 1% less than their interest rate giving a savings of £80.  The Mayor thought they could not be discharged early.  The Town Clerk will get definite information for next meeting.

Cr Linkson resigned from the Public Works and Parklands Committees saying:

‘I object to sit on any committee which includes Cr Hardy.  He is not fit _____’

[He was here cut off by Hardy and the Mayor.]
