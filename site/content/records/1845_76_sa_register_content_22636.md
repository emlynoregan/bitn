Redruth Court, 10 February

Elizabeth Neville, widow, was charged with unlawfully disposing of the body of a child of which she had recently been delivered by placing it in the closet of the Mine Hospital.  Sarah Thomas and Sarah McEwen both gave evidence that the accused had told them she was guilty of concealing the birth of the child, but had the child been born alive she would not have concealed the fact.  After the birth she had intended to bury it, but had not been able to go as far as the cemetery.  Alice Woollacott (c. 11), daughter of William Woollacott gave evidence that at about Christmas she had been sent for to make tea for the prisoner who was then very ill.  Evidence was also given that the prisoner had kept her box locked for some time until she had left with a bundle.  Esther Strike, a married woman living with her father, Mr Woollacott, said the tea incident had been at the end of November.  She had visited the prisoner later that day and found her ill and in bed.  Dr William Henry Dashwood gave evidence that the prisoner had admitted to him that she had given birth, but said that when she had become conscious the child was dead.  She had tried to take the body to the cemetery, but had fainted outside the Aberdeen Hotel and then fainted a second time near the Hospital and was unable to go further.  Dr Dashwood said he had examined the body and had no suspicion of foul play, though the body was badly decayed and the bones disarticulated.  The prisoner said that poverty had driven her to act as she had and she wanted it known that no one else was present at the birth and no one had assisted her in any way in the matter.  The prisoner was committed for trial at the next Criminal Sessions.
