Princess Royal Station has been named recipient of the 2015 Telstra South Australian Business, Medium Business Award and Regional Business Award.  The Princess Royal Station is a large scale livestock enterprise, formed in 2003 from an existing business, T & R Pastoral, by Simon Rowe and his father, the late Robert Rowe.  The business breeds and prepares premium cattle for domestic and overseas sale and trades in cattle, sheep and lambs.  It produces one third of its feed requirements from a large scale cropping program.  [Photo.]
