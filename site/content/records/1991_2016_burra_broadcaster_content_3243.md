N.B. Lewis writes asking if anybody can assist in identifying which are the ruins of the childhood farm home of Sir Hubert Wilkins.  Sir Hubert made the first flight over the Arctic from Alaska to Spitsbergen in 1928 and also the first flight in Antarctica in the summer of 1928-29.  The ruins are pictured in the Australian Geographic of October-December 1992 on page 119.  I have no idea to what extent, if at all, Wilkins is part of local history, because he spent most of his life abroad.  He has been more esteemed in the USA than in his homeland.
