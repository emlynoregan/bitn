Redruth Court, 18 September.

Jones (painter) v. Steele (butcher of Tothills Creek)

Steele did not hear a warning re wet paint on a Burra Hotel verandah post.  He leant against it and painted his coat.  He then kicked over the painter’s paint pot.  He claimed this was accidental, but the court decided otherwise.  Ordered to pay a fine of £1-5-0 for the paint, court fees of 10/-, witness fees of 15/- and counsel’s fees of £2-2-0.

Nelson & Hoar were each fined 5/- for furious riding.

Kidman fined 10/- for driving loose horses through Aberdeen.
