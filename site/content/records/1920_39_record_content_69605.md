Obituary.  Miss Avis Neill died last Friday at midnight at the Burra Hospital aged 34.  She was the eldest daughter of Mr A.G. & the late Mrs Neill of ‘Wheetelande’.  Since her mother’s death 12 or 13 years ago she took charge of the family of four sisters and three brothers as well as taking a keen interest in local social activities.  The Hanson Methodist Church has lost a great worker.  She was organist, Secretary of the Ladies guild and Head of the Kindergarten Department and Co-secretary of the Wesley Guild.  She was a keen entrant in the Burra Show for cooking, sweets and needlework.  She was also a good tennis player.  [Born Avis Aldyth Neill 1 October 1902 at Manoora: died 21 January 1938 at Kooringa, residence Farrell’s Flat.]
