Hallett Railway. With the change in ministry a new deputation went to the Commissioner of Public works urging an undercrossing near the Bon Accord Hotel to the mill - 6.5 chains north of the level crossing. Still claiming the crossing with awkward angles and 1:12 grade is unsafe. Messrs W.R. Ridgway, B. Butterworth, J. Tiver, A. Bartholomæus, G. Hill & J.J. Osborne.
