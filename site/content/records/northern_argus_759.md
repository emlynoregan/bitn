Ian Auhl’s new book, The Story of the Monster Mine is to be launched by the Director of the Department of Mines and Energy Mr R. Keith Johns at the Mines Department Building on 25 March.  Mr Johns’ great great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of the Burra Burra Mine.

Ian Auhl was born in Burra in 1914 into a family which had lived in the district since pioneering days.  He returned in 1964 as headmaster of Burra Primary School.  Following his retirement he has written prolifically on Burra and this large book of 488 pages, 15 colour plates, 50 illustrations, plus maps and numerous photographs is the culmination of years of valuable research.

Pam Marlow has carried out the initial work on the Jubilee Project to build a scale model of the Burra Mine to be housed in the Bon Accord Mining Museum.  The module of Morphett’s Enginehouse, boiler house and capstan has been on display in Bence’s window.  This is one of 33 groups of buildings which will slot into the landscape model, which is about 5 metres by 6.5 metres in area.  It will provide a picture of how the mine looked in about 1860.  The landscape is planned for completion in May and the glazing of the display is due to be done in September, ahead of the museum’s opening in October.  Pam and Phil Marlow and children have recently moved to Pinaroo, so on site work will be limited to school holidays.  Pam will continue to work on the models at her new home.  Many others have contributed to the huge task, especially Brian Salter and Peter Stitt.
