The Seaside Trip.  A meeting on Thursday decided on going to Glenelg this year, though the Mayor favoured Semaphore as quieter.  The Glenelg people were prepared to erect two marquees for the ladies and in the event of bad weather to allow the use of the Town Hall.  The date will be the 24 February, departing c. 5.30 p.m. and leaving c. 8 p.m. from Glenelg.  Adults 6/3, children 3/-.
