Burra Rifle Club fired the last stage of the Kookaburra Trophy and the best results were from H.G. Oates & C.H. Dixon.

H.G. Oates has won the Championship and as he cannot also win the handicap there was a shoot-off between R. Nutt & A.C. Aughey that was won by Aughey.

Kookaburra Trophy goes to H.G. Oates who also picks up the Marksmanâ€™s Cup and the Consistency Trophy.
