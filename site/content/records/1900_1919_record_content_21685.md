Obituary.  Thomas Davis, an old Burra resident, died in Adelaide last week from cancer of the liver.

Thus in ‘Short & Sharp’ column, but in a longer obituary he becomes Thomas Davies of Aberdeen.  He was born in Wales and migrated with his parents in 1854, when 7 years old.  He came to Burra from Hindmarsh about a year later.  He farmed at Gum Creek for some years.  He leaves a widow and two daughters: Mrs Hayes (Adelaide) & Kathleen (Aberdeen).  He was for some time a North Ward Councillor [Dec. 1887-Nov. 1888] and was President of the ULP at Burra at the time of his death.

[Died 2 April 1908 in Adelaide, residence Burra aged 61.]
