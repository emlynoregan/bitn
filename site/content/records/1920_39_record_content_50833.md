Local Board of Health

People were bringing meat into the town from outside that had not been killed in slaughterhouses and selling it in unhygienic conditions.  A legal case being fought at Orroroo suggested there was little they could do to stop the practice with their present powers.  It was decided to ask the Central Board of health to draft a regulation under which the Council could act to inspect any place where meat was being killed for consumption within the town.
