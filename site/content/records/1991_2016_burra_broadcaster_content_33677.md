Goyder Council has commenced a review of master planning options for Market Square and Best Place.  There will be consultation with the community as a precursor to detailed design and ultimate capital works.  Repairs, replacement and maintenance over the past twenty years have slowly changed the character of Market Square and Best Place.  Market Square is now a mixture of different paving materials, landscaping, public lighting and other street furniture.  One aim is to win back public space from bitumen in Market Square.  Consultants Greg Davis and Edith Mayer of Adelaide firm Hames Sharley have been engaged.
