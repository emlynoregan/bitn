Weather.  Rain to the east seems to have filled all the dams.  Last yearâ€™s rains allowed country to the east to be restocked after a considerable period of drought.  It looks like this will also be a good year.  Rains on Sunday saw Burra record 71 points, while falls to the east were patchy most places got from 20 to 60 points with a few reading above and below that range.

The rains of the last week did considerable damage to the Burra Burra DC roads from Koo-owie to the southeast, but damage is much worse in the Robertstown DC area where seas of mud from fallow have had to be removed from metalled surfaces by scoops.
