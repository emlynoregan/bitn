Burra Meals on Wheels supplied a special meal to Bill Webb last Wednesday to celebrate National Meals on Wheels Day.  Mr Webb has been receiving meals for about 22 years.  William Webb was born in Broken Hill almost 84 years ago.  At age 10 the family moved to Adelaide briefly and then to Burra.  They lived in a couple of places before settling in Paxton Square and were the last residents to leave there before the cottages became heritage tourist accommodation.  Mr Webb worked with the Highways Department for 25 years and for many years did odd jobs at the Commercial Hotel.  After retiring nearly 20 years ago Mr Webb suffered heart problems and was grateful to be offered Meals on Wheels.
