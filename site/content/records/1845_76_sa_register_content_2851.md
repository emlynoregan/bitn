Too much cannot be said of the moderation shown by the miners.

Share prices and dividends must fall.  There is not 10,000 tons of ore at grass that will pay to be sent home.

Strange revelations will be made when Mr Burr’s action comes on.

Another correspondent writes:

Business continues at a complete standstill.

No work is going on at the mine except the dressing of ore at grass.

In the taking of a pile to dress no competition is allowed; the men have agreed that should the Captain and the men who made the first offer not agree then no one will take that work at a lower rate.

About 400 of the miners have formed a club, each member paying 1/- weekly towards a fund to support poorer families while the strike lasts.

No assistance has yet been required.

They consider themselves prepared to hold out for about six months.

The Directors may fortify themselves in their resolve, but it is morally impossible they can exonerate themselves from the devastating mischief, which is likely to follow from their recklessness.

The interruption to the carriage operations is another aspect of the dilemma.  We hear that the drayman’s actions are likely to produce a serious loss to the Association due to heavy demurrages to which the detained shipping will be entitled under their charter-parties.

These successive strikes have arisen from dogged mismanagement.  ‘If it is possible that there is anything approaching chicanery in all this; we hope it will be unsparingly exposed and denounced.’
