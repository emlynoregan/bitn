Burra Town Council, 1 August.

Mr Rogers’ kerbing was finally approved.

Several head of cattle are grazing on the oval.  [The tone suggests they were uninvited.]

Letter from R. Adderley of Gladstone asking to be considered as Waterworks Engineer as he had heard they were dissatisfied with the present one.

Tenders for a new assessment were opened and held over for consideration.  W.H. Hardy’s was £14-10-0 and A. Bartholomæus was £25.

Work is to be found in North Ward for two very needy cases of unemployed men.

The Mayor reports that the Waterworks Engineer is carrying out his duties well.

Cr Harris complained that Mr Littlejohn did not flush every fireplug along the main.

The Mayor said that at the last meeting a list of work for the Engineer had been submitted and one Councillor commented it would take three months to do it all.  It has been done in a fortnight and still dissatisfaction is expressed.

6 August.

The Council received legal advice that it should have filled all vacancies arising from resignations from committees and not have been left with only two committees.  Advice was to record all motions of the meeting of 4 July and fill vacancies in the normal way.  It was decided not to make any assessment.

[There is no report of a meeting of 4 July.  The paper of 11 July reports on for 9 July and the paper of 4 July could not report a meeting of that date.]

‘At the last meeting of the Council Councillor Walsh, one of the straightest, conscientious and peaceful men that has ever sat in the Burra Town Council, intimated that he would not be in the Burra Town Council next year.  Now North Ward ratepayers, be loyal to him, who has been loyal to you, and induce Councillor Walsh to alter his mind.’
