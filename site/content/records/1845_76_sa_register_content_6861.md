From the Bathurst Free Press

One party of 4 (4 of them teetotallers) got £165 for 10 days’ work, in pieces from 3 oz down.

Fitzpatrick’s party won £184-10-0 for two weeks labour, or £40 per man.

McGregor’s party of 5 in 5 days did not clear expenses, but in the next 5 days earned £95.  Overall they earned about £1-6-0 per man per day.

[The article goes on with examples of good and bad luck.]

Rewards have been offered for the discovery of gold in the Maitland area.

There are reports of gold discoveries in the Burragorang Ranges.

While some diggers have picked up large pieces, not one person in 50 has fallen across anything larger than 1 oz.

The diggers are mostly housed very poorly in gunyahs, which offer little protection from the biting cold and none from the rain.

There are recent reports of 85 teams and over 200 men camped at Mary’s Lane en route for Ophir.

Mr Joseph West reports seeing 168 drays and 1117 men between Sydney and the foot of Mount Victoria.

Employers in Bathurst say they can get plenty of labour from unsuccessful miners.

Two shipments of gold of £3,000 and £4,000 respectively have been sent to London and are sure to convince people there that the gold discoveries in Australia are substantial.

A private letter from Bathurst tells of its writer having seen a 7 lb troy lump of gold.
