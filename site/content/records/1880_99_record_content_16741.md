Lapford Correspondent.

[There were correspondents’ reports from many centres on a fairly regular basis, but since nothing much ever happened at Lapford the correspondent purporting to give news from there often produced a humorous article sometimes with wider ranging satirical comments.  See also the note at VII, 468, 21 August 1885, page 3.]

‘Were one seeking the hospitality of Lapford, he would fare very badly indeed; for there are only two houses and three inhabitants all told, in the entire township proper; and “entertainment for man and beast,” is but a dim and misty legend of bygone days.’

‘The survey “pegs” are here, and the streets, roads, and “blocks” are here, but all is desolation beside.’

An effort was recently made to open a school here.  The school is held in an iron building once devoted to the dispensation of Wein und Läerbier.

It is a disgrace that there is no state school hitherto in the Hundreds of Mongolata, Baldina and Bright.

Letter from W.H. Hardy in reply to Mr Cooksley and he is warned by the editor to be less personal in the future.

Letter from R.B. advocating the poisoning of sparrows.

Letter from Argus about the Town Council finances, in favour of borrowing £500
