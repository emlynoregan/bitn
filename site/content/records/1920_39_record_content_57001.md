An Empire Exhibition would be staged from March to May.

The Adelaide Show would be a Special Centenary Show.

A National Thanksgiving Service was planned.

A Flower festival would run in Adelaide from 9-16 October.

A Music Festival would be held.

There would be a Racing Carnival.

The eight days around 28 December would see a special carnival.

There would be a host of other sporting events and celebratory activities.

January and February had been set aside as the main time to organise for country events so they would not clash with either each other or the main city based events.

Sir George thought the idea of a beautification scheme for Burra combined with some sort of carnival to attract visitors to the town was a good concept.

He said it was the view of the Country Organisation Committee that it was in the interest of country towns to form a local Centenary Committee to arrange the local activities and to co-ordinate with the general program of the Executive Committee.  Indeed it was on the basis that there was such a local committee that Centenary Grants would be made available.  Any such grant would have to be subsidised £ for £ by the local Centenary Committee and would have to be spent on schemes entailing work for those presently unemployed.

It was usual for the local government body to initiate the formation of these local Centenary Committees.

Mr Ryan elaborated a little on this and said that activities approved by the Central Committee would receive more extensive publicity than ever before and the state would benefit from more extensive advertising than at any time in its history.

When it was suggested focussing Burra’s activities around the time of the Burra Show, Mr Ryan indicated that it would be difficult with so many other events approved for that period.  Sir George said 36 towns were already involved in planning activities.

Mr Bence thought that with no other large town in the district, Burra ought to get a larger grant of, say, £500 to enable a big affair to be staged here.  [The subsidy implications of this do not seem to have been discussed.]  Mr Ryan said there was one time period that might be possible; after the Royal Show and before 9 October, but the application for this time should be made quickly.

A.B. Riggs thought they should apply for the fourth week in September and if that were to fail, then for the third or fourth week in February.  January he considered useless with all the schools on holidays.

[The meeting closed with the usual exchanges of thanks and acknowledgements.]
