Public Meeting on Decentralization

Thirty-four people attended the public meeting at the Burra Town Hall on 20 February.  The meeting was to pass on suggestions about industry for the town.  With population dwindling what could be done in Burra was the question.  The Mayor’s own suggestion was the concrete trade – posts and bricks, many of which are used in the district and further north.  Another suggestion was crushed metal and another the development of mineral resources within the ‘Eastern’ country. Other suggestions touched on meat works and a cannery, Mongolata goldfield, clay, pottery and bricks and small scale machinery.  Questions of cheaper electricity and water were raised and the question was asked about how much and whether the Government would pay for decentralization.
