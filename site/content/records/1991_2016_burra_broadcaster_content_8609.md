Burra Council’s Development Committee discussed options for a conceived industrial area on the outskirts of Burra last Tuesday night.  Chairman Graham Kellock highlighted Burra’s advantages with three phase power, piped gas and road and rail transport available.  Thee sealing of the Morgan-Burra road would soon be another advantage and could influence location.
