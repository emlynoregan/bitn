Industrial Zone

The editor reprinted an article from 15 November 1995

It deals with the problem of light industry not being able to find a location in the town.  The obstacles needed to be overcome were:

Zoning regulations

A perceived heritage conflict

Proximity to a watercourse

Council had been considering the problem for a long time, without making any apparent progress.  The Burra Broadcaster had been asking questions about it for two years and getting fobbed off with a series of inadequate responses.  Councils in other areas of SA had confronted like problems, but had managed to find solutions.  Even twenty extra jobs would make a significant difference to the town – look at the impact when Adchem shed fifty workers.  Families left, school enrolment fell and real estate values dropped.

The editor then turned to 2004 and said nothing proactive had been done, save the rezoning of Stockman’s paddock north of the golf course.  The recent application was 246 metres from the nearest house and lay outside the declared heritage area, but the dilemma of finding a suitable block will remain until Council acquired some appropriate land and made it available with the required amenities.
