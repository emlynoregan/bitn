Kooringa News, 26 November

Inquest

On Friday 25 November an inquest was held into the fire at Mr Opie’s on Tuesday last.  Mr Godson was foreman of the jury.

Cyprian Stanton:

Saw the fire from the other side of the creek as I was going to church.  It was nearly out when I came.  When I was coming away I saw a little boy William Roberts who said that he was lighting a squib, which burst in his hand.  He threw it down and the stables caught fire.  He then ran away and hid in the creek.  He asked me to take him home, but I was late and did not do so.  The fire engine arrived while I was at the fire.  The child is four years old this month.

John Henwood:

Was on Quarry Hill between 10 and 11 a.m. and saw the place on fire.  Do not know how it happened.

Thomas Paynter:

Was in the stables at 9 a.m.  Fed the horses and left all safe.  About 10.15 heard a cry of fire.  Ran and opened the stable.  Untied one horse, but could not untie another because of the fire.  Do not know how it started.  I saw the fire at the end where the hay was.  I do not smoke.  Saw no one about.  Did not see the boy there.


Nicholas Opie”

Between 10 and 11 was in the barn.  Heard Mrs Opie cry out that the stable was on fire.  Saw Paynter open the door and try to free the horses.  I began to tear down the stable to let the horses out.  Two broke their halters and fled through the door.  One was burnt to death.  Saw no one about and cannot account for the fire.  Was not smoking when I went out.  Have seen children about with squibs in the last week.

Mrs Opie:

Was in the kitchen about 10.30.  My little boy was going round to the front when he turned and called, ‘The stable is on fire.’  Called Mr Opie.  Saw Paynter open the door.  Did not go outside.  Did not see the boy about.

William Roberts:

The child left my house in Market Square at about 10.30 a.m.  My wife sent him to the opposite side of the creek to ask after his mother.

Elizabeth Ann Champion:

Saw the child W. Roberts on Sunday morning in Paxton Square.  Helped him cross the creek near to Mr Blackney’s.  The fire was burning at the time the bells were ringing for church.

The jury decided there was no evidence to show the origin of the fire.
