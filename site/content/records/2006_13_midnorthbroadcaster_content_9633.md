Burra Community School Continental attracted a good crowd last Friday on a warm night.  The theme was a beach party.  The pool was available and there was a food court, which did plenty of trade.  Stalls were also busy with show bags, glow sticks and fairy floss all popular.  The treasure room also saw many visitors. Overall it was a very successful event and the school is already committed to planning another for 2012.
