Methodist Jubilee Hall.  In connection with the enlargement of the Methodist Jubilee Hall at Redruth on 7 May at 3.30 p.m. seven memorial stones will be laid.  £130 is to be raised to complete the building.  Tea and public meetings will follow the ceremony.  Rev. W.F. James saw £187 raised by memorial stone services at a church in Cardiff.  The trustees hope as much as £70 might be raised at Redruth.
