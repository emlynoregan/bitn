Pte Eric Smith

Wrote to the Mayor in July, saying he was still in Libya after four months and was sick of the heat, flies, fleas and dust.  Temperatures to 125ÂºF in the shade.  He mentions Tobruk, Italian soldiers firing machine guns at them through the night, German dive bombers and machine gunning from the air.  His gift watch from the town was keeping excellent time despite all the dust and sand.  Canteen service was poor as all shipping space was needed for essentials.  Raids etc. were fewer lately and things had quietened down and he speculates that the Germans might be preoccupied with the Eastern Front.
