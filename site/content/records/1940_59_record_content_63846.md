Mr & Mrs Jack Goodridge and family left Burra on Wednesday to live at Crystal Brook, where Mr Goodridge has a position with the E & WS Department.  The family came to Burra just after the war when he started the Burra Radio & Electrical Service, at first by himself and later in partnership with Bert Beinke.  Later he retired from this to take a position with the Burra Electric Supply Co. and Bert Beinke and his wife took over the Burra Radio & Electrical Service.
