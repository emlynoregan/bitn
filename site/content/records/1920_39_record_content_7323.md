Burra Town Council 20 March.

Resolved not to act on the electricity offer to cover lighting of main streets only for £5,000 until such an offer is made officially.  [Rather than in a letter to the Mayor.]

Mr Bosisto reported he had £50 in cash and £25 in promises towards the construction of a Fire Station.

Fresh tenders for a Fire Station to be called.

Arrangements made for a civic reception for the Prime Minister.

The trophy gun will be painted.

The tarred roads are proving slippery for horses and Mr Crewes said Adelaide had the same problem.
