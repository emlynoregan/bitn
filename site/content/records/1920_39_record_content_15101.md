Cr Hammond wanted Councillors to inspect a vacant block near the Kooringa Hotel as a possible site for a children’s playground.

It was resolved that a light be placed near the rotunda in Market Square.

The Mayor took up the suggestion in the paper for a ‘Back to Burra Week’ and thought it a good idea.

Cr Hammond said a man not connected with the Council would have to be procured to handle it.

Cr Harris agreed that Burra could do it as well as other towns had.

Cr Riggs also thought it a good idea as did Crs Kellaway and Woollacott.
