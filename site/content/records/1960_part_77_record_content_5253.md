R.S. Norris writes commenting on an article in the Advertiser reporting comments by Mr H. Toepfer of the importing firm of Alfred Toepfer of Hamburg, who was amazed to find SA still handling virtually all its oats and barley in bags and calling for bulk handling both for efficiency and to control pests.  The need to change to bulk handling, he says, is clear.
