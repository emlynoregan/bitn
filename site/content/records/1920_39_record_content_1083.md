Lindsay Kemble.  [An article reprinted from the magazine The Graphic of Australia (Melbourne)]

Lindsay Kemble was born in Burra and served over four years in the trenches.  He is appearing as the ‘leading lady’ in Mademoiselle Mimi at the Playhouse.  In 1914 he won a bet that he could not dress as a girl for six months on end.  He eventually got himself arrested by a policeman and the publicity led to an engagement at the King’s Theatre in Adelaide.  He enlisted in 1915 aged nearly 18 and served in France, being gassed a bit and buried once.  He joined The Sentimental Blokes organised by Lieut. Douglas Walsh of the 10th Battalion and when the boys were out of the line they gave three shows a day.  Performances were close enough to the line to be shelled and at Christmas the whole show was gassed and Lieut. Walsh was killed.  The article goes on for ⅔ column giving anecdotes of performances etc.
