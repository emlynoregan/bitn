Dr D. McDonald Steele:

On 17 March went to Koonoona.  Body of the deceased was lying c. 3 yards from his office door.  The face was covered with blood and there was considerable blood on the ground.  We took the body to the office.  No blackening or singeing of the face.  There was a large wound on the right side above the upper lip, from which I extracted a wad.  The upper jaw was smashed and the right eye completely collapsed.  There were many small wounds, many minute wounds contained fragments of wire from the window screen.  The injuries were consistent with a shot from the gun and cartridge produced.  Death was from shock and haemorrhage. The wad penetrating the skin points to a shot from at most a few yards.

William Clement Escott:

Gave an account of his movements, essentially the same as previously reported.

James C. McCarthy, farmer of Hundred of Hanson:

Owned a double-barrelled breech-loading gun – missed it a month or five weeks ago from a trap in the buggy shed, also about five cartridges, some of them Eley’s speedites.  Cartridge produced is similar.  The cartridge had been knocked about and McCarthy recognised marks on it where he had had trouble extracting it from the gun in February when he had used a pocket-knife for the purpose.  Harold Escott was present on the hunt on that occasion.  He described features of the gun which made it highly likely to be the same one, but would not swear to its being the one.  Harold Escott had been staying at their place from before New Year till sometime in February.  (About 2 months)  Saw Harold at my father’s on 16 March: he arrived about 9 p.m.  Said he was on his way to Farrell’s flat to have the horse shod.  It is about 5 miles to Escott’s from our place – it might be covered in about half an hour on a good horse.

Christopher Tennant Fisher, retired farmer, who had been living with the deceased for about 15 years:

Evidence was largely as has previously been reported.  He added that if after firing the shot the person had returned to rob Harold’s room he would have run into Fisher.  When Harold came home I said ‘Have you heard the news, your father is shot.’  Did not tell him he was dead and Harold did not go to see.

Alvina m. Escott, wife of W. Clement Escott:

The evidence adds little to the picture [except the possibly strange point that there was no light in the office when the body was discovered and she said there was no evidence the lamp had been alight as the glass was not hot.  She had carried a light from her bedroom to light the office lamp.]

Alfred Ryan, Police Tracker:

There was a track from a galvanised iron fence to the window: a distance of about 11 paces.  Someone had stood there and the tracks returned to the fence.  The tracks suggest a hurrying person.  The tracks went towards the stable and got lost in motor traffic, but the same tracks come from the front of the house to the stable and return.  A circle round the house did not reveal tracks of a stranger.  Horse tracks led from the homestead to the back road.  Later he details how he tracked a horse to where the rider got off and then the tracks of the rider to a deep shaft in which he could see a gun.  The horse returned to the stable and then came from it galloping.  The galloping horse had gone towards Black Springs and after a while the horse stopped, rider dismounted, got back on and a mile from the homestead took a side road to a back way to the homestead.  This track eventually went to McCarthy’s Farm.  The tracks were those of the mousy-coloured chestnut.  The tracks to the shaft were the same as those made by Harold Escott.  He identified the prints in front of the window and near the shaft as those of Harold Escott.

M-C L.G.J. Merrett of Adelaide:

His evidence corroborates the movements of the tracker and his conclusions.  He also made enquiries about the gun and was told the story as outlined by James McCarthy.

M-C W.J. Johns gave corroborating evidence.

M-C Queale’s evidence is largely repetitive also, but adds information about the alleged robbery from Harold Escott’s room.  Miss Minnie Escott reported this about 7 a.m. on the 17 March, saying he was missing £42, a gold watch, pendant and chain and a safety razor.  Asked Harold how he came to have £42.  £17 was a cheque from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, £25 was from G. Marshall in Adelaide in payment of a gambling debt (details of which are given).  On the night of the murder Harold said he had ridden the mousy-coloured horse to McCarthy’s.

Mr Winnall appeared for Harold Escott and asked the courtroom be cleared of children.

Herbert Allchurch, Detective, gave parallel evidence about the tracks and the alleged robbery.  Confronted with the findings of the tracker, Harold Escott made no reply.  The police checked his story about the gambling debt, but could find no evidence he had sent the telegrams he had claimed to have.  He then changed his story and said a man called Murphy, who was with him at the races, actually sent the telegrams.  They found Murphy had sent one telegram to Marshall at a hotel.  Harold Escott had said four or five telegrams had been sent to Marshall c/o P.O. Adelaide.

Harold Escott was called, but refused to answer any questions.

The jury found that Mr William Escott Escott’s death on 16 March 1915 ‘was caused by some person outside the office window.  From the evidence placed before the jury we consider that person was Harold Escott.’

Mr Lane committed Harold Escott to stand trial at the next Criminal Sittings in Adelaide.
