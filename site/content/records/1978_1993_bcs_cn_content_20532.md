John Michael Oates

Aged 33 and married to Jackie.  Have two children and live at Poonunda Station east of Burra as have my family for three generations.  Previously a member of the Burra Pistol Club and currently a member of the Burra Tennis Club and Burra Golf Club and Vice-President and foundation member of the Burra Picnic Races Inc.  I joined the District Council in 1987 and have since learnt a great deal about the running and financial areas of operation.  I would like to be re-elected to participate more, having had some time to gain experience.  I have served on the Works Committee and the Redbanks Management Committee.  My main areas of concentration would be:

Continued upgrading of rural roads.

Upgrading and sealing of streets in our four towns.

Pressure the relevant departments for more funding for country hospitals.

To represent the whole area to the best of my ability.
