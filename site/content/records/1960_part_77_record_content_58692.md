John Baker the Burra Bushranger by Ian Auhl: Part 1.

Baker was arrested on Monday 16 October 1871 outside the Burra Court House.  There was a price on his head.  He was arrested by Lance Cpl Smith and Constable Noble.  The charge was horse stealing and robbery under arms, which carried a sentence of death by hanging.  He had eluded police for two years in the Barrier Ranges, so why had he come to Burra?  There was always a touch of bravado about him.  He had stood trial at the Supreme Court in Adelaide in August 1866 aged 21 on a charge of horse stealing.  The judge took the view that his reasons for taking the horse were at least plausible and the police could be driving him into a life of crime.  He was acquitted and released.  He immediately stole a horse from the Napoleon Hotel and headed to Glenelg.  The police caught up with him five weeks later in NSW and this time the judge sided with the police.  In his teenage years he had worked at the Cross Roads Inn [near Burra] grooming and caring for travellers and coaches.  Then he was employed by the Burra firm of McDonald & Hosking breaking in horses for their northern mail runs.  He was described as a ‘smallish man, very active and a daring rider’.  He liked horses and objected vehemently when a trooper ill-treated his horse.

After leaving Burra he spent a few years around Gawler and Adelaide, apparently making a living collecting stray horses and returning them to their owners.  It was when he began ‘collecting’ them from their owners’ paddocks and from public pounds that he struck trouble.  Such behaviour saw him facing court aged 21.  His sentence some five weeks later following his capture in NSW was one year’s hard labour at the Dry Creek Stockade (Yatala Prison).  It was there that he met another horse thief ‘Billy’ Bertram and probably formed the partnership which ended in Bertram’s hanging at Bathurst Gaol in 1871 and Baker’s own arrest at Burra later in that year.

Bertram was a German with a lisp and one eye and was an ex-Tungkillo butcher who had talent and notoriety as a cattle thief and it was his carelessness in leaving a cow’s tail in his yard that led to a conviction for stealing free meat and a sentence in the stockade at the same time as Baker.

After their release Baker and Bertram continued their life of petty crime in the hills around Gumeracha and out to the River Murray.  When SA got too hot for them they headed north up the Darling to the Barrier Ranges.  In the 1860s this became the haunt of cattle duffers, bushrangers and other undesirables.  The notorious Morgan and Captain Thunderbolt paid a few visits to this frontier area.  Baker and Bertram operated unhindered for a while with water and hiding places readily available.  In October 1869 Baker was charged at Wilcannia with three assaults: one on a boarding-house keeper and two on the NSW constables who arrested him.  He was fined $14.  Mr Bellamy, an admirer of pluck, raised the fine money from Baker’s admirers.  The next morning four horses, the property of Mt Murchison Station, were missing.  The outlaws always had plenty of sympathisers, which explains some of the cockiness and cool daring common to bushrangers in general.  A few days later Baker and Bertram held up the manager of Mt Arrowsmith Station, Mr George Urquhart and took horses and stores.  Station hands and shearers looked on.  The partners began to hold a contempt for law and the police that would lead to their downfall.

By November 1869 they were labelled ‘The Darling Bushrangers’.  On 9 November they bailed up a hawker Charles Young and when he asked who they were Bertram boasted that he was Billy Bertram who had robbed O’Brien and taken four horses from Murchison Station.  After threatening to blow out his brains, they robbed Young of $100 and rifled his van for guns and stores.  This made them guilty of robbery under arms, leading to their being declared outlaws, each with a price of $100 on his head.  After robbing Young they separated.

Bertram was finally captured late in 1870 near Cobham Lake where he was living in an Aboriginal camp.  By this time he was wanted for murder, having killed the same Charles Young he had previously threatened.  He was tried at Wilcannia and hanged at Bathurst Gaol early in 1871.

Baker eluded police for nearly two years and was undone by his arrogance.  L-Cpl Smith heard news that Baker was en route from the Barrier Ranges with a small band of stolen horses.  He had known Baker a few years earlier at Burra.  Baker, travelling without disguise, arrived after dark on Sunday evening.  On Monday he went to the barber’s shop in Kooringa [In 1971 Bert Beinke’s Paper and Book Shop] and asked for a hair cut and to have his hair dyed red.  The barber refused to dye it and Baker abused the barber for taking so long about cutting it.  Baker then walked to Redruth with two other men and sat down outside the court to cut up tobacco for his pipe.  The court was a cheap source of entertainment for idlers, sight-seers and moral busy-bodies in Victorian times and so the place was crowded.  When Smith and Noble approached him and declared he was arrested, Baker attempted to escape, but was chased and brought back.

He was placed in one of the cells behind the police station after a violent struggle.  They found a revolver in his swag, but no arms on his person.  The next day he was taken to Redruth Gaol and within a few days was planning his escape.  [To be continued.]
