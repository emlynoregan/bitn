Opening of St Mary’s.  Designed by Mr McLagan and erected by Sara & Dunstan, the building is placed with its side to the street.  The stone is of good quality from Mr Brooks’ quarry at Hampton.  The nave is 60’ x 40’ with two hexagonal transepts.  The height of the church in the nave is 44’ and the floor slopes 6” towards the chancel.  The transepts are divided from the nave by two arches corresponding to that separating the nave from the chancel.  The organ chamber is to the left of the chancel arch and possesses two arches, one inside the chancel.  On the right are a door and an arched passageway corresponding to the organ chamber and the vestry is to the left of this passage.  The chancel is 20’ x 18’, rising five steps, two at the entrance and three at the altar rail.  The roof is hammerbeam with stained matchboard ceiling.  The window-glass gives the appearance of ice and is believed to be some of that imported for the cathedral in Adelaide.  The altar frontal was worked by Miss Nesbitt.  The contractors presented the prayer desk, lectern and altar rails using kauri pine.  An elaborately carved altar desk was presented by its maker, Mr W.C.V. Burton of Hallett.  A very large congregation on the 18 January saw the Lord Bishop of Adelaide open the church with the incumbent, Rev. H. Howitt, reading the prayers.  The organist was Miss F.H. Cave, on the Smith organ.  The Bishop officiated at a confirmation service on Monday.
