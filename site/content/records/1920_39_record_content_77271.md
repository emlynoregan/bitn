Obituary.  Mrs George Earle of Willalo died at Burra Hospital on Thursday 30 November.  She was born at Gawler River in 1866, a daughter, Frances Harriet, of the late Mr & Mrs Brumby.  She married George Earle in 1885 and they went to live at Belton for 33 years.  [North of Carrieton.]  They then took land at Booborowie North (Willalo) in about 1918 and lived there until recently.  She is survived by a husband, 11 sons and 2 daughters: Messrs George (Hallett), Roy* (Burra), Hurlet* (Gawler River), Oliver (Quondong Station), Perce (Unley), Leslie (Curnamana), Clive* (Kielpa), Frank (Spalding), Ernest (Victoria), Leonard (Streaky Bay), Eric (Canowie) and Mesdames George (Orroroo) & Ridings (Malvern).  There are 27 grandchildren & 5 great-grandchildren.  Five sons saw service in the Great War: Roy, Oliver, Perce, Leslie and Frank as well as a son-in-law Mr T. Surfield.

[Born Frances Harriet Brumby 16 November Red Banks, Grace Plains: died 29 November Burra, residence Willalo.]

[* Note: Hurlet would seem to be an error for Hurtle, but One son was Hurtle Roy, so the intended name here could be the otherwise missing Charles Herbert.  Unless Clive is a nickname it is an error for Harold Clyde.]
