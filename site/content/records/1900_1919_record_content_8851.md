Cr Cook did not recall seeing it or signing it.

Cr Lott read it.

Cr Roach & Cr Snell neither saw it nor signed it.

Mr Winnall asked if it was signed by a resolution of Council. – Yes.

Mr Crewes asked if the Commissioner had made signing it a condition of the £81 rebate. – Yes.

In reply to an inaudible question from T. Davis the Mayor denied there had been any ‘back door business’ done this year – there had been no ‘shinanikin’. 

Mr Crewes objected to the Mayor’s emphasis on ‘this year’. 

Mr Hardy thought there had been a lot of ‘shinnanikin’ in Council this year.

Mr Hardy asked if since Mr Sedgman’s appointment wasn’t young Harvey doing the work Mr Sedgman was appointed to do.

The mayor said Mr Sedgman had been busy repairing the machinery ever since he had been there and Harvey was doing as much for 3/- a day as Hardy would for 10/-. 

Hardy – if the engineer signed the agreement to do the work he should do it.

Mayor – The likes of Mr Hardy would blight the prospects of Council ever getting a good man to do the job and it was nonsense for him to find fault with such a practical engineer as Mr Sedgman.  Ratepayers should put their foot down and stop such nonsensical talk.

The chair here intervened to stop personal remarks and to return to conducting business in a gentlemanly way.

Mr Hardy apologised to the meeting, but not to the Mayor.  He then launched into another tirade against the Mayor over the Waterworks in an attempt to prevent the meeting from adopting the report.  The report was adopted.

Cr Sangster said he was glad to be retiring.  He had voted for an end to Waterworks concessions and to appoint Mr Sedgman.  The Waterworks lease was too stringent and he was not present when it was signed and was surprised it had been.  Also a Council was foolish not to have appointed a joint inspector of meat with the District Council.  The town was poorly lighted and he hoped the new Council would give this attention.

Cr Cook gave a brief speech of retirement.

Cr Lott said he was going to offer his services for East Ward again.  He had voted to sign the Waterworks lease because the Mayor had said they were compelled to do so.  It would not have been done but for financial necessity.  He had voted against the water concessions to the Burra Copper Co.

The Mayor said Mr Pryor had not been offered £5 to resign, but the speaker knew differently.  He had moved that Mr Pryor be given £10 in lieu of notice – which was his entitlement.  It was through an accident at the Waterworks that he had been incapacitated.

The Mayor: No.

Mr Neville moved a hearty vote of thanks to the retiring Councillors.  Mr Hardy 2nd.

A Voice: ‘That includes the Mayor, too, I suppose.’

Mr Hardy: ‘If it does I’ll withdraw.’  (Laughter)

Mr Neville: ‘I included the Mayor, of course.’

Mr Winnall seconded the motion.

The Mayor thanked all for thanking him.  He had devoted as much time to his duties as any man could.  He had lived longer than any other resident in the town and now intended to retire into private life, but would always keep a watchful eye over future Council proceedings.

Mr Winnall said he was a candidate for Mayor, but felt it was not going to be a very enviable position.  He would be the first Burra boy to fill the position.  The Waterworks would be the greatest trouble in the year.  He was willing to let the Government take over at once if necessary.  It was too much to expect that they would pay more for their water under the Government that they do now.  People in Adelaide paid 6d per 1,000 gallons while here it was much more.  They paid 3½% interest and we pay 5-6%.  The Burra Waterworks were worth about £3,000 and yet we pay interest on £8,000.  If they are not handed back to the Government we must insist on a substantial reduction in the capital account.  When some time ago the Government valuer placed a price on the works the Government would not part with them for that value.  The slaughterhouse question would also occupy much time of the incoming Council.

Cr Lott, as a candidate for East Ward supported Mr Winnall re the Waterworks.

J. Drew, candidate for West Ward, had previously refused to have anything to do with municipal matters, but as his firm was about the largest ratepayer in the town he felt it was his duty.  He felt if the Waterworks account could not be reduced they should be returned to the Government.  He was Burra born and so was his mother before him, so he felt he had some claim in the town.

Mr Neville, candidate for North Ward, thought the Waterworks were a sick baby and the sooner they got rid of it the better.
