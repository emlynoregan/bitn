Burra Racing Club.  The annual meeting was held under most unfavourable weather conditions on 28 April at the Aberdeen Racecourse.  There was high wind and blowing dust.  The well-patronised special train from the city broke down twice and the engine had to be replaced at Gawler.  The replacement barely struggled to Hanson.  Unfortunately on the train were the starter, the judge, the clerk of scales and most of the jockeys.  Eventually the train crawled into Burra just before 2 o’clock instead of 12.30.  The first event was delayed an hour.  Despite all this the meeting was a great success.  The main race was the Gallagher Cup over 1¼ miles for £100 in prize money.  It was won by H.E. Gregory’s Peaceful Chief.  Other results are also printed.
