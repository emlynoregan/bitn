Burra Heavy Vehicle By-Pass

Ron Roberts MLC met with Stephen Kerrigan Goyder, Council CEO; and Peter Boaden, Director of Operations on 8 November to discuss the Councils ongoing problems with maintaining the by-pass road.  Currently it is classified as a local road, but received heavy traffic due to signs erected by Transport SA.  Maintenance is a heavy burden on the Council, which believes it should be reclassified as a Rural Arterial Road, like the by-passes at Redhill, Snowtown and Crystal Brook.  Once reclassified it should be sealed, as it is carrying increased traffic since the sealing of the Morgan Road.  Sealing it would also divert much heavy traffic from Market Square.  Currently there is a petition circulating asking for the by-pass to be sealed.  There is, however, also a petition asking that the sealing of the Kooringa Rd (the extension of Kingston Street) be done before the by-pass.  This has been launched by a number of business people who fear the loss of passing trade when the by-pass is sealed.
