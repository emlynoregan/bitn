SAMA: half-yearly report. After debiting the profit and loss account with £3,080 in payment of the 62nd dividend, paid on the 8 July and with expenses in the last half-year to 30th instant, amounting to £701-2-6 for rents and interest received there remains to the credit of the account £70,795-7-1.

A surrender of the unexpired term of a 99-year lease of land to the E & A copper Co., on which the smelting works is erected, has been accepted by the directors and part of the land, amounting to about 47 acres, has been sold to the Copper Co. in exchange and in consideration of £300.  This is regarded as advantageous to both parties.

Five allotments in Kooringa have been sold, amounting to rather more than an acre, for £295 and some lease renewals have been granted for fair rentals.
