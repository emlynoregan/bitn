Burra Burra DC.  The management of the War memorial Oval is to be referred to the Burra & Community Sports Club Committee.

A $7,000 grant has been received to undertake conservation work at the Burra Cemetery.

Fencing at Redbanks Reserve is to be completed, where Mr Robert Heading has been appointed interim caretaker with four members of the local community to be appointed to a committee to draft a management plan.  [Nominations for this committee are called on page 2.]

Mr Rob Kerin MP has been invited to Burra to discuss the Morgan-Burra Road.

The Burra Arts Council has permission to use the old Post & Telegraph Office for an art exhibition on 30 April & 1 May.

An aerial survey is to be conducted over the towns in the area at an altitude of 80 m.

The new Development Act is now in place.

Recording the recent history of Paxton Square cottages will soon be undertaken.

Complaints about dogs are on the increase.
