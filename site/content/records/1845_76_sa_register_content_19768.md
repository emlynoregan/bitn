Kooringa News, 4 October

The road between Kooringa and Redruth is in course of construction.  They are employing only ten men.  It is said a contractor near at hand wants 50 men and cannot get them and until he does no more will be employed on the road.

Good rains have fallen accompanied by warm weather.

Theft.  Four times in three months provisions have been taken from a tent on Mr Warnesâ€™ station just after rations were delivered.  Various other items were also taken.  Police have a suspect in mind.

The Burra Auxiliary Destitute Board accepted on 27 September the tender of Messrs Drew & Co. for supplying rations to the destitute poor.
