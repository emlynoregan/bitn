Kangarooing.  There is a humorous two column report about ‘A Two Days Kangarooing Excursion’.  Seven men with seven horses and two traps to carry tucker and chaff headed off to Baldina Creek where they stopped at a hut, dining on tinned fish, meat etc. and had a good smoke.  Foot & Agnew made up a bed on the floor for five men while the others attended to the horses.  The other two men had to ‘make do’.  Agnew roused the group at 4.30 a.m.  During the day they got five roos before reaching the main camping ground.

Then details of tackling the kangaroos are given.  By evening seventeen tails had been added to the catch.
