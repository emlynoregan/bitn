Letter.  Bob Skinner and Glenys Christopher write, complaining of the lack of adequate signage at Ford’s Corner.  People are entering their gateway and turning their cars and caravans around to avoid the gravel road to Burra.  The Department of Road Transport and the Council are each expecting the other to act.
