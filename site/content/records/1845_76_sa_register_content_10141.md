Port Wakefield Road

A letter from J. Hamilton, Manager of the English & Australian Copper Co. stated he had anticipated the decision of the Road Board and had employed several working parties on the Port Wakefield Road.  As the sum of Â£1,750 was altogether inadequate, he was disposed to double that amount, if he could obtain from the Government a promise to reimburse the Company at some time.
