Court Cases, 26 July

Five men were fined for having unregistered dogs and three of them went to gaol for 14 days because they were unable to pay the fine.

Charles Blight was fined £3-10-0 for allowing young bulls to trespass among his neighbours’ stock.

John Cundy paid £4 in fine and costs (or 4 month in gaol) for smashing furniture in the bar at the White Hart Hotel, resisting police and committing a nuisance in the police cell.  That he was drunk was regarded as no excuse.
