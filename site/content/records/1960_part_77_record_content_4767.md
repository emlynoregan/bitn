Burra Town Council, 4 December

Mr Baulderstone reported on Councillors in the town receiving abuse and those in business losing trade.  People had refused to deal with Councillors’ businesses because the footbridge by the bowling green had been closed for repairs.  This was unfair on people who do a voluntary job to the best of their ability and who suffer through ratepayers who take no apparent interest in town affairs other than when something doesn’t suit them and who would not offer themselves for election to the same position.
