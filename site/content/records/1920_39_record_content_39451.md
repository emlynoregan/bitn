T.H. Woollacott writes in response to A.B. Riggs accusing him of inconsistency.  He approved or signed the recommendation to the incoming Council for the 1929-30 assessment which is the highest in the town’s history.

Year	Assessment	Rate	Rate Revenue	Total Revenue	Expenditure

1928	17394	2/6	2174	3064	3165

1929	17671	2/9	2429	3164	3135

1930	17611	2/6	2201	2950	3092

1931	17087	2/3	1922	2368	2128 to 30 September

Why did Mr Riggs not discover the disadvantage of keeping an overseer to supervise one man, one horse and a dray while he was in office?  The present Council has sold ⅔ of the plant, cut scavenging cost by half by piece work and reduced the Clerk’s salary.  Rates were reduced from 2/6 to 2/3.  The Hospital rate went up £30, the main road grant was cut to £100 and the £168 subsidy on rates was cut.  The overseer and curator are one job and could hardly safely be made casual.  There are 101 small things that cannot be done by piece work without chaos.  Amalgamation of Councils would be a disaster.  It would see the town go backwards.  If wards were done away with there would be some economy.  The overseer had to control over 50 men receiving the Federal Grant.  As for a 22½% drop in values, I haven’t heard of it.  Banks haven’t made such a cut on overdrafts!  Like the Premiers’ Plan change takes time.
