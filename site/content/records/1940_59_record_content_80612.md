Burra RSL held its AGM in the club rooms 15 February.

President C.M. Beckwith reported on a successful year.  Membership rose from 128 to 142.  The Ministers’ Fraternal conducted the Anzac Service at which the Marananga Band headed the march and accompanied the ceremony.  The annual ball was an outstanding success.  The Annual Smoke Social drew a full house.  The combined Christmas Party with the Air Force Association was also very successful.  Badge Days were conducted for Legacy, Poppy Day Appeal and Anzac Day Appeal.  We continue to support two Legacy Wards.  A cricket match was played against Farrell Flat RSL.  In the year a fireplace was built in the club rooms and several rooms have been painted.  About 100 trees were planted on land opposite the Rifle Club.  Several graves have been attended to under the supervision of Pension Officer Mt Cornelius.  During the year farewells were accorded Mr Trigwell, Mr & Mrs Lott, Mr & Mrs A. Bence and Mr Tom Wooton.

Thanks are extended to the members of the Ladies Auxiliary and to members of the Sub-Branch Committee.

Elected for 1958: President, E.C. Pietsch; Vice-Presidents, H. Griffen & T.G .Perry; Secretary, R.W. Nankivell and Treasurer, J. Battye.
