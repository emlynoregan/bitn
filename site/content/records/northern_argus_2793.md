Elders Pastoral will celebrate the centenary of their sheep sales in Burra this year with records showing the first sale at the present saleyards site was on 25 November 1887 when some 15,000 sheep and 420 cattle were offered.  The two storey Elders office building is now the Tourist Information Centre.  The land for the saleyards was acquired from James Shakes and John Lewis at a cost of £518-15-0.  The original red and blue gum post and rail sheep yards cost £120-16-0.

In 1902 a newspaper report says Burra was then recognised as the principal market in SA and Elder, Smith & Co. decided to erect their own yards.  The then new yards were designed to hold 40,000 sheep and at the recent off-shears sale 44,000 sheep were offered and sold.

Elder’s first Burra office were modest facilities at the rear of Drew & Crewes’ Store.  Tenders were called for the two storey office in 1890 and it was open for business in 1891.  They moved to their recently vacated offices after merging with Goldsbrough Mort in the 1960s.  In 1887 the flat rate of commission was 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep.  Records show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents at Burra exceeded 500,000 per annum.  One record about 1890 reports a private sale of 19,995 two-toothed ewes sold for 17/9 each and one injured one at 3/-, revealing a generation that expected nothing and gave nothing.

In 1906 one of the first pieces of high-tech equipment was introduced to the office – a typewriter.  In 1904 the office took delivery of its first motor vehicle, but horses and buggies were retained till 1917.
