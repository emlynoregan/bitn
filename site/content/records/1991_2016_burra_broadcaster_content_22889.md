Mokota Conservation Park

A meeting at Mt Bryan Hall on 3 July was a workshop for planning the management of this new park, which is to be officially declared on 15 October.  The park contains up to 200 species, of which about 90 are weeds.  Twelve species are of state conservation significance and two are of national significance.  Management issues discussed included concerns over wildfire, the future of existing dams, weed and kangaroo control, boundary issues and threatened species management.

[Page 8 adds that Ian Falkenberg, the new District ranger, will move into the new Burra office in mid-July and will work on the areas parks as well as the Kangaroo Management Program.]
