Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes were given a farewell at Leighton Hall last Saturday evening.  They had left for Glenelg a few weeks ago after living in the district for nearly forty years.  In that time everything in the district had enjoyed their financial and personal support.  Jack Preiss’s Orchestra provided the music.  Mr A.D. McDonald MP presided.

Mr McDonald said that Mr & Mrs Warnes had always seen that others who left the district got a good send-off, but had tried to avoid one for themselves.  Among the things Mr & Mrs Warnes had done he mentioned: the tree planting campaign from the church to the hall, the Leighton Hall, which owed much to Mr Warnes’ efforts that had seen it grow from a small room to a building valued at £1,500.  Mrs Warnes had been president of the Ladies’ Guild and instituted the Christmas Tree ceremony.  Both had taken a keen interest in sporting clubs and organised cricket and golf clubs on their own land.  Mr Warnes had been a member of the school committee.  Both has also taken a keen interest in activities across the whole district.

Mr T.H. Woollacott, Mayor of Burra, also paid tribute to the contribution of Mr & Mrs Warnes to the district’s institutions. He mentioned particularly Mrs Warnes’ role in the CWA and the OBE she had earned.

Dr Steele also mentioned Mrs Warnes’ role in the CWA and Mr Warnes’ great role in Leighton Hall and the Burra Hospital.  He had given the latter its X-Ray plant and later £300 towards alterations to the building.  Lately he had arranged for each bed to be fitted with an electric bell.

Mr A.B. Riggs spoke particularly of Mr Warnes’ part in the Burra Show Society.

Mr J. Beaglehole spoke on behalf of the Mt Bryan Hall Committee and as clerk of the District Council of Mt Bryan, of which Mr Warnes had been Chairman for 25 consecutive years.  He was now Chairman of the amalgamated councils.  Mr Warnes was Chairman of the Mt Bryan Memorial Hall and many times he had given £ for £ when improvements had been made to it.  The districts sports, benefactions and religious bodies had always received Mr Warnes’ support.

Mr Alan Pearce spoke for Booborowie and said the sound position of their hall owed a great deal to Mr & Mrs Warnes agreeing to open fetes etc. there and to their generous donations to it.  His generous gift when laying the foundation stone had not been forgotten.

Mr T.J. Quinn of Mt Bryan spoke in support of Mr Beaglehole’s remarks.

Mr & Mrs Warnes were presented with a framed illuminated address, an inscribed silver tea and coffee service and a chromium tray.

Leighton Golf & Tennis Clubs presented a mulga ink stand.

Mr & Mrs Warnes responded.
