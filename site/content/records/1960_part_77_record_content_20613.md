Mr Howard Griffen of Mt Bryan has developed a fleece weighing table.  The table measures 10 ft x 5 ft and weighs up to 30 lb.  It has been under test at the Agricultural Research Station Trangie and results suggest it would be a sound purchase where fleece measurement was an integral part of the breeding program.  Tests show it to be as accurate as a standard balance, allowing for the fact that some locks will fall through when a fleece is thrown onto the table – the difference from the pan weight being between nil and 0.2 lb.  Overall it was accurate and simplified the board boy’s routine.  A NSW firm has agreed to manufacture the table.
