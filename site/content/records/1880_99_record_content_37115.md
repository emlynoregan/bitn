William Davis, a railway ganger was killed near Burra on Saturday 28 June.  [Aged 48.]  It was his job, daily to travel the line between Burra and Mt Bryan on a tricycle.  The story is most clearly told by John Ryan, the first witness at the inquest:

‘Was at work at a culvert near the 105¾ mile post; my attention was drawn to the whistling of an engine to put down brakes; did not know what it meant; but soon saw the train pass me with deceased on the cow-catcher and a tricycle being pushed along in front; saw the train was pulling up; ran as fast as I could with two other men who were working with me; we ran on until the train stopped about 200 yards from where I wa[s] at work; assisted to extricate deceased from the cow-catcher, and also the tricycle; deceased’s left leg had got between the bars of the cow-catcher and his right leg was resting on the bars; his head was bent back under the bottom bar of the cow-catcher and beating upon the ballast; his trousers were torn on the left leg and I believe the flesh was also torn.  Deceased was not dead when extricated from the engine but died in the cutting to the north of the Burra station a few minutes to 8 o’clock; deceased was brought to Burra by the same train by which he was killed.’

The special train notice showed that the train was running nearly two hours late.  The accident occurred in fog which limited visibility to c. 100 yards.

[The noise of the tricycle would have drowned the noise of the approaching train as stated in the 2nd leader which also said these vehicles should have rubber tyres.]  The inquest was adjourned to 2 July.
