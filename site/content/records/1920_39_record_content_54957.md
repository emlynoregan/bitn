Burra Cycle & Athletic Club sent a deputation of President Sylvester Preiss & Secretary Alex Bevan to ask permission to lay a saucer track around Victoria Park.  Neither football nor cricket would be affected and there would be no cost to the Council.  C. Sampson had offered to grade the oval for the material needed for the changes, and this would also improve the oval.  Approval was given.
