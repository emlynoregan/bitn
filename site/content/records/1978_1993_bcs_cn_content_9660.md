Singapore Airlines is beginning its service into SA.  The airline will provide free seats for ten BCS students from Years 8-12 on its return flight to Melbourne on 15 December.  To qualify students must submit an application stating why they would like to take part.  A cost will be involved as students would have to stay over in Adelaide on Friday 14 December.  Students would then be encouraged to write a 300 word essay recounting their experience, for publication in the local paper (though this was not obligatory).
