West Burra Copper Mining Co. half-yearly report.

In the last six months the shaft has been deepened 52’ and at the 100’ level 50’ of driving has been done.  At present there is no payable ore in the shaft, but there is a 4” vein of quartz with copper at 152’.  We have £684 in credit and intend to stop deepening the shaft and explore the 50’ or 100’ levels further with driving.

Directors: T. McWaters, George Lord, A.J. McBride, Charles B. Warnes and S.M. Lane.
