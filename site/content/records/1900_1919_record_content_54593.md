Re-opening of the Leighton School.  I.J. Warnes re-opened the school on Tuesday 11 March.  E.W. Crewes also attended with J.Q. Hogan, Chairman of the Booborowie School Board and M.A. Radford as a representative of the Burra School Board.  The school building has been enlarged and lighting and ventilation improved.

Mr Warnes said the first school had been held in the old Wesleyan Chapel and in 1878 the first school had been built.  During the alterations school had carried on in Leighton Hall.  Wartime problems with labour and materials had delayed the project, which had begun in November 1917.  The 40 pupils certainly deserved better than the old cramped, badly lit and poorly ventilated room.  There had been a move to build a new school at Blacksmith’s Corner and a second one by the creek, but this was no time to be building new schools – perhaps in better times.

A.D. McDonald then explained that the Government had contributed £75 and expected the rest to be found by parents, but in fact Mr Warnes had taken over the balance himself.

Messrs J.Q. Hogan, E. Cock, M.A. Radford, E.W. Crewes and Robinson (the head teacher), all spoke.  Mr Warnes was warmly thanked.
