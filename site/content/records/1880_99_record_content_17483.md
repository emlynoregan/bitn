Burra Town Council, 18 April.

Tenders were let for the footway to the Mine Bridge.

The Mayor had communicated with Captain Killicoat and it would be necessary to formally ask the Midland Road Board for permission to make the footway.

As the solicitor’s fee had been paid in advance the motion carried re his retainer will effect a savings next year.

The Mayor said he had twice interviewed Mr Mestayer [the Hydraulic Engineer] and understood the engine coming from England was only 6 h.p. and would not be sufficient.

He suggested the engineer be asked the power of the engine and its pumping capacity per hour.  They would then cave something definite to take to the Commissioner.  It would be better to keep the engine in stock than to set it up if it was inadequate.  Suggestion accepted.
