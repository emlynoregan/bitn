The Inspector was offered £80 instead of £75, but with all court fees to go to the Corporation.

SAMA has conceded the land around the cemetery to remain a reserve under Corporation control and allows the Corporation control of the banks of the Burra Creek for planting etc. on the understanding that at any time they could resume the same or any part thereof if the Association finds it in its best interest.

The Council will write to SAMA thanking them for this offer, but explaining that they could not expend the rates on the basis of such uncertain tenure.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has informed Council that the Reserves in Redruth would be placed under Council control.
