Burra Town Council has declined to declare the town a Sparrow District.

The bridge near the cemetery is to be repaired.

The Jubilee Avenue Fountain is to be repainted.

Cr Hardy moved a motion on notice that the Council impose a licence fee of £10 p.a. on all owners of premises used for the sale by public auction of horses and cattle within the municipality and that sale of such other than in licensed premises be unlawful.

Cr Watt called for a ruling on whether the motion was in order under Standing Order 94.  The Mayor ruled that without a by-law it was not legal and a meeting of ratepayers should be called to find their views.

Cr Rabbich 2nd the motion claiming that the auctioneers were the biggest transactors of business in the town and yet paid no rates.  Their business imposes wear and tear on the roads and they should pay a fair share of their upkeep.  He strongly supported the move.

Cr Hardy said the auction business could pay 8% dividend. [Implying they could easily afford the £10 annual fee.]

Crs Watt & Parks were opposed.

Cr Watt believed it was taxing those who beautified the town with fine buildings and brought in much business.

'If one person is doing more business than another it is not right that the man doing the most should be taxed higher than the other.'
