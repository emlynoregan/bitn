Election Meeting.  Burra Institute, Thursday.

Only about 100 electors were present.  Dr Brummitt presided.

Mr Bright.

Was willing in the outside country to give tenure for 42 years or longer to encourage improvements.  The colony suffered from surrenders of land in agricultural districts and much had been resold at low prices, reducing the Governmentâ€™s income.  He was not in favour of increasing duties on agricultural implements.  Was for inter-colonial free trade.  The whole world was in depression and the Government could not find work for all.  Debt was out of proportion to their population.  Too much had been spent on public buildings, and the railways were not well managed.  The poor should be educated to a certain level, but beyond that they should pay for it and those who could pay should pay for all education.

Bosworth

Was for greater fixity of tenure for pastoral lands. He favoured Bible reading in state schools.  The Road Boards should continue and he was for the gradual reduction of grants-in-aid and for consolidation and preservation of the Real Property Act.  He opposed increased tariffs or duties.  He favoured federation and assisted immigration, but opposed any increase in the civil service.

Martin

He was in favour of some protection.  Duties should be paid on things that could be produced here and if this raised too little then small duties might be imposed on other products.  Land tax should pay for Government borrowing for improvements in bridges, roads, railways etc. and for defence.  Property had in the past been insufficiently taxed.  Education should be free for reading, writing and arithmetic only, and for some technical education to fit people for work.  At present there was too much cramming for examinations.  There might be advanced schools for gifted children.  He favoured a continuation of grants-in-aid.

Bright and Bosworth opposed the payment of members [of Parliament].

Martin had changed his mind and was now in favour.
