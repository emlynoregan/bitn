Letter.  Danny Smith replied to a statement the previous week by Leo Sturman when Leo expressed disappointment that none of Burraâ€™s Churches had responded to enquiries about their participation in the Wheal Burra Burra Festival and made a suggestion that they were a dying force.  Danny pointed out that members of Christian churches in Burra were already widely involved in the festival as members of the community and in a wide range of organisations.
