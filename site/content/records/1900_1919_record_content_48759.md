Bridges

The application for funds to replace three bridges washed away by flood last year resulted in funds for only one bridge.  The one previously near Lord’s Hotel has been replaced with one opposite the Institute at £210.  The Government paid half and the Council will pay the other half over five years at 5% interest.  The Government has promised to assist later with the bridges near the White Hart Hotel and the Pig & Whistle.
