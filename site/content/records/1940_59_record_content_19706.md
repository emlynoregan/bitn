Obituary.  Mr John Morrison who died in Adelaide on 27 November was an old identity of this district.  He was employed at Messrs McGregorâ€™s wool scouring works at Mile End.  He was the son of Mr & Mrs Murdock Morrison who owned property at Westbury in 1881 and he spent his youth locally on sheep stations and later as a shearer.  He married Miss Lucy Fry of Pt Germein and they lived in Pt Pirie where he was employed by BHP Smelting Works.  Eventually they returned to Burra where Mr Morrison worked in various capacities for Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride.  He assisted the firm when it acquired Wilgena Station on the East-West Railway and other station properties and was well known in the northeast as a shearer.  For family and age reasons he went to live in Adelaide about 7 years ago.  He is survived by a widow, six daughters and one son.

[This obituary & the one on the previous page of the paper should be treated with caution.  There is no registration of his birth on the SA Births CD and the marriage registrations say he married Lucy Ann Bowman 13 May 1908 at Pt Pirie.  Strangely the daughter Jean that is mentioned is registered as born to John Morrison & Lucy Ann Fry at Caltowie.  There is no Enid registered as born to John Morrison, but there is an Edith Myra.  The death is registered as at Thebarton, residence Mile End and the age given of 61 suggests a birth in 1883 but his mother died in 1882.  The age given on marriage suggests a birth in 1881 or 1882.]
