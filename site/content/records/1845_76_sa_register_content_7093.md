Gold in SA

Some beautiful specimens of gold rock have been found on a section adjoining the Victoria Mine, the property of J.B. Neales Esq.  The gold is in fine lamin√¶ mixed with quartz and sandstone.  Two sets of miners have entered into arrangements with Mr Neales to work the lode for the next twelve months, paying him a handsome royalty and a rental for the land as well.
