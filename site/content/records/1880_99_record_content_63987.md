Fire.  On 12 April a fire on the farm of James O’Dea at Booborowie destroyed two haystacks containing about 48 tons of hay.  An inquest was held before J. Sampson JP and a jury of six headed by T.T. Shortridge.

James O’Dea said he awoke due to a noise between 3 & 4 a.m. and found the stacks alight.  Neither he nor his sons smoke and he knew of no one likely to do him injury.

John, Charles & Thomas (sons) corroborated his evidence.

Michael Kelly also gave evidence.

The verdict was there was no evidence to show the origin of the fire.  The stacks were insured.
