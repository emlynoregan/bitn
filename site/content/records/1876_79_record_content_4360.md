Letters to Ed. 
Rabbit rates do little good at all. The rabbit preserving works have seen no reduction in rabbits — indeed the numbers are increasing. Instead of a rate we need a compulsory eradication Bill without which absentee owners will do nothing.

‘Progress’ writes that railways need to be located to open up the country, they need to be pushed into the heart of the country & to the Barrier. Branches to be added later. The writer felt that the N-E was able to grow wheat and therefore needed the railway though squatters would oppose it as resumption of leases would follow.

A writer wondered why police allowed the Commercial Hotel to trade beyond 11 pm — indeed 2 am is mentioned with singing, swearing and sounds like quarrelling.

A writer asks why the youths of the town are allowed to disturb others at entertainments in the Inst. etc.
