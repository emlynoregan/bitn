Accident.  On Saturday morning a woman was injured when a utility crashed through the Bon Accord Bridge at about 4.30 a.m.  It was a vehicle owned and driven by Mr Clarence Frederick Garrard of Broken Hill and formerly of Burra.  The spot was where the railing was broken in an accident in August and had not been repaired.  The vehicle landed on its hood in the creek bed.  Mrs Garrard, the only passenger, suffered a fractured collar bone and left forearm.  Mr Garrard suffered a suspected fractured rib, but was later able to drive the vehicle on to Adelaide.
