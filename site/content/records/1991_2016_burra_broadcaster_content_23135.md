Vandalism.  A vandal attack at the toilet block in the creek area opposite the Town Hall resulted in toilet paper being strewn around and ignited, the block being flooded from the hand basin taps and a toilet bowl being broken by a brick.  [Comments by the police make it clear that juveniles are believed responsible.]
