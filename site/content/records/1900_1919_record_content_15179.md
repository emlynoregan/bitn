The Burra Record seeks to clarify its position with respect to the charges of claim jumping by Mr Hasselle and says it did not mean to imply that he had come by the claims unfairly.  After conversation with the gentleman â€˜we find that the reported jumping was out of the question.

[They may not have implied that he had acted illegally, but most readers would undoubtedly have gained the impression they thought the move was unfair.]
