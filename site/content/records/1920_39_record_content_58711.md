Mongolata Goldfield

Data from the ‘Mining Review’ showing the total ore treated by the Mongolata Battery and cyanide works up to 30 June 1935.

Values are calculated on a gold price of £4-4-11½ per fine ounce.

The total value of the above is £23,637-2-0, or at current prices about £40,000.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate.  The manager advises that 15 tons 5 cwt delivered to the battery on 22 November yielded 76 oz 1 dwt with tailing to come estimated at ½ oz per ton.

Going east in nice looking lode 18 ft from the line of the shaft.  The lode is 3½ ft wide and showing values.

The battery is still crushing a parcel, having done about 210 tons to date.

The Burra Institute Committee Grand Concert to launch the new grand piano and collect funds for it drew only about half a hall of patrons.  Music lovers turned up, but the social fraternity were absent, though they will be the ones to benefit from it for dance music.

[The concert is reviewed in an article about 1 column in length.]
