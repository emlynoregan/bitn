Burra Mine.  The Minister of Mines in Parliament, Hon. R.C. Geddes:

Earlier in 1968 several shafts were sunk in the oxidised leavings to obtain a sample of copper lodes for testing.  Metallurgical difficulties have been encountered in doing so, but investigations are proceeding.  Drilling to ascertain deeper lodes has taken place, but is stopped at present due to discouraging results.
