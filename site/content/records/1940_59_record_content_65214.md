Burra Hospital New Nurses Quarters were opened on Friday afternoon by Mr G. Stanley Hawker MP.  Mr M. de N. Lucas, on behalf of the Board, welcomed the MP.  The move started 12 years ago when the late Mr C. Gebhardt left money in a bequest for the purpose.  The hope was to build a new hospital, but as the cost rose to £75,000 it was decided to proceed in sections.  The present new building realised about one third of the plan.  Mr John Gebhardt, Chairman of the Fund-Raising Committee, said the new building and some repairs to the General Hospital had cost £10,750.  Of the money raised, which attracted a £ for £ subsidy, £1,500 remains and he recommended its investment until the next stage could be realised.

Mr Hawker said an efficient hospital needed efficient staff and this required comfortable quarters for them.  After declaring the building open a tour of inspection was made.  Each room is painted in different pastel shades with a different coloured ceiling, and furnished to match.  Red Cross ladies provided afternoon tea.
