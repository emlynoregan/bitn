Burra Burra Mine.  The Directors and Secretary arrived in Kooringa on Tuesday evening.  A large group of miners assembled to see them drive in.  The Kooringa Brass Band had assembled for the occasion.  The Survey took place at the Mine on Thursday and numerous tribute pitches and tutwork bargains were taken at the Captainsâ€™ prices, with only a few rejected.  The quantity of ore on the surface is still very large, but the weather is now fine and so there is the expectation that it will be speedily removed by the Patent Copper Company, whose works at the Burra are now nearly in full operation.  This imparts a stimulus to business in Kooringa, which had been slow due to the long continuance of the wet season.
