Historic Burra on Display

The Department of Housing, Urban and Regional Affairs is presenting a visual display in Adelaide on Burra as a result of their involvement in the Burra Conservation Study.  It will be in their Departmental Library on the 8th floor of the GRE Building in Grenfell Street.  It incorporates a tape and slide presentation, a pr√©cis of the findings of the Conservation Study, original S.T. Gill paintings owned by the Burra Burra DC and photos taken by Dr Tregenza of the Art Gallery.  After six weeks the display will be sent to Burra to become the property of the District Council.
