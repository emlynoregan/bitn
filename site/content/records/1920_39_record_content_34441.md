Liberal Federation Women’s Branch AGM 6 June.  The President Mrs I.J. Warnes took the chair.  While in Mt Gambier recently for the CWA she had also spoken at a local Women’s Branch of the Liberal Federation there.  All the old officers were re-elected, but Miss Bubb resigned from the committee due to her removal to Sydney and was eulogised by Mrs Warnes for her work.  Miss Bubb thanked her for her remarks.
