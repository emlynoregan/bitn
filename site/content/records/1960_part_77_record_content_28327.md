Burra National Trust is calling for material for its historical museum in Market Square.  The building is one of the early shops with rods for hanging outside shutters.  During last year the exterior was renovated and the front room repaired.  Historical items concerning the mine and town will be displayed in the front room and later it is hoped to repair the back rooms, making one a typical bedroom and another a typical kitchen of the mining era.  Both funds and items are needed.  [Photo of building.]
