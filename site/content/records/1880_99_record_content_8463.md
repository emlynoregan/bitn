Editorial on Burra Corporation and the Midland Road Board.

The kerbing and pitchpaving in Best Place is halted because of a dispute re the correct alignment of the road.  The surveyor and Mr Kelly [of the Road Board] are very seriously in error and the surveyor is either negligently or wilfully so.

Last September the Mayor and Town Clerk waited on the Board to get permission for kerbing and watertabling.  The Board undertook to raise the road.

There has been an encroachment, which has led to a dispute over the alignment of the road between Mr Ridgway’s and Mr Austin’s properties.  [The latter’s shop being occupied by Mr Rabbich.]  There is only 62½’ for a 66’ roadway between the two.  [The text here is corrupt and the above is the only reasonable interpretation.]

The Town Council called in the surveyor, F.G. Richardson who found the encroachment to be on Mr Ridgway’s side, varying from 0’ to 7’ and Mr Ridgway admitted a small encroachment, though not to that extent.  Nothing was done until the kerbing commenced following Richardson’s line.

This began, but it was found that pegs were wrongly driven and Mr Richardson had to be recalled to relay his line.

Meanwhile Mr Duffy, surveyor for the Midland Road Board insisted he have the right width of road between the kerbs (which the Council had always intended), but also that the footways either side be full width.  This, in view of the encroachment is impossible unless a strip on the east claimed by Mr Ridgway is cleared of buildings and made a footway, or on the other side a strip of about 3’ of vacant land and 3’6” of Mr Austin’s verandah are appropriated.

Council was prepared to have the inconvenience of narrowed footways and to give the Board full road width.

They only wanted to know the proper line to decide which side was wrong, but the Board’s surveyor did not oblige.  He simply asserted that he would regard Mr Ridgway’s line as correct.
