BCS.  Staff Profile: Michelle Kimber.

I have just completed my Bachelor of Education degree at the University of SA-Magill.  I have had teaching experience at Para Hills PS, Mercedes College and Norwood HS and worked as a swimming instructor in my holidays.  Unfortunately I only have a contract for term 1, due to Mike Dayâ€™s absence.  At BCS I share the Year 5/6 class with Peter Ryan, take R-2 and Yera9/10 Physical Education and teach Year 12 Accounting.
