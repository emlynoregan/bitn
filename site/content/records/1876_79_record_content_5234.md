The Mayor felt that next year they would have more to spend than ever before. He hoped to be re-elected. He had been a local for 11 years. They had not in the past been in a position to improve the town, but now they could ‘make it presentable’ 
Dr Nesbitt then spoke as a candidate for Mayor. He thought the last year had seen funds spent less wisely than they might have been. With an income of c. £850, £135 had gone in salaries and £600 should have been available for public works, which supplemented would give £1,200 annually to improve the town. He felt that the next year would in fact have less money to spend — in fact almost none! 
At present the debit was over £11 
The current quarter salaries were £35 
There was a contract let for £35 
The land for the new bridge approaches would cost £175 
Legal and other fees related to the bridge work would add £125 
Earthwork for the bridge, £50 
Money owed to the cemetery account £230 
Total £662 
With an income of c. £850 necessary expenses and salaries would leave £600 ‘so there would not be a very large balance to spend’ 
A mortuary chapel should be built at the cemetery. 
He favoured finding someone who could combine the jobs of Town Clerk, Surveyor, & Inspector and so save some of the salary costs. The 3d rate for sanitary purposes was a farce. It raised £150 which was spent: £50 to the inspector, £10 for the Secretary and £80 to the Scavenger and the latter produced a result ‘not equal to the expenditure.’ More was required than the removal of household refuse. 
He hoped water supply arrangements could be made to remove the antagonism between the north and south end of the town. He believed it had been decided to erect two standpipes in Kooringa — one in Market Square and one in Paxton Square. Some parts of town had a well in almost every backyard and did not require a scheme that would impose a general rate that would be unfair to those who did not use the water. Any citizen on the mains should be entitled to be connected at his own cost and to pay for water received. He also complained about a misleading flier circulated by his opponent or his supporters in which he was accused of being in town only ‘a year or two’ — actually it was almost 3½ years. He would ignore the comments about competence and experience. He was accused of always opposing the Council — he had opposed the original Council: not the one headed by Mr Lipsett. He was said to be promoted by a clique, of whom Messrs Drew & Dawson were considered the heads, but 104 persons had signed the requisition asking him to stand — a rather large ‘clique’. He didn’t have, the document claimed, one hour a month for the School Board of Advice. This was true because it was a waste of time — on it Mr Ridgway lived at Brighton and was rarely there, Mr Lipsett was Lane, Mr Bath was Lane & Mr Lane was Lane — so it was all Lane. He had never said, as was claimed, that the workingman would vote for Lipsett and respectable people would be on his side. 
Asked what arrangements had been made for a water supply, Mr Lipsett said none whatsoever. 
Mr Dawson then spoke against Mr Lipsett and he read reports of what Lipsett had said to the Commission re the water supply. The extracts said Lipsett had asserted teamsters had but two or three wells to depend on for supply. 
Lipsett rose to object and others interjected that there were in fact no public wells at all. Lipsett rose to say he had been sent to get the pipe extended to Kooringa, but had obtained a trough and standpipe at Aberdeen. He had indeed said two or three wells for teamsters as they could not use private wells. 
W. Pearce jnr said he didn’t know there were even two or three public wells. 
Cr Roberts and Rev. W. Jenkin rose in support of Mr Lipsett.
