Burra National Bank Branch Robbery

A Point Pass man was arrested last Thursday and charged with the robbery of Burra’s National Australia Bank on 4 August.  Barossa and Yorke Police sought him after reports of an armed robbery at Maitland’s ANZ branch at 2 p.m. and another at about 2.40 p.m. at the Ardrossan branch of BankSA.  He was sighted about 15 km from Bute and pursued, finally being stopped on the Agery Road about 10 km east of Kadina.  He was charged with the two alleged robberies on Yorke Peninsula as well as the Burra offence and appeared in the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on 27 October.
