Nathaniel O’Brien (9) will appear on CMC (Austar) this week.  The Country Music Channel contacted the family to let them know of his appearance following his try out for the Road to Tamworth.  Although he did not win this, he has won several Country Music Festivals, which entitles him to compete in the Champion of Champions to be held at Burnside Town Hall on 30 July.
