BCS.  The Year 12 SACE results for 2003 Stage 1 were of a similar standard to those of 2001 and 2002, but the Stage 2 results from a small cohort were disappointing.  Only 53.3% of senior students completed a full SACE Certificate.  This reflects the views of staff that numerous senior students exhibited a lack of both attendance and effort.  The principal said he looked forward to better results this year.

BCS has 26 new students for 2004, 14 of whom appear in a photo.
