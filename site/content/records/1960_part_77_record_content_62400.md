The rebuilding of Peacock’s Chimney.

In the early stages it was plain sailing.  The chimney was quickly dismantled and moved to the new site at the Mine entrance.  The courses were laid out and re-erection went smoothly as each course had been marked.

Difficulties began when the brick section was reached.  The old bricks proved unsuitable, having weathered too much in 100 years and other second-hand bricks had to be found.  The wet and windy weather intervened and then new bricklayers had to be found.  The original bricklayers found they could not build a tapered chimney and various others tried.  Finally two finished the job, but they had almost performed the impossible by squaring the circle.  Though it did not look too bad from a distance, it was decided it was unacceptable and unfair both on the subscribers and the memory of the old Cornish masons.  It was taken down.  After a long search Mr Colin Barron of Barron & Sons offered to complete it, but a week later, due to illness in the family, he had to withdraw.

Mr Bob O’Neill of O’ Neill & Clayton Ltd came to the rescue – recommended by Adelaide architect Mr Steve Gilbert.  Mr O’ Neill was President of the Master Builders’ Association for some years and a foundation member of the National Trust.  He had specialised in the reconstruction of historic buildings, including the restoration of Charles Sturt’s cottage at the Grange.

Cornish masons were in the habit of building their chimney stacks from the scaffolding inside the chimney and this was the method that had been followed on the first attempt at rebuilding Peacock’s Chimney.  Lack of experience resulted in failure, particularly at the top where the brickwork is stepped out (corbelling).

Mr O’Neill decided to use scaffolding on the outside.  This is more expensive, but use of volunteers has helped to contain costs.  The cost of hiring and erecting the scaffolding without volunteer labour would have been $950.  This cost has been halved.  Now the work has been re-commenced and the Governor will open the completed chimney at the Copper Festival.
