Drew & Crewes sued Mary Allen for a debt of £3-4-10.

Her husband, Alfred Allen, was employed at Roach’s Mill for 36/- a week.

Mrs Allen said she had no possessions – the furniture was all in her husband’s name by registered Bill of Sale.  Her cow belongs to Mr Adams, though she sometimes sells some milk – she hires the cow for 2/6 per week.

Mr Crewes said ‘this woman went about the town imposing on every honest tradesman and made every effort to get out of paying just debts’.  He asked for 2/6 a week.  The defendant said he could only get 1/-.  An order was made for 1/- a week.
