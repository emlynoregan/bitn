St Mary’s Service

The Anglican Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier will attend the St Mary’s service on Sunday, as will former Rector, Arch-Deacon Ross Lenthall.  Former organist Clem Davey will play the organ.

The Bishop will dedicate two memorials:

The set of bookshelves in the porch in memory of the late Guy Dollman and his wife Doris Mary Dollman.

An aumbry placed over the chapel altar to house the sacrament for the communion of the sick will honour the late Bishop Donald Llewellyn Redding, Rector of Burra 1933-39.

The Ven. Arch-Deacon Lenthall (Rector 1953-58) will be guest preacher who had a long association with Mr & Mrs Dollman and with Bishop Redding.  The aumbry has been designed by Mr N.C. Rohrlach of Whyalla who also designed the Sanctuary lamp some time ago.  A parish lunch will follow in the RSL Hall.
