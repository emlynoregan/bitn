Burra Town Council

The Premier wrote thanking the Mayor and Councillors for their reception on his recent visit.

The DC of Mt Bryan invited the Mayor and Councillors to attend a public meeting to organise a Bush Fire Brigade.  After discussion it was decided Councillors should attend at their discretion.

H. Jennison was given permission to erect a petrol bowser.

The cost of sinking graves will rise and an extra 10/- for Sunday work was recommended – the latter was referred back to Council.

It was resolved to charge £1-1-0 for all bowsers erected in streets.

A silent cop is to be placed at the corner of Best Place and Morehead St and a white line extended 172ft from it along Best Place.

Another will be placed at the Farmers’ Union corner and a line drawn.

Burra Rifle Club fired a 300, 600 & 700 yard match on Saturday and C.W. Pearce, H. Byles and J. Terry scored best.
