Obituary/Inquest.  Edward Gascoyne died suddenly at Burra.  An inquest was held by W.H. Challoner JP.  Dr Dashwood refrained from offering an opinion of the chemical contents of the stomach and intestines.  The deceased had made a statement accusing Theresa Clark, alias Mrs Brown of poisoning him.  While there is no suggested motive, the deceased had been suffering from severe cold for some days and inflammation of the bowels could have resulted.  The inquest was adjourned to permit expert examination of the contents of the organs.  [See further at 15 August 1870, page 3.]

[Edward Gascoigne died 5 August 1870 Kooringa, residence Adelaide aged 52.]
