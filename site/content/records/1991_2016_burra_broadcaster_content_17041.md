Small Plague Grasshoppers

A series of meetings has discussed the problem and the Goyder Council has moved to provide help.  A buffer zone has been delineated from north of Quorn to Robertstown and all proprietors in the zone will receive a form to provide permission for Primary Industries personnel to carry out control measures in the form of aerial spraying.
