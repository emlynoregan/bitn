Redruth 50 Years Ago.  Fourth in the series of reminiscences.

Memories of James Montgomery who was born at Dry Creek on 4 January 1853.

His father and a shipmate bought a section of land at Dry Creek for 20/- per acre.  His schooling is outlined, but it was not at Burra, which he came to first when he was aged 20 in 1873.  His father then had land at Mt Bryan.  Things here were very quiet after the mine closed and after living in the district for seven years he started carting wheat and wood at Wilmington with a bullock team for 11 years.  Calamity Station got its name from a series of accidents that happened there:

Jack Ashby got a broken jaw from the handle of a scoop.

A bullock hunter got his wrist broken

I lost sight of 1 eye when a piece of wood I was chopping flew into it.

I attended the first show in Burra.  It was held in the old Smelting Works where the horses and mules were kept. [He then goes on about the use of horses and mules by the E. & A. Copper Co.]

His father was one of the first batch to take copper ore to Pt Adelaide in a bullock dray, taking 2½ to 3 tons per load.

There were several wells in and around Burra.  Few people had tanks.  Some had square iron tanks and others wooden, zinc-lined cases, or a barrel, but most bought their water, delivered from wells.  Water carters came around in a two-wheeled cart with a large barrel.  One carter was Field, another Ryan, and another Enoch Stephens.  He built Stephens’ Row in Burra.

John Roach built a mill – he had one in Sevenhills, which burnt down, then he came to Burra.  His sons kept going for a while after his death.
