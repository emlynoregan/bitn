Notice.  Kooringa Infirmary.

Patron	W. Allen Esq.

President	W.H. Browne Esq.

Trustees	W. Paxton Esq., Dr Kent, J.G. Nash Esq.

Treasurer	J.C. Coke Esq.

Hon. Secretary	Thomas William Powell

And under the management of a committee of 12.

The township of Kooringa, being the centre of large mining operations, is the resort of a great number of new emigrants as well as a large number of bullock-drivers who are constantly coming and going.  Thus there is a community either living in tents or crowded boarding-houses in conditions liable to promote fever, the spread of diseases and accidents.  Within 30 miles of Kooringa it is estimated there are woodcutters, miners, shepherds, smelters, sawyers, bullock-drivers and labourers amounting to 3,000 (exclusive of those working on the Burra Burra Mine or for the Smelting Company) who in case of disease have no place of resort for medical treatment.

To enable such of these men who are able and willing to pay for hospital treatment as well as to afford help to those unable to do so, the committee is soliciting contributions to erect a building to be called the Kooringa Infirmary.  Subscription may be left at the Union Bank, the Bank of South Australia or with Henry Ayers Esq., Secretary of the SA Mining Association or Messrs Boord Brothers of Hindley Street.
