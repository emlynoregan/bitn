Burra Town Council, 5 December

Mr Bednall reported Mr Villis had been fined 5/- plus costs for permitting stock to stray on the road.

J.G. Carpenter was granted lease of the creek paddock from the Church of England to the mill for £6 p.a. provided trees were fenced to prevent damage.

The Mayor said he had launched a Christmas Fund for the poor.

Cr McWaters enquired about plans to widen the Mine Bridge – if they went ahead a light pole had to be moved.

The Clerk said no plans had yet come to hand.
