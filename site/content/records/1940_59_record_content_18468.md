Obituary.  Mrs C.C. Williams who died in Adelaide recently was an old Burra resident.  She was 89.  She arrived in SA from England in the Oakland in 1876.  En route she acted as a trained nurse, having trained at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading.  On arrival in SA she found the Burra Hospital had just started and agreed to come to Burra as a nurse.  After two years she married C.C. Williams.  During her life and especially in the early days she did a great deal of work in the district as a nurse, especially among the poorer people.  We understand she and the late T.W. Wilkinson and the late Lady Holder were the prime movers in the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society, founded when the late Mr Gebhardt left Â£500, the interest from which was to be distributed among the poor. [Born Catharine Watson.  See 64, 28, 11 July 1944, page 2.]
