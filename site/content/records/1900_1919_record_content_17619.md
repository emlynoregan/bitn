Obituary.  James Cullen, husband of Kate, died at Broken Hill, aged 63.  He is a brother to Mrs Fred Lewis of Hampton and to Mr W. Cullen of Terowie.  James Cullen was formerly engine driver at Roach’s Mill.  He leaves a wife and eight children: Mrs Fred Dew (Blue Bells near Burra), Elizabeth (WA), Alfred, Polly, John, James, Ethel, George and Ruby.  [Which makes nine!]  There are also two stepchildren: William & Mrs John Lewis of Broken Hill, and 8 grandchildren.
