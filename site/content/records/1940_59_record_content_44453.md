Mr & Mrs Trueman and family were farewelled from Copperhouse School on 14 January.  Mr Trueman has been in the district for 7 years and goes to Cunliffe near Moonta.  Copperhouse School has closed due to lack of students.  Supper and dancing concluded the evening.  The present building has been used for the school for about 70 years, before which the school was held in a private house across the road.  Its heyday was at the start of the century with 70-80 students from 1902-1907 and a peak of 88 in 1908.  Many students then came from Aberdeen and Hampton.  A bus service now carries students to Burra Primary School.
