E.E. Thamm writes in rather a bitter humour commenting on his treatment when he appealed his assessment.  Cr McWaters reinstated the original £20 after a small reduction [to £17-10-0] had been moved by Cr McBride.  He invited Cr Dane to visit and see for himself the value of the property.  He offers to provide a plank 16’ x 12” x 1½” to convey Cr Dane from his car across the slush to the verandah steps!
