Burra Town Council, 20 October.

The Council desired the Bowling and Tennis Clubs to beautify their grounds and would place rubble at their entrance as their contribution.

Dr Steele said that if shrubs etc. were planted, wagons used to cart top-dressing would be unable to turn around.  The Mayor wanted to see plantings at the entrance, at the back of the shed, and along the creek.  Mr Pollard suggested entrance for the wagons be from the Council’s paddock.  Representatives of the Council and the Clubs will meet to further the matter.

A letter from the DC of Hallett said it was not in favour of purchasing another district ambulance.  The Mayor said that the DC of Burra was of a similar opinion.  Cr Kellaway moved the ambulance be remodelled for Municipal use only.  Carried.
