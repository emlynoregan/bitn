Booborowie Area

At ‘Lucerne Downs’ Miss Alice Collins had 190 ewes, 6 rams and 70 lambs swept away.  65 sheep and lambs have been recovered, but about 200 are still missing.  She reports 450 points in two days and says others have had more.  Miles of fencing have been destroyed.  John Drew of Booborowie reports over four inches.

Other reports from the Booborowie area say the rush of water swept along boulders and large trees and played havoc with fencing.  Fencing material is in very limited supply, which will make replacement a problem.

Messrs I.J. Warnes & Sons have also lost sheep and several homes on Booborowie Flat were flooded.  The old station house at Booborowie, owned by I.J. Warnes & Sons and occupied by Mrs J.C. Przibilla and E. Asser and families was flooded to a depth of 30 inches.  R. Hodge, overseer for R. Hawker Ltd, lost 26 drums of kerosene, petrol and oil.  R. Morris’s residence was inundated and so was that of Mr Hurtle Baynes.  Mr W.D. Ogilvie’s home was also damaged.

At Booborowie Township itself the drain constructed to prevent flooding served its purpose well.
