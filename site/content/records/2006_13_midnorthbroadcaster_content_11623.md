The Burra Hospital is in the process of being transferred from Lower North Health to the Lower North Health Advisory Council.  Yorke and Lower North Health Service Director, Gary Stewart, says this will not affect funding levels or management.  The transfer was highlighted in a letter sent by Health Minister John Hill on 23 December 2010 in a reply to Concerned Burra Residents regarding the LNHAC and the withdrawal of acute care privileges in respect of Dr Dharma Dissanayake at Burra Hospital.  He said LNHAC also manages significant funds that have been donated by the local community to the health service.  He said in the letter that the decision to cease Dr Dissanayake providing acute services was made on the advice of an independent group of medical practitioners.  He also said this decision was being formally appealed and he could therefore not comment further.  Burra Doctor Lakman Fernando has since offered his services along with another doctor to be recruited by Dr Fernando to fill the void.  Dr Lakman now says he has reservations following the transfer of ownership of the hospital.  He is concerned about who is going to fund the hospital expenses, especially the emergency department.  He also disputed the statement that any independent medical officers assessed Dr Dissanayake.
