Obituary.  The death of the young aviator Mr James Melrose became known on Sunday morning.  The Town Council observed a silence in his honour before last Monday’s meeting.  The whole country had observed his epic flights from country to country.  Cr Dow moved a letter of sympathy be sent to his mother.  Cr Jennison seconded.

[Charles James Melrose born 13 September 1913, Burnside: died 5 July 1936 when his aeroplane broke up over South Melton in Victoria.  He was the son of Sir John Melrose’s brother, James, by his second wife, born Hilda Westley Billling.]
