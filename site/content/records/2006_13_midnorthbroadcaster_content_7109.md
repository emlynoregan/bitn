Helen Szuty of RAG writes re the inappropriate badging of the ‘Proposed Resolutions’ from RAG.  She considers that both the letter to residents and the apology in the paper failed to make it sufficiently clear that the error was the paper’s and not RAG’s.  She is also disappointed not to have received a letter of apology to RAG from the paper and looks forward to its arrival.
