Burra Sale Yards have been sold, marking the end of an era.  Sheep numbers have decline form more than 200 million in the 1970s when the saleyards were built to about 70 million today.  This has contributed to the drop in the number of smaller rural markets and the concentration on larger regional markets, such as at Jamestown in the Mid North.  Clients of Elders have been going to Jamestown for the past five to eight years and there have been no sales in Burra since October 2007, and that was only a small affair in the morning before a Jamestown sale.  At the peak Burra had monthly markets except in January and at times there were two a month.  There was a time when the Burra market attracted buyers from all over the state and from Victoria.  In the 1970s and 1980s everyone had lambs and sold them at the local market.  Young and older ewes were sold in October and wethers and lambs in November.  The largest number of sheep yarded at the Burra sale yards was for the Elders Centenary on Wednesday 25 November 1987, which was about 25,000.  Dressed in period costume Tom Rogers, who was State Livestock Manager for Elders.  He auctioned the first lot in pound shillings and pence.

[Note.  This article is misleading in some of its statements.  It is true that the saleyards in their latest configuration date from 1972, but Elders saleyards on this site were much older, as the reference to Elders Centenary Sale suggests.  The story of sheep sales at Burra North is complicated by the variety of agents and companies involved, but the Eldersâ€™ story starts on the site with their new yards being used for the first time on 25 November 1887, when they had a yarding of 25,000 sheep and 300 cattle.  The following year Elders Wool and Produce Co. was reorganised as Elder, Smith & Co. and the first sale under this name was on 27 July 1888 with just 4,350 sheep and 15 cattle.  In 1891 Sara & Dunstan completely reconstructed the saleyards for Elders and the new yards were opened 15 October 1891 with a yarding of 25,174 sheep.  In the late 1880s and early 1890s Elders were yarding over 200,000 sheep a year.  Shakes & Lewis were handling almost as many and others somewhat fewer, but an annual turnover in excess of half a million sheep was being recorded.  A series of dry years from 1892 saw numbers plummet, but the peak sale in SA was recorded on 27 September 1895 when Elders at their Bon Accord sale yarded 44,000 sheep and sold 36,000 of them along with 750 head of cattle.  In 1972 the old timber yards were replaced with the metal fencing that has just been sold.
