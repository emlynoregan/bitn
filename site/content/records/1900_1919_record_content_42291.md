W.B. Martin writes from Thames in New Zealand saying his family arrived in Burra in 1848 and left in 1862 to move to the Wallaroo Mines and then in 1872 went to New Zealand.  His father was Martin Martin, who sang in the Bible Christian Choir.  He remembers people in Burra named Killicoat, Drew, Lane and Truscott.  The writer is Bill, Martinâ€™s eldest son.  When the family arrived in Burra the creek was full of big gum trees and most people lived in the creek.  I was playing with Joe Reed when he went to wash his hands in the creek and the bank crumbled.  He fell in and drowned.  Remember two men, Prior and Johns, I think, who suffocated in the mine.  My wife was born at Kooringa on 11 October 1846, her father was Samuel Gribble and he left Burra about 68 years ago.  There were 14 in our family, of whom four survive: a sister in Broken Hill, Mrs Simons in Aberdeen, a brother in Wallaroo and I.  We have just celebrated our Golden Wedding and have 21 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren.
