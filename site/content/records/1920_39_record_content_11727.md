Martin Buckley, farmer of Gum Creek, was sued by Thomas H. Villis drover for £197-18-6.  The defendant was driving a car on 20 April which collided with the plaintiff who was riding a bicycle.  The plaintiff alleged the driver of the car had not kept a proper lookout, had lack of control and was on the wrong side of the road.  There was a counter claim of £10 for damage to the car.

Dr W.E. Steven gave evidence of the injuries which resulted in the plaintiff being taken to hospital four days after the event and staying there till 27 May.  By 1 October he was still not fit enough to resume his job as a drover.

The plaintiff gave evidence he was riding from Aberdeen to Kooringa on the left hand side of the road when two cars approached him.  Roy Sellars drove one which was on the left side and Martin Buckley’s car was on the right hand side of the road.  About a chain away from collision he tried to move to the crown of the road.  He did not believe he could have avoided the collision had he stayed on the left.  The plaintiff knew no more until he picked himself up off the road.  The bike was produced.

He had been earning £14 a week, out of which he had to pay a boy, his board and feed two horses.  The contract with Bennett & Fisher would have lasted to the present.

Ethel May Eddy corroborated the plaintiff and Ella Emily Nickles also gave evidence.

Roy Sellars said the defendant’s car was passing him and the plaintiff was riding along the fence.  The defendant’s car swerved or skidded towards the fence and the defendant then swung towards the middle of the road.  He had thought the defendant’s car would go through the fence when it swerved.

Buckley’s version of events had him travelling at 14 m.p.h. in the centre of the road with the plaintiff 7 or 8 ft from the fence and then suddenly veering in front of the car, apparently out of control.  He applied the brakes hard and a wheel broke.

Amanda Buckley, daughter of the defendant who was in the car, substantiated her father’s evidence.

In summing up his honour said on his own evidence the defendant was travelling about 40 m.p.h. and on visiting the site his honour believed the plaintiff and evidence from Mr Sellars and the two young ladies.  Judgement was for the plaintiff for £150 and in counter claim was also for Mr Villis.
