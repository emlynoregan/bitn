Annual Spinsters & Bachelors’ Ball was held last Friday.  The theme of the decorations was chrysanthemums with Japanese lanterns and skeleton umbrellas.  The stage was set up as a lounge for cards etc. for non-dancers and the entrance was a cosy retreat too.  Refreshments were served at 10.30.  Setaro’s Band came from Adelaide.  A list of costumes and participants is printed.
