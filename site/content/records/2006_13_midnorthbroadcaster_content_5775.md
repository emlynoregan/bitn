Paxton Square

The five-year management contract on the cottages will expire on 31 August.  Goyder Council is seeking to make temporary arrangements until June 2009.  Council is also seeking a valuation for the sale and/or lease of the property.  The cottages have been losing money in the order of $250,000 â€“ a cost carried by the Council.  Originally aimed at low cost accommodation by families, the cottages attracted a more affluent clientele.  The Council had budgeted for higher occupancy levels to generate more money to plough back into upgrades.  This did not eventuate.  Various options will now be considered.
