Phillip Bednall (18), 2nd son of Mr & Mrs M.W. Bednall formerly of Burra, has won the John Cresswell Scholarship for five years of study in the Commerce Course at Adelaide University.  He passed Leaving at St Peter’s College in 1947 and is among the top flight in cricket, being included in the Shield team for Brisbane after playing only two A Grade games.

[There is something wrong here.  John William & David Maurice were the first two sons, so perhaps Phillip is the 3rd.  Dates are too recent to be checked on CD.]
