‘Burra-ite’ writes wondering why the fact that there is a bitumen road now between Adelaide and Burra is not better publicised.  In the past few months many people, including some members of Government Departments have come to Burra via Black Springs, apparently unaware that the sealed road exists.  Signage is also a problem.  At the southern entrance to the town the sign to Adelaide still points to Black Springs and on the new road near Brown’s the sign points to Broken Hill via Burra North so that traffic bypasses Burra.
