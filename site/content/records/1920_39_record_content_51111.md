Solomon Williams.  Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s (Continued)

In the 1850s it was an easy matter for families to keep cows for milk, cream and butter.  There was plenty of surround country to be used as commons.  They depended mainly on grass, though those in milk also required some bran.  Cow-boys took the cows to pasture for a small fee.  One mob went east, another west and another south.  In all there were hundred of animals and they were a great asset to the people.

In the 1850s stray dogs were a great nuisance.  This was before the Dog Act and police would deal with them summarily.  At certain times soon after daybreak guns would be heard and many were destroyed in this way.

I remember seeing John McDouall Stuart returning from one of his expeditions.  He left his party at Mt Remarkable and came on by coach, staying over night at the Burra Hotel.  A group of businessmen met him at the hotel in the morning.  He came out looking very thin, but well.  He wore well-polished but old boots cut in places, no doubt to ease his feet.  Dr Wilkinson spoke to welcome him and congratulate him on his achievements.

The streets then are unimaginable to residents of today.  This was before they were formed or macadamised.  In winter they were deeply cut up by the cartage of heavy loads of logs for the mine and by the mule teams for the Smelting Works.  Crossing them was quite an adventure, but it was made easier in two places.  From Drew’s store to the Police Station was a path made of hard material forming a ridge above the muddy surface.  One day I saw a spring cart with four men in it drawn by one horse.  When it met this ridge the belly-band broke and the shafts went up spilling the men out.  T.W. Powell Clerk of the Local Court was one and he sustained a broken arm.

The other ridge went from John Winnall’s shop to Queen Street.

Election times were lively before the secret ballot was adopted.  I did not witness, but can vouch for my informant who spoke of one such election when George Strickland Kingston was a candidate for Parliament.  He was supported by the miners and a number of young fellows took the horses out of his vehicle and drew him up and down the street, giving the opposition a knock-out blow.  The opposition then produced an advertisement announcing the sale of some first-class donkeys – in fact the very same which drew Mr G.S. Kingston about the streets of Kooringa.

It was a great time for the boys when a large number of mules and a few donkeys came to Burra accompanied by Spaniards in their distinctive dress and hair plaited and wound round their heads under large sombreros and with their ponchos, lassoes & large rowelled spurs.  The boys went mad with improvised lassoes, catching dogs, cats, calves, posts and each other, though like all fads it soon passed.  The mule teams of ten in a wagon were employed for years, but after a time the Spaniards disappeared to be replaced by other muleteers.

My school days ended about 1862 after several years, first with Mr E. Strike and then under Mr John Ricardo Stephens, later known as Dr Stephens who was rather proud of his 5th Class and I suppose we were rather proficient compared with the general public schools of that period.  Occasionally there was an examination at which parents and friends were invited and one or two professional men assisted in the proceedings.  Dr Mayne was present on one such occasion and put a few questions.  I can remember two we failed to answer: if a herring and a half costs three half-pence, how many do I get for a shilling?  And point out the 185° of longitude.  The people living near the school must have been very patient to tolerate all the noise and disturbance when we were let out for recess with all the running, jumping, ball-throwing and yelling etc.
