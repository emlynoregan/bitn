Burra Broadcaster will change its size to tabloid from the next issue.  We are expanding to give blanket coverage to the whole of Goyder Council area, with a corresponding increase in circulation.  The change will make for better value for advertisers.  The price will rise to 70c as from 7 November.  [From the then 55c.]
