Further Removals from Burra

A week or so ago Mr & Mrs W.M. Heath and Mrs Norman Villis and her three children left for the city.  Sgt Villis is, we believe, on military duty for the duration.

Mrs Les. James is now following her husband, who some time ago obtained a position in the City.

This means the loss of another family of three.  Miss Dorothy Parker, Mrs James’ eldest daughter had been an enthusiastic supporter of the VSD and a Revue girl.

Mary Jesser, daughter of Mr & Mrs R. Jesser left recently to take up nursing and she had also been prominent in the VSD and a Revue girl.  Both had worked at Bence’s Ltd.

Master Dick Pascoe Jnr left three weeks ago to an office position in the City.
