The comments for the supplements for 1880-81 apply unchanged for this year.

It would appear that the supplements were common for a number of country papers and may not have been printed by the Burra Record.  When the microfilm versions were compiled some of the literary supplements from the Burra Record were not available.  It was possible to complete the collection by using those from other publications where it would seem the identical format prevailed, as the serials fitted in as required.

The reader certainly got good value for money with a good collection of reading matter both in fiction and non-fiction, though reading the small print employed, by candlelight or kerosene lamp, must have been something of a challenge to many.

The supplements comprised a single broadsheet page of seven columns of small print.  The poetry was quite limited and the prose each week would have provided a good deal of reading ranging over a wide variety of topics.

The titles of the serialised novels give a sufficient hint as to their contents.  They are generally romances of a most melodramatic sort.
