Burra Hospital Board Meeting 30 November

Mr Warnes moved the reduction of the Board to five members and Mr Riggs seconded it.

Mr Davey questioned the legitimacy of the motion on the grounds that Parliamentary procedure did not allow a similar motion for 12 months once a motion had been defeated.

The chairman agreed that the motion appeared to be irregular.

Mr Warnes said the hospital rules were not susceptible to such an interpretation.

The chairman ruled the motion out of order.

Mr Warnes then said he would get legal advice.

Miss Sandland asked if the 23 December would suit for the Christmas tree and that was approved.

The theft of wire from the fence around the Maternity Wing is to be reported to the police.

Mr Hawkes, the chairman, raised the question of the isolation ward.  He had a plan similar to one erected on the West Coast for £1,550 comprising two large rooms which could take four patients each, but it could be divided into four rooms.  Nurses bedroom, kitchenette, two bathrooms and conveniences with a 10ft verandah all round.  They had £600 in hand.  They could take another £100 from a fund and he was willing to give £100.  He felt sure that if they raised £1,000 they could get £500 from the Government.  He believed a £3,000 or £4,000 scheme was unnecessary.  Mr Melrose moved that the plans be sent to the medical officer to report on next meeting.
