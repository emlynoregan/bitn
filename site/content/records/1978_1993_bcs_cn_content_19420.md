Ronald John Shipard

Aged 53 and have lived in the Burra District for 30 years, having farmed at Hanson for 23 years.  I recently retired to 10 Queen street after several years farming in the Nyngan District of NSW.  Have been involved in the Burra & Hanson Tennis Clubs, Farrell Flat and Burra Golf Clubs, Agricultural Bureau at Hanson, BCS, Burra Show Society and St Maryâ€™s Church.  My aim is to make Burra a cleaner and healthier place to live and work in and would like to see the district get more value for money spent.
