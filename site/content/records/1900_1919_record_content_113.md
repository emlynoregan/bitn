The Patriotic Fund.  A concert in support of the fund was held on Thursday evening.  The Institute Hall was patriotically decorated.  [The program is reviewed.]  It included items played on Mr Hiddle’s gramophone.  £30 was raised and it is expected that £100 will be raised in Burra.  W.J. Davey took a flash photograph of the performers and the committee for presentation to the Queen.
