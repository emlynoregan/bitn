Burra Mine.  The rich lode at 65’ in the new shaft near Peacock’s air Shaft is causing much interest and many visitors.  Though not as rich as the material last week the lode is still payable stuff and it is being bagged to be sent for assay. At Bunts’s the miners struck malachite and the shaft is also opening out well.
