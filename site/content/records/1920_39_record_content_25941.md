Floods.  The rains reported last week continued and on Wednesday came reports of further falls to the northeast.  Hallett and Mallett each received 1” and Ketchowla 56 points.  Unknown to everyone over 2” had fallen at Glenora and Duffer Dam.  Rain set in here again on Wednesday evening.  On Thursday morning came news of 3.5” at Woolgangi and Oakbank and falls elsewhere of around 2”.  Cars were bogged and creeks came down.  Several groups of people were stranded at and near Glenora.  W.R. Lee spent an arduous few days rescuing bogged vehicles and becoming bogged himself.  Other people were in trouble at Bendigo Station where Jack Pens effected rescue with horses.  [Pictures of the difficulties there appeared in Saturday’s Register.]
