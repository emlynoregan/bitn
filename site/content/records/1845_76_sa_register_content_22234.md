Burra News, 29 July

Accident.  A man recently arrived from Kapunda was helping to unload a bullock dray in Messrs Drew’s yard on Monday when he was accidentally thrown off the dray.  The bullocks moved slightly and the wheels passed over both his thighs.  Fortunately no bones were broken, but the flesh injuries were serious.  After medical treatment he is making progress.

Redruth Wesleyans held their Sunday-school Anniversary last Sunday.  The usual sermons were preached and tea and cake consumed.  About £12 was added to the school funds.  There are 69 children on the roll.

The site of the proposed railway station remains a mystery.

Two persons are currently rumoured to be about to erect mills.

About £13 has been presented to Mr F. Gurney from the inhabitants of Burra in appreciation of his 15 years’ service as a mail driver.  No driver has had fewer accidents or been more punctual.

The Width of Tires Act

A meeting was held at the Aberdeen Hotel on 25 July to consider the provisions of the Act and the best way of relieving teamsters of the restrictions thus placed on their calling.

James Tiver, road contractor and builder, was voted into the chair.  He described the Act as ‘class legislation’.

William Woollacott objected to the haste with which the legislation had been put through.  He said it was one thing for the areas around Adelaide with metalled roads, but it was only very recently that any roads in this district had been metalled and the Act should not be enforced [on unmade roads].  Teamsters could not make a living with reduced loads and increasing the width of tires meant more friction and more bullocks to move a load, which also meant they couldn’t make a living.  Bush roads should be excluded from the Act.  Wide wheels cost £4 to £5 more to make.  He said the Patent Copper Co. loaded its mule wagons heavily and had them follow one another in a continuous line.  Each mule was shod and each team was about twelve mules.  This was what destroyed roads far more than a team of unshod or half shod bullocks.  He called for all owners of vehicles to be taxed as an alternative – why should owners of buggies get off scot-free.  The Act interfered with free trade.  He then proposed a motion calling for a petition for the repeal of the Width of Tires Act.

Mr M. Quinn spoke in support of Mr Woollacott and so did Mr W. Sampson, who blamed carters near Adelaide for cutting up roads and inflicting the Act on everyone else.

Tothill’s Creek Width of Tires Act Meeting

[The arguments at this meeting were essentially the same as at the Burra meeting already reported and noted above.]
