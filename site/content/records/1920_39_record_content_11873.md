Burra Electric Supply Co.

The half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held in Pearce’s Building on Thursday.  Matters were progressing well.  Some trouble had been had in selecting the plant, but it would comprise two engines of 60 and 30 horsepower.  A delay in erecting the powerhouse was caused because of a hitch in respect to the land and they had to move to another site involving an extra £150 in cost.  So far 60 houses had been wired and 30-40 orders were on hand.  About £1,000 worth of work had been done wiring houses.  If the contractors kept to contract the engines would be in place in the last week of November and electricity should be switched on early in December.  Provisional directors are: James Gallagher, M. Collins, W.H. Sandland & E.W. Crewes and they were re-elected for 12 months.  A cable recently received advises that the power plants should reach Port Adelaide on 24 November.
