BCS is attempting to become the first state school in SA to offer boarding facilities.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said a small sub-committee of the school and the Burra District Council had approached the Minister of Education with a proposal for a 60-bed facility on the school campus.  The Director General of Education has established a working party, chaired by the Director of the Western Region Mr Keith Ware.  Local MPs were supportive.  The aim was to enable isolated students who now did correspondence courses to have access to a school.  Students from small country towns would also be accommodated.  Mr Henderson said the school would like the facility to be housed in a number of small cottage-type units with a recreations room, a study room and a sick bay with a trained nurse and laundry facilities.  Getting approval will be difficult because it involves a change in Government policy, which has for 40 years concentrated on developing a superb correspondence system.
