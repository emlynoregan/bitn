Miss Bubb was given a kitchen afternoon on Wednesday to wish her well in her new venture in Kooringa.  On Thursday afternoon she was honoured at Jubilee Hall by members of the Soldiers’ Aid Society (of which she is President) at a ‘linen afternoon’.  Both meetings resulted in a large number of valuable gifts to help Miss Bubb launch her Guest House.
