The miners’ cottages present a most deserted appearance.  Where once all was teeming with inhabitants is now a scene of desolation.  The houses generally have windows smashed and doors unhinged with collections of rags and rubbish on their thresholds.  The old mine is desolate.  Not a man is to be seen.  The engine hangs motionless.  The exception is the main street where the shops remain open and are far from being deserted, as might have been expected.  The rapid increase in farmers around, the families of absent miners, those working on the railway and bush customers have all allowed the tradespeople to hold their ground.  On the whole they do not seem to fear the stoppage and the dullness of trade that must come before the resumption of operations.
