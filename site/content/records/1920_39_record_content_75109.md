Empire Day was celebrated at Burra Schools last Friday.  The day seemed to have greater meaning this year in view of the unrest existing in the world today.  Speakers were Mr S. Kellaway Chairman of the School Committee and Revs. Gray & Secombe.  The students then listened to a radio broadcast from the Norwood Oval with speeches from the retiring Director of Education Mr W. Adey, the Commissioner of Crown Lands Mr Rudal and Sir Henry Newland.  At the High School Dr D.M. Steele Chairman of the High School Council and Mr M. Bednall gave the addresses.
