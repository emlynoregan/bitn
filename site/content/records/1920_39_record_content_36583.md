Characteristics of the paper in 1930.

Page 1.

Large local advertisements dominate, but often mixed with some news, though the amount varies from nothing to half a page.

Page 2.

Large and small advertisements, sales and public notices and local government advertising.  Classified type items and sometimes news makes a late appearance.

Page 3.

This generally carries about five columns of news, though it is sometimes fleshed out with non-local items and articles of general interest.

Page 4.

This carries a lot of reading, but it is often not local in content, although local news can be a significant component.  The Advance Australia News Service often appears here.

Supplements are rare.

In general the paper gave reasonable local coverage, but supplemented this with a lot of material in the form of syndicated articles and in particular a column headed ‘Advance Australia News Service’.  This is frequent, but not every week.  Its source is not acknowledged, but the content is remarkable.  It is ultra-patriotic and fosters a jingoistic Australianism.  It is fiercely against party politics and individualism and promotes unquestioning obedience to a unitary state.  There is considerable admiration expressed for Mussolini and a desire to see the emergence of a strong national and nationalistic leader.  In short it is supportive of Fascism.

There are quite a lot of articles of general interest without a local component.
