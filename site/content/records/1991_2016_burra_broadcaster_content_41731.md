Goyder Council in December 2013 engaged an arborist to survey the condition of the white cedars in the Burra Town Heritage Area.  Seventy-nine were rated very poor for health and/or structure and were recommended for removal.  Council has a program to remove or replace these seventy-nine over a five year period, with eighteen to be replaced in 2016 with a non-fruiting variety of white cedar.  Feedback will be accepted to 13 May 2016.
