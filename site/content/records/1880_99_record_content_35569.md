Lancelot.  Messrs Anderson, Dick & Co., wool-buyers, scourers and fellmongers, have opened a branch at Lancelot.  [Of interest because this town near Peterborough has now completely disappeared.]

There is also an advertisement in column 2 for the ‘Lancelot Woolwash’ for which the address is Railway Station, Dawson Road, Lancelot.  This seems odd since as far as I can see Lancelot didn’t have a railway station (or a railway for that matter).  Perhaps it was at Ucolta.
