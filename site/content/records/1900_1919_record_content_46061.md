Mr Gebhardt wanted individual replies.

Mr Crewes thought the Doctors should be asked to a conference with the Board and Mr Warnes so moved.

Mr Hawkes said the letter was not only rude, but also intentionally rude and a conference would achieve more than letters, which could easily lead to unpleasant developments.  Motion carried unanimously.
