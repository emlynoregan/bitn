Burra School Welfare Club Annual Report is printed.

Membership was 54 and average attendance 29.  During the year various items of sporting equipment were bought and a reading laboratory and other teaching aids and a cupboard and bed for the sick bay.

We provided a buffet meal for 50 people when teachers from the district and inspectors visited the Burra School in June.

Burra High School.  Parents & Friends’ Association AGM

Elected: President, Mrs P. Sandercock; Vice-President, Mrs P. Murphy; Secretary, Mrs E. Benger; Assistant Secretary, Mrs P. Field and Treasurer, Mrs F. Brook.  The report on the year noted the near completion of the Jubilee Sports Area.  The Association provided luncheon at the Sports Day at the racecourse for the first time.  It was also associated with the Inter High School Sports and the Jubilee Celebrations.  The annual High School Ball this year took £159-11-3.  £500 was donated to the Jubilee Committee for the Sports Area and this attracted a Departmental subsidy.  Thanks go to W. Carpenter for re-lettering the Honour Roll in the Avenue of Remembrance for past students and teachers who fell in WWI & WWII.  The High School Banquet and the Vice-Regal visit were other highlights of the year.  There are now 53 financial members and average attendance was 27.
