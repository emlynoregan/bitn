Burra Electric Supply Co. Lead-in Wires

Legal opinion has been obtained that the Company is obliged by its agreement with the Council to keep its lead-in wires in good condition and failure after 14 days’ notice to do so could lead to termination of the agreement.  The writer had not found any Act of Parliament wherein there were specific regulations regarding wiring.  A letter from Norwich Union Insurance Co. stated that according to the Underwriters’ Act the active service cable had to be insulated for at least seven feet from the facia board of a dwelling.  The neutral could be bare.

Council then passed a motion asking the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd to see to it that service cables were affixed to dwellings supplied with current in accordance with the terms set out in the Underwriters’ Act.
