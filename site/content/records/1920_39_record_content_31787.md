Burra Local Court, 6 September

John Harrison was charged with unlawful possession of COR kerosene believed stolen from the COR depot at Aberdeen.  The tin in question was found at the defendant’s home.  Harrison offered no real explanation for its presence, supposing ‘the old woman’ had got it.  Mrs Harrison said she didn’t know where it had come from.  Harrison suggested it might have been left behind by boarders about five or six weeks ago.  He mentioned a George Ki (who left after his marriage on 17 July).  Police said that no store in Burra sold COR kerosene.  Harrison was fined £3 or one month in jail and was allowed one month to pay.

Arthur Harold (Mick) Harrison was charged with unlawful possession of COR petrol which M-C Webster had seen him putting into his car at Burra Station on 5 September.  Harrison claimed to have bought it from a man with a motor lorry between Lilydale and Mutooroo, but was unable to give a receipt or to describe either the man or the lorry.  The defendant elaborated on this story of getting the petrol while on a rabbiting trip.  He was found guilty and fined £3 plus costs of 15/- or one month in jail, with one month to pay.  He was fined a further £1 and 15/- costs for having an unregistered firearm and the weapon was confiscated.
