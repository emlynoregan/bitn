The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push was won by the Dampier Salt Shakers from WA for the third time in succession.  A crowd estimated at 4,000 lined the highway and Burra streets to see the finish.  The Paringa Pushers came second.  The winners said their $10,000 prize would be donated to charity.  Paringa Pushers won $1,000 and in third place the Port Hedland Running Club won $500.  Retravision Boilers came 13th, but won $1,000 for being the only team with members over 40 years old.  Burra Barrow Birds won $1,000 for being the only female team.  Collinsville Rams were the best local team and came in fifth.  Burra Breathers came 8th.  The event was a great success and there are already plans for a Burra-Broken Hill push in 1988.
