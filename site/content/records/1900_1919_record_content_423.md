Court.

The following were charged with disturbing the peace:

Charles Stritch			Sappho Halls			Morris Geoghagen

William Knevett			Walter Newell			Stanley Bewley

Edward Moore			Alfred Bevan			Thomas Rosewall

The charges against Bevan and Rosewall were later withdrawn when they were found to have arrived late at the scene.  All the rest pleaded not guilty.

Bevan’s evidence.  Had arrived at Welsh Place c. 11 p.m. on 3 February and found Stritch rowing and fighting and hollowing in a disturbance which had lasted c. ¾ of an hour.  Halls was present, but did not start it: he was looking on.  Knevett was present.  Bevan saw Stritch strike Knevett who tried to defend himself, but was too young.  He also saw Stritch strike Bewley who did nothing.  Halls took Bewley’s part.  Moore was present with Rosewall and Bevan, but took no part.  Newell was present and had been drinking, but was not drunk and caused no row in Bevan’s presence.

Thomas Rosewall’s evidence largely agreed with the above.  He thought Stritch had caused the row.

Stritch said he had come in from McBride’s Norman Farm with a horse and trap.  When he came out of the hotel someone had let the horse loose, this happened a second time and things were removed from his trap and a bottle of beer taken from his pocket.  He said two or three of a group of boys were teasing him.

After hearing all the evidence the charges against Rosewall and Bevan were withdrawn.  Halls, Bewley, Newell and Moore were discharged.  Stritch, Knevett, and Geoghagen were fined 10/- + 13/4 costs or in lieu, 14 days.

Francis Harris			Charles Schultz			John Stephen Beale

Each fined 2/6 + costs for owning various straying animals.
