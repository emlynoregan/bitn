Redruth Methodist Sunday School Centenary

The Wesleyan Methodist Church began in Kooringa in 1847 and in 1851 a chapel was built at Redruth.  This was dismantled in 1854 and went to Spring Farm, where it became the head of the Clare Circuit.  By 1856 many men had returned from the Victorian Goldfields and in 1857 the church was restored.  The first mention of a Sunday school in Redruth is in 1856 when Mr Benjamin Preece started the school in a stable near a store owned by Mr Austin.  In 1857 the church was rebuilt near the Police Station and the school was held there.  Mr Edwards became morning Superintendent and Mr W. Pearce the afternoon Superintendent.  Mr A.H. Forder was appointed the first Secretary.  The 1st Sunday School Anniversary was held on 1 October 1857.  In 1874 the present church was built and the Sunday school room was attached at a cost of £265.  It later became the transept.  In 1882 the Sunday school held a bazaar at the home of Miss Reed and raised £170 to enable the purchase for £200 of the corner block, where the Memorial Hall now stands.  In 1879 the wall separating the church and the schoolroom was taken down to create the transept as at present.  The Sunday school was then fortunate that the Lutherans permitted the use of the Lutheran Church that stood between the Police Station and the Creek.  They met there for 23 years.  In 1900 Methodist Union was effected and the Primitive Methodist Church was altered and renamed Jubilee Hall to become the Methodist Sunday school in Burra North.  In 1915 Mrs Gare began to take collections in her Sunday school class for a new Sunday school.  The Rev. E.M. Ingamells returned in 1924 to lay the foundation stone for the new school, which was built by T.H. Woollacott and F.M. Pearce.  It was formally opened on Saturday 7 February 1925, when Mr James Reed opened the door.  One week before opening £1,190 was owing.  Before the celebrations had been completed, it had been paid off.  Mrs W.H. Gare unveiled the memorial plaque and Mr Frank Reed was treasurer of the building fund.  Early this year the building was repainted inside.  Today a shortage of teachers has curtailed activities, but thanks to the people of Kooringa the Methodist witness continues even stronger than before.  The success of the centenary celebrations was largely due to the untiring efforts of Mrs Satchell, Miss Reed, Mr L.H. Thomas, Mrs H.L. White and Mr & Mrs B.P. Thamm.
