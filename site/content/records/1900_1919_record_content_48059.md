Red Cross Concert.  The concert organised by Miss Kathleen Sandland passed off most successfully on Monday evening at the Institute before a large audience.  Mrs Trevor was unable to perform due to illness.  The comedy pieces were well performed and much appreciated.  The auction of the Red Cross flag signed by Lady Galway raised £30.  Nett proceeds for Red Cross should be between £50 and £60.
