Burra Town Council, 7 December

The Unemployment Relief Council advised that a sum of money had been made available for Christmas Cheer for the unemployed.  Heads of households were entitled to £1, a woman to 10/-, a single man to 10/- and each child to 2/6.  A list has been sent in advising that in Burra seven persons were entitled to the relief.

An inspection will be made of the cracks in the Fire Station walls.

M.W. Bednall advises that a portion of the Burra Hospital was still vested in the Council, but the Government was tidying up the titles to show all the land was now vested in the Burra Burra Hospital Inc.

Plans submitted by J.E. Pearce for a new sleepout at the National Bank were approved.

Quite a long discussion was held on whether to give the Aberdeen Croquet Club £2 towards excess water costs.  The Club was beautifying an area of Council owned land and this question came up annually.  Eventually it was resolved that the club would be paid £2 annually towards excess water (as long as they incurred such charges.)

Queen Street had been tarred in 1935 and it was resolved now to tar Kangaroo Street.

The occupiers of all houses with steps protruding into the footpath will be required to remove them, as they constitute a danger to pedestrians.  This was specifically sparked by concerns over the steps at Mr Woodman’s house on the path leading to the hospital.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Sampson on his recent bereavement.
