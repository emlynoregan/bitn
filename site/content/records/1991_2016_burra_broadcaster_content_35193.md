Letter from Bob Skinner & Glenys Christopher agreeing with a number of the points raised by Roger Cross.  They ‘do not think you are a wowser Mr Cross, but a caring, thinking individual who wonders about the apparent values of most of the people of Burra.’

The concern themselves with the self-esteem of the girls who are voted off and wonder if viewers get some enjoyment from seeing girls being rated as ‘failures’. 

‘…I still think this type of T.V. is a pretty low form of entertainment when someone in the audience can shout out ‘Show us your tits’.
