Burra Town Council.

Cr Davies moved the Council form itself into a committee to draw up a law for the general regulation of markets and sale of stock and to provide for tolls, dues and fees to be received thereat.

Cr Morris, who was absent, asked by letter that the matter be stood over until he was present.  He opposed the move on several grounds:

It would be taxing one business to its injury.

Present salesmen pay a licence individually of Â£10 p.a., which will soon come to Council.

The response could well be to sell stock by sample, or to move the sales beyond the town boundary and so evade the tax.

It is in the interest of the town that the motion not be carried.

It is outside our province.

There was some discussion on the matter and on whether the Council should own saleyards itself, before the matter was adjourned.
