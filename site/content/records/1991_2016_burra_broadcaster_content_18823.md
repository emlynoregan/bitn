Letter.  R.M. Gebhardt responds to the Ann Prescott letter re Mt Cone.  Gebhardts had owned Mt Cone for well over 100 years and the land was in good condition because of good management practices and not overgrazing.  It could have been ploughed up and had he known that it was to be confiscated he certainly would have.

‘Perhaps we need native grasses – but we need people like Ann Prescott and her Greenies much less.’
