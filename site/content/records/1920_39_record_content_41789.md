Roy Jeffery has finally been able to leave hospital after his serious accident two years ago.

H. Stockley linesman with the Telephone Dept. for over seven years has been transferred to McLaren vale for health reasons.  It is said he will be succeeded by Mr Sylvester Preiss.

Thomas Sandland late of ‘Heathmont’ is very ill in Perth.  He lives with his son Philip and about three weeks ago as he was opening a gate the horse in the buggy reared and struck Mr Sandland in the face breaking his nose and requiring 14 stitches in a severe cut in his face.  He was able to leave hospital after two weeks, but on Saturday he had a heart attack.  His youngest daughter Miss Elsie Sandland from Melbourne passed through Burra yesterday on the East-West Express on the way to see her father.

Mothers’ Day was celebrated last Sunday with larger than usual attendances at churches and a stream of traffic to the cemetery where masses of white flowers were in evidence.

Weather.  Rain fell on Friday with a useful 23 points locally.  To the east it was patchy with some good falls while others missed out.  Koomooloo for instance got 12 while Sturt Vale recorded 47 and Pine valley 78 points.
