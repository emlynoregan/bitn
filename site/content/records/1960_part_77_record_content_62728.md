Paxton Square Cottages have received a grant of $5,000 under the Rural Unemployment Scheme.  The fronts will be whitewashed, then new guttering and if finance permits the painting of the roof.  Four men are working on this project and eight others are employed under the scheme in putting down cement kerbing and water tables elsewhere.
