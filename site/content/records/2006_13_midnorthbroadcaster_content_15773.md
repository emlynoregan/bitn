BCS.  Years 8 & 9 boys have been participating in the Wise Moves for Boys Program, which local nurse Carrie Affolter implemented last year as the Wise Moves Program with Years 8 & 9 girls.  Until recently menâ€™s health and well being was an issue not commonly discussed.  Middle School co-ordinator Michelle Pudney said the school would like to see this program for many years to come.
