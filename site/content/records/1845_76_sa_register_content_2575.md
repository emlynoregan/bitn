[The paper then continues to report developments.]

The news from Burra by yesterday’s mail is calculated to remove any grounds for alarm.  There has been no serious breach of the peace and no destruction of property, much less any resort to arms or other tragic occurrences.  The men have returned to work with assurances that the matters in dispute will be amicably arranged and the Directors have intimated that the carriage of ore has resumed.

The dispute between the Directors and Mr Burra is not likely to be so soon settled.  Mr Burra has not only resigned under protest, but has engaged leading counsel, and means to sue the Directors for the full salary to which his services would have entitled him, had he remained Superintendent of the Mines for the stipulated period.
