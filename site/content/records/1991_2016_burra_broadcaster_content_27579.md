Goyder Council

Burra Creek toilets will have skylights installed.

The old shelters at Burra North Playground will be dismantled.

Farrell Flat will get a street numbering system.

Farrell Flat public toilets have been closed to the public pending the appointment of a cleaner – for whom $2,000 has been included in the 2001-02 budget.

Council will arrange a loan of $700,000 over ten years for Council’s Burra Office upgrade.

Council’s Paxton Square Working Party has been authorised to negotiate an extension of the lease of the Burra Visitor Centre with the Burra Branch of the National Trust for six months for up to $15,000.
