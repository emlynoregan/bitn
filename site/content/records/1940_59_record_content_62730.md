Mongolata Goldfield

The Government Auctioneer sold the equipment at the field last Wednesday and the once thriving field is now only a relic.  In the early 1930s the field had a boom and stories of easily won gold held hope of wealth for the miners and the district.  A good deal of Burra and other money was sunk into the field, but gold was found only in isolated pockets and the field was deemed one for prospectors only.  The largest nugget found, called Pexton’s Nugget, weighed 183 oz, valued at £10 an ounce.  The companies at the field pulled out leaving only optimistic miners, who gradually gave up.  All the Government supplied tools, shed, ladders, etc. were sold on Wednesday for fairly low prices.  The battery and big shed that housed it were not sold and will be transferred elsewhere.
