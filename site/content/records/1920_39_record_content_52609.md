A Lucky Escape.  Last week two sons of John Allen of Mt Bryan, grandsons of Mr J. Allen of Kooringa, were out playing when they saw a person draw water from a well.  Later they went to have a look.  They got the cover off and while peering down, Robert (5) the elder of them overbalanced and fell in.  The water was 40ft down and at that depth there were four landings.  Don (3½) calmly put the cover back, walked home and told his mother that Bobbie was down the well.  She told her husband who is the manager for Drew & Crewes at Mt Bryan and when Mr Allen uncovered the well and asked, ‘Are you all right Bobbie?’ he was surprised when the reply came back ‘Yes daddie.’  Bobbie who was up to his waist in water was standing on one of the platforms.  Mr Allen lowered the bucket and the 5-year-old climbed in – not an easy job according to well-sinkers – and his father pulled him up.  Apart from two grazed knees from trying to climb up the pole he was unhurt.  After a hot bath and bed he awoke next morning to greet his mother with the remark, ‘Gee whiz mum, I did make a splash, did you hear me?’
