The Mayor thanked Cr Kellaway for his motion.  The furniture previously in use was a disgrace and when distinguished visitors came it had reflected credit on neither the Council nor the citizens of Burra.

The motion was carried.

The Mayor read Christmas greetings from the Lord Provost of Aberdeen, Scotland.

A.L. Bence offered prizes of 15/- and 5/- for the best two letters to Father Christmas.

First prize went to Verona Brown aged 6 of Wildildie, Mongolata.

Second prize went to Barbara Jennison of Aberdeen aged 6.

A special second prize was awarded to Mavis Shipway of Mongolata aged 6.

Joy Pascoe submitted the most humorous letter:
