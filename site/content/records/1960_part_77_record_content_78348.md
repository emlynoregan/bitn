Burra Pre-School Kindergarten wishes to appoint a full-time director, but has almost no hope of doing do before 1 July and perhaps not this year unless there are enough children to fill the kindergarten for nine sessions per week.  At present the number cannot increase and the times of attendance cannot be extended until there is a full-time director.  Further information is required regarding the age of children and the number of days they would attend.
