Mrs M. Ironside of Burra writes complaining that a fall caused by an uneven paver in Commercial Street cost her a lot of pain, a trip to the Burra Hospital and then to the RAH, followed by the need to employ someone to do housework for some time.  The cost all up was $80-$90 and her insurance company refused to pay up because no other falls had been reported.

Peter Brodie writes, concerned about the transfer of the title to the Burra Hospital is being transferred to the Lower North Health Advisory Council.  This is a voluntary body with no authority and Burra has only minor representation on it.  A public forum is being held to discuss this at the Burra sports Complex at 1 p.m. 26 March, before the next Lower North HAC meeting.

Des Woolley writes to praise the action taken by Council to help solve his drainage problems in the southeast corner of the town.  He says the approach has been professional and the work of a high standard.

Don Lloyd and Claire Tiver write expressing their concern that the removal of large pepper trees (Schinus molle) across the district is ‘tearing a page from a history book’.  The pepper trees are believed to have grown from seeds introduced by Chilean muleteers carting copper to Port Wakefield in the mid 1850s.

Trevor Bird of Birdwood writes a long letter citing evidence that the rural property identification number system is not working.  Though supposedly giving rapid and precise identification for emergency services, he found it is not known or used by the Ambulance Service, the Police or the CFS.
