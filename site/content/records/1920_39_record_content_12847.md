Burra Town Council 18 February

There was disagreement re the council obligation to move the debris from the Redruth Sunday-school excavation.  Cr Kellaway said there was no metal in it and therefore they were under no obligation to move it.  The letter was then produced which showed the Council had agreed to take the stuff without specifying its quality and they were therefore obliged, under protest, to do so.  Cr Riggs said they had bought a pig in a bag and would have to take the consequences.

There were complaints that street lights, both gas and electric were not being lit.

Some boys have been pulling up trees about 2 years old on the parklands.  The boys and parents have been summoned to the next meeting of Council.

Letter from R.J. Fairchild condemning the new Width of Tyres Act which reduces the carrying capacity of vehicles from 9 cwt to 8 cwt, but since the same loads have to be transported will do nothing to help the state of the roads.  It is merely an extra burden on the taxpayers - farmers and teamsters.  The car tax should go to the local government to aid road construction and maintenance.

Salvation Army.  The weather and the after effects of the Semaphore excursion made the effort on Monday as part of the 40th anniversary, less than satisfactory.
