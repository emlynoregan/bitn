Burra Burra DC is seeking details from all landowners about horehound infestation.  Over the past two years adjoining councils have attempted to reduce the incidence of horehound seed on roadsides and it is intended to carry this work on throughout the Burra Burra DC area.  Later eradication will be extended to the whole area.
