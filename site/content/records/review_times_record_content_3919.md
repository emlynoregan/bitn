Also present was the immediate past Principal of Burra Community School, Mr R. Henderson.  He presented two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall of the room; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that word had come from the Education Department that the position of an education officer for Burra would be funded from 1988.  Guests then inspected the collection, displays in the library and enjoyed afternoon tea.  Colin Fidock cut a cake celebrating the ninth birthday of the Community Library.
