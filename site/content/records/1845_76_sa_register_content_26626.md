Mount Bryan East Meeting

A public meeting on the districtâ€™s problems was held on 10 September.

T. Best moved that the inhabitants move to get the Eastern Plains mail to pass through Mt Bryan East rather than as at present to Munjibbie and thence to Ketchowla via Piltimitiappa.  This would see the mail carried more cheaply and service a larger population.  A committee set up to get a memorial to this effect drawn up and signed.

J. Prior moved for the appointment of JPs in the Hundreds of Hallett and Kingston.  This proposal was seconded by S. Roberts and adopted.

G. Harry moved amotion urging the Government to act to make landowners responsible for rabbit control.  J. Montgomery seconded and this was unanimously supported.

There was also unanimous agreement that it was time the area had a District Council and a special meeting will be called on this subject.
