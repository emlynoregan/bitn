Burra’s 1924 T-Model Ford Fire Truck is currently centre of a display in Wesfarmers Dalgety’s Market Square showrooms.  It has been lent by the National Trust.  It saw service in Burra in the 1920s and 1930s and was superseded by the Diamond T.  It is said that the last fire it attended was of a house that burnt down before it could be started.  It was discarded and went to a farm, but was rescued and restored in the early 1980s.  It then spent some time on display at the fire station in Wakefield Street in Adelaide.
