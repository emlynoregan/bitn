‘The Burra School & Community News’ – A Tribute

This began in 1978 following the demise of the Burra Record.  For the first time in 100 years Burra did not have a paper of its own and many felt it had lost its voice.  What happens and is recorded becomes tomorrow’s history.  Chris McCabe, the new Principal of the new BCS and his wife Denise came up with the idea of the ‘Burra School and Community News’.  At first it appeared fortnightly – typed, laid out and printed at the school by Cynthia Burnett.  Early illustrations were hand drawn by Mary Woollacott.

In 1978 BCS was new.  It had an SRC, a Parents & Friends’ Association, a School Council and staff.  The buildings were named after the original villages from the copper mining days.  Ron Thamm was Chairman of the School Council.  The school was officially opened in April 1978. The total enrolment was 456.  There were Community Weeks and film evenings and a Buy-a-Brick Campaign to get a reasonable sized gymnasium.
