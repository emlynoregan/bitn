The Poisoner is about again.  Poison has been laid around town and people have lost goats, pigs and a kangaroo dog on the chain.  One pig was lost in the pen.  A clue to the culprit is being followed up.

One victim was Harry Vivian’s fox terrier Doolan, a much loved animal and well known to patrons of Mr Vivian’s Commercial Hotel.
