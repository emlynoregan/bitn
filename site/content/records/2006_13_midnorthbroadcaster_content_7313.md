Palaeontology Bus Tours

Burra hosted busloads of curious visitors to Red Banks Conservation Park as part of the SA Museum’s Palaeontology Week.  There were guided tours on both Saturday and Sunday, starting in the foyer of the Goyder Council office, which houses an exhibition of fossilised bones from the Diprotodon supplied by the SA Museum.  National Parks & Wildlife Ranger, Kate Burton, gave a brief explanation of what they could expect to see before participants joined the bus.  At Red Banks Adelaide palaeontologist Aaron Camens explained the importance of the Red Banks site and what work had been carried out to date.  At the dig site visitors could see amateur and professional archaeologists working to find the remaining bones needed to complete the skeletal remains of a Diprotodon.    The diprotodon was Australia’s largest marsupial, living in the Burra area a mere 10,000 years ago.  They weighed in at one to two tonnes and stood two metres tall and three metres long.   They are so named because they had two distinctive tusk-like incisors: di (two), proto (front) and don (tooth).  They were well adapted to grinding up coarse tough foliage.  They are believed to have eaten 100 to 150 kg of vegetation a day.  They died out about 60,000 years ago.  [2 photos.]
