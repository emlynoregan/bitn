Those American Boys arrived by the midday train on Saturday and marched to the Institute with the band playing and were formally welcomed.

Saturday afternoon football:

Burra		1.5	3.12	4.15	5.21	(51)

American Boys	0.2	1.3	2.4	4.5	(29)

The evening entertainment at the Institute was crowded to the doors and was very well received, though the stage was too small to make the most of the drills.

On Sunday morning the boys could be seen all over town, with the old mine a popular place to visit and in the afternoon the band played in Victoria Park, but unfortunately it was cold and showery.  The charity collection there brought in c. £7.  The football match raised £8, of which one third was for the boys and two thirds for charity.  The concert grossed £31.  The party left for Broken Hill by Sunday evening’s express.
