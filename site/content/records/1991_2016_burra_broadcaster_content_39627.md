Cornish Heritage Listing

Residents are invited to attend an update on the progress of an application for National Heritage Listing for SAâ€™s Cornish Mining Areas.  The sessions will include a summary of supporting research done by ANU researcher Dr Ash Lenton.

The ultimate aim is to achieve a UNESCO World Heritage Site listing, in which the two SA sites would become part of a transnational listing of Cornish Mining Heritage, taking in the UK, Spain, Australia, Mexico and South Africa.  Burra and Moonta sites are already State Heritage listed.  This information session will be held at the Burra Town Hall on Monday 22 September at 5.30 p.m.
