Paxton Square Letters

Mrs G. Towler writes that as Denizen of the Square she had written a second letter that had not been published, in which she explained that her sole concern had been the fear of being turned out of a house with children.  She was sorry if she had misjudged the Council.  She did not say the inhabitants would object to their houses being examined and in the second letter made it clear they would be glad of any amelioration to their conditions.  They are patient because they know many lived in even worse conditions than theirs.  She finds the letter from ‘Evacuee’ abusive and his gross innuendoes unworthy of refutation.  ‘The Man Who Sees’ displays a larger souled person with sympathy who would never descend to such coarse expressions as ‘muck around in a pig trough’. 

The second letter of ‘Denizen of the Square’ is then printed, which bears out what has been said above and says that a major concern is the hordes of mosquitoes that breed in the stagnant ooze of the creek.

The Editor adds that this was received too late for inclusion in the previous issue.
