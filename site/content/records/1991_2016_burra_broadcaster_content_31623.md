‘Belcunda’ 19 km north of Burra has been sold by Jim Litchfield’s Hazeldean Company to neighbouring Collinsville for $3 million.

Hazeldean will continue to rub its East Bungaree & Hazeldean seedstock interests.  It is understood Collinsville will sell some other property, in order to purchase ‘Belcunda’ and so benefit from it as forming a contiguous parcel.
