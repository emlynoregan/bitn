Obituary/Inquest.  On Friday a coroner’s inquest was held at the Aberdeen Hotel before Dr Mayne JP to enquire into the death of James Waite, sheep farmer.  Captain Killicoat was the foreman of the jury.

Henry Chandler, publican of Black Springs, said he saw the deceased alive the previous day at about 4 p.m.  He had seen him on the Light River as he was heading to Black Springs.  He had asked if he stayed at the Emu Hotel overnight he could reach Burra by 8 o’clock the next morning.  I said he could.  It was not raining at that time, when we were eight miles from my home.  The ford near my home was not fit for crossing and that afternoon a great quantity of water was coming down the creek.

James Tyler, labourer of Black Springs.

Saw deceased at about 5 p.m. when he was some 200 yards from the ford.  Went into Robinson’s house for 15 minutes and on coming out saw a saddled horse in the paddock on the opposite side of the creek.  Went to the schoolhouse to see if the rider was sheltering there, but finding no one I rode the horse to the hotel and asked if anyone was there who had lost a horse.  Police Trooper Kidney, myself and one or two others then went to seek the rider.  We found the body about 450 yards down the creek.  It had not been raining when I saw the deceased, but there was a flood in the creek, which would have been 10-12 ft deep in places.  The ford was in good repair before the flood, but is now completely destroyed.

Henry Kidney, Police Trooper.

[Kidney’s evidence corroborates Tyler and he goes on to say how they identified the deceased from the belongings found on or near the body.  George Allen, commercial traveller, gave evidence concerning the ford and his view was that it was not completed before the flood, but was merely loose stones.]
