Mrs August Fuss was assaulted by a tramp who threw a croquet ball and hit her on the head when she refused him food.  Mr Fuss refused to charge him with assault and M-C Phelan had him brought back and charged with having no lawful visible means of support.  In the case the accused, David Baker reminded Mrs Fuss ‘it was an insult to call him a “tramp” and that you ought to be consumed by the flames of hell, and that is where you would be in a couple of days’.  The accused has been several times examined for lunacy and spent time in the Kew Asylum.  He was given two months in Adelaide Gaol.
