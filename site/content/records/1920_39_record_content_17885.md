The stables also caught alight and the position looked serious then for Parks’ bakery and the adjoining buildings.  The brigade poured water into the loft in blinding smoke and buckets of water were thrown over Parks’ woodheap only about 10ft from the fire.  Although every inch of timber in the stables was charred, the building and roof were intact.  This fire alone proves the value of the brigade and also shows that the problem of poor pressure can be solved.  £10,000 to £20,000 damage was saved by the brigade’s actions, as the whole block from Chapel to Queen Street would otherwise have been lost.  The cause of the outbreak is not known.
