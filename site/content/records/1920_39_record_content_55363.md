Mongolata Goldfield

Rev. Donald Redding held his fortnightly service and sing-song on Tuesday last week.  Attendance was c. 40.

A cricket team visited from World’s End and 30 March: Mongolata 53 defeated World’s End 21.

The return match was played at World’s End on Saturday: Mongolata 53 defeated World’s End 21.

This was a game in which six Mongolata players scored ducks and so did four World’s End players while a further five World’s End players scored only one run each.  (8 extras were by far the top score.)
