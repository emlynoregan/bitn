H. Cooper v. J. Ford in a claim for £5-3-4 wages due.

Henry Cooper claimed Ford had engaged him as a gardener to 26 June and on 28 June as a boundary rider at £1 a week.  A week later Cooper said he got a message to save the scalps and a few days later a message by Reynolds to pick up tools and clear.  He said to tell Ford he wanted proper notice.

Ford offered £1-5-6, which he told cooper was at the rate of 10/- a week.  When examined Cooper admitted receiving some tobacco and 3/-. 

Joseph Ford said Cooper had been engaged at 10/- a week in the garden, but he had a row with the men and after a day or two was sent rabbiting.  He was employed about two weeks and in that time had 2 lbs tobacco and a dozen boxes of matches.  He charged him 4/6 lb for the tobacco.  He swore he engaged the plaintiff at 10/- a week.  There was then some evidence about Cooper’s interaction with ‘the Chinaman’.  ‘He gave the Chinaman an awful fright; he said he would kill him and he made the Chinaman “blacker” instead of “whiter”.  (Laughter)

Mr Rounsevell: You didn’t hear him say he would kill the Chinaman, so you must not say that.  What has the Chinaman to do with the case?

Defendant: Why, he ran after him and the Chinaman ran for his life.  (Laughter)

Mr Rounsevell: Oh we’ll have nothing to do with the Chinaman.’

Later Ford said: ‘if he could frighten all the rabbits like he frightened the Chinaman he would be valuable.

Verdict for the plaintiff for £1-11-6.
