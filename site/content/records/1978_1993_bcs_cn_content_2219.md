BCS

Year 9 students visited Geralka Farm last Wednesday.

In the first half of the term we have had use of an Apple II Micro computer from Angle Park Computing Centre.  It is more powerful than the Wang it replaced.  Staff and students have been required to learn some new programs.  We have it for a further three weeks in Tern II.

Some Year 9 students are writing programs, some of which may later be used by younger students.  Many students have used the computer to play educational games and chess.

Aberdeen Clubrooms’ Women’s Committee raised $159 at their trading table on 21 March.

Cricket.  Burra Footballers won a consolation prize by winning the Mayfield Shield against Leighton.
