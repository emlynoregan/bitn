Early Burra District History: by ‘T.H.B.’ reprinted from the Register.

The article tells of the trip to the area in 1838 by Governor Gawler, Henry Bryan (a young English visitor), Charles Sturt & Henry Inman (Commissioner of Police).  They went up the Murray to NW Bend and then struck out to the NW.  It tells of how the party only got back to the river with difficulty, but how Henry Bryan failed to make it.  [There is no information on the later creation of towns in the area.]
