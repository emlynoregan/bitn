The English & Australian Copper Company

The adjourned meeting of the proprietors was resumed on 12 August [Perhaps 2 August as the print is unclear.]

[The Chairman explained that when they had adjourned the meeting held in July 1856, they had anticipated getting the accounts from Australia in time to resume the meeting in October 1856.  In fact the accounts were not received until February 1857.  The accounts and the accountant’s report had been laid before the Committee, which had made five suggestions and these would be laid before shareholders at the meeting.]

The old contract with the Burra Burra Company had expired in April 1856.

A new contract had provisionally been entered into by Mr Hamilton for seven years from 29 May 1856, terminable at the option of the Company, on giving three months’ notice prior to 1 July or 1 October each year.  This contract is more favourable than the old contract in three respects:

The power of termination outlined above.

The improved percentage of copper on the low produce ores.

The power of rejecting the low produce ores, providing that the whole of the ore raised in each period of two months does not average 17 %.

We note that the mine is now in full production, after the disruption of the gold rush, and the richest ores alone are being raised.  The last report being about 27%.  This is good for this company as the proportion of ore appertaining to this company from 100 tons at 27% is considerably larger than from 100 tons of ore at 17%, while the smelting charges do not increase in a corresponding ratio.  The Committee therefore recommends confirming the provisional contract entered into by Mr Hamilton.

The financial position of the Company in England has much improved and there is a surplus on hand out of which the shareholders may declare a dividend of 2/6 per share, if they think it expedient to do so.

The gross assets in Australia at 30 June 1856 are £251,869-1-6.  Cartage costs of ore are reducing.  This year Mr Hamilton expects to move 8,000 tons at 30/- instead of 40/-, a saving of £4,000.  There will be a saving on wages of £4,000 and a similar saving on freight, not including ore, which will be shipped as ballast.  In all there is likely to be a saving on the cartage of ore and coal and on freight to England of c. £20,000.  As a result the Committee recommends:

A continuation of operations in the colonies on the basis of the provisional contract with the Burra Burra Company.

That new auditors be appointed.

That a new and clear form of accounts be adopted.
