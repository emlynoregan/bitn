The Mayor refused to withdraw any of his remarks and threatened to adjourn the meeting.

Cr Hardy again said that three could form a quorum and others could leave.

Cr Linkson said: ‘Who said we were going to leave the room?

Cr Walsh said the Mayor would not allow anyone to speak on his [the Mayor’s] report at the last Council meeting and that is why it has come on for discussion now.

The Mayor read part of Standing Orders and claimed that they had to receive his report.

Cr Linkson said: ‘It is not compulsory to receive the report.’

Cr Parks asked that the Mayor withdraw the remarks complained of.

The Mayor refused.

Cr Parks then said that to avoid an adjournment he would vote for the receiving of the report, but would also give notice that at the next meeting he would move that the remarks be expunged from the minute book.

The report was then received with Crs Parks, Kitchen & Hardy for and Crs West Walsh & Linkson opposed.  The Mayor’s casting vote was for.

The Mayor then read his report.

Cr Hardy asked if communication had been received from SAR re the crossing at the Bon Accord.  No, it had not.

Cr Kitchen then asked if the report of the last Council meeting in the Record was considered by the Mayor to be true and correct.

The Mayor said he thought it to be anything but a fair one and it included several misstatements.

Cr Parks then asked if the Mayor considered it his duty to attend committee meetings.

The Mayor said he did and apologised for missing one, having not looked at the bottom of the notice.

Various other matters of a routine nature are then reported.

Cr West disagreed with work to be done, but the Public Works Report was eventually adopted.

Waterworks business of the normal sort was transacted and then Cr Kitchen asked if the engineer was allowed to leave the engine while it was working.

The Mayor asked what distance.

Cr Kitchen said 200 yards.

The Mayor did not think so and asked Mr Littlejohn if he did such a thing.

He said he never left the engine for 200 or 300 yards without someone in attendance.

Cr Hardy then asked if it was in order for the engineer to go to the Bon Accord Hotel while the engine was in full swing.

Cr Kitchen said a ratepayer had told him about it.

Cr Parks, as Chairman of the Waterworks Committee, moved that Cr Kitchen be asked to produce substantial evidence in the charge against the engineer.  Cr Walsh 2nd.

Cr Kitchen said he would do so if the party who told him was willing for his name to be divulged, otherwise they would have to accept the engineer’s denial.

Cr Linkson said that several complaints had been made to him, but he said nothing, as the parties concerned were not prepared to have their names mentioned.

The Mayor considered the charge so serious that if proved the engineer would be severely reprimanded, if not discharged.  He hoped the engineer would substantiate his own remarks.

The motion was carried.
