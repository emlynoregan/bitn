Miss Joan Davies flew to Sydney for the judging of the final of the ‘Pix’ Miss Cover Girl Quest.  She was one of the four finalists and the results of the all male judging panel will not be known for some time.  She returned to Burra last Tuesday.  If she were to win she would probably be asked to take part in the film Kingsford Smith to be made in Australia soon, as well as getting a ‘Pix’ model contract and a £100 War Bond.  Details in ⅔ column.
