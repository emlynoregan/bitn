Lieut. Graham Dow, son of Mr & Mrs G.H. Dow formerly of Burra, has been reported accidentally wounded while serving in Borneo.  News spread quickly and apparently his brother Reg., W.O.1. Clem Davey and Rev. Redding MBE (one time Rector of St Mary’s) all met at the scene of the accident to see if they could help.  It is quite a coincidence when one recalls that both Reg. and Graham Jnr were choirboys at St Mary’s when Rev. Redding was Rector there and Clem Davey was organist.
