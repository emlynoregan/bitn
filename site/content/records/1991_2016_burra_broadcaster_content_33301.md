Letter.  Glenys Christopher & Bob Skinner write again on the galah ‘problem’.  Their point is that grain farmers inevitably create a windfall source of food for galahs, who then like to roost in trees at night.  The few remaining trees in this area are in the town.  If farmers planted more trees around their paddocks the birds would roost there and it would most likely have other advantages as well with respect to reducing wind erosion, providing shelter and shade.
