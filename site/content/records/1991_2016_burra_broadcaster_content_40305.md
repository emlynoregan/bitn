New Residency and Ephemeral Art Trail in Burra

Country Arts SA is seeking expressions of interest from SA artists for a one week residency in Burra to create ephemeral works of art for installation in the public domain.  Four artists will be selected to take part in ‘develop and install residencies’ in July-August 2015, with art works to be installed March-April 2016.

Oppy’s IGA Community Chest for 2015 has presented $480 to the Burra Broadcaster to support this local paper.
