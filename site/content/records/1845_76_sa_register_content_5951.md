Considerable excitement had been shown before the meeting on account of the effects of the disastrous season.  The drought is such that the cartage of ore has been virtually stopped, with but 70 tons on the road and the Patent Copper Company has but six furnaces out of 19 at work because they are unable to get fuel.  Regardless of this situation the Captain of the Mine has declared ‘that the prospects were never more cheering than they now are’.    And observers have been reassured by the fact that profits are only £3,000 less than on 30 March 1850.

The colony can be reassured by these results and with 7,757 tons of ore and 144 tons of copper on hand within the colony there is no fear of a stoppage in the circulation of money arising from any failure in the operations of the Association.

The manufactured article is being sent largely to India and a consequence is that Indian produce has become cheaper here than in the other colonies, because of our greater facility in making payment.

The number of men and boys employed is 1,042.

There are only 24 employed at Karkulto Mines and the Pompurne Estate (Emu Plains) remains undeveloped.  The colony would benefit from the development of both these estates, which want only men and capital to release their buried treasures.
