Sgt R.J. Woollacott’s letters continue to arrive.  One on 26 August tells of his movement towards the front and on 5 September, two days after the anniversary of his enlistment, he reflected on the year past and speculated on the good that might come out of this catastrophe – of the lessons the war might teach.
