BCS.  As the Burra School & Community News ends with the issue of 22 December 1993, the school will need a new channel of communication with parents and community.  It has been proposed there be a fortnightly publication to inform about school events and provide an outlet for writing from students, staff and parents and for students’ art work.  The publication will need a name and also volunteers and a cartoon-type character to appear regularly.

22 December 1993

Chris McCabe, the first BCS Principal, writes to say that he remembers reading that ‘a town without a newspaper is a town without a soul’.  Ian Auhl said much the same thing in 1976 just before the Burra Record ceased publication in the following year.  He says that the fact that the newsletter survived until December 1993 showed it served a need.  He writes of fond memories of the volunteers and was pleased once to have been a member of their team.  He wishes the Burra Broadcaster a long and successful future.

Kevin Fahey, Principal of BCS writes that he has been proud to have been associated with the Burra School & Community News and praises the dedication of the editors, typists, proofreaders, contributors, payout people, collators and distributors.  He thanks all community members who have contributed to its success over the past sixteen years.  He says a new avenue of communication will be developed and one such is the School’s Radio Station, which was granted a ‘narrow class licence’ the previous week.

Mary Woollacott writes reflecting on the sixteen years of operation:

The ‘School’ and later ‘School & Community News’ was born from a perceived need to keep a local news identity.

Chris McCabe was the prime mover in its establishment.

The first issues were produced from typed stencils.

The last issue used computer type setting.

It has depended on co-operation in every facet of its production.

For her ‘Hear and There’ was a column that stemmed from her days of writing ‘Out and About’ for the Burra Record.

While the publication was never in direct competition with the Broadcaster the decreasing number of volunteers meant that the committee had to accept the inevitable rather than place too great a burden on too few people.

Cameron Grover writes regretting that this was the last issue of Burra School & Community News and points to its importance as a means of preserving a historical record of the town and surrounding districts during a period that a newspaper was not being published – as well as a means of communicating school news and sports results.  He thanks all associated with its success and production on behalf of the School and Community News Committee.

Chris Reed as Chairman of the Burra Community School Council adds his thanks and acknowledgement of the efforts of the group that produced the paper for the past sixteen years, echoing what has already been said and adding thanks especially to the major donors over the years: the Burra Apex Club, Burra traders, The Burra Burra District Council and the Burra Community School.
