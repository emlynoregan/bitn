[There is an interesting, amazing and disturbing ⅔-column article on how the British Empire is tied together by race.

‘All the nations in it, including India, descend from a common ancestor, and, curiously enough it includes types of the five branches of the Aryan stock already evolved – the Indian, the Persian exiles in India, the Egyptian, the Kelt and the Teuton and also the sixth branch (the Austral-American) now emerging.’

Eventually, it says, all these branches will unite in one splendid brotherhood.]
