W.H. Hardy, recently back from a prospecting trip to Central Australia has gone prospecting north of Hallett to the headwaters of the creeks leading to Ulooloo: the Nollenius, Coglin & Ulooloo Creeks.  He seeks to locate the reefs supplying the alluvial gold to the Ulooloo Field.  He hopes the field may be payable.
