Parking in Kooringa on Fridays is chaotic.  Cars are left at any angle and so close that it is frequently impossible for the inside car to be moved.  People execute turns without signalling.  Last Friday afternoon there were four collisions in Kooringa and one in Aberdeen and, though no one was injured, the damage was extensive.  Three places are particularly dangerous due to the high speeds of vehicles: the SAFU Corner, the curve in Market Square by F. Harrisâ€™s shop and anywhere a side street joins the main road.
