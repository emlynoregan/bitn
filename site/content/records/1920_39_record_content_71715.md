A New Zealand Farmers’ Group, which is visiting Australia was welcomed by Mr I.J. Warnes Chairman of the District Council of Burra Burra and Mr S. Kellaway the Mayor of Burra, at the Centenary Hall at Burra Show Grounds.  Mrs A.N. Ratcliffe of the Royal Exchange Hotel provided dinner for the 100 who attended.  The tour was being conducted by Mr Harry, a son of the late Jimmy Harry who had worked in the Burra Mine.  Mr Warnes’ speech is reported at length and runs on to page 4.  Mr Harry and others responded for the visitors.  Other speakers were A.D. McDonald MP and Mr Bradley.

The Ratepayers’ Meeting last Thursday evening.

About 45 people attended.  The Mayor S. Kellaway presided.

The first question was to ask the approval to borrow £400 by debentures on the security of a special rate of 7d in the £.

The second question was to ask if ratepayers were willing for the Council to take over the Institute.

21 ratepayers could petition for a poll on either of the matters within 24 hours.

Mr Kellaway said the Council had a debt of £575-5-2 at 30 June 1938, which did not include £400 to be spent if the swimming pool was constructed.  That £400 had been borrowed at 4¼% and £49-16-9 had been paid back leaving £353-3-7.  Their total debt was therefore £929-8-9, which was way in excess of what they were allowed to borrow on the General Rule.

The £400 on debentures was a sum to draw on till rates came in.  If the Council did not borrow the money it would be impossible to carry on unless the Council immediately struck and collected the General & Special 7d rates.

The motion to borrow by debentures was lost without discussion.

Mr M.W. Bednall said that as a consequence the Corporation could not borrow money to carry on and would have to default on payment of wages etc. or collect rates one month after they were declared – in August instead of next March.

Mr Worth then put the case for the Institute.  He said that on the figures put to them they would see the transfer of the Institute involved the Corporation in little if any extra cost.  The most recent balance sheet gave an estimated income of £322-7-6 and expenses of £330-4-2.  There is a mortgage to the State Bank of £3,161-18-3 plus £39-10-6 interest to 31 December 1937.  Assets are £5,905-12-10, leaving an excess of assets over liabilities of £2,704-4-1.  No cash other than the costs of transfer would be required.  In round terms for taking over a liability of £3,000 the Council gained an asset worth £6,000.  Why does the Institute Committee wish to surrender such an asset?  They feel the management of the Institute is a matter which should be in the hands of the ratepayers.

Mr A.B. Riggs moved that the Burra Corporation acquire the Institute, as the proposition was sound.

Edgar Pearce spoke against it.  The committee would, if it needed public support, get more than the Council would.

Mr Bednall said the transfer required:

The consent of the ratepayers

The consent of the Council of the Institutes Association

The consent of the Minister of Education

The consent of the State Bank

If the Corporation took over it would have to pay the 5% interest to the State Bank half yearly.  As a member of the Institute Committee he said that for the last 8 years Burra had been very apathetic about the Institute.  Attempts to raise money had met with little or no response.  The Government had cut out the subsidy and there was little response to calls for library subscribers.  The committee could not afford a decent supper room or to give the Corporation a decent set of rooms for offices.  The Institute could pay its way, but could not effect any improvements.  The town would be getting a Town Hall for the cost of servicing the debt – far cheaper than the Town Halls at Clare or Peterborough, which the ratepayers had to bear the capital cost of.  If the Council took over, the Government would have no say in it at all.  A rate of 2d in the £ would cover the interest and 6d if there was no income at all.  In fact Mr Dane’s rent for the pictures amounted to a trifle less than the interest.

This motion when put was carried 22 to 19.

A poll has been called on both counts.
