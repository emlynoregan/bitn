Numbering of issues for the 1894 paper

1894 began with Volume XV No. 277 on 3 January 1894

And ran to

Volume XV No. 320 on 24 December 1894

However, in this series the following numbers are used for two issues:

287, 306, 309, 312* & 313

297 & 319 appear on three issues

311* on five issues

The numbers 288, 298, 307 & 310 were not used

* Although 311 appeared on five issues some copies of 3 October were numbered 312 suggesting a correction on a second edition or later print run.

[The National Trustâ€™s bound hard copy carries No. 312. for 10 October.]

Some collections might thus suggest 312 was used on 3 & 10 October while others might suggest it appeared only on the latter date.
