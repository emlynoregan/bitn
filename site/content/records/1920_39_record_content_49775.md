Burra Town Council, Monday

St Mary’s requested the movement of a street light to a better location – granted at the church’s cost.

The local Fire Brigade would cost £306 for the coming year.

A tender for £10 for the purchase of the ambulance held by the Council was accepted.

The Mayor said Mr Bence had offered £5 a year as rental for the garage and he thought it should be accepted as the place was falling to pieces.  No decision.

The Mayor got the Town Clerk to bring in a deputation from the Burra district Band at short notice.

Cr Kellaway objected that they had not given two days notice to the Town Clerk as required by standing orders.  He moved they not be heard that night, but he was not seconded.

The Mayor said standing orders were often over-ridden, such as happened two weeks ago when a horse was bought when Cr Riggs & Cr Sampson were to ‘view’ the horse only.

Cr Kellaway: ‘That is a downright lie.’

Cr Sampson also repudiated the Mayor’s allegation.

The Mayor said he was quite prepared to hear the deputation, as the matter (concerning enlarging the rotunda) had been before them three times and it is only blocked by a technicality.

Cr Dow sympathised with the band, understood Cr Kellaway’s objection, but thought the deputation should be heard.  Cr Sampson was sympathetic, was for upholding standing orders, but thought that under the circumstances they should be heard.  He so moved, but this too was not seconded.

Cr Riggs thought it best to postpone the deputation.

The Mayor claimed not to have been approached by the Town Clerk before [on this issue].

The Town Clerk said he had been.

The Mayor said it was up to him to decide on the receiving of a deputation.

Cr Sampson accused the Mayor of trying to force his ideas on Council and allowing no other ideas to prevail.  [And the suggestion was that it was a habit of his.]

The argument then reverted to the horse issue.

The end seems to have been that the argument fizzled out without any resolution formally and the deputation was not heard.

J.H. Murison writes a letter ti the paper to explain what happened in this storm in a teacup.  Because a Brass Band Musical Festival has been arranged in Burra for 27 & 28 April when the Waikerie District Band will visit, he was anxious to see if anything could be done to allow the bands to play within the railings as the rotunda itself will hold only half a band.  He approached the Mayor about a deputation and the Mayor pointed out the irregularity of the procedure, but realised the need for action id anything could be done and promised his support.  He did not promise anything, but expressed a belief that the whole Council had the interests of the Band sufficiently at heart to consent to waiving the formalities considering the urgency of the case.
