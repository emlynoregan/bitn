Burra Town Council, 26 April

Waterworks Engineer reports the rates owing on 24 unclaimed North Ward allotments total £13-8-5 with the highest being £3-8-6.

Mrs Sampson is to be allowed to build a pig sty on a site near the cemetery.

There was again an altercation arising from the autocratic attitude of the Mayor in which he threatened to ‘Read the Act’ on Cr Jennison & Cr Bevan threatened to move that the Mayor’s ruling be disagreed with and he be asked to leave the chair.

This time it all blew over after a period of discord.

The question causing the dispute was the need to spend £128 of relief money which could only be spent on labour.

A special grant will be sought to bituminise to the railway gate.

Cr Sampson was granted three months leave as he has a contract in the northeast.

[Probably sinking or clearing our dams.]
