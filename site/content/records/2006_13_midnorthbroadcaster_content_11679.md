Tom Whittlesea of Booborowie won selection in the Team of the Championships in the 2011 SACA BankSA Under 17 Shield.  Although he missed the last of the seven game series, 16-year-old Whittlesea was among the most destructive quicks at the titles, collecting 13 wickets at an exceptional average of 9.2.  Tom is a good all round athlete, being among our best fielders and capable of a handy effort with the bat in the lower order.  He has the capacity to play district ‘A’ Grade cricket.  His best figures were 4 for 22 from 10 overs in the match against Adelaide at Glandore on Monday 17 January.  [Photo on page 1.]
