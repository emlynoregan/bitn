The Season.  The 1997-98 harvest turned out to be surprisingly good, considering the weather was terrible up to August.

Locusts have been plentiful on Christmas Day and immediately after.  Now there has been another hatching.

The ‘Midnight Oil House’ [Cobb & Co.’s Corner] features in Ken Duncan’s new book The Great South Land and also in the January edition of Australian Women’s Weekly.
