Goyder Council has approved the building of a digital mobile phone tower by Telstra on Brewery Hill.  It will form part of a network with another two towers built at Hallett and Black Springs.  State Heritage has indicated its approval. Subject to conditions:

All servicing of the tower is to be done via underground trenching.

A small colorbond building associated with the tower is to be located behind the hill, so as to be invisible from the town.

The approval was for a 35 m steel lattice tower, with provision for two other mobile phone companies to share if they wish.
