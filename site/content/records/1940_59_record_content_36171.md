Burra High School Parents & Friends Association held its AGM on Tuesday 16 March.  Mrs Marston took the chair.  Attendance was somewhat disappointing.

The Association had catered for the Inter-High School Sports on 9 May.  It had again paid for a number of books and magazine subscriptions for the school library.  A successful ball was run in conjunction with the High School Council.  Takings were down due to a very wet night, but it was an enjoyable occasion.  Considerable money was spent on sports equipment and a Gestetner machine.  Some members acted as examination supervisors for the Intermediate and Leaving Examinations.  The Association made arrangements for a fine banquet at the end of the year, but this had to be cancelled following the outbreak on infantile paralysis (polio).

Elected: President, Mrs Miels; Vice-Presidents, Mrs Riggs & Mrs Pederick; Secretary, Mrs A. Ford; Assistant Secretary, Mrs Jennison; Treasurer, Mrs I. Gare.
