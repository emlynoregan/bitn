The Travellers’ Aid Society.  The 9th anniversary of the local branch of the society was presided over by President Mrs I.J. Warnes.  The address was given by Miss Howard Clark of Adelaide, who gave an interesting account of the society’s activities.  The society was established to aid travelling women, girls and children.  Their helpers meet overseas and interstate boats, long distance trains and buses, and assist those travellers in distress or who are in need of help.  [Details in ⅔ column.]
