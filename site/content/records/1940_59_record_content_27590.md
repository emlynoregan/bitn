Burra Town Council

At a recent Council meeting Cr Woollacott said Burra could do with a cracking plant.  The Burra Burra DC had a crusher at the Ballast Quarry at Aberdeen, but it could only turn out large rubble.  If the Town Council installed new crackers, it could produce gravel for footpaths.  It was resolved that the Clerk would write to the District Council on the subject.
