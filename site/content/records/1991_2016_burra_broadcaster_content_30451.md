Fourthly, Councillor Gill and others should be under no illusion that the matter will proceed to Court given all evidence being obtained. The fact that he and others may propose to renominate in the upcoming election is purely up to them, because they know the consequences proposed in the Notice served on them, and it makes no difference to proceedings whether they are in Council or not.

Doug Wiltshire. Burraâ€™
