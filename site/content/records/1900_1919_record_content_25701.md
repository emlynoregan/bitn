Also supported Mr Crewes’ arguments.

S. Burns:

Sat rather uncomfortably on the fence, saying ‘there were two sides to the question.’

Mr Lane:

Thought the post office was in the right place now.  Many Aberdeen people got their correspondence through the Kooringa post office.  The best site was ‘certainly not Market Square’. 

Dr Sangster:

The post office might fit in Market Square, but not the residence and as there is a Post Office Savings Bank Assoc. that serves Aberdeen people as well, the present site is better.

The Hon. R.W. Foster said it was the first he had heard of a request for a new site – he said he would pass on the deputation’s ideas, but warned that division in the town could only cause delay.  Wherever the new post office was built they could rest assured it would be up-to-date.
