Article on Porter Lagoon

1876 - William Lunn and friend drown in the lagoon while duck shooting.  (Lunn was the founder of Spalding and great-grandfather of Burra resident Garth Lunn.

1926 – A syndicate was formed after a meeting at H.C. Atkins’ home, to build a 16 foot clinker boat.  People paid 6 pence an hour for a ride on Sundays and Public holidays and 2/6 an hour on other days.

1927 – The boat was christened ‘The Swan’ by Mrs Atkins at a special sports day.  A single plank jetty was erected and in late 1927 another boat, ‘The Gull’ was bought.  A shed was erected and a ladies only bathing area was declared.  Planning began for a regatta for Australia Day 1928.

1928 – The tradition of an Australia Day Regatta kicked off with events that included: bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel, 440 yard swim.

1929 – Athletic events were added to the regatta and a dance was held [At Farrell Flat] in the evening.

1930 – With lower water level more athletic events were added along with sheaf tossing.

1937 – The lake was dry and salt was being harvested.  At their peak, thousands were attending the regattas.  Swings and seesaws were erected on the shore, there was a plentiful supply of cool drinks and ice cream and catering was done in the boat shed.

WWII – When war broke out the boats were sold and moved to Fisherman’s Bay and the other assets were also sold.

1950s – The water returned and water skiing became popular.  The Australian Water Skiing Championships were held there and the Pt Adelaide Sailing Club came along.
