Burra Town Council, 23 September

The Mayor’s action in having D.T. Jacka & Co. cover the area under the Town Hall balcony with hardboard was endorsed.

Weeds in the cemetery have been sprayed.

Cemetery charges: grave digging weekdays $20 and weekends and public holidays $30.  There will be a surcharge of $5 for filling in a grave on weekends or public holidays.

The cost of electrical work at the Caravan Park rose $33 due to the need to install circuit breakers rather than fuses.  A subsidy will be sought to cover this charge.

The Highways & Local Government Department will be asked to investigate damage done to Taylor Street when the bridge on Highway 32 had been closed.  [The Bon accord Bridge.]

The Department of Agriculture advises of a subsidy of $45 for spraying the stock route.  ($120 had been requested.)

The Burra Small Bore Club was given permission to close the gateway in the northern stone wall to a gate 2 ft 6 inches wide.

Advertising slides shown at the Town Hall will be updated by Monks & Blanks Ltd.

Burra Golf Associates held their AGM on 25 September.

President Mrs M. Nicholls welcomed Associates.  The highlight of the season was Judy’s winning the Zone Silver Salver.  Another highlight was Burra’s win in the Pennant Competition after having played in it for years without a win.  Open Day entries were down and it was not a financial success, but it was enjoyable.  Congratulations go to the ‘A’ Grade Champion Mrs Jeffery, the ‘B’ Grade Champion Mrs Oates and ‘C’ Grade Champion Mrs Gebhardt.
