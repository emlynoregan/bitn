Obituary. The funeral of the late Mrs Roberts took place on Sunday and was attended by nearly everyone.  She was a class leader of the Wesleyan community.  Her sudden death left a family of six children, the youngest a few days old.  [Born Jane Shortland or Shourtland c. 1820: died 2 June 1864, Kooringa.  She died in childbirth, being delivered of twin daughters.  Jane Shourtland Roberts was born 2 June 1864, Kooringa: died 15 June 1864, Kooringa.  Her sister Alice Shourtland Roberts born 2 June 1864, Kooringa, perhaps surprisingly survived to be married in 1889.]
