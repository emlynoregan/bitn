Soldiers’ Memorial.  Conference of District Representatives.

Mr Crewes responded to the recent Leighton meeting and wrote to the DCs of Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Apoinga, Hanson, Hallett & Burra, asking the Chairmen to meet him and a conference took place at the Burra Institute on 18 December.  Those present were the Mayor, Crs T. McWaters, Kellock, & Pearse (Burra), I.J. Warnes (Mt Bryan), A.E. McWaters (Booborowie), Thomas & Radford (Burra Corporation) & some town residents.

The Mayor said several schemes had been mooted

A statue in Market Square

A suitable club building for returned men

With respect to a club building – clubs had been tried before and always died out after a while and such a place would need a caretaker and ongoing expenses.

Mr McDonald, Chairman of the Booborowie DC wrote apologising for his absence and calling for public meetings in the districts to discuss the alternatives, and for a debate in the press.

Mr Hawkes for Apoinga also apologised, but he favoured one fine memorial at a suitable place and would not like to see districts split into sections.

Cr Roger from Hanson also wrote in.

Cr Warnes was rather surprised to see more than representatives there and under those circumstances did not see it as a conference.  There was then considerable dissention about who should be present and what their role was.

Mr Crewes said his position was well known – a subscription from the districts and Burra of £1,500 for the purpose of a suitable memorial in Market Square.  He did not support a memorial in each district and he feared if they were erected they would soon be neglected.

Cr Warnes was concerned that the outside districts were not given credit for their efforts and had to have representation.  He personally did not favour many small memorials.

His others thought were for

an avenue of trees – say from Burra to Mt Bryan

a weir across Burra Creek

an isolation ward at Burra Hospital

He quite liked a statue, but was not sure it would be well received in outside districts.

Cr C.T. McWaters was not prepared to vote, but leaned towards a central monument.

Cr A.E. McWaters was also not prepared to decide yet, but leant towards a central monument, though each district would have to be represented on the executive and be duly represented at the opening etc.

Cr Warnes & Cr McWaters complained that they never got invitations to activities in Burra as official representatives of the DCs.  Cr McWaters thought that if a monument was erected specific places on it needed to be allotted to each district.  If a garden was to be maintained each district should have its own plot.

Cr Pearse favoured a lasting memorial – something like the memorial on North Terrace.  Trees in a few years would be just trees.

Cr Kellock would like to see unity.

Cr Thomas favoured a central monument: in 50 years small memorials would be neglected and dilapidated.  He favoured allocating each district its proper proportion and its proper representation on the executive.  He hoped for no split – he had heard that even one of Burra’s own Wards wanted its own memorial.  Nothing worthy could be done if they all split.

Cr Warnes did not think it fitting to raise funds on Peace Day.

The Mayor said there were to be three Peace Days: one of thanksgiving, one of rejoicing and one for the children.  He thought it a most suitable day to ask for donations.

Cr Warnes thought there should be a Memorial Day.

Cr Radford said that concerning the lack of official invitations to District Councils that the Burra Town Council had nothing to do with that – it was a matter in the hands of the various patriotic societies.

Cr Warnes said the patriotic bodies never recognised the districts and as President of several district bodies he could say no official invitations ever reached them.  He believed there would be better support for tree plantings or an isolation ward.  He had been asked personally, never officially to functions.

Mr Crewes said: On how many occasions have the outside districts gone on their own?  If the idea they were not valued was prevalent he was sorry: it was not the slightest intent of any patriotic body
