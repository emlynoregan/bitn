Burra Town Council, 7 November

The Unemployed Relief Council will make a £100 grant provided the Council subsidises it to the same amount – to employ only the genuinely unemployed.  Accepted.

The District Council advises it cannot legally spend money on the Princess Royal Road.

A range of matters connected with roads and tidying up the cemetery etc. were discussed.
