Fires.  Another outbreak of fire on Wednesday occurred on a portion of Cartapo and Wandillah Estate, which has been purchased by the Government for closer settlement.  It is blamed on phosphorus.  This time it did not extend very far.  A tin containing phosphorous was found near the origin of the fire by Mr Charles Burton.  He picked up the tin and when he shook it, it burst into flames, burning his hands.
