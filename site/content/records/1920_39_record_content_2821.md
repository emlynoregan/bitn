The inscription of the foundation stone was then discussed.  The Mayor said he had assumed it would say something to the effect that the stone was laid by the Governor or whoever performed the ceremony.  Mr Lane thought the RSL should have a say.  Mr Lawn thought it had been agreed that the only names to appear on the memorial would be those of the fallen.  Mr Hawkes agreed.  The agreement finally was that the wording would be ‘To Our Glorious Dead.’  February 23 was fixed for the day, but since then the Governor has advised he cannot perform the ceremony until the end of March.  A committee was appointed to choose the program for the day.  Dr Steele said they had now to decide the names to go on the memorial.  This was not entirely straightforward: some who died had never embarked, some died after returning home, some were Burra boys who had enlisted elsewhere.  A sub-committee will be appointed at the next general meeting to deal with this issue.
