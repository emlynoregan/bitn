Cr Tiver said they needed the larger engine, which would require more space.  He thought the suggestion they buy the works was an insult.

Cr Ridgway said the present Council was dealing with a much larger scheme than the earlier one had envisaged.

The Hydraulic Engineer had again declined to supply details of the cost of the works, but the Town Clerk analysed the situation as follows on the 13 June.

The Hydraulic Engineer’s report is misleading.  It gives the impression that the capacity of the machinery had never been questioned, but in fact in two interviews with the Mayor the necessity had been tacitly admitted by the Hydraulic Engineer.  On the 9 December he wrote to the Council.  Although the mains applied for are largely in excess of the requirements first given to the Department it will be advisable to fix the machinery as ordered and then to ascertain to what extent any extension of power is advisable.

The Hydraulic Engineer has consistently and persistently opposed concession of any kind and when they have been granted it has been by the Commissioner in spite of the Hydraulic Engineer’s attitude.

The argument from average consumption is very fallacious.  The demand in summer may be 100 times the winter demand.

The Council employs one man and in summer with the smaller engine he would spend virtually all his time at the pump and a mechanic would be required to look after the plant.  With the larger engine one man would suffice and fuel would also be more economically used.  The feeling re the need for a larger engine is intensified by the knowledge that the Railway Department has given up the lease on the adjoining property whence they have derived their water supply and have fallen back on their original plant south of the station.  This supply will be deficient whenever a seasonal drought occurs, as has previously happened.  A larger engine would place the Corporation in a position to supply such needs.

The suggestion that the Corporation should purchase the plant could only have been made in derision.  All we wish is to have a constant supply at minimum cost and this can best be done by setting up at the start a system that will require neither addition nor alteration for a lengthy period.

The site of the shaft should be arranged before the erection of the new engine to prevent any further litigation or uncertainty and the purchase of a small piece of adjacent ground would enable this.  The site question could be so much more easily understood upon inspection that the Council invites the Commissioner to examine it for himself.

John D. Cave.

Town Clerk
