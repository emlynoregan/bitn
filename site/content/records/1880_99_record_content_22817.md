‘Wanderer’: What with the Salvation Army and the Larrikins the place is becoming a pandemonium.  Saturday evening began with a hideous shrieking and vulgar bawlings by young fellows quite big enough to know how to behave themselves.  After which the Salvation Army appeared with drum and cymbals to see who could make the most noise.  A party said to me, so bad was the noise, that ‘had the composer been present he would have committed suicide.’  People should not have to put up with this uproar.

‘Wanderer’ then salutes the enterprise of J. Roach in starting the ‘Penny Reading’ series, which will keep many boys and girls from roaming the streets.  There was a disappointingly small attendance on Saturday night last, perhaps due to the rain.
