Volunteer Air Observation Corps showed a series of topical war films at the Institute on Thursday 10 February.  FO E.J. Ashby, Zone Officer for VAOC Adelaide, addressed the large gathering.  Though the threat from enemy aircraft had passed, the role of the corps was important in the training flights of young airmen.  The Burra post had a good record for the last two years under chief observer Mr F. Pledge.  Extra volunteers were needed.  Several volunteers were enrolled and it is hoped others will come forward.
