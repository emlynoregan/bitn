Sunday Sport.  F. B. Hewitson, the Anglican rector writes a long and learned article on Sunday Observance in response to ‘Abooringa’, the previous week.

[It is, perhaps, overly pedantic and takes a long time to come to the point that Sunday should be a day that sees a balance in physical and spiritual vigour, ideally having both religious and physical exercise – ‘unfortunately one is often emphasized to the detriment of the other.’

E. Smith also write on Sunday Sport, though mainly on why Sunday has become the Lord’s Day and the day of rest.  Exactly where he stands on Sunday sport is not quite clear, but probably against it.
