Obituary.  Don Halliday, a well known Burra man before moving to Adelaide, died following a road accident in Queensland last Thursday [14th September.]

[This may be incorrect.  The RSLâ€™s Last Post magazine reports the death of Donald Alton Halliday on 5 August 2001 and evidence suggests he enlisted for WWII from Burra.  He was born 18 May 1909 at Evanston, Gawler.]
