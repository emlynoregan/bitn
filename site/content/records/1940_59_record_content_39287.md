Burra Town Council, 2 November

Burra School Committee asked the Council to submit a price for asphalting a piece of ground 51 yards by 38 yards, all material to be supplied by Council.  Council replied that it would amount to more than Â£200, but due to work in hand they could not do it for several months.

SAR advised that arrangements had been made to minimise the time the Bon Accord crossing was blocked by shunting trains.  Also they would ensure that when practicable the blowing off of boilers would be done out of town.

War Memorial Committee advised it had so far been unable to get a tender for grading the oval.
