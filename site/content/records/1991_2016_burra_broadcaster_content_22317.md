Grasshoppers are present in swarms in the agricultural country as far south as Whyte Yarcowie and also in pastoral areas east of Burra.  Spraying had been done in the Hawker-Parachilna area and now mapping of their spread is being done before deciding whether to spray in the Mt Remarkable area and the Murray Mallee.  The swarms had their origin in the channel country of Queensland.
