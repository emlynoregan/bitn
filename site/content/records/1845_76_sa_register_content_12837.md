A fire broke out in a carpenter’s shop in the township on Saturday, but was fortunately noticed and extinguished before much damage was dome to the timber building.  Had it got a hold it would have spread rapidly and destroyed the block of houses adjacent to it.  The carpenter has lost a number of his tools and a quantity of timber.  He was badly frightened and has vowed never again to smoke in his shop.
