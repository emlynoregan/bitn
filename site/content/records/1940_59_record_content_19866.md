Ratepayers’ Meeting

The mayor placed before the well-attended meeting the proposal of Council to buy the Institute.

He said the total turnover for the year was £571-19-0.

Assets were £5,293.

Loss for the year was £36-17-6.

The debt being taken over was £3,160 to the State Bank plus interest.  The proposal was to make payments of £225 off interest and capital for 20 years.

On the present figures the Council would only need to find a small sum annually to do this, bit if they struck a 3½d rate they could pay it off in 10 years.

He hoped people would get behind the purchase and pay the whole lot off in the town’s centenary year in 1945.

Cr Kellaway supported buying the Institute, but also paying it off as soon as possible.

Mr A. Walker thought the swimming pool fund and the seaside picnic account could be utilised.

Mr Jennison as Chairman of the former was strongly against that.

The Mayor said several hundred pounds of War Loans etc. could be used.

A.B. Riggs said the present proposal was a saving of some £1,700 compared with an earlier scheme of purchase.

Mr F.T. Marston moved acceptance, Mr J. McGrath seconded and it was carried unanimously.
