J.C. Killicoat also attacks John McLaren ‘for his absolutely slack management during his abruptly-ended regime as Mayor’.  He ‘characteristically blames someone else’.  I fail to see where the Council repudiates any agreement, they are merely being businesslike and keeping the interests of ratepayers before them as first consideration.
