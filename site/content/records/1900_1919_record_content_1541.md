Burra Cycling Club held a sports meeting at Victoria Park on Monday.  The weather was good, but there was a very small crowd of people.  Since prizes totalled £12 and the rent cost £3-3-0 and incidentals £1-10-0 the cost of the enterprise was £16-3-0, but the gate brought in only £2-10-0.  This makes the meeting a dismal financial failure with a deficit of £13-13-0.

The racing itself was good.

W.J. Richards won the 2 mile.

J. Bailey won the 1 mile.

C. Packard won the ½ mile.

W.J. Richards won the scratch race.

W. Barkley won the ¼ mile dash.

O. Baynes won the Consolation Stakes.
