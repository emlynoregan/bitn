Australia Day in Burra saw more than 300 people gather at the Thomas Pickett Reserve in ideal weather conditions for breakfast.  Burra Swimming Club provided the breakfast and tables and chairs dotted the lawns.  A welcome by Steve Royal started the official proceedings and the Burra Sing Australia Choir, led by John Fuss, led the singing of the National Anthem.  Darren Lovell of the Burra Uniting Church gave an Australia Day address.  Australia Day Awards were then presented by Darryl Venning:

Burra Ward Citizen of the Year is Lorraine Stevens who has devoted many years to helping others through a variety of committees and organisations.

Rhiannon Phillips was the Young Citizen of the Year.  She has contributed in the SA Ambulance and sporting areas.  The Event of the Year Award went to the BBH Football & Netball Clubs for their hosting of the North Eastern Grand Final last September, which saw more than 4,000 people descend on the town and raised about $15,000.
