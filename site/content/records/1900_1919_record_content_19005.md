Fire.  A fire broke out in H. Collins & Sons paddock at Mt Bryan c. 1 mile north of the railway station soon after a train passed on Saturday about noon.  It ran northerly and jumped a chain road to Josiah Thomas’s paddock.  Thomas O’Connell narrowly escaped being caught while trying to save some sheep on John Harris’s property.  The fire then entered Collins & Sons 2nd paddock, jumped a road and entered Mt Bryan Sheep Station.  Reaching the main road by the church, it entered Richard Collins’s paddock and surrounded the residence.  It threatened Pearce Bros wheat crop, but turned N-E towards their homestead, but was halted at the road near the house.  The gusty wind then re-ignited it near the house and it again headed towards the wheat.  This time it was extinguished just three chains from it.  Richard Collins lost the most: principally grass and his garden.  His sheds etc. were saved.  H. Collins & Sons lost grass, but saved their stock and Messrs Thomas and Harris lost considerable grass.  Mr Harris had some stock caught, but it is thought they will survive.  It was over a mile wide and two miles long.  A small portion of Wandillah estate was burnt.
