Burra Town Council, 26 October.

Special meeting of the Waterworks Committee

The Commissioner of Public Works writes seeking the terms on which the Railways Department can have water from the Burra Waterworks.  He understood water was required for all the line from Riverton to Orroroo.  Under the old system the Railways Department charged the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department 3/- per 1,000 gallons and they had charged the public 6/- per 1,000 gallons.  [Presumably the ‘they’ in this sentence refers to the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department.]

Cr West believed that in the past the Government had paid, for the rent of the well, wages and fuel, c. £310 p.a. and consumption should not be less in the future.

Another reason for connection was on account of fire.

On Sunday morning a fire had destroyed about six feet of the platform and had it not been discovered the station might have burnt and no water was available.

Cr Ridgway suggested a price of 1/6 per 1,000 gallons.

The works were in a ragged state and at present they could not undertake any definite supply.  Things would be thrown out of gear in a couple of months by the installation of the new engine.

Cr Sampson thought 2/- would be better as you could always reduce the price, but not raise it.

Cr Ridgway thought his motion would allow sales to the public at 3/- per 1,000 gallons.

Cr Coglin would 2nd the motion at 2/- and Cr Ridgway agreed to this.  Carried.

The Council has received details of the capital cost of the Waterworks and a statement that the land they want is available at £50 if they want it to go on the Capital Account - Council agreed to accept the land.
