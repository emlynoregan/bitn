Weather.  Last Wednesday the temperature exceeded 100Â°F, but about 8.30 p.m. a sudden change brought in a three-hour gale with dust, creating one of the worst dust storms for some time with flying grit and even small gravel.  Some light rain began about midnight and by 9 a.m. 28 points had been registered.  In the pastoral areas falls were between 20 and 37 points.
