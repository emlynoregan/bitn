On 12 January this was rescinded, with the effect that in practise the doctors could now admit whom they chose.  The register of patients to be read at Board meetings.

Mr Hawkes thought the doctors would come and the whole thing be settled if the censure motion was rescinded.

Mr Winnall was in the chair and objected to any recantation.

Dr Ashton did not complain at the time and resigned in January, when he left the town.  The membership of the Board had changed greatly during Dr Ashton’s two-year absence and it was a direct insult that the doctors would not confer with it.

Mr Hawkes said that after the alleged unfair motion Dr Ashton had attended meetings, then resigned and finally accepted re-instatement under the Board which had insulted him.

Mr Warnes moved that as the hospital was meant to care for destitute persons; all persons treated should be free of all fees except hospital charges.  In regard to the vote of censure he recalled that the Matron and nurse were examined at the time, three years ago, and were now away.  If the doctor was not satisfied then why did he not ask for a special conference and have the matter thrashed out again whilst the parties were in the town?  The case was not specialised and the nurse had to attend to other cases.  If it were so bad the doctor should have given instructions.

When anyone left an institution and returned again it was generally taken that old sores had healed.  The two-line reply from the doctors was not worthy of gentlemen and an apology should have been demanded.  The financial and medical management were inseparable.  Dr Ashton said all he had to do was look after his private practice, but a good deal of that was done in the hospital.  Medical officers were paid to look after the patients on alternate weeks.  Many non-paying patients were surprised to receive doctor’s bills.  Then again the doctors had free use of the operating theatres and use of the nursing staff.  Concerning children, the only ones objected to were babes in arms as one of those would need a nurse to itself.  If the rules were unsatisfactory why didn’t the doctors come and help to amend them?  He felt certain that when they could no longer follow their private practice in the hospital they would ask for a conference.  Why Dr Williams involved himself in the matter was hard to say.

Mr McWaters 2nd the motion.

Mr Hawkes felt the motion was too drastic and in admitting paying patients the doctors were standing behind hospital rules.  It meant that of a person able to pay met with a serious accident and was taken to hospital the doctors might reasonably refuse to treat them.

Mr Gebhardt thought that to pay them £75 p.a. without the right to treat private patients would not be reasonable.
