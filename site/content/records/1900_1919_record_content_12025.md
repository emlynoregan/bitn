Fire.  A fire broke out in the chimney of an old man named Andrew Morgan, at Paradise, next to H. Walkers, about 11 o’clock on Thursday.  No water was available and about 2 o’clock the fire spread to the building which had a paling roof and hessian ceilings.  It was soon consumed, but for the walls.
