R.M. Harvey, former manager of the Bank of Australasia in Burra, reports that his son Bruce who many will remember here as ‘a knickerbockered little fellow’ has gone to Hong Kong to fill a good and responsible position.  Mr R.M. Harvey is now at Shepparton Victoria.

[Another paragraph on page 5 gives the following slightly different version of this report.]

Bruce (18) has been appointed operator at Singapore with the Eastern Extension Cable Co. and will holiday in Hong Kong briefly before taking up his position.
