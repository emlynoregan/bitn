Warden’s Court, 27 January (The first held in Burra)

T.M. Berry claimed H.W. Morgan & L. Motherall should forfeit their claim at Mongolata, as they had failed to work the claim and failed to report discovery of payable gold and Motherall had not applied for a gold lease as required by the Act.

Martin Berry gave evidence that the claim in the name of H.W. Morgan was not being worked in October 1932.  He claimed to have an option over the three claims.

Otto Wilhelm Allanson also gave evidence of seeing no sign of recent work on Morgan’s claim.

Allan Edward Schneider did not see any work being done on Morgan’s claim.

Court was adjourned till 1 February.

Plus padding.
