Burra Rifle Club

With the ending of the war rifle clubs are again permitted and a meeting of the old members and intending members is called for Friday night next in the RSL Clubrooms.  The conditions governing clubs will be as before July 1941.  Provision has been made for 144 clubs in SA with 6,000 members.  New clubs cannot at present be begun.  Plans are in hand to re-instate prize meetings etc. as before the war.
