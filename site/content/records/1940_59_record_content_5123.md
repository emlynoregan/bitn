Burra Town Council

Council resolved to support Mr McDonald in an effort to get the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry re-opened in the interest of local employment.

The Mayor objected to receiving the Overseer’s report because it failed to mention why repairs were done to the truck and why it had been used to cart water to the cemetery for the convenience of outside monumental contractors.  He had lost confidence in the Overseer.

A somewhat protracted discussion occurred before someone suggested that, as the Overseer was present, they should ask him to explain!

He said he had taken water to the cemetery after seeing there was no water there for people bringing flowers to the cemetery.  The contractors had preferred to use water from Sampson’s Well, though it had become silted up by the recent floods.  In any case they had not used the water in the tank he had taken down.

The Mayor was sceptical about this explanation because cement work had been done there.  The Overseer said it had been done before he took the tank down there.

Cr Lott wanted to reprimand the Overseer.

Cr Terry wanted to know why the Mayor was calling the Overseer a liar.

The Mayor then said there was a motion stating that the truck was not to go to the cemetery.

It was decided to let the report lie on the table till next meeting.
