Burra Town Council, 19 March

Burra electric Supply suggests the light at Kooringa Playground by discontinued, as it has been broken.  Cr Dow moved for discontinuation.  Seconded Cr Riggs.

Cr Kellaway said it had been installed to discourage vandalism.  It did not cost the Council as the Company had generously installed it.  He would like to see it maintained and Cr Bevan agreed.  The Mayor agreed with Cr Kellaway, but thought the repair costs should fall to the Council, especially if it posed a danger to children.  Cr Dow said he knew its purpose, but as the lights were switched off at midnight it seemed scarcely necessary.  There was no light at the Aberdeen Playground.  Cr Dow’s motion was lost.  The Company also advised that the St Mary’s light would be in its new position by 25 March.
