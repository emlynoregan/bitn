The Burra Preservation Committee supposedly has a large following, but is not recognised by Council, perhaps because of its inconsistencies and emotional approach

Council needs to acknowledge it is elected to govern on behalf of the people; not to rule over them

All deserve a say, but should be willing then to abide by the majority decision.
