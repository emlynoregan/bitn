Burra Rifle Club held a social at the Burra Hotel on Wednesday last and the trophies recently won, were presented.  [The winners were as previously noted and the report runs to 1½ columns.]

Dr Sangster jun. presided.  He was concerned at the problem Burra had in maintaining any sporting club for long.  Young men might get one going, but it soon fell to older ones to carry it on and married men had other obligations.  The absence of a cricket club in the town was an example.  In passing he mentioned the old rifle range as being ‘near the cemetery’.  He especially thanked Captain Lord for the present healthy state of the Rifle Club.  Presentations were then made and toasts proposed.
