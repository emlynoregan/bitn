With a sidelight on the problems of the Daviestown Station: passengers getting off there must go to the brake-van the station before and clamber down from there. [The context implies a lack of a platform.] Passengers joining there reverse the performance. They also have to pay the fare to the next station (or if getting on there, the fare from the previous station).

Passengers from Hallett who want to join the morning train from Burra have to start at 6.30 a.m. and ride in the guard's van to Burra. Often this means standing all the way for 18 miles and sometimes standing on the external platform of the van. Surely a small passenger carriage is in order here.
