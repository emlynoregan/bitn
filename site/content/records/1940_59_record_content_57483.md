Burra Town Council, 5 January

W.E.D. Young was sworn in as Councillor for West Ward.

W.D. Bednall wrote concerning the SA Mining Association that the Registrar of Companies has agreed to convey the Recreation Reserve [Victoria Park] to the corporation and has not yet considered the sale of the other pieces of land.

Sara & Co. have applied to build a shed 30 ft x 30 ft for the storage of flammable oils and advises that the site has been approved by the Factories and Steam Boilers Department.  Council called for the plans to be submitted.

The Stationmaster is to be asked to co-operate in stopping trains from standing on the Bon Accord crossing for long periods.
