Train Timetables.  The Town Council is critical of the SAR for not running a Wednesday morning train to Burra, due to a lack of manpower according the Railways Department.  Nevertheless, two trains arrive within minutes of each other on Monday and Wednesday nights and according to Cr Baulderstone one is always practically empty.   Apparently the idea of the two trains is to speed up the Broken Hill Express.  The second train was a railcar, for which liquid fuel was used.
