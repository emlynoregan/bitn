SA Mining Association [Editorial]

The AGM of the Association was held in the company’s office on 17 April.  The report of the Directors was submitted and adopted.  The retiring Directors: Messrs Arthur Blyth, John Beck, Thomas Graves, John Charles Boord and John Hector, were all re-elected.  A vote of thanks was passed to Captain Roach.

Despite the loss of miners to the new Wallaroo Mines, activity at the Burra Burra Mine has been pursued with undiminished vigour.  The ore raised in the last half-year has been described as equal in quantity and quality to ‘the production of similar periods’.  6,406 tons were raised compared with 6,940 tons in the previous six months.  The total number of hands employed has decreased by 65 in the half-year; there now being 888.  In the last six months 1,231 tons of fine copper have been received from the English & Australian Copper Co.  More than 860 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide for an average price of £95-11-3 per ton.  170 tons has been sent to London for sale.  At the start of this month the ore on hand was 3,843 tons and the copper on hand was 266 tons.

The cost of producing 7,243 tons of ore raised from September 1859 to March 1860 was £78,135-14-5 or £10-15-9 per ton.  The nett profit was £18,018-17-5 or £2-9-9 per ton.  This is a considerable improvement on the two preceding half years and results in a much larger profit than the Directors had anticipated.  While the price of copper fell, the costs of production decreased considerably.  The Directors have announced their intention of paying a dividend of 100% on 1 June next and, if accruing profits justify it, another of 100% on the profits of the current half-year.  The first of these dividends will be paid out of the balance of £17,799-9-11 which remained to the credit of the profit and loss account on 31 March 1860.  If estimates of the profits on copper yet unsold prove correct there will be a further sum of £24,277-2-0 to be added to profits already ascertained, making a gross undivided profit of £42,076-11-11 on transactions to 11 March 1861.

The Captain’s report on the Mine is very favourable and he says the Karkulto Mine is looking more favourable than hitherto.  It is now meeting expenses.
