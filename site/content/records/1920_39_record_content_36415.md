Burra Town Council, 15 December

Mr S. McHugh MLA advised that the Government was short of funds and it was not possible for the Council to obtain a loan, but the new Unemployment Council should improve matters for the unemployed.

Cr Allen reported no money in the West Ward account and the Town Clerk reported the general account overdrawn about £170 and also overdrawn about £200 on the main roads account.  The mayor said wheat teams were damaging the Bon Accord Bridge and last year it cost £50 in repairs.

Heavy traffic is to be banned from using the bridge.

Cr Bevan gave notice he would move to rescind the motion giving no Mayoral Allowance this year.
