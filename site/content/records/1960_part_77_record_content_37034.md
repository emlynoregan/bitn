Burra Police report quite a few people have taken advantage of an amnesty for unregistered firearms.  Many people think that once a firearm is registered it is for all times, but a change of ownership requires the new owner to register the firearm.

Sgt N. Orford from City Headquarters will replace Sgt W. Teague and he will take up duty in Burra early in the New Year.
