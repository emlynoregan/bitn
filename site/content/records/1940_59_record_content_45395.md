Housing Trust in Burra.  The Trust has rejected the site offered because of unsuitable drainage.  There are plenty of available blocks and if no one area can accommodate a dozen houses why is it necessary for all of them to be built together?  It seems none will be built soon and the housing situation in Burra is pretty grim.

Burra Rifle Club fired the postponed 16th Stage of the E.S. Williams Trophy over double 500 yards on Saturday.  For the Marksmanâ€™s Trophy J. Harris leads with 34 points from F.T. Marston & A.G. Heinrich each with 32 points.  For the E.S. Williams Trophy (Handicap) J. Harris has 24 points, ahead of W. Hempel with 22.  Best on Saturday were F. Kakoschke & W. Hempel.
