Dr Ashton writes in reply to Mr McBride.  He wonders by what magic a doctor has been able to treat and charge private patients at the hospital after the Board of Enquiry had found it illegal.  He says he has not fallen in with Dr Steeleâ€™s proposal because he abhors anything savouring of cabal or intrigue.  He assures the chairman that dissatisfaction certainly exists.  He finds it strange they are now happy to have 30 patients when previously they complained it was full at 20.  [And he also goes over old ground again.
