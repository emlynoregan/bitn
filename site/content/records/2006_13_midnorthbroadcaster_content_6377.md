Burra Show was declared a huge success with bumper crowds and gate takings double those of last year.  The Australian Merino Shearing Championships were a major drawcard.  Channel 9 weatherman Xavier Minnicon officially opened the event.  Shearing Hall of Fame legend Tony Ryan (85) kicked off the shearing championship.  Tom Dalla of Collinsville gave a demonstration of blade shearing.  The winner of the title Australian Merino Shearing Champion was Daryl Andriske of Blyth.

A helicopter provided a full day of scenic joy flights.

Horse in Action enjoyed a large rise in the number of entrants in more than 80 events.

Baby of the Show was Nadia Blieschke.

Junior Princess was Matilda Basa.

Prince of Show was Cody Jones of Booborowie.

Princess of show was Amber Williams of Burra.

As usual the rides were popular.

Entries in the show pavilion were up on last year.

In the evening live entertainment was provided by Tracey Rains and Claypan and by The Paul O’Bryan Band.
