Burra Town Council, 21 November

Nursing staff asked for exclusive use of the tennis court in front of the hospital.  They had renovated the courts at considerable trouble and were often debarred from it because others were in possession.  [The confusion of ‘court’ and ‘courts’ follows the paper report.]

Cr Treloar said the court was half on a roadway and half on Mr McBride’s paddock.  On one or two occasions the Council had tarred the courts.  The matter to lie on the table.

The Chief Secretary wrote that it had been decided to appoint a medical man when a vacancy had occurred on the State Children’s Council.

The Municipal Assoc. Melbourne sent a log of wages and said unless Corporations agreed the matter would go to the Commonwealth Conciliation Court.  The minimum wage for a Town Clerk was £451.
