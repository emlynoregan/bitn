Jazz in the Monster Mine.  The Sir Hubert Wilkins Committee has announced that the Twilight Jazz Affair at Petherton will not be staged again next year.  As a result a sub-committee of BRTBA is planning a replacement event for 2 March 2002.  The proposed site is near water level in the Burra Mine.  It has been inspected and acoustics are ideal.  Some earthworks will need to be done, after which the site will become a town asset.  Some funding has been approved through the SA Tourism Commissionâ€™s Regional Events & Festivals Program.
