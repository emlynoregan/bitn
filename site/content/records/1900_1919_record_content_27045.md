Burra Rifle Club met on Tuesday at Lord’s Burra Hotel to hand over the two prizes won in recent competitions.  The Mackerode Silver Cup went to Mr Clem Pearce and the Davey Photograph of World’s End Creek went to Mr F. Wheatley.

Mounted Constable Clark was farewelled.

It has been discovered that the cash balance of the club at the end of last financial year was £21-0-3 and not the £15 previously stated.  With assets of £62-15-0 and liabilities of £1-2-8, the club is in a very satisfactory financial position.
