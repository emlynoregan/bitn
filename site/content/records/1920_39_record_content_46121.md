Mongolata Goldfield

A letter has been sent to the directors of the most prominent companies and syndicates.  The letter draws attention to the comment of Dr Ward Director of Mines in the Advertiser of 16 May that considering the time of operation workings at Mongolata were remarkably shallow.  He hoped a deep shaft or two would be sunk to prove the field.  The writer therefore proposed:

Arrangements be made between the present syndicates to put in £50 each and approach the Employment Promotion Council for a £ for £ subsidy.  £700 resulting should be ample to sink a 6ft x 4ft shaft to 300ft.  We suggest the site be chosen by Dr Ward or his inspectors.  This should benefit shareholders and the state generally.

Mongolata Block 8.  Driven at north end of the main shaft in a lode c. 4ft wide and getting a little battery ore.
