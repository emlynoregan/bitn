Kooringa Post Office.  The new post and telegraph office is now open for business with much improved accommodation.  A decent light outside is still wanting however.  The Town Council should see to this.  The lighting inside is also very poor and an insult to the 20th century.  Officials are to be seen wandering around carrying old kerosene lamps in their hands to see what they are doing.
