BBH Football Club has been fined $2,500.  Two players from St Mary’s Club in Darwin played for them in round three.  The club had originally assumed the players had a ‘match day permit,’ but they were later shown to be unregistered.  The club was fined $500 for each of the players, $250 for each player ‘for bringing the games into disrepute and $1,000 for ‘not listening to a Community Board Official’.  BBH expects that one of the players, Josh Heath, will soon be cleared to play for them.  It also has an application for the other player, Allan May.    [The infringed rules are somewhat technical and the article refers readers to the NEFL website for further details and the full rules and regulations.]
