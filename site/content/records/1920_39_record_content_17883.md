On 15 December at 9 p.m. fire broke out on an enclosed allotment in Chapel St between the Commercial Hotel stables and E. Pfennig’s tinsmith’s.  Deal boxes and straw were alight behind a 10ft iron fence and flames rose high above the buildings.  The hydraulic engineer Mr James Isaac cut the water to Aberdeen and Redruth to increase the pressure to the area and in 15 minutes the fire was under control.  Mr Pfennig’s shop was alight several times and a bucket brigade used water from a tank on the south side of the shop to save it.
