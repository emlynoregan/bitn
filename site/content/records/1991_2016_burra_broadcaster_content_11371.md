Redfire Resources NL, based in Sydney, is interested in a licence to explore for minerals, especially copper and gold between Hallett and Robertstown.  Their proposed area would have a western boundary through Hanson and an eastern one through World’s End, but would exclude 160 km2 centred on Burra, where a licence is held for exploration by Elliot Geophysics of Urrbrae, from April 1996 for 12 months.
