Burra Defence Rifle Club

Firing match rules have been established.

Points for the clock, 25, for the cup 20 and for the rifle 15.

Points for places in matches to be 1st 5, 2nd 4, 3rd 3.

When a competitor reaches 15 he must decide either to take the rifle or go on for the next trophy, forfeiting rights to the rifle and any points, and so forth.

In the first match: P.A. Roach 90, J.E. Pearce 88, C. Parks 90*, J.F. Martin 87.

* C. Parks’ score was reduced by three because he used a .303 rifle.

The Rifle Club and the Cricket Club met at Vivian’s Hotel on Thursday and finalised arrangements for the picnic and sports meeting at Princess Royal next Wednesday. (Which will be observed as a holiday by 13 storekeepers.)
