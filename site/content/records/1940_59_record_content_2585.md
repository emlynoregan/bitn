Civil Defence Meeting at the Institute on 8 July.

Lieut-Cols Bice and Shaw addressed the meeting and S.C. Genders, on behalf of Bank Managers of the town appealed to the small audience to invest in War Savings Certificates and in five minutes £966 was raised.

Lieut-Col. Bice spoke on the war effort in Europe and Australia.  He mentioned the effort of Mr Essington Lewis in control of war industries and shipbuilding at Whyalla.  He outlined the evacuation scheme devised by the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to accommodate 4 people in each of 73,000 homes.

Lieut-Col. Shaw spoke of total warfare and of air raid precautions and procedures.  He dealt with blackout procedures in Adelaide and air raid shelters there as well as dealing with various types of bomb.

M.W. Bednall, Chairman of the Local Defence Committee, reported on the VSD activities.  In the event of an air raid on Adelaide, Burra would have to look after 2,000 people and Mr Dick Smith had been placed in charge of that.  Every house had been canvassed to see how many people they could take.  Messrs Genders & Jennison were appointed air raid wardens.  Lieut-Col. Bice explained the other arrangements for food and blankets and how people would recoup costs.

Mr Genders then said he represented a small committee selling War Savings Certificates and explained them.  They could be bought for 16/- and redeemed for £1 in seven years, which worked out at an interest rate of 3½%.  As noted above, £966 was raised.
