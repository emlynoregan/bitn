Burra Young Men’s Club was raided by Constable Coleman last Friday evening.  The club has been meeting in a tradesman’s shop to play chess, draughts, cards etc.  It had been suggested that gambling was taking place, but the constable found no signs of such activity.  [A long letter received on the subject makes it clear that the informant was a ‘minister of the gospel’.]
