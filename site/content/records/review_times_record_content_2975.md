Morphett’s Pump-house.  Work will begin at this site this month on the $100,000 re-development.  District Clerk Mr Walsh said that the work would make the pump-house and the Bon Accord museum one of the state’s top tourist attractions.  Work on restoring the shaft was one of a number of SA projects that has received funding during the Jubilee 150 year.  The pump-house project and the Bon Accord Museum will be officially opened during the Copper-town Festival in October.
