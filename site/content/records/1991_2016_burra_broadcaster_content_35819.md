Burra Visitor Centre staff have recently participated in a familiarisation tour of the Flinders Ranges conducted by Andrew Glen.  They have returned with a much better understanding of what the Flinders Ranges offers, which should allow them to better help tourists, many of whom travel to and from the Flinders Ranges via Burra.
