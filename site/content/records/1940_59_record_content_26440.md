Burra Town Council Assessment

Every seven years a District Council or Town Corporation is required to have a new assessment.  Consequently the Town Council asked Mr K.M. Drew to submit a price for the work.  He waited on the Council on 6 May to discuss the matter.  The Mayor said the Councilâ€™s rates were based upon the rental value.  Mr Drew said the fairest way to reach that was to place a fair value on the property in question and then take 5% as the rental value.  After discussion it was decided to ask Mr Drew to submit a price for making an assessment on that basis.  It was also resolved that the Clerk write to the District Council to obtain the necessary information to enable him to compute areas of certain allotments within the town boundaries.
