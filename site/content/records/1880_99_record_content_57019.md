St Mary’s.  Special sermons last Sunday were preached by Ven. Archdeacon Dove of Adelaide and in the morning two memorial windows were unveiled in memory of Mrs John Lewis and Dr William Peel Nesbitt.  Dr R. Brummitt, who was a particular friend of both families, performed the ceremony of unveiling.  The windows were made in Adelaide by Messrs Montgomery & Grimbly.

That in memory of Martha Ann Lewis illustrated Our Saviour with Mary at his feet and Martha serving by his side.

That in memory of Dr William Peel Nesbitt illustrates the Beloved Physician, St Luke.
