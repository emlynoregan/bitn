Burra Town Council.

[What exactly had been transpiring within the Council is not apparent from the paper reports, but the following bits of evidence suggest considerable division:

On 11 October the paper reports that at the meeting of 7 Oct. a motion moved by Cr Hardy to have the main road bridges tarred, was carried.

On 18 Oct. the paper reports a special meeting on 15 Oct. where it appears that the Public Works Committee overrode this resolution on the grounds it was informal.

On 22 Oct. the paper reports that at the meeting on 19 Oct. the resignation of the Public Works Committee was accepted and the Council resolved to do without one for the rest of the year.  The Overseer of Works was to receive instruction from the Town Clerk as representing the whole Council.]
