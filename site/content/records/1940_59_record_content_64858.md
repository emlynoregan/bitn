Burra Town Council, 16 August

Sides of the road from Market Square to Kingston St Bridge are to be sealed.

A general rate of 60d in the pound was declared.

Mrs E.D. Reed is to be asked for an offer for the piece of land applied for and a surety that all expenses will be met by her.

Mrs D. Carpenter applied to purchase William St, a portion of Quarry St and a portion of Thomas St.  Council is prepared to negotiate, but wants to know if the adjoining land is covered by RPA titles.

[These are three roads in Hampton on three sides of a block of 12 allotments there.]

Cr Carpenter moved that necessary action be taken regarding property in the name of Thomas Richards, situated at Millerton, Burra North.  Carried.  [A sale for unpaid rates?]

Cr Nankivell moved the removal of the hoarding near the post office as soon as arrangements can be made for the display of picture advertising.  Carried.
