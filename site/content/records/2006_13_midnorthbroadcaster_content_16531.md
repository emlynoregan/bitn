The Auhl Family History Room at the Burra Community Library has added Ian Auhl’s OAM to its collection.  Auhl is Burra’s noted historian and last Tuesday his daughter Tania travelled from Kingston with a great addition to the Auhl Collection: the OAM and certificate received by her father on 14 June 1980.   Accompanied by her cousin Avis Webster of Burra and friend Helen Nitschke, she presented the medal and framed certificate to the Community Library, where they were received by Library Assistant and family friend, Mary Woollacott.  Ian Auhl (1914-1996) was a dedicated researcher who had a passion for Burra and its history.  He was responsible for a long list of books on the town, notably among them The Story of the Monster Mine, Burra Sketchbook and Burra and District: a Pictorial Memoir.
