He calls for a series of remedies:

Vermin proof fencing

Lower rents so that feed can be conserved

Security of tenure – all should be on perpetual lease

The present rent of £2-13-6 per mile[2] is one half too much

The rent should be £1-5-0 per mile[2]

He calls a meeting at the Burra Institute for 4 o’clock on 3 June to discuss these issues.
