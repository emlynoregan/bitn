The speech night was held in the Burra Town Hall 18 December.  Mr P.H .Quirke MP was the guest speaker and was accompanied by Mrs Quirke.  He gave a forceful talk on the stages of education for life.

Headmaster Mr Jeffery’s Report: the 45th Annual Report for Burra High School

The school began the year with an enrolment of 75.  No staff changes occurred during the year.  Of eleven candidates who sat for the Intermediate, ten gained full certificates and the other enough to add to in the future.  Ten credits were obtained.  In Leaving (after Supplementary Examinations) three certificates were gained out of a possible six.

[The report then cites the outstanding Intermediate results as:

Jeremy Cookes 	7 subjects with 1 credit

Richard Freer 	7 with 1 credit.

Robert Lott passed 	7 with 1 credit

Margaret Hopkins 	7 with 1 credit

Marcia Terry	7 with 1 credit

Jill Lucas	6 with 1 credit

BUT this does not agree with the results printed early in 1956 in 87, 4, 31 Jan. 1956, page 6:

Robert P. Bourman	8 (3)

Jeremy E. Cookes	9 (1)

Richard G. Freer	8 (1)

Margaret R. Hopkins	8 (1)

Patricia C. Kowald	8 (1)

Robert J. Lott	9 (1)

Jillian R. Lucas	7 (1)

Marcia F. Terry	8 (1)]

This year eight sat for Intermediate and five for Leaving.

School Sports were won this year by Steele House.

The Inter-High School Sports were held at Kapunda.  Burra could not compete with the larger schools, but some individual results were excellent; notably Jill Lucas in the High Jump, Donald Broad in High Jump, Gillian Snell in Broad Jump and Robert Bourman in the shot put.

The School’s Annual Sports Day was held on Burra Oval.  Cup winners:

Senior Girls’ Cup	Helen Lines

Senior Boys’ Cup	Robert Bourman

Junior Girls’ Cup	Marie Eberhard

Junior Boys’ Cup	Max Lockett

The School looks forward to the establishment of a swimming pool in Burra.

This year we regretfully accepted the retirement of Mr Jack Fisher as Secretary of the High School Council after 15 years, due to ill health.  We extend out thanks.

The new High school Council saw H.J.B. Jennison re-elected as Chairman and Mr G.H. Cockrum became Secretary.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has given much assistance, including a new portable gramophone to aid in teaching typing, a lawn-mower, a record cabinet and about £30 worth of library books.  Mrs Ellis continued as President and Mrs Binks-Williams succeeded Mrs Lott as Secretary.

The High School Ball was again a great success.

Religious Instruction has continued and all the churches in Burra are represented.

The usual school excursion was made to the city.  In the morning the boys went to the Metropolitan Abattoirs and the girls to the GPO and in the afternoon the combined group went to the West Beach Aerodrome and the Southern Adelaide Hills and Mt bold Reservoir.  The Leaving Geography Class visited Pt Pirie and toured part of the South Flinders Ranges.

Visiting Day introduced the new High School Council to the school and students.

Senator R.R. Wilson visited on another occasion.

Adult woodwork classes were conducted by Mr R.L. Pillar.

Remembrance Day was observed in conjunction with the Primary School, when Mr Wilf. Nankivell represented the RSL and gave an address.

School uniform has been pleasing to see in the past two or three years and this year it was decided to institute summer and winter uniforms for girls.
