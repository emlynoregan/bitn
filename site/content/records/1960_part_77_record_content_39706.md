Burra Floral Art Club held its second floral display in the Town Hall on Friday.  This year there were fewer displays, but the standard was higher.  In the centre was a reconstruction of Burra’s entry in the Adelaide Flower Day display in March and Mesdames Lloyd and Pettet are to be congratulated for this.  The day’s takings of $94.70 will aid the Town Hall floor appeal.
