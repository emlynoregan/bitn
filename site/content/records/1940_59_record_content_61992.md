Weather.  Heavy rain from thunderstorms on Friday & Saturday brought relief to the Eastern Pastoral Areas.  Though inevitably patchy, many falls were between 45 and 125 points.  In Burra on Friday a storm dropped heavy rain and hail briefly, but with temperatures over 90Â°F conditions became very humid.
