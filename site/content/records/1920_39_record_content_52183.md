R. Fuss writes an angry letter following last week’s report from the Burra Burra Show Committee meeting where they passed a resolution ‘That Stewards of Flowers be requested to stage flowers better.’  He says this is a gratuitous insult and a fine way to dispense with the services of stewards.  Disgruntled competitors should be called upon to place their complaints in writing and the committee should have then called for a report.  This would pander to the exhibitor’s sense of his or her own importance while treating the stewards with decency.  Every year the flowers have too little space and every year the stewards complain on this account, but there is no more space to be had and stewards do as well as they can in the circumstances.  It is a miserable act of the committee to publicly censure the stewards for its own shortcomings in accepting more entries than they can accommodate.
