Kooringa, 29 September.

The first in a series of 6d popular concerts was held in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on Friday evening to standing room only.  Rev. G.W. Patchell was Chairman and A.H. Forder played the harmonium.

On Monday evening Rev. E.F. Kingdon lectured at the Bible Christian Chapel to a moderate crowd on ‘Popular Delusions’.

On Tuesday evening at the Assembly Room at the Miners’ Arms about 30 gentlemen met to consider accepting the offer of the SA Mining Association to transfer the present hospital to trustees and to take such steps as would secure this object.  Captain I. Killicoat chaired the meeting.  Several residents spoke of the benefits of such a move and a decision to accept the offer was carried unanimously.  A committee to arrange preliminaries was appointed: Captain R. Sanders, Messrs J. Drew, H. Dawson, W.R. Ridgway, W.H. Rosman Jnr, T. Bath & W. Builder.

R. Austin’s new premises at Aberdeen are now complete and at Kooringa many old places are being renovated.  The town has a much more cheerful appearance than three or four years ago.
