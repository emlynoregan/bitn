Burra Racing Club Ball was held in the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  Darrell Field’s Orchestra played.  It was most successful with dancing to 2 a.m.

Burra Racing Club held its first meeting since the war on Saturday, though that day proved to have some of the worst weather for quite some time.  The wind blew a half gale for most of the day, bringing raised dust and then about half way through the program the rain set in.  Despite this the meeting was a success.
