SA Ambulance Service Recruitment Drive

Profile of Nigel Winzar

I am 51 years old, married with two young children at school.  I joined the Ambulance Service four years ago to do a bit more for the community, but also to gain skills that could aid my own family if sick or injured.  In the past not knowing what to do when faced with a sick or injured child was a real fear.  Now I have that knowledge and training.  My commitment is one night a week training and being on call for a few shifts each month – depending on work and family commitments.  Being on call still allows me to do most things – gardening, visiting friends or cleaning out the shed – as long as I stay within the town.  The number of Ambulance Officers is low at present and new recruits are needed to help share the workload.
