Burra Show Society’s New Wool Pavilion has now been completed.  The project began in February and a committee set about raising donations for the building proposed by Mr R. Fuss; a structure 30 feet x 30 feet with a steel frame and with a south facing roof light.  The final cost was £1,007-13-3.  The Hon. The Minister of Agriculture has approved a subsidy of £250.  The building has a cement floor and all fittings are painted.  It is a credit to Mr Fuss and the band of helpers who assisted.
