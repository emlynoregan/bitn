Obituary.  John McGilchrist, eldest son of James McGilchrist, who carried on a watchmaking business here in the shop now used as a storeroom by C.C. Williams, met a sudden and tragic end a short time ago.  He went into a hotel for refreshments and almost immediately took seriously ill and died three hours later.

[John McGilchrist was born 9 July 1877 at Naracoorte and died 12 August 1906 at Naracoorte, residence Bordertown.  It seems strange not to have mentioned the J. McGilchrist who only in the last issue was said to be coming to Kooringa from Naracoorte to open a shop.  The latter would seem to be the deceasedâ€™s father James, because James McGilchrist dies in Kooringa 3 October 1909 aged 73.]
