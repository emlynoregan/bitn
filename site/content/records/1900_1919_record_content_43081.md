Letter from Sgt R.G. Baynes, formerly of Burra, from Gallipoli dated 30 June.  It is a humorous account of life in the trenches living on seven course meals of Bully beef, biscuits, bacon, potatoes, onions, cheese, jam and sometimes bread.  He also tells of men sunbaking after rubbing themselves with rifle oil and turning brown to black.
