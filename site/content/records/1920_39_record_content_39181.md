Tennis.  There has been a proposal to form a combined Burra Club in place of the existing clubs.  One reason is the lack of sufficient available courts.  There is a proposal to acquire land and lay down new courts.  A meeting to discuss the proposal will be held in the Council Chamber at the Institute 10 September.
