Phyllis Whippy & Bryan Silpy have taken over the Cook O'Burra snack bar in Market Square from Pauline & John O’Bryan, who have run the shop for more than seven years.  The couple also own Miss Mabel’s Cottage at Burra North and will take up residence at the shop.  They will carry on the business without significant changes for the present.  Bryan is a former Telstra worker.
