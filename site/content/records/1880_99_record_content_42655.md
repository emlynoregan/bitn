Editorial on The Burra Mine.

A few months ago we would not have believed the old slag would be being crushed so it is not impossible to imagine the mine again producing copper.  The old mine was world famous.  The capital invested was £12,320 in £5 shares which were at one time worth £200 each and returned £40 each year in dividends.  It paid in all £800,800 in dividends.

Immediately on discovery it employed 10 miners and soon a large number.  In the first six years it raised upwards of 80,000 tons of rich ore which yielded a profit of a little short of £500,000 and within a few years a gross profit of £882,436 and dividends equal to £315 on each £5 share. The Victorian diggings drew miners away in 1851-52 and the mine stopped.  Machinery halted and water came in with the few remaining workers employed above the water level.  When work began again in earnest for many years it yielded 10,000 to 13,000 tons per annum at 22-23% copper or c. 2,500 tons of copper with an average value of c. £225,000.  From 1845-64 the company spent in SA about £1,700,000 of which about £1,000,000 was in wages.

In 1878 another check on its work occurred when the directors suspended operations owing to the low price of copper.  For many years not a single man worked on the mine, but in 1886 several local men applied to be allowed to work on tribute and this was allowed.  They are engaged in overhauling debris thrown away and in digging on the side of the mine not previously worked and are making a fair living at it.  There were about 12 working at one time, but now about 6.  It is hard as they must bag the ore and fetch it a long distance back to the old floor.  Much of the wood and iron work is in good condition and the large engine is as good as ever.  Mr Paynter’s efforts will surely have an effect on those who were recently negotiating with SAMA to buy the mine, but who have so far failed to carry it through.

2nd Leader on Our Servants in Parliament.

[Saying basically that ‘the time of the country is being wasted’.

3rd Leader on ‘Are We Socialists?’

In many significant respects we are.  Consider in SA the operation of the postal service, telegraphs, railways, schools, etc.  And many laws compel action for the good of the community and are a limit on individualism.

Mr Paynter’s operations have begun.
