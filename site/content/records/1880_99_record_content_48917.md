The Burra Accidental Bicycle Club held a fancy dress tournament at the Burra Oval on 14 February.  The night was dark and unsuitable, but 4-500 came anyway and enjoyed themselves.  Â£5 was taken towards promoting the 50 mile race on Easter Monday.  There was a one mile fancy dress handicap and a series of other events including a quarter mile slow race.  The Burra Band attended.
