The Spinsters & Bachelors’ Ball on Friday in the Institute was a brilliant affair.  The hall was elaborately dressed with Chinese lanterns and imitation peach blossom was conspicuous.  The recess at the entrance was set up for cards.  The ball was in fancy dress.  Dancing started at 8 p.m. with music from Setaro’s Band from Adelaide and continued till the early hours.  About 130 ladies and gentlemen were present, many of whom are listed with their costumes.
