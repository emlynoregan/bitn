Bible Christian Church in Burra.  The Rev. W.F. James writes on efforts of this body in Burra.  It began in 1848 with James Blatchford preaching in the open air.  A church was formed with 40 members.  Local preachers, James Blatchford, John Halse and John Pellew conducted services.  A church to seat 200 was built.  In 1850 Rev. James Rowe came from England and the church had to be enlarged to double its size.  In 1859 Rev. James Way, the father of Sir Samuel Way, became pastor and witnessed one of the most dramatic revivals in SA Methodist history when 70 juveniles and 320 persons were added to the membership.  A noble church to seat 600 was built and the work prospered for many years.  The congregation suffered decline when the mines closed and great numbers removed to Yorke Peninsula mining towns.  My own stay from 1884-87 saw the erection of a new manse.
