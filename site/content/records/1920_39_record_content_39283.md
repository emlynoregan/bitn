P.J. Squire the Kooringa postmaster will retire at the end of the month having completed nearly 50 years in the service.  He started work as a messenger at Victor Harbor in 1882 and later spent nine years at Alice Springs and for five years was in charge of the important repeating station at Smoky Bay.  He had short periods in charge of Wallaroo and Peterborough before coming to Burra a little over nine years ago.  His careful attention to duty and his courtesy have earned him the respect of the community.  It is thought that Mr H.E. Scotcher of Jamestown will come here.
