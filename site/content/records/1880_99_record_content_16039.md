Editorial on the New Year.

Looking to the future we are taking in a harvest we hope to average almost 10 bushels per acre.  Our gold mines are looking good and the silver mines across the border are ‘virtually annexed by the soon-to-be railway.’  No great issue faces Parliament demanding settlement.  The coming Legislative Council election will be the first ordinary election under the act dividing the colony into districts.  And 1884 will be the first year direct taxation will be levied - a land tax and an income tax.  To the north and east of Burra the crops are better than for many a year.  We shall lose some trade with the completion of the Silverton Railway, but it runs so far north that a large area to the east will remain dependent upon Burra as before.  Large estates surrounding the town sap the prosperity as for many country towns.

New Year in Burra arrived with the usual watchnight services and less than the usual larrikinism.  The chief attraction for New Year’s Day seemed to be the picnic at Hallett, for which there was a special train at 9 a.m. as well as the normal one.

The Bible Christian quarterly meeting on Wednesday noted that though many had been added the number of removals was such that there were fewer members than last year.  It was decided to build a much-needed new manse, which is expected to cost c. £700.

At the tea meeting on 29 December Rev. W.F. James gave a lecture on President Garfield.  The profits from the good audience were £10-10-8, which will provide furniture for the Mission House.

Wesleyan Sunday School Picnic at Hallett on New Year’s Day.  Usually Princess Royal had been used, but this year a change was tried.  Early on Thursday the children assembled at the schoolroom and were taken on various vehicles to the station.  A train of trucks, comfortably seated and with a covering overhead was speedily filled and left at 9 a.m. for Hallett.  On arrival they were taken to a nearby pretty spot with trees for games and abundant provisions.  The train left for Burra at 5 p.m. even more fully laden as some returned who had come by ordinary trains.  Burra was reached a little before 6 p.m.  It all came off without a hitch.  The Burra Brass Band enlivened proceedings.
