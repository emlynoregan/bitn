Obituary/Inquest at Leighton on 22 July before J.D. Cave JP on the body of Robert Everest, a boundary rider who drowned the previous day. The body was found in Farrell’s Creek in reeds about ¾ mile below the crossing — he was seen to enter the water in attempting a crossing. He was drunk at the time. The verdict was that death was accidental, but may not have happened, but for his being under the influence of liquor.  [Died 19 July 1878 near Booborowie, residence Booborowie aged 61.]
