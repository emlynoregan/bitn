John Anderson, Deputy Leader of the National Party, addressed a disappointingly small group of wool growers at the Burra Sports Complex on the subject of the Garnaut Report.  This exhaustive report addressed the management of the wool stockpile, the responsibilities of the various industry bodies and trade and market expansion initiatives.  The goal is to develop a more market driven response to consumer demands.  The report recommended the gradual reduction of wool industry bodies from four to one, privatisation after four years and better matching of supply and demand.  Research, Development & Promotion are suggested to be combined.  Wool International Inc. would manage the disposal of the stockpile, discharge industry debt and develop risk management tools.  Wool, Research & Promotion would manage research and development and promotion.  It seemed that the report was largely accepted by the few present in the absence of any alternative to discuss.
