Hon. P.A. McBride, the LCL endorsed candidate for Wakefield and Mr J.B. Murdoch, Senate candidate, addressed a well-attended meeting at the Burra Town Hall on Monday evening 2 September.

Mr Murdoch believed that in the past 20 years vocal minorities had received too much attention, to the detriment of passive majorities.  Coal strikes, a shortage of transport and of power were retarding production when orders for goods were plentiful and the same causes had sent costs up.  Shipbuilding at Whyalla would cost £64 per ton, but in Canada £44 and in Clydeside £34.  The Government had brought in excessive taxation, which was a disincentive to work.  The country needed more migrants.  He also urged voters to vote NO at the referendum.

Hon. P.A. McBride also spoke against the continuation of high wartime taxation levels.  Taxation should immediately be cut by 25%, stimulating production.  He also spoke in favour of a Rural Industries Commission and the Pooling System to give rural industry some stability and reasonable profit.  He advised a NO vote at the coming referendum.

[The speeches are reported in 1⅔ columns.]
