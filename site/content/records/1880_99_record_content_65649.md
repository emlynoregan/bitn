Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports on 26 December were a great success.

It was a good day, with a good gate, good racing, and a good wind-up.  It was rather hot.  Nominations and acceptances were a record.  Times in the cycle events equalled those in Adelaide: due to the great track.  Were it to be banked it would surpass Adelaide.  Victoria Park needs some money spent on it if it is not to become a white elephant: the park will not attract the sports while the Polo Ground is available.  The move to the Polo Ground saw the gate £45 up on last year.

A complete list of results is printed.

The major cycle event was the one mile handicap:

L.P. Morgan	1st	£6-10-0

F.C. Fuss	2nd	£2-10-0

R.D. Moreton	3rd	£1-0-0

The main foot race was the Sheffield Handicap over 135 yards

C.R. Patterson	1st	£10-10-0

N.C. Clarke	2nd	£2-10-0

E.L. Renfrey	3rd	£1-10-0

O.E. Fry	4th	10/-
