Charles Drew and his wife return to Adelaide by the Ormuz, leaving Plymouth on the 28th.  They have been on a holiday to restore Mr Drew’s health.  The European Mail of 17 Jan. reports that Mr C. Drew of Burra has just presented to the Art Gallery of SA a painting by T.B. Kenning, The Pinch of Poverty.  It is a work of considerable size and the figures are life-size.  ‘It is a work of very great merit and South Australians may be congratulated on having so clever a painting added to their already fine collection in Adelaide.’
