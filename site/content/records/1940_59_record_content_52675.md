Fire Controllers held a meeting at Mt Bryan last Wednesday night.  Mr E. Murray took the chair as they discussed arrangements for control of fires that might break out in the coming summer.

[The duties of various people are listed.]

Arrangements include:

B. Hirschausen (Corporation Overseer) would man the trailer pump and take it immediately to the fire.

B. Rogers would attend with a Jeep and tow rope etc. to act as a mechanic as needed.

The Burra Postmaster would keep lines open to the District Office.

Elder, smith Ltd in Burra would man the hydrant outside the District Office for filling tanks on trucks.

The Waterworks Department would make the 6 inch main at Burra North available for large fires.

The Stationmaster would sanction the use of water at the Burra Railway Station â€“ particularly for fires after trains.

Each of 26 Fire Control Officers had been made aware of the location of hydrants on the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.

[Other details follow.]

It was advised that oil burning locomotives were already being employed on the line.

Roadside burning operations were arranged.

[Various other details are reported.  One interesting problem raised was that of shunting in the Mt Bryan railway yards, which could block the crossing for up to half an hour.  The Railways Commissioner had rejected any idea of a new crossing.]
