Burra Town Council

Further from the closed meeting of 4 June.

Cr Parks asked if by-law 26 was legal.

The Mayor said the Crown Solicitor’s opinion was that it was ultra vires on two grounds.

Cr Rabbich asked questions about the ratepayers’ memorial of the matter.

The Mayor said it was open to criticism and he preferred not to irritate any Councillor by reading it.

Cr Sampson complained that Crs Hardy and Rabbich said he had supported the by-law last year.  He denied having done so.

Cr Harris moved acceptance of the tender of Launder & Co. of £2-5-0 per chain for kerbing in Church St.  D. Rogers had tendered £1-19-0.

Cr Hardy moved for a call of the whole Council on Wednesday to rescind the new by-law.  Carried.

Special Council Meeting on Wednesday.

The minute adopting the new by-law was rescinded.

Names of 24 men requiring work on the main roads were received and arrangements were made for putting on 16 for four days each at 6/- a day.  The remaining 8 to be put on in turn.
