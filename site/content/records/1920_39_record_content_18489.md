I.J. Warnes was badly burnt on the left hand on 16 January.  When he was taking a tin of boiling tar out of the blacksmith’s shop at ‘Wahroonga’ a gust of wind caught the boiling matter and blew it over his hand.  The removal of the tar from his hand was exceedingly painful.  His hand is now healing well.
