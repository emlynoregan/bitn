Burra Showgrounds – New Wool Pavilion

The Wool Pavilion Committee has commenced work on erecting the new pavilion.  The building will be 30 feet x 30 feet with a roof light facing south to provide even lighting.  Mr R. Fuss and helpers have cemented the bases for the columns of the building.  The frame has been ordered and is due at the end of this week.  Further donations are solicited.
