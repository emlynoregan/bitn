A Strange Case.  W. Highet and his wife lived in a strained marriage and when William Matthews appeared he came to live with them.  He threatened Highet with violence and the latter gave over his wife and child to Matthews for a quiet life, but recently Matthews went to prison for a month for breaking the Bible Christian windows.  He returned at Christmas, but was almost immediately arrested for being idle and disorderly and given another month.
