Burra Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

The Mayor called a meeting on 4 August to consider the delay in erecting the memorial.  Mr Tillett advised by mail that the bronze statue would be ready in about two months.  He had not received information on the names and that could cause further delay.  The memorial, he said, would be second to none in Australia.  There was considerable dissatisfaction with the lengthy delay in getting the monument erected.

The meeting was presented with a list of 99 names to be included on the monument.  The committee was still working on the Roll of Honour.

The cost of the memorial and plates was estimated at £2,210 and they had in money and promises £2,030.  It was resolved that the secretary write to Pengilly & Co. Duncan & Fraser and others for designs and prices without names.  The present Roll of Honour in the Institute Reading Room had 70 names on it and they were in duty bound to complete it.  C.J. Pearce’s offer to add additional panels for £30 was accepted.

Mr Geake wanted volunteered but rejected names on the roll, but the meeting did not support this.
