‘Death on Bad Ink-Slingers’ writes in response to the Burra correspondent to the Southern Cross [Hardy] who complains that larrikins led on the event in Burra and they were led by one who is not a Burraite.  The writer says he has been coming to the district for four years as a shearer.  He bought the clothes on his back in Burra and always makes Burra his home, though shearing in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania.

‘The scribe has not only fell foul of the Burra residents but has also spoiled good paper to abuse inoffensive miners and ended in the effigies of two personages being consumed.  But they are not dead yet!  I see one walking about to save funeral expenses, accompanied by the tunes of a howling mob.

First he calls the Burra people respectable residents: next he calls them a howling mob.’
