Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata Gold Mining Co. has had excellent results from a recent crushing with an average 14oz per ton.

The erection of a battery certainly seems justified and tons of ore are at grass on the field awaiting crushing.  Hopes for the field to prove a major producer have been boosted.

We understand that F. O’Brien who has acquired the lease of Herbert J. Schwier adjoining Byles’ is to float a company of 50,000 £1 shares in an attempt to exploit the downwards continuation of the reef.

O’Brien is an experienced prospector and mining expert who reported in the Record of 9 September 1931.

A number of donations have supported the Mongolata Sports Assoc.

Mr Abbott of Abbott & Co. has arrived in connection with the construction of the Government tank for the conservation of water for domestic purposes.

Gold has also been found near Robertstown.

The boring operation at Mongolata has resulted in a flow of 750 gallons an hour of excellent water.
