Mr Hallett, who is deaf and dumb and has resided in the area for a long time, has had his hand amputated by Dr Dashwood assisted by Dr Wall.  This was made necessary after he was bitten by a centipede and the swelling so extended up the arm that his life was feared for.  After about a fortnight he is progressing favourably.
