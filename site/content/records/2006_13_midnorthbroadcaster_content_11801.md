Jazz in the Monster Mine 2011 was an outstanding success with a capacity crowd and ticket sales surpassing previous years.  There were anxious moments during the rainy set-up period on Friday and Saturday morning, but the evening, though cool was dry.   The planned lighting display on the cliff walls had to be reduced due to the wet conditions, but the walls were still highlighted, showcasing the spectacular setting.  [Further details of the nightâ€™s events and program are given.]
