The Terowie Heritage Gallery was established in 1987 with the help of a Bicentennial Grant.  It has gone on to establish the Blacksmith Museum, opened in 1993 and later this year will open ‘Women’s Work’ and a historical perspective ‘Terowie Main Street’.  The Pioneer Gallery contains 1,000 photographs of national, regional and local significance and on 18 October received a $4,000 grant on behalf of Terowie Citizens Association for conservation and reformatting of the photographic collection.
