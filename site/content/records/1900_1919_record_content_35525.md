President (S. Lane) and Mr Winnall have seen Mr Lester of Theatregraph Pictures and arranged that from 1 September he have the hall regularly on Fridays for 12 months.  Anyone wishing to have the hall on a Friday is to negotiate with him to waive his right for a consideration.  Mr McLaren did not approve of this.  The others however, did, as it was a paying proposition.  The agreement, as Mr Nield pointed out, expired before the next run of fetes and need not be renewed if it caused trouble.
