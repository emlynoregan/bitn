Burra Town Council is concerned to see bread and meat deliveries resumed in Burra.  No replies had been received from retailers on the subject.  The Mayor thought that if nothing was done they should take the matter up with the Federal Government though the local Member.

Cr Jennison said that quite a number of visitors came to Burra for the Easter break and some returned, but the locals had done nothing to make their stay more enjoyable.  It was suggested that efforts could be made to offer some entertainment such as a picnic to The Gorge.
