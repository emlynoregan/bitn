Burra North Red Cross held its 4th AGM on 18 July.  Meetings had been held in the Aberdeen Croquet Club Hall on the first and third Wednesday of each month.  For the annual drive last year they had combined with the FFCF and takings had amounted to £875-7-4.  The drive in 1945 was run over just one month because of the decision to allow the Burra Centenary Committee a free run from July to October.  Miss Gladys Scroop was our ‘Miss Red Cross’ entrant and members raised £112-8-9.  In the last twelve months the branch had raised £359-3-3 compared with £283-3-8 in the previous twelve months.  Elected: President, Mrs H.J.B. Jennison; Vice-President, Miss M. Rogers; Secretary, Mrs E.J. Reed; Assistant Secretary, Mrs M. Miels and Treasurer, Mrs S. Scroop.
