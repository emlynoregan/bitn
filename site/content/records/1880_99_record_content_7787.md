Burra Town Council, 4 September

A group comprising Messrs A. Harris, J. Launder, W. Rodda & J. Edwards presented a memorial from 45 people asking for an improvement of access from their houses to the business centre.  The route desired was along Mitchell Flat and then along the eastern side of the Burra Creek to Bridge St near Mr Sampson Sen.’s.  Mitchell’s Flat has never been made and there is some question whether the rest of the track is on public land.  If it is not they ask for it to be obtained and put in repair.

Council voted to inspect and for the finance committee to report on funds.

Crown Lands advises that money spent on tree planting would be supplemented as for other public works.  £40 is therefore to be spent on trees in North Ward and £50 in Middle Ward.
