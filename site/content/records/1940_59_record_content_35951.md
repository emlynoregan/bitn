It aims to:

Create and maintain interest in the school.

To inform parents of the work of the school.

Promote a community of interest between parents and teachers.

Raise funds to meet the needs of the school.

To work in concert with the School Committee in promoting the good of the school.

The club has helped with the payments for two new tennis courts, film hire, magazine subscriptions, books, sports equipment and a wireless licence.  A Gestetner duplicating machine was jointly purchased by the Welfare Club and the Parents and Friends’ Association for the use of both Primary and High Schools.  The total cost was £149-14-8.

Owing to the outbreak of Infantile Paralysis (Polio) the usual Christmas Break-up Party for the children was held out of doors on 18 December.
