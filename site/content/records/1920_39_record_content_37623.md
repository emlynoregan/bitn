Mr Hill said that unemployment was the greatest problem, along with necessitous farmers.  He hoped the future was looking a little better.  The price of wool had risen 25% and exports had exceeded imports.  Wheat remained very low – 1/3½ at the siding, which was the lowest on record.  There were 5,000 farmers who would be unable to plant a crop this year without help and that would be a calamity.  He outlined some of the Government’s financial problems and the need for retrenchments – for example in the railways.  The state debt was £57,000,000 and the average interest rate was 5½%.
