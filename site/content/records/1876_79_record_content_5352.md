North Ward Election Meeting at Broad’s Hotel Aberdeen Tuesday 25 November. About 30 people attended. 
Mr W.R. Ridgway spoke as candidate. He was only there as no one in whom he had any confidence had come forward. The council was a mess. The town was in a worse state with respect to streets and footpaths than it was when taken over from the District council and they were in debt for between £700 & £800. 
Debit Balance 	£88-3-9 
Owed Salaries 	£36-0-0 
Contract in Hand 	£35-0-0 
Land for the New Bridge in Kingston St. 	£175-0-0 
Legal Costs re the New Bridge 	£ 125-0-0 
Due to the Cemetery 	£250-0-0 
Total:	£709-3-9 
It was time for some new blood on the Council. 
He then outlined his expenditure plans in some detail. 
Mr Woollacott said he would withdraw as Mr Ridgway had come out. 
There was a vote of thanks to the retiring Cr G. Sara Jnr proposed by Mr Tiver and 2nd Mr Ridgway.
