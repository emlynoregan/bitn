Sunday Tennis.  Despite a ruling by the Town Council not to allow play on the Burra North Tennis Courts on Sundays, several member of the Aberdeen Club played on the courts last Sunday.  The voting in Council recently was very close and provoked freely expressed opinions.  The matter will now be raised again at the next Council meeting on Monday.  Some members deny that the Council has the right to restrict play because the Club leases the site.  We have found no written agreement between the Club and the Council.  The nearest thing is a Council minute of 6 September 1923 when Crs Riggs and Harris moved that the Club be granted a lease on Lowe’s Reserve for use as a tennis court for 99 years on payment of a rental of £1 per annum.  The Council could rescind the motion with a majority vote, but that could prove rather costly as the Council would then have to buy the Club’s assets.
