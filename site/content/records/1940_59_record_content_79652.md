Burra Swimming Pool held a very successful working bee on 17 November when 130 ft of wall 3 ft 6 inches high and 8 inches thick was poured by 1 p.m. to complete the walls of the project.  Half the project is now completed.  Phase III is the setting of the concrete surrounds.  Tons of earth have been moved in to build up the surrounds.  Concrete about 4 ft wide will be laid around the pool, with a small brick retaining wall at the edge.  It is hoped to complete this in about three weeks.
