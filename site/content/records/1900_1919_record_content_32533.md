‘Engineer’ writes urging four dams across the Burra Creek.  One opposite the Institute, one at Roach’s Mill, one on the north side of the Aberdeen Bridge and the last between the ford and the railway line.  The banks would then be planted to beautify the area.

The editor says that similar schemes have long been spoken of, but starting with one weir would be a worthy beginning.
