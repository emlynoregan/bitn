Dr Steele was farewelled Thursday afternoon at the Institute.  E.W. Crewes took the chair.  Over 200 had now gone from the district including four nurses and two chaplains.  Dr Steele was presented with an inscribed wristwatch of which the dial and hands were treated with radium so the time could be ascertained in the dark.  There was also a parcel from the Burra Cheer-up Society.  J.E.H. Winnall added to the Mayorâ€™s remarks and so did Rev. S.J. Bloyd.  He reminded the Mayor that Burra had already sent Dr Caw to join HMAS Australia and he had already served a terrible winter in the North Sea.  J. McLaren, T.W. Wilkinson and Mr Harcus added their endorsements and Dr Steele made a suitable reply.
