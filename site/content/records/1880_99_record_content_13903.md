The Barrier Coach Line, run by Messrs R. Rayner, McGowan & Co. has striven to improve the service at heavy outlay of capital.  Supplying horse feed along the way is a problem.  Teams despatched from Terowie on 1 May took 54 days to reach Mt Gipps, a journey of 220 miles.  The line is now well horsed and needs to be with heavy loads on nigh impassable roads in places.
