Revs T.G. Drought & Richard S. Jenner write calling on the Town Council to call a public meeting for the purpose of holding a Home and Family Week in Burra, as had been done elsewhere in SA.  The idea would be to promote Education in Marriage, Parenthood and Family Relationships.

It would require

The availability of the Town Hall or other suitable premises.

The co-operation of the churches.

The recognition that much voluntary work would be involved.
