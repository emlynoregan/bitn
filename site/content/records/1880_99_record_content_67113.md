'G.C.' writes complaining that the Methodist connections are competing with each other for attention.  The Bible Christians found the traditional date for their annual dinner had been taken by ‘Redruth friends’ and then that on the alternative date they had to compete with the Wesleyans who were opening their new tennis court.  The ‘Prims’ had their anniversary last Sunday only to find special Wesleyan services on that date as well.
