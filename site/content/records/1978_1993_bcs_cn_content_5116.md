BCS Year 11 students went on a bush walk on Sunday to climb Mt Bryan Razorback Ridge.  What was planned as a full day’s hike was accomplished by midday and an early camp was made, giving time to explore around the old Reed homestead.  The weather then turned nasty and it was decided to re-site the tents in the shelter of the shearers’ quarters, which provided a windbreak.  Use was made of the shearers’ kitchen.  Morning revealed a rather sodden group with some collapsed tents and soggy sleeping bags.  The final day saw a hike to Burra across the ranges to the Redruth Gaol.
