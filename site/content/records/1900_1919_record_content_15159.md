Salvation Army.  At the Barracks on Monday night a very fair attendance, despite the poor weather, heard Major Graham’s lecture on ‘Missionary Work of the Army’.  Other stirring addresses were also given.

Ensign Good announced the self-denial collection for 1905 was a surprising £72-10-0 which was £32-10-0 over target and £5 more than ever before.
