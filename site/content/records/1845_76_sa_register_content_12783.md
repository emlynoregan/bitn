Kooringa News, 26 October

The recent revivals among the three Methodist groups in Burra seem to have influenced others as well.  The Germans have resolved upon finishing their chapel, the foundation stone of which was laid with Masonic honours some eight or nine years ago and which could not be completed when the Victorian gold diggings drew away the population.  It promises to be a handsome structure near the Redruth Court House.

Since the visit of Rev. Lyall to Burra there has been an attempt to establish a Presbyterian Church and this may well succeed as there are a number of Presbyterians scattered about Burra and the neighbouring stations.
