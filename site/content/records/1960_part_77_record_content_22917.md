Burra Hospital

The speech made by Mr R. Pearse, Chairman of the Board, at the opening of the new hospital building, is printed.

He thanked the staff for handling all the inconveniences during building operations without complaint.  The District Council and its employees also provided unpaid help.  The Town Council attended to cleaning of the footpaths and streets associated with the building.  The doctors also spent much time giving aid and advice.  The Board members and the Secretary Mr H. Foote also contributed a great deal of time and effort.  The architects are commended for blending the new building in with the old.  The public also had a huge role to play by contributing £5,000 between 29 October and 16 December 1963.  Further contributions would be welcome because over the past 12 months costs have increased between 20 & 25%.  Mr Pearse then said a few words on the history of the hospital.  The first hospital [Bleak House] was built by the mining company, just the other side of the old power house.  In 1876 the Burra Hospital was formed in what had been the original Burra hotel, then owned by the licensee Mr Alfred Barker.  (Mr John Barker is a grandson and the only family representative in the district today.)  Later Men’s and Women’s Wards were added, followed by a theatre block and some private rooms.  Later still, through the courtesy of Mr James Gallagher, an Isolation Block was added. (His child was the first patient there.)  In 1924 the Maternity Wing was added.  A major plan for redevelopment was formulated in 1953 and the Nurses’ Home was erected.  This plan’s other aspects were not proceeded with and the present Board thought it rather too big for the present needs of the district and the cost would have been excessive.  The present building is stage one of three of the new plan for redevelopment.  Next the pantry will be modernised.  The aim is to reduce the number of levels in the hospital.  We want to alter the theatre block and casualty to place all on one level, except for the Maternity Wing.
