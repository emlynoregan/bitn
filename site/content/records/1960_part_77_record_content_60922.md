Burra Mine

A recent state-wide weekly publication stated ‘Burra seems destined to become nothing more than a big hole in the ground, and a ghastly mess after mining has ended.’

Residents have expressed displeasure at the heading and opening of the article, which was otherwise a well meant attempt at stressing the importance of preserving Burra and its historical buildings.  The mine is far from a mess because of the rigid mining regulations and the efficient manner in which Samin Ltd are carrying out operations.

[Six requirements to limit the impact are then listed.]

The District Council were aware of the conditions before mining commenced and the company provides a healthy pay packet each week, which should be spent in the town.  Current operations are practically confined to the old mine area, which for the past 100 years has been a ‘big hole in the ground containing water’.  The operations will remain inside the boundary fence and will not interfere with the town.
