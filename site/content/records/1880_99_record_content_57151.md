Cr Sampson moved that applications be received from unemployed men requiring work on the main roads.

The Charge Against Inspector Gray.

The investigation by the Council Committee on Friday night last.

Cr Parks tried to exclude the press and public.

Cr Sampson was prepared for a public enquiry and Cr West supported him and this was finally carried.  The Mayor read the charge and Mr Gray said it was untrue.  [See council meeting notes.]

Cr Rabbich then delayed matters by trying to get sworn evidence when as Cr Sampson pointed out they had no right to demand such evidence.

Eventually the request for sworn evidence was withdrawn.

Cr Rabbich then made a rambling statement that said he had been told someone had made the remarks objected to and he had subsequently found out it was Mr Gray.

Mt T. Woollacott was the person who had told him and who had named Mr Gray.

Mr Thomas Tiver had also told him what Mr Gray had said.  Cr Rabbich had not personally heard anything said by Mr Gray.

Mr Thomas Woollacott was the first witness.  Mr Gray had spoken to him about the tenders for gravel and that all carters had received 100 yards at 9d per yard and asked him what he thought of the working man’s friend now?  Crs Rabbich and Hardy wanted to accept the lowest tenders of 7d and 7½d per yard.  Cr Sampson had moved the amendment for 9d per yard.

The witness had told the Inspector there was not much of a working man’s friend about that.

Cr Rabbich asked: ‘Don’t you remember telling me that Mr Gray was no friend of mine?’

No I didn’t say so.

Gray asked the witness if he had told the latter that Hardy and Rabbich did their level best t get the lowest tender accepted.  Witness said: ‘No.’

Thomas Tiver was called.  His evidence turned out to be unacceptable as hearsay.

There was much further discussion, but mostly it came down to whether the admitted statement as above constituted an offence.

The committee withdrew to consider its finding and later decided:

That Inspector Gray had given an incorrect impression of the business relating to the tenders for carting road metal at the meeting held on May 7 having evidently misunderstood what occurred.’
