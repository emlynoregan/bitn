Accident.  Miss Adams, school teacher of World’s End, was walking to Kooringa from the Burra Show with Miss Hughes, teacher of the Douglas School, when she was struck by the near side horse of a wagonette loaded with passengers as the driver pulled off the road to pass another vehicle.  She was thrown forward in front of the horses and trampled.  The vehicle then passed right over her, but fortunately all but one ankle lay between the wheels.  The wheels passed over this ankle and a hoofs truck the back of her head.  S. Burns was passing and took her to his home in his cart.  The next day the ankle was very swollen and Dr Sangster was called in.  Surprisingly she recovered well and was able to return to World’s End on Friday.  The driver of the wagonette has not been identified.
