The directors seem to have killed the goose that laid the golden egg by not allowing tributers to work.  The residents of Burra seem now to have lost all faith in them and the exodus of people has recommenced.  Last week four left for Broken Hill and others will follow, though at present there is little prospect of work there either due to the recent fire.
