Burra Public School

Though the school opened in January 1878 it was more expedient to celebrate the jubilee in April.  It was decided to hold a sports day to celebrate on Monday 2 April.  A committee was formed and good prizes collected for the events.  The day got underway at 1 p.m.  Events and winners are listed.

[Personal interest: Girls’ race Grade IV won by Joan Fairchild.  Boys’ race Grade II Jack Oates 2nd.  Boot race Grade IV Mervyn Allen 2nd.  Thread needle race Grade IV Joan Fairchild 2nd.]

There was an evening concert at the Institute which was crowded.  The program is printed.

Mr Oborn gave a history of the school from the stone-laying by Thomas Bath on 27 February 1877 and the opening by Hon. Neville Blyth, Minister of Education in 1878.  Philip Lane first Mayor of Burra was also first Chairman of the School Board of Advice.  The first headmaster was Mr James Cater.  There were 560 on the roll and 512 present on the first day.  In the first year the school fees amounted to £304-13-1.  School buildings and grounds occupy two acres and there were 12 large rooms.  Two rooms were remodelled in 1900 and are now used by the High School and these and other rooms are currently being renovated.  Headmasters have been:

James Cater	1878-86	J.F. Johnson	1911-16

A. Wittber	1886-93	C. Mundy		1916-20

J.A. Kennedy	1893-95	R. Hitchcox	1916-18 [sic]

W. Bennett	1895-98	R. Bromley		1918-20

R. McAloney	1898-1900	D. Murphy		1920-21

F. Fairweather	1900-03	J.S.G. Oborn	1921-28

G. Scott	1903-11

[According to Ian Auhl’s Centenary History of the School this list should be rather different, probably due to overlapping years on hand-over, but more significant differences occur as follows:

Charles J.W. Mundy	1916-17

Richmond T. Hitchcox	1918-19

Roy L. Bromley		1920

John S.R. Oborn		1921 to his death 7 September 1931]

He also gave a list of private school in Burra apart from St Joseph’s.

[The list is neither complete nor in order.  Again refer to Ian Auhl’s book as above.]

Mr H. Pinch: first school in a dugout in Burra Creek

Others were: Dr J.R. Stephens, Mr Grasby (night school), Mr F.W. Holder, Mr Stanton, Mr R.F. White, Mrs Rowe, Misses A. & L. Josling, Misses Goss, Mrs Press, Mrs Gillespie, Miss M.E. Sleep, Miss Johnson, Mr Jones, Mr Matthews, Mrs Blaird, Mrs McLagan, Mr Davis and a branch of MLC.

In the past students could leave at any age once they had gained the Compulsory Certificate, now they had to stay to 13.  The Mayor also gave a short speech in the evening – he said he had gained his Compulsory Certificate when 11 and had then left to work.

Mr E.J. Davey who had been present when the school opened said he had wandered down from home in the Mine Stores and could hardly wait for the speeches to end so he could get to the raspberries, lollies and other good things waiting for them.  Like the Mayor he could not think of great men who had gone through the school, but they could claim Dr Fred. W. Richards, one of the Supreme Court Judges.  He referred to the old feud between children of Kooringa and Aberdeen when lads threw stones at each other – the current lads affirmed that they still fought.

Farewell & Welcome Social.  This combined event was held at the Methodist Lecture Hall on 4 April to farewell Rev. R.H. Lee after three years and to welcome Rev. & Mrs Lawson.  A large number of friends also attended from Redruth Church, World’s End and the Salvation Army.  Mr H.G. James, circuit steward, was in the chair and others on the platform were Rev. J.S.W. Coles (Anglican), Rev. W.O. Harris (Redruth) and Mr Arthur Riggs senior circuit steward.

The proceeding included speeches and musical items and are reported in 1 column of detail.
