The Mania Murderer, Fry.

The mystery of the disappearance of the maniac Fry has been solved by the discovery of his bones by Mr Alexander McCulloch, within half a mile of where he murdered his wife and not more than four miles from his station.  Although wild dogs had torn his clothes and scattered the bones, he was identified from his rifle, cutting knife, pistol and pocket book.  His wifeâ€™s bonnet was also nearby.  It is expected an inquest will be held on Thursday.  This will allow letters of administration to be granted, to the benefit of his children.  It is rumoured that the contents of the pocket-book are of a highly important and interesting nature.

[Strangely the SA Deaths CD records no adult Fry deaths before 1860.]
