Mr E.W. Crewes, now elected for his 6th term as Mayor, establishes a record, as no other person has held the office so long.  Mr Crewes was born in Somerset in June 1859, but his parents were from Cornwall.  He came to Burra in 1878 and was employed first by Gartrell & Co. of Aberdeen and then with Messrs Drew & Co.  He later opened a branch business for them in NSW before going into partnership with Mr John Drew at Kooringa from whence branches were established at Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Something over six years ago the business became drew & Crewes Pty Ltd with Mr Crewes as managing director.  He has always had an interest in public affairs and has been a Councillor at various times.  He was first elected Mayor in 1901 and held the position for three years.  He was elected again in 1913 and each time the outbreak of war imposed a heavy workload, which he has discharged with energy and enthusiasm.  He is president of every patriotic society in the town, a member of the Hospital Board and President of the Institute.
