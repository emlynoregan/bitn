Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk is looking into a design for a Corporation Seal.

The Public Works Committee recommends work on the Redruth Ford.  [Perhaps the Aberdeen Ford in Young Street?]

Public safety concerns included the state of the footbridge leading to the cemetery, an uncovered shaft near the Gaol, a dangerous gutter near Mr Harris’s, stones sticking up through footpaths, a dangerous well near the White Hart Hotel and a dangerous open quarry at Hampton where one man had already been killed.

D. Wells was commended and has handed over to the Corporation profits of £157 from his time in managing the cemetery.
