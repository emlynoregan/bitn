Burra Cycling & Athletic Club held a preliminary meeting on 21 July in Mr Carpenter’s rooms.  Mr J. Richards said that as a member of the original sports committee he could tell them the club could start with no liabilities and assets of £27 in the Bank  [Presumably this is a resuscitated club and the £27 comes from its earlier incarnation.]  A second meeting on 28 July decided to hold a sports meeting on Boxing Day.  Despite problems with the harvest at that time, the next suitable holiday was Easter, which was deemed to be too late.
