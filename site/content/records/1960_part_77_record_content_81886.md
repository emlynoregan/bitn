52, 11, 18 Mar. 1931, page 2: Advt.  The formation of Bence’s Ltd is announced.  It was financed by certain local people and managed by A.L. Bence.  Bence’s Ltd has purchased the entire assets in the assigned estate of A.L. Bence at a huge discount.  [There location is not stated, but probably the west side of Market Square.  In any case by August the former SAFU store that had been the location of Bence’s Cash & Carry Department was vacant and available for a dance.]
