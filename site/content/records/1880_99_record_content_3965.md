Cricket.  The first dinner of the Aberdeen Cricket Club was held at the Royal Exchange Hotel 26 March.  [Note that this suggests that the ‘Royal’ part of the name was in use as early as this, though the licensing information suggests a much later date for its official use.]  W.R. Ridgway was in the chair.

M. Moorhouse in his speech said that the club started in October with 11 members and now had 29 paid up.  5 matches had been played with 2 won and 3 lost.  The club had a small debt.  W. Cobb had the best batting average at just over 10, with Mr Yeomans 2nd.  Best bowler was W. Cobb with 4.5 runs/wicket.  [The toasts are reported in ¾ column.]
