Marlene Wooton was awarded the Positive Ageing Award by Governor Sir Eric Neal at Government House recently.  It is given for excellence in service to seniors and is the first time it has gone to a country region.  [Photo.]

Marlene saw the need for activity among elderly hospital patients when in hospital herself and in 1977 started Day Care, working for five years as a volunteer and later became co-ordinator when the service moved to Burra North.
