Burra Traders’ Association invites all business people, tradesmen etc. whether members or not to attend a meeting at the Civic Centre on Monday 20 June to hear Mr Michael Fetherstonhaugh, advertising consultant, talk about advertising.  %cs have devised a plan for advertising in Burra that will enable members of the Burra Traders’ Association to advertise at 5CS for almost half the price of independent advertising and the more traders who use the plan the less it will cost all traders to advertise.
