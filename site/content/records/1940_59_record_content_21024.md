There were 49 members on the roll.  During the year the group had forwarded to headquarters: 59 pairs of socks, 8 pullovers, 4 mufflers, 2 balaclavas, 3 pairs of mittens, 90 handkerchiefs, 272 face washers, 1 pair of seaboot stockings, 1 pair long stockings and a large quantity of reading matter.  From the groups turn at operating the pie cart they had raised £22-14-0 and from their turn at managing the shop* £40-11-2.  They had forwarded £98 to headquarters towards general funds.

Elected: President, Mrs G.S. Hawker; Vice-Presidents, Mrs H.J.B. Jennison & Mrs R.L. Steele; Secretary, Mrs C. Bruce and Treasurer, Mrs R.J. Lloyd.

[The shop was a joint venture of the three FFCF units and the Burra Red Cross.  It was essentially a trading table where people brought in cakes, flowers, vegetables etc. to raise funds.]
