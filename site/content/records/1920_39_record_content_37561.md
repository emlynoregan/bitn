At the last annual meeting the sub-committee formed to enquire into the position of unemployed ex-servicemen received fewer than six names.  The committee will continue to urge the retention of preference for ex-servicemen when a job becomes available.  Rations of 2/6 have been given to down and out ex-servicemen passing through.
