Cpl Frank Preiss (AIF) was welcomed home on 23 October after three and a half years of captivity in Thailand.  He was greeted at the train by his mother, Mrs B. Preiss of Burra.  He has been a prisoner of war since the fall of Singapore.  He was also met by his sisters, Vonnie (Mrs Bourman), Rene (Mrs Opie) and her three children, and his brother, Mr C.S. Preiss, with his wife and three children and his nieces Kath and Carmel Moore.  Throughout his captivity Cpl Preiss preserved the hat badge that had belonged to his elder brother, Sylvester, who had carried it through WWI.  He returned the badge to his mother for safe-keeping.  Cpl Preiss looks thin, but fit and is in good humour.
