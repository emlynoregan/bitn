Christmas and the New Year passed with pleasant weather and there were many picnics at the Gorge and Porter’s Lagoon.  At the Lagoon the beach is clean and the water clear.

On Christmas Eve the streets were crowded and the Burra Brass Band rendered music and carols and it gave another program last Sunday.
