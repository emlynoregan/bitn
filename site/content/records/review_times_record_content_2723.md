Burra Swimming Pool is ready for the coming summer.  A new chlorine system and new pipes have been installed at a cost of c. $5,000.  The new system should cost about $300 less per year to operate as well as being safer and easier to run.  Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilisers Ltd donated materials worth about $3,000 and the Burra Council will pay $1,000 towards the refurbishment.
