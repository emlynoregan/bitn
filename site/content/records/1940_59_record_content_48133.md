ETSA has advised the Town Council that it will not supply current to the Burra area until plans are further advanced.  The problem is that Burra is on the fringe of the populated area of the state and lines to Burra would dead end here.  Areas to the north, south and west are already supplied by ETSA and there is no town to the east.  ETSA electricity reached Hanson, only 7 miles away.  It also reached Farrell Flat and will soon reach Booborowie through Spalding.

‘Seven miles of electrical mains from Hanson would be too expensive for this Government to erect for the benefit of Burra.’
