Burra School Air Raid Shelters

Many have contributed to the effort of building air raid shelters for the schools.  Some 200 men now have the job nearly completed.  Eddie Finch provided a tractor and borrowed the DC’s road plough to break the first two feet of the surface.  Mr A. Przibilla drove the tractor and Messrs Irlam, Sid Bown and Bill Parker assisted.

A ground plan for the ‘W’-shaped trenches had been worked out.  The work is not quite completed.  More sandbags have to be filled for placing on the tops of trenches and one or two trenches require a little more depth.  Next Saturday’s working bee will see it finished.  Some of the boy students of the High School were busy on the western side of the school grounds.  Fully 400 partook of tea in the afternoon, including ladies and children and a similar sumptuous tea was served at St Joseph’s School.

Mr Jennison, Chairman of the School Committee thanked all the workers and the ladies for supplying afternoon tea.

Mr P.J. Byrne, Chairman of the St Joseph’s School Committee paid tribute to the workers there.

On 28 March we hear that a similar working bee will be held for the Hospital.

[Details of the activity occupy two columns, but no real detail is provided of the location or appearance etc. of the actual trenches.]
