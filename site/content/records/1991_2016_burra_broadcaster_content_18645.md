Elders Twilight Jazz Affair was held on Saturday, when c. 400 people braved the wet conditions to raise c. $8,000 to assist the Sir Hubert Wilkins Family Cottage Restoration Project.  Revellers dances under the bright umbrellas to the sounds of E-Type Jazz, Eddie White’s All Stars and the 25-piece Faith Secondary School Swing Band, until at about 10.15 p.m. a major power blackout finally stopped the show.
