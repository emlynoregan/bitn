BCS.  Year 10 students this year have Community Service as an option.  In Term 1 students did maintenance work on the Croquet Grounds.  For the winter they have shifted to restoration work on one of Paxton square cottages.  When finished it will become a practice area for students learning the trumpet or recorder.  Students also assist with Meals on Wheels and in historical research using old copies of the Burra Record for a project pack on Burra.
