Burra-Black Springs Road.  The Minister of Roads has advised that the road from Black Springs to Burra is hilly and full of bends and would be very expensive to reconstruct.  It has been decided, after investigation, to survey a new route via Hanson.  This has been temporarily postponed due to urgent works elsewhere.  While the work is seen as very desirable, it is not possible to say when work on it might commence.
