Burra Chrysanthemum Show was held last Wednesday.

A prize for the best 48 chrysanthemums went to R.M. Harvey with J.D. Cave 2nd. (Mr Cave had sent 70 choice blooms to Adelaide a few days earlier.)

J. Lewis was a strong contender.

Best six blooms to Miss H. Baker.  Miss M. Oppermann excelled in bouquets and Mr Oppermann in fruit.  12 pears grown by the late H.C.W. Fuss weighed 18Â½ lbs and called for special mention on account of their large dimensions.

The complete prize list is printed.
