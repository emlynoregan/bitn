Burra Racing Club held its AGM on Wednesday.  Mr E.C. Collins was elected a life member in appreciation of the work done for it over many years, we believe since 1936, and for many years as President.  The AGM drew only a poor attendance.  The financial position was good with £536 in hand, an increase of £231 for the year.  The two meetings for the year were successful.  The financial success is due to the Winning Bet Tax: income from the Betting Control Board was £1,458 compared with £880 the previous year.  Renewal and repairs cost £322 and additions to buildings £77.  Several hundred yards of new railing were put up and 720 ft of railing is on hand.  CWA luncheons and afternoon teas contributed greatly to meetings.  The resignation of Cyril Collins from the committee, through ill health, was accepted with great regret.  Mr G. Gask was unanimously re-elected as President.
