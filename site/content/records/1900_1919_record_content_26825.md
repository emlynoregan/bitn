Empire Day.  A meeting was held at Burra Institute on Friday night to consider how to celebrate Empire Day this year.  Empire Day Secretary Mr George Scott reported they had £5 in assets and £2-15-4 in hand.  A number of people spoke and it was generally thought that in view of the death of King Edward VII the program of last year should be curtailed and it was resolved to omit the sports and simply have a few speeches about Empire Day and its object.  A list of speakers was drawn up to attend the different district schools.  [The list is printed.]
