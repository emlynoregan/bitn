Letter.  Des Woolley writes – interested to see the Council grading and finally surfacing a road that carries on from Stock Street then turns right and links up with Ware Street – a road to nowhere, serving no one.  Could they be pandering to someone wishing to develop land south of Dr Simpson’s home?  Surely it is not breaking the Council’s policy of not allowing any development above that of the existing township defined!
