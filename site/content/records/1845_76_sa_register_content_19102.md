‘One of the Public’

[This letter is in response to a letter of complaint by Rev. Cox.    The writer condemns the ‘dangerous and uncomfortable’ vehicles Mr Rounsevell has at different times placed on the Angaston mail route.]

At times the condition of his vehicles has prompted someone else to place rival vehicles that are more commodious and comfortable on the route.  On such occasions Mr Rounsevell has promptly cut his fares or schemed in such a way that his rival has been removed.  He then resumes his reign of terror ‘with rickety traps, cushionless seats, and often uncivil drivers’.
