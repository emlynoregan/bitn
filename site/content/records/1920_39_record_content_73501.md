8 Intermediate Certificates.

Much additional school equipment was also acquired and the Domestic Arts Centre was modernised.

1938 saw a record enrolment due to a large First Year class.

The staff changed almost completely.

Two junior teachers were appointed and the school had a staff of 5.  The Parents & Friends and the new High School Council elected in April, together with similar Primary School bodies convinced the Department of the need for immediate alterations to the school.  The new High School Library is expected to be in use by the start of 1939 and the Assembly Hall will give the school a more equal footing with others.  Money raised by the Parents & Friends Assoc. should fund a stage in the Hall and a bicycle shed and £25 goes to the library, attracting a £ for £ subsidy.  The new aids of cinema, wireless and amplifier have been used to advantage in 1938.
