Following their meeting on 29 October the Burra Burra DC has contacted the National Trust with a suggestion for including the unstaffed Morphett’s Engine House Museum on the Burra Passport.  If no agreement is reached beforehand the Engine House will be closed from 29 November due to financial constraints.  Council has been staffing the museum for two hours a day during the week and for three hours at weekends.  Some months ago the National Trust proposed it manage and staff the building and pay the wages and involve the general community through a committee.  The Council would make a financial commitment and share any profit.  Council has delayed discussion until they work out how to place the Engine House on the passport.  Once closed the mineral displays will be removed.  The Van Buuren model of a beam engine, the audio system and the video commentary will remain.
