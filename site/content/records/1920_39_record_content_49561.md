RSL held its AGM in the Club Rooms 10 February.  Attendance was very small.

President H.J.B. Jennison reported that there was a marked indifference to their work from a disappointing number of returned men.  Social gatherings and meetings have been only poorly attended and yet absent members are the first to complain when something goes wrong.  There was a marked lack of support for the Anzac Sports, which only succeeded because of non-digger friends.  The membership is the smallest for many years and he appealed to all true diggers to recognise the tremendous work of the League for the less fortunate returned men and their dependants.

Members who left the district this year were: Dobson, Lawrence & Jones.  Oliver Earle, though still a member was too far away for regular attendance.  He reported on visits to Crystal Brook and Spalding and on a poorly attended lantern lecture by Comrade Downs.  Anzac Sunday afternoon was a success when the address was by Padre G.C. Hutchinson supported by Salvation Army Capt. & P.L. Rosman.  The Burra District Band under Comrade Murison ably supported and the evening service was at Redruth Methodist Church and there was a packed room.  Anzac Sports were very successful and the best of its kind ever held in Burra.  The sub-branch has greatly appreciated the support this year of the Burra District Band.

The Brandt Fund established in 1929 is now exhausted after paying out Â£168-2-5.

He suggested regular monthly smoke socials.

Mr R.C. Sexton is secretary following the departure of M. Dobson.

The sporting success has greatly helped the financial position.  Elections: President, H.J.B. Jennison (re-elected); Vice-Presidents, J.H. Murison (re-elected) & T.J. Canny (re-elected); Secretary, G.H. Dow (re-elected); Treasurer, R.C. Sexton (re-elected). It was decided to hold the Anzac Sports on Saturday 28 April and monthly smoke social were decided upon.
