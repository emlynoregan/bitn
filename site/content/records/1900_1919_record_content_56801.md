Burra Cheer-up Society

Pte Ralph Thomas was welcomed at the station on Tuesday night on his way to Mt Bryan by the Ladies’ band etc.  Pte Wesley Nankivell was also present.

On Wednesday morning the Ladies’ band went to Farrell’s Flat on the morning train and thence to Clare for their Australia Day proceedings.  They reached Clare at 7.30 a.m.  At 12.30 they led the procession to the sports ground.  The Band returned on the Broken Hill Express.

A photo has been received of Driver R.S. Honan of Hallett.

E.J. Davey writes maintaining his statement that Mr Winnall had said that Lawn & Co. had not a leg to stand on.

They took £694-1-2 and paid to the Navy League £331-10-0 and some to Missions to Seamen.  [Details of costs totally £29-18-5 are then given and the bank account currently stood at £1-2-9.]
