Burra Town Council, 18 February

The RAA complained that stray stock were a danger on the town’s roads at night.  The Ranger will be instructed to take action.

Morgan, Burra Burra District, Burra Town and Waikerie Councils will soon meet at Robertstown to discuss improvements to the road from Morgan to Mid Northern Towns.

The George Street Ford is to be repaired.

Burra Town Council has been given title to more than three acres of land close to the Burra High School as a gift from Messrs Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd and the Council now holds it in trust for the Burra High School.

[Without checking this out, it seems likely this land was the former saleyards site east of the Unicorn Brewery site and which later became a school oval.]

Mr E.R. Davey, the Town Clerk, said that the agreement between the Kooringa Tennis Club and the Council was good for a period of fifteen years from November 1925.  As a result the Council can make the courts available to the Kooringa Methodist Church Tennis Club and the Club will be advised the courts can be repaired for about £15.

A Public Meeting will be held at the Council Chamber on 5 March to consider the formation of a Pre-School Kindergarten in Burra.  Such bodies are becoming numerous and are associated with the Kindergarten Union.  Trained staff are in charge and fees are paid on a voluntary basis and funds are supplemented by various functions.

District Roads

In the Government’s post-war reconstruction work the Burra-Saddleworth Road has been given priority A.

Burra-Peterborough has priority B and the Burra-Spalding Road rates only priority C.

Cr Jennison asked recently whether the new lights to outline the Town Hall would be ready by Easter and the Mayor said he thought it was possible.  Cr Bevan suggested a Ball on 25 June to raise funds towards renovations at the Hall.  A discussion was also held about later holding monthly dances.
