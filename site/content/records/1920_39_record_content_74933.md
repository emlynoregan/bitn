Burra Town Council, 8 May

SAR advises that the ballast needs of the Riverton-Terowie line were two cars a week and the quarry at Aberdeen had no crusher so it was preferable to use the main quarry and hook the cars onto an ordinary freight train.

Cr Lott said a deputation to the railways seemed necessary.

The Town Clerk said it was not possible to get an engine to the quarry to handle the trucks.

The Mayor said the local MP assured him the matter had been fully considered.

Rev. C. Gray & Rev. J.A. Andrews were appointed to the High School Council to replace Rev. Redding & Mr G.H. Dow.

The Mayor & Cr Robinson were appointed to see the Commissioners re the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.

The Town Clerk was appointed to make a fresh assessment for Â£20.

The Government is to be approached for a special grant for road work in front of the hospital, as it would have to be done when the bitumen came through to Burra.

The cemetery wall is to be repaired.
