Accident.  Cheryl Anne Paynter fell from a moving car between Hanson and Burra on Sunday.  Cheryl was 10 yesterday and spent her birthday in Burra Hospital with a fractured skull and abrasions.  She was a passenger in a car driven by Theodore Paynter of Oaklands.  It is thought the door flew open when the car hit a bump.  Her condition yesterday was satisfactory.
