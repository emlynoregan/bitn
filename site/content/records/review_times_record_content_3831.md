Jennison’s Sale

Bidding was active at the clearing sale of Jennison’s Tyre Service last Wednesday, which marked the close of 65 years’ business in Burra.  Mr G. Tapscott, Elders auctioneer, said the gross takings were about $18,000.  Mr Ray Jennison’s decision to close the business was based on his ambition to retire at 60.  He plans to spend his leisure time fishing at Port Vincent and improving his golf handicap of 11.  After 30 years as a Ford dealership the Commercial Street premises will now be occupied by Elders Pastoral.  Mr Tapscott said the larger premises would give customers better access, increased stock lines and the use of a forklift for loading.
