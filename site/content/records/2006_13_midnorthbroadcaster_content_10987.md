Burra Show was held last weekend in ideal weather.  The attendance was good and the feedback from locals was positive.  MP Dan van Holst Pellekaan and his wife attended, as did Rowan Ramsey later in the day.  There were about 40 trade sites and the sideshows were popular as usual.  Entries were generally pleasing, though down in the ute competition.  There were 13 competitors in the shearing competition.  Life Member Ron Shipard officially opened the event.  President John Oates said it was very pleasing to see the turnaround from a few years ago when the show appeared to be struggling.  ‘Horses in Action’ is a booming section, with greater numbers this year allowing for a full events card.  Charles McInnis of Mt Bryan deserves special mention for entering a wide field of sections and taking out the Junior Aggregate Award.
