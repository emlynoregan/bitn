Kooringa News, 25 May

Three wagons and parties comprising residents from around Mintaro and some Burra miners returned from the Barrier Ranges on the evening of 24 May.  They report plenty of holes, but no gold.

On Thursday 23 May Rev. L.W. Stanton gave one of his amusing entertainments comprising readings from popular authors supplemented by amateur musicians.  The aim was to provide some aid for a poor, but deserving widow.  [The program is printed.]  The sum collected was £6-15-0, which together with the previous week’s takings made £16-8-0.

Rev. M.C. Patchell, Wesleyan Minister from Wallaroo, has been here since 17 May as deputation for the Home Mission Fund. He gave a lecture at the Kooringa Wesleyan chapel on 22 May on ‘The Future Residence of the Saints of this World’.  Several public meetings have been held on the object of the Mission.

On the Queen’s Birthday holiday there were races at Mt Bryan Hotel, but few people attended and the racing was not of the best order.  On the way home Mr Opie’s cart overturned and a son of Mr Potter sustained a severe leg injury.

The Princess Royal Mine still looks well and if some capital can be obtained to crush ore many think it will prove a splendid mine.  There are large piles of ore at grass.
