The Burra Show.

With the number of entries rising it was decided on a two-day show this year.  (There were 1,700 entries.)  The industrial hall was twice the size of last year.  Though Wednesday was the main day, Tuesday attracted crowds.  It was hot on Wednesday and a real brickfielder was raging by 9 a.m., but a very large crowd attended.  It was the same when the special train arrived at midday, but conditions moderated about 2 p.m.

The luncheon is reported at length.  The speakers were the Hon. W. Mills, Mr O’Halloran MP, The President I.J. Warnes, Mr Maurice Collins, Mr G.F. Jenkins (President of the Yarcowie Field Trial Society), Mr J. Denton (Vice-President of the Royal Show), Mr Edwards (said to be the father of the Pinnaroo Society), Mr G. Harmer (Clare) & Mr A.R. G. Hawke MP.

Agricultural produce had numerous entries.

Dairy produce displays were much praised, especially Mr Eddie Finch’s.

Poultry had over 300 entries.

Draught horse entries were the biggest ever seen.  This is the first Australian show with a class for Percheron.

Blood stock entries were few.

Horses in action were as usual a favourite attraction.

Cattle entries were more than double last year’s.

Dog entries had an excellent show of greyhounds, but sheep dogs disappointed.

The sheep shown were in great condition and H. Collins & Co. of Lucernedale Mt Bryan took most prizes.

Fleece wools were an outstanding feature and the champion fleece came from Percy J. Thomas of Mt Bryan East.

There were few pigs.

Agricultural implements were dominated by John Shearer & Sons and there were a large number of cars.

Fruit & Vegetables were dominated by Messrs Moxam [Moxham?] & Oppermann.

Flowers were reduced by the drastic weather changes of the week.

Cookery was very creditably represented as were arts and industries.

The school class entries were an improvement on last year.
