2nd Leader on changes to the way Institutes were subsidised. All income was subsidised in the past, but now income from the hire of the hall or a portion of the building, or donations in consideration of the same, will not be subsidised. In Burra the Institute income is £350 of which £200 will no longer attract a subsidy. To make such a change after many Institutes have entered into commitments on the reasonable expectation of the subsidy continuing is unfair. At least 12 months notice of so large a change should be given.
