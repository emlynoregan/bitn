BCS students have been participating in National Science Week from 17-25 August.  Year 8 students took part in the Innovations & Inventions machine making competition, organised by Queensland Innovation, science & Technology (QIST).  Students received a package of five everyday items and could add five more to make a machine to solve an everyday problem.  Most successful were Lachlan Riggs, William Gebhardt, Doug Wilson and Chris Martin, who invented a lifting device to suspend small objects such as model plane parts so they could be painted or glued.
