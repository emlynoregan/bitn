Burra Cheer-up Soc.  An article on the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band as reported in the Register.

Violet Day.  The Naval Band was prevented by influenza from playing and the Military Band had duty at Outer Harbour, so the Ladies’ band carried most of the musical portion of the ceremonies and did it very well.  In the afternoon its members were invested with war service stripes by the Military Commandant at the Cheer-up Hut.  There were present about 1,000 interstate troops en route for home from the transport Devanha.  The President [of what? Mr Crewes?] introduced the Band and recounted its service, especially in greeting returning soldiers at the station.  Brigadier-General Antrill made the presentation.

The badge comprises a representation in blue on a white ground of a pair of wings and a stripe for each year of service.  Mr G.E. Dane of the Burra Cheer-up Soc. responded for the Band.
