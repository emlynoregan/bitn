Obituary – Murder.

Bessie Mann, whose father is an old and respected resident of Hallett and who for some time kept the Hallett Hotel, has been committed for trial in Adelaide for murder.  The jury at a recent inquest found she had thrown her child into the Torrens in Adelaide, where the body was later found.

The child, a boy aged 3, had been looked after for about two years by Mrs John Anderson of Hallett for about 5/- to 7/- a week, but the mother had recently (13 October) said she was taking the child to North Adelaide where Mrs McKenzie of Argent St [sic] [Archer St?] had offered to adopt it.  She claimed she had given Frank to Mrs McKenzie on North Terrace near Government House on Tuesday together with £5.  The jury found that Frank Mann died on 14 October by drowning in the Torrens and that his mother, Bessie Mann, had placed him there.  The accused is well known in Burra.

[Frank Horace Mann was born 20 September 1894.]
