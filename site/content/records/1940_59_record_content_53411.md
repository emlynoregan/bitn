Burra Town Council, 7 January

SAR advises that from 1 January the royalty for material taken from the railway quarry had been increased to 4d per ton.

RAA forwarded another complaint about straying stock in Burra.

L.L. Fiebig submitted further advice and plans for entrances needed at the new Burra North Service Station.  The work required will be done as soon as possible.

The Queen St Footbridge will receive necessary attention.

A sign will be placed on the Queen St Bridge advising it was safe only for light traffic.
