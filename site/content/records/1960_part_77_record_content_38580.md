Burra Mine.  Three men, ‘Jock’, Hugh and Andy Brown, are working there at present.  They recently put in a small shaft near Peacock’s and at about 43 ft broke into a drive off the main shaft and found an old four pint billy-can and small pannikin and a ‘pickaxe’ bottle, which they gave to the local museum.
