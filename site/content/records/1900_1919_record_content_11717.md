Mr John Sampson, probably the oldest resident of Burra, is in poor health.  He has served as town councillor for some 15 years, Mayor for a term and as Redruth Court Bailiff for many years.  He saw the first corpse laid in the local cemetery and the first load of copper leave the mine.  He is 74 and has resided here for 54 years.
