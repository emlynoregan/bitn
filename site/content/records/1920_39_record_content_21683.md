Characteristics of the 1926 paper.

Page 1

Large advertisements; mainly local.

Page 2

A mixture of advertisements of varying sizes.  Many are concerned with sales of stock or real estate.  Notices from local government and State & Federal Government Departments etc.  News rarely starts on page 2 in 1926.

Page 3

Page 2 advertisements and notices frequently spill over onto page 3.  The news than begins without editorials.  Sport gets considerable detail and so does the Town Council.  There is generally a good coverage of local and district events and the outlying towns and districts have regular correspondentsâ€™ reports.

Page 4

A mixture of larger advertisements; not all local, and a spill-over of news from page 3 in widely varying proportions.

Supplements in varying sizes are common.  Some are single sided while others cover both sides.

Advertising seems to have expanded considerably this year.  The paper also contains a few photographs.  They remain sparse, but no longer rare.  Few are local.
