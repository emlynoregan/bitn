The Club’s guarantors had notified that they will no longer make payments after 1928.  A meeting was called and the matter discussed and eventually they have guaranteed payments to £600 as long as the guarantors are a majority of the committee.  The meeting of 21 March was most successful, though some fields could have been larger.  Membership at 156 is only three below last year’s.  Officers appointed were: President and Chairman, N.H. Pearse; Secretary, G.H. Dow & Patron, Sir John Melrose.
