The Burra Mine

Representatives of the Mines Department visited Burra some time ago and made a very cursory perusal of the mine.  They seem to have tested a site at or near the old Bon Accord Mine where it was known no copper was likely to be found.  Is it that the Department does not want to find copper in the Burra District?  Why does it seem reluctant to spend a few pounds in the Burra Mining Company site or at Princess Royal or at Shafton where there are other known deposits?
