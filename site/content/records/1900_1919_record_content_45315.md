Redruth Court House.

On Monday afternoon as Senior Constable McCarthy was closing the front door he heard a noise and on investigation found about two square feet of the ceiling in his office had fallen down.  Soon after another similar piece fell and almost immediately the rest of the ceiling and its rafters.  In doing so the back wall was bowed out and will have to be rebuilt above the height of the windowsill.  It is a great mercy no one was hurt or killed.
