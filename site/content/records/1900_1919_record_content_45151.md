Thomas Halls Jnr.

Returned home from hospital after recovering from typhoid on Sunday.  He accused his wife of impropriety with Grow, alleging she had been found on the bed together.  She admitted Grow had been on the bed, but she was only tickling him.  Told her he was finished with her.  Noticed her bags were packed and said that looked like guilt.  Repeated the conversation to Grow when he arrived and that was when both of them attacked me – she with a coffee pot and he with a frying pan and fist.  She fell on her head climbing over the wall.  He admitted to striking Grow, but not his wife: pushed her, but never hit her.  I said nothing about a signed statement.  At one point everybody was hitting everybody else.  Untrue I pushed Grow over the chair.  Wife was pretty regular in attendance at hospital while I was there.
