AGL Bush to Burra Cattle Drive has resulted in a cheque of $10,000 to Aussie Helpers Ltd.  This body was founded to help fight poverty and lift spirits of those affected by drought in Queenslandâ€™s outback and has since gone national and urban as well.  Other health organisations also benefited.  Another drive is being organised for next year.
