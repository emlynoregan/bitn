M-C Geering left with Mrs Geering for his new station at Mt Pleasant after 4½ years at Kooringa.  The congregation of St Joseph’s presented him with a case of pipes and a silver entrée dish for Mrs Geering.  A travelling rug was given by ‘the business community’ and a silver cake dish was also given to Mrs Geering.  These latter presentations were made by the Mayor.
