The Prince of Wales’s Birthday Holiday

The picnic arranged by Rev. Stanton at Princess Royal was marred by the almost continuous rain, but went ahead and was enjoyed by the small number who went.  The number of rabbits there is surprising and even without dogs the agile youngsters caught a few.

About 30 young people attended a dance in the evening at the Grammar School, which continued till early morning.

The Redruth Sunday School held its Anniversary services.  Proceeds were about £14.

The Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel has undergone extensive and necessary repairs and was reopened on Sunday.  Rev. J.G. Wright preached three sermons.  On Monday with the rain falling heavily and the creeks rising, nearly 40 people had an excellent repast in Mr Steven’s wine and spirit store.  The next day a similar treat was given in a tent near E. Stevens’s hay shed, where many enjoyed themselves.  Proceeds were £52.

The Branch Bible Society held a meeting in the Bible Christian Chapel recently.  Attendance was small and Rev. B. Backhouse was the deputation.  Collections for the year totalled about £60 and [book] repository sales had been £12-4-6.  £40 was awarded as a donation to the Parent Society.  Mr Porter was elected Chairman and P.W. Dyer as Secretary for the year.
