‘Oh I don’t want them; [i.e. the questions] I don’t like questions; I can’t stand them.’

Mr Winnall, who was appearing on behalf of Mr E. Camp, who had sustained £80 damages was clearly annoyed by this and said: ‘We will give you a chair then.’

[M-C Phelan then provided a chair, though whether Mr Winnall’s sarcasm was meant to be taken literally is unclear.]

Elliott Camp claimed he had traced the fire back to still burning chips and cinders close to the Waterworks shed.

The verdict was that there was strong circumstantial evidence that the fire started at New Aberdeen on 31 December, by a spark from the Burra Waterworks chimney.

The coroner was C. Bartholomaeus and C.A. Fuss was foreman of the jury.
