Mt Bryan Hall Auxiliary is a small committee dedicated to the upkeep of the hall and to assisting the wider community.  It major fundraising activity is the Annual Dinner, which this year will be held on 29 July.  All tickets have been sold.  This year the auxiliary has supported a major upgrade of the hall’s exterior, a repainting of the interior and the fitting of new curtains.

In recent years other groups to benefit have been: the Ambulance and St John Service, Burra hospital, Ronald McDonald house, Mt Bryan CFS, Mt Bryan Tennis Club, Mt Bryan Progress Assoc. and the Mt Bryan School.  This year they are helping the Hallett-Mt Bryan Play-group.

Active8 is a new style of school cadets being introduced after a gap of two decades in such activity.  Premier John Olsen said the State Government has committed $4.4 million to the program over four years.

Burra Branch of the National Trust reviewed its performance at a quarterly meeting last Thursday.  Some good news was that takings from the Bon Accord and Morphett’s Engine House Museums were up on last year.  Steve Boyes is continuing his huge job of entering all the Trust’s items and artefacts onto a database.  It is estimated some 6,000 items are in the archives.  Angus Radford has helped him recently as part of work experience.  Malowen Loweth items are on the database with the Market Square Museum to be tackled next.
