City Rackets Hit Country People & Traders

A Â¾-column article attacks rackets which give city folk plenty of chocolate and biscuits etc. but packing difficulties in warehouses keep the same items from being delivered to the country.  Furniture suppliers use 3d worth of packing and charge 25/-, but cannot by regulation be passed on to the consumer.  The profit margin on the wholesale price is also regulated.

Garden hose is available in small quantities, limited to 30ft per applicant and priced at 1/- per foot.  Oddly enough heavy industrial hose is able to be purchased in any quantity at 2/2 per foot without application.
