Burra Town Council.

James Pryor sought a pay rise of 7/6 a week to 22/6 for lighting lamps in Kooringa and the right to the proceeds from the sale of carbide holders and a pair of leather gloves.

Cr Harris moved it be granted.

Cr McBride said the carbide lamps were useless and it was time kerosene was substituted.  It cost more than the rates brought in ‘to light lamps which were never alight’.

Cr McWaters agreed – some of the lamps had not been alight for weeks.

The matter will be considered.

[The outcome of Cr Harris’s motion is unclear.]
