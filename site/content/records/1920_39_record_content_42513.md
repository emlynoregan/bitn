A reunion of priests of the Catholic Diocese of Pt Augusta, who were educated at Mongrel College SJ in Limerick Ireland, was held on 29 June at Seven Hills College.  Dr Killian Bishop of Port Augusta was in Ireland and attended the College itself on the Golden Jubilee of the institution.  In Burra Father Morrissey the senior Mungret Priest gave a dinner to others and those present were Very Rev. Father McCarthy SJ and Rev. Father Logue SJ of Seven Hills College.  Representatives of other Irish Colleges were Rev. Fathers F. Farrell of Renmark, J. Cullinan of Whyalla (formerly of Burra), and the past Mungret Priests Rev. M.V. Clune of Hawker, Rev. W.H. Nesdale of Peterborough (formerly of Burra), Rev. A.J. Conway of Pt Augusta, Rev. T.F. Toal of Streaky Bay and Rev. M.F. Toal of Jamestown (formerly of Burra).
