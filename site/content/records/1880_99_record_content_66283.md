Burra Mine.  The report on the boring operation shows that the drill was at 1201’ and showed copper ore at 600’ in Morphett’s Shaft, Waterhouse’s, and Peacock’s.  It proves the continuance downwards of copper bearing ground.  The Government Geologist, H.V.L. Brown, considers it shows enough ore to justify setting Morphett’s Shaft in order and restarting mining at that point.
