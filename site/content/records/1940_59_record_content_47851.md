The Committee has been advised that getting a bigger water supply for the oval is going to be difficult.  Mr Fisher has laid piping at the oval, but he reported that it was doubtful if a new main would be put down.  It was resolved to ask Council to advise the E & WS Department that interest on the capital outlay for a 3 inch main would be guaranteed.

E.T. Baulderstone offered to make enquiries about drawings and specification s for a grandstand.  The matter is to stand over pending an application from the Cricket Assoc. concerning the use of the ground in the coming cricket season.  The levelling of the ground has been completed and the cycling track made.  Fencing, building a grandstand and establishing the grass are tasks yet to be done.
