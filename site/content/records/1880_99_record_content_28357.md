‘Wanderer’ has been circulating a libel upon the community and while we would usually ignore such a handbill we consider its abuse of the community makes it worthy to note, as it will recoil upon its writer.

The handbill accuses the editor of the Record of stopping his column ‘through nothing but party motives.’

He implies that Holder is ‘so cringing and cowardly as to vilify any honest outspoken person who was prepared to fight the battle of right against might.’  He inveighs against the suppression of all honest speech.  He intends to continue the battle, if one avenue is closed then by other means.

Editorial comment on ‘Wanderer’.

He was given ample time to voice his opinions and develop his ‘democratic, not to say socialistic’ views.  But instead of using argument and fact he ‘descended into personal abuse and wandered further from fairness so much as to do damage to the cause he represented.’  To charge ‘people in this “outlandish place” of being afraid of each other’ is absurd.
