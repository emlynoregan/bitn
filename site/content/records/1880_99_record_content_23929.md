Editorial.  [This is a good example of parochialism.]  The editor condemns the through running of trains to and from Broken Hill.  Cockburn should, he says, remain the terminus and thus become the trading centre for the northeast.

He also reports that the Town Council debt increased through the year from £201 on 1 January 1886 to an anticipated £380 by 31 December 1886.

The appearance of the town has been much improved over the last few years due to the formation of streets and footpaths and the planting of trees.  The benefit of trees is only now beginning to be felt.
