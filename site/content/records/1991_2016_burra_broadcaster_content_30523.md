The Burra Picnic Race Club has had to cancel this yearâ€™s event. The insurance company with which they were negotiating pulled out at the last minute.  An attempt will be made to resume in 2004.

Burra Swimming Pool has closed for the season.  Despite a late opening due to repairs, the takings were at an all-time high, due to the very hot summer.  The pool now needs major repairs.  The options are resurfacing with marble sheen (the present surface) or tiling.  The latter is more expensive, but has a longer life.

Frequent vandalism remains a problem.
