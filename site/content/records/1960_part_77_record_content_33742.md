Hanson Field Day.  The Hanson Agricultural Bureau organised this function on Thursday 30 March.  Five machinery firms were represented: Ferguson, Shearer, Chamberlain, Ford and International and also John Deer Tractors.  Hanson CWA catered for 120 at a light luncheon in the Hanson Hall.  Proceeds will aid the Burra Hospital.  The location of the demonstrations was at Tom Rogers, just west of Hanson.  Demonstrations were held in very windy and dusty conditions.  In the afternoon Mr Hal Bannister demonstrated the latest techniques in bulk handling of super.  The use of bulk super has increased in the past six years from 1.1% to 34%.
