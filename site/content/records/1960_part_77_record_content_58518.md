Burra Motel.  A meeting on Thursday decided that plans should be drawn up and a prospectus prepared.  On Thursday it was decided to use a site near the resited Peacock’s Chimney.  At least eight possible sites were inspected and discarded.  Messrs Peat Marwick, Mitchell & Co. are drawing up the necessary documents.  The plan is for 16 or 20 units plus dining facilities.
