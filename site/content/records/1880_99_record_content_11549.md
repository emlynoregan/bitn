The characteristics of the paper in 1883

Page 1

This held the usual regular advertisements, mostly of larger size and many from outside the town.

Pages 2 & 3

The dividing line between the two was very flexible, but these two pages held most of the local news in small paragraphs.  The editorial and 2nd leader (sometimes with a 3rd as well) were quite varied in length.  They frequently dealt with SA Parliamentary issues or other matters beyond the town itself.  The Town Council meetings were usually reported only briefly, but there are some exceptions where considerable detail is provided.  The Midland Road Boardâ€™s activities are reported in rather more detail.  There are reports from correspondents in other northern centres and these are both numerous and significant.  Advertisements do not intrude into the news.  Overseas news is significant, but is usually reported in very short paragraphs without headings or breaks.  Headlines are small and used only for major articles.  Many smaller items blend into one another.  There is rarely any prose fiction and only occasionally a poem.

This is also the place for small classified advertisements and official and other notices.

There is a little news: generally in the first two columns.  The remainder of the space is for advertisements among which patent medicines feature strongly.

Changes.

The quality of the newsprint was bad in the second half of the year.

From 9 October the paper was published twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays instead of only on Wednesdays.

This saw the introduction of serial fiction and a lot more overseas, Australasian and regional items - not necessarily of great quality.  It did nothing for local coverage, which was at best the same spread over two issues, and may even have declined.

Essentially the former pages 2 & 3 were condensed onto page 2 and page 3 carried a condensed selection from the former literary supplement plus notices, especially Council notices and some small advertisements.

The lengthy and repeated articles and editorials on taxation issues and Land Acts etc. surely reflect the interests of the editor rather than those of most of his readers.  While an elite might have liked them, it is hard to imagine that they were widely read, given the literacy levels of the day.

Temperance issues occupy a significant amount of space.
