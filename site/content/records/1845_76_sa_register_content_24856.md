Mr W.W. Hughes has donated a large sum - £20,000 to £30,000 is mentioned – towards the establishment of the University of Adelaide.  [Most of the article is devoted to pointing out how rare such philanthropy is and how most rich men stick to most of their money with the ‘tenacity of a horse leech’ and deem themselves generous if they part with a £5 note and if they subscribe £100 consider they have done something worthy of the admiration of the world at large.]

‘It will be observed that …Captain Hughes has not waited for his riches to be snatched from his grasp by death before endeavouring to do good with them.  In so doing he has acted wisely, for he will have the gratification of witnessing during his lifetime the effects of his liberality – a gratification which we trust may be prolonged to the utmost limit of his desire.’
