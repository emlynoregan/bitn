Public Tree Planting Meeting

A well attended meeting on Thursday night discussed the plan to plant trees in different parts of the town to commemorate the visit of HM the Queen to Australia.  It was realised that young trees would need to be protected from straying stock in many places.  A wide ranging number of groups and individuals were represented and the outcome was a decision to plant 80 trees this year in different sites.
