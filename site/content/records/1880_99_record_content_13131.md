‘I presume to entice the people away.’

The Salvation Army, he says, have done good work and continue to do good, but this sort of action is unjustifiable.  He describes four steeds harnessed to a four-wheeled vehicle bearing men in gold-banded caps playing brass instruments with an inscription on the vehicle: ‘Grand National Circus’.

‘They resemble them too in their tunes which are light, gay, or what you please to call them, for I don’t call them sacred.’
