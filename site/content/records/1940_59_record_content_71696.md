Burra RSL held its AGM last Saturday and elected: President, C.M. Beckwith; Vice-Presidents, J. Battye & R.W. Nankivell; Secretary, Don Higginson.  Outgoing President H. Cornelius reported on a busy year for 1955.  A bottle drive made a lot of work, but built up funds far in excess of expectations, which will enable renovations to the clubrooms.  The Anzac service was conducted by the Ministers Fraternal and attended by the Marananga Band with a good turnout of citizens.  November 11 Remembrance Day was also observed, as was Air Force Week.  The Annual Ball was another success.  The Christmas Party was a very successful combined meeting with the Air Force Assoc.  Badge days were conducted for Legacy, Poppy Day and Anzac Day Appeals.  The local RSL continues to support two Legacy wards.  RSL members and others planted a number of trees in the RSL Plantation, but the very wet weather saw nearly all die.  In future they will be potted for the first year.  Three members were farewelled and one, Tom Fuller, was made a life member.  Thanks were extended to members of the House Committee, Burra Record and all others who have helped throughout the year.
