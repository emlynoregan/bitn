The Mayor said revenue for the last 12 months at a 2/3 rate was £2,203.

He wanted to reduce rates, saying in 1932 maintenance cost £648 and unemployment relief £161, leaving about £1,500 for ‘overhead expenses’.  He considered this too much.  A considerable argument erupted, as part of those expenses was the lighting bill.

The Mayor then wanted to cut the Medical Officer’s salary from £50 to £25 – in fact they had had no report from him for 11 years and the post might be abolished.

This provoked a heated exchange in which the loud blustering of the Mayor eventually provoked sharp responses from Crs Dow, Sampson and Jennison.

Cr Dow felt he had been personally insulted and shouted down.

Cr Sampson found ‘too much personal bias’ and would ‘sooner stop at home than come here to a dogfight’.  He accused the Mayor of not giving anyone ‘a chance to say a dashed word, you go on like a babbling brook, I’m sick of it’.

Cr Jennison thought they would get on better if the Mayor were ‘not so overbearing and treated us as reasonable men’.

The Mayor apologised.

The Councillors generally supported the need for a Medical Officer.

The Mayor then turned to the employees and suggested they did not need two hands, and Mr Voumard could be made a casual hand.  Another altercation erupted during which the Mayor believed he had been insulted by the Town Clerk.

Finally Cr Dow moved for a ten-minute adjournment to allow tempers to cool.

After returning Cr Riggs then moved an adjournment for a week to allow the Town Clerk to get out all items of expenditure for consideration, but this was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Cr Bevan then moved Mr Voumard be made a casual hand with preference when there was work to be done.  Carried.

Cr Sampson said the Electric Supply Co. was already giving a price reduction and if they acted quietly they might be induced to do more.

Mayor: Ranger and Poundkeeper cost £36 p.a. for a return of £2.

Clerk: Poundkeeper gets 7/6 a week plus poundage fees.  Council gets the fees from the Ranger.

Cr Sampson thought the Ranger worth all he got for the abuse he received, but he thought the Poundkeeper overpaid.

Clerk: It would take about a month to terminate his appointment.

The Poundkeeper is to be approached about some accommodation.

The Mayor said the Ranger was paid for 2 days a month at 10/6 a day.

Cr March thought a reduction was possible.

The Town Clerk thought that for night work he was not overpaid.  No action.

The Mayor then sought to reduce the Town Clerk’s salary.

The Town Clerk said they had an agreement requiring six months notice of termination or change to salary.

The Mayor thought £274 p.a. too much for two days a week five hours a day (plus the assessment).

The Town Clerk said he worked five days a week.  The two days were merely the office hours.

Cr Riggs moved that the Town Clerk be given six months notice.

Then an altercation erupted with some heat.

The Mayor offered 10/6 of his own for a solicitor to interpret the agreement with the Town Clerk.

Eventually Cr Sampson moved that the rate be left at 2/3, as a 1d cut would reduce income by £60 and they couldn’t afford that.
