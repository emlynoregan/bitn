Fire.  The Burra fire maniac has struck again and on Saturday c. 10.30 p.m. he tried to burn down W.J.C. Ewins drapery in Commercial St.  Luke Day raised the alarm and the crowd from the picture show was soon there.  The rear verandah and lean-to were ablaze and the shop roof was burning so the worst was feared.  The thick smoke and the high fenced small yard made access difficult.  Had the fire got a firm hold on the shop probably the whole block would have gone from Miss Snell’s corner.  There is still no fire fighting equipment in Burra.  After much effort the fire was extinguished.  Two or three of the workers were much affected by smoke and the hard-working M-C Queale was rendered unconscious and had to be treated by Dr Steele.  Though recovering, he still feels the effects.  He was overcome trying to get to the books.  That it was the work of an incendiary is undoubted.
