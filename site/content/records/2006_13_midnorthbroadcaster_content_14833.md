Queen’s Birthday Honours

Two Mid-North identities have been appointed members of the Order of Australia; Jessica Dames of Burra and Robert Ashby.  Jessica Dames has been honoured for her services to arts administration through the Independent Arts Association and as a supporter for emerging artists and writers and the promotion of cultural events.  In the 1980s she was governor and SA chairman of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust.  When this was disbanded she formed the Independent Arts Foundation.  Mrs Dames also started the IAF Clare Valley Movie Club, held at the Blyth Theatre and has been a committee member of the SA Living Arts (SALA).

Robert Ashby of Hallett has been recognised for his service to the merino sheep breeding and wool growing industry, particularly through executive roles in professional organisations.  He has been president of the Federation of Merino Breeders since 2010.

[A list of positions held is printed for both recipients with photos of both.]
