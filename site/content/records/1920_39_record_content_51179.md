‘Lest We Forget’ writes ironically congratulating the Mayor T.H. Woollacott on his recent letter criticising the lack of support for Empire Day observance at the school and saying wryly: ‘I do believe there was a time when His Worship was not in accord with public men airing their views through the Press.’
