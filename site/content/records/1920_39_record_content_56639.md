Threadgold’s.  South* of the Burra Mongolata Syndicate near the surface a vein of crushed quartz and mullock was followed down on a very flat underlie south for 30 ft, but no values were found.  The shaft is being sunk deeper in an effort to pick up another leader.

[*The 1978 Department of Mines & Energy Map shows Threadgold’s immediately north of Burra Mongolata & south of Mongolata South.]
