Burra DC

Chairman Mr J. McMahon said the Burra DC would still be viable if parts of it were annexed to Hallett.  Comments to the contrary were just figments of someone’s imagination.  His response followed hearings of the Local Government Advisory Commission in Pt Pirie last week.  The Council’s debt represented 23.15% of its rate revenue and as far as he was aware in SA only Laura DC had a smaller debt.  The areas wishing to join Hallett represented 22.4% of Burra’s rate revenue, which would affect it, but not destroy its viability.  He said the main reason the area wished to secede was because of the condition of roads.
