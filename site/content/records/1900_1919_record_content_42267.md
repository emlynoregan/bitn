Obituary.  Mr W.S. Thomson, the manager of the National Bank died suddenly on 21 June.  He was recovering from severe gastritis, but collapsed in the street while talking to Dr Ashton who was visiting Burra.  The latter at once sent for Dr Steele and the patient was sent to hospital, but died two hours later from a cerebral haemorrhage.  He was aged 54 and had been manager in Kooringa for c. 5 years.  He came to SA about 32 years ago from Scotland.  At his death he was Vice-President of the Institute.  He leaves a wife, three sons and one daughter.  Mr M. Thomson is gaining station experience in the North, Charles is in the bank at Gladstone and George is fighting in the Dardanelles.  [Wyville Smythe Thomson.]
