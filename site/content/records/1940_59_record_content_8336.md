Carol Singers will, as for the past two years, go around the streets of Burra on Christmas Eve.  If the shops are open, this will take place on Monday next the 22 December.  Those who can sing should assemble at St Mary’s Church at 8 p.m.  Participants are invited to supper at the Rectory at the conclusion of the carols.  Any money collected will go to the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.
