8 November

Martin Kennedy was charged with being drunk and disorderly and assaulting Sergeant Reid.  He was fined 5/- on the first charge and 10/- for the assault.

Mr Fitzgerald applied to the court for a warrant against the Copper Co. for £22-10-0 in accordance with the Bench’s ruling of 3 November.  Mr Grant, for the Copper Co. said he had been asked to say by Mr Ewbank that the money would be paid as soon as the wood had been weighed.  Mr Fitzgerald said the effect of such a compromise would be to nullify the previous decision.  His Worship doubted he could grant the warrant in the absence of the other JP who had made the judgement.  Mr Fitzgerald read out the clause of the Masters and Servants Act that said the warrant could be granted by any JP.  Dr Bull said he preferred that the matter stand over to the next day.

Mr Fitzgerald had no objection as long as the Bench would inform Mr Ewbank that they could not entertain his proposal and that unless the Money was paid by Monday they would be obliged to grant the warrant of distress.  Dr Bull said he would consult his brother Magistrate and Mr Grant would be instructed to reply to Mr Ewbank’s message.
