Burra Roll of Honour.  The final little bit to complete the work is proving most difficult.  A few pounds were needed for a guard rail and to complete the roll of those killed in action, requiring some 40 names to be written.  The guard rail has been erected and in all some £20 is still required.  About £70 of promises has not been redeemed and perhaps those people could forward at least a portion of their pledges.
