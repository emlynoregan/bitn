The Season.  Some local farmers are saying the drought is the worst in their lifetimes.  Richard Riggs owns and manages 8,900 ha of land north and east of Burra with his wife Jen and son Tom and he says this is the worst drought in the past 40 years.  The local water table is starting to dry up.  Upon recently re-equipping a bore that had not been used for 15 years, the static level had fallen from 43 ft to 100 ft.  Don Villis at Hallett says the 1982-83 drought was worse and he has plenty of water at 80 to 190 ft.  Farmers selling stock have forced the prices down by 60% and slaughter rates for sheep and cattle are up.  [Photo of Richard Riggs in a dry dam.]
