Another factor is the need for a clinic for the Doctors.  Research has found that the present Burra Burra District Council Office is the ideal site and size for the clinic.  The opportunity has therefore been taken to negotiate its sale.  When the Burra Mine was re-opened the royalties were set aside for purposes of this nature and relocation of the Council can be largely financed from this source and the sale of the existing offices.
