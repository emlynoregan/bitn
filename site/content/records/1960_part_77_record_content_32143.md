Bowls

Burra Blue104 defeated Saddleworth Blue 67

Burra Green 94 defeated Saddleworth Gold 98 [sic: but adding up the figures confirms the two totals as given and thus this should read Saddleworth Gold 98 defeated Burra Green 94.]

The same problem occurred in the following results, which thus should read Clare Blue 96 defeated Burra Gold 73.

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club fired a round over double 75 yards.  Best scores were from R. Angel, M. Thomas & P. Mengersen.

The Mt Bryan East Area reports rising grasshopper numbers.
