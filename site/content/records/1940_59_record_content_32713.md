Burra Hospital Board decided on Friday to buy a new Watson-Victor X-ray machine at a cost of over £500 (with accessories) and a washing machine for £200.  The present X-ray machine is obsolete and cumbersome.  The Government has agreed to a £ for £ subsidy if the money is raised by public subscription.  The Board so far has £65 towards the washing machine (£130 with Government subsidy).  The new X-ray machine will be portable while the old one certainly is not.
