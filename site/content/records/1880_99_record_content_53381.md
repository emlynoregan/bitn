Frederick August Mann’s evidence confirmed the above account.

Carl Petergelt [sic] said he was sitting sewing when Hilda entered.  After a couple of minutes she took up the gun and asked if it was loaded, he said ‘very likely’.  He kept on sewing without looking at her and then the gun went off.  He picked her up and sat her on a box and went to tell her parents.

The verdict was that the death was purely accidental.

[Neither birth nor death appear to have been registered.]
