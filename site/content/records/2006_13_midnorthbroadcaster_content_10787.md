The Barton Hill Ram Sale at ‘The Gap’ last Tuesday resulted in a complete clearance of the 100 rams offered.  The average was a new stud record of $1588 and the top price was $6800.  Owners David & Jo Gebhardt said the sale reflected the optimism in the industry and the exceptional seasonal conditions.  There is a strong demand for big, plain bodied Poll Merinos.
