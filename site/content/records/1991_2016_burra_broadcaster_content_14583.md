Burra-Morgan Road.  The initial seal was completed on Monday this week.  Contractors are now commencing the final seal, hoping to reach from Burra to the Robertstown turn-off by Christmas.  The whole project is now due to be completed by the end of February 1998.  Originally the project was due to be completed by 2001.
