Obituary.  Mr Cecil Beckwith of Mt Bryan died on Thursday in Dawes Road Hospital after a short illness.  He was the only son of Mr Thomas and the late Mrs Beckwith and had lived all his life at Mt Bryan.  As a lad he was educated there and was dux of the school.  He later worked with his father on their property at Mt Bryan where they farmed and carried on Merino Stud breeding.  At the outbreak of WWII he enlisted in the AIF and went to Malaya with the 8th Division where he was taken prisoner by the Japanese and was for 3½ years a POW and worked on the Burma Railway.  He was one of the first POWs to be repatriated after the war.  He took over the property from his father and built up ‘Rose Park’ Stud into a very successful business.  He was a keen cricketer and played both before and after the war for the Mt Bryan team; in one innings scoring over 200 runs.  He also played in the Country Cricket Carnival for the Mokota Association.  He was a popular and respected citizen who took a keen and active interest in the social life of the district.  He was a member of the Mt Bryan Soldiers’ Memorial Hall Committee, Secretary of the School Committee, a Member of the Methodist Church Trust and Secretary (in turn) of the Hallett District Schools’ Sports.  He worked hard for Legacy and for the past two years was President of the Burra RSL and had been on the committee for a number of years.  140 cars attended the funeral at the Burra Cemetery on Saturday and over 140 RSL members formed a guard of honour.  He is survived by a wife, his daughter Ann and son Peter.
