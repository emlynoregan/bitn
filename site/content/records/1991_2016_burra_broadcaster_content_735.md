The BBH Football Club Season in Review

BBH finished the [‘A’ Grade] season with the wooden spoon.  They won only one game out of 17 in the year.  While there were many factors in this unsatisfying result, a principal problem was the lack of big men around the ground, especially in key attacking and defending positions.  A disturbing aspect of the NEFL is the dominance of just two sides, North Clare and BSR.  The remaining four sides struggle to keep in touch with those two.

The ‘B’ Grade side scored three wins and 14 losses.

Senior Colts ended the minor rounds second place and hopefully will play in the final.

The Junior Colts end the season in third place, but were eliminated by North Clare in the 1st semi-final in a game played in atrocious conditions.
