Letter.  John Monfries writes at considerable length to complain about the noise and dust caused by road trains illegally using Turner’s Depot at the bottom of Cooper Street.

The Editor adds the comment that at the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC approval for road trains to use Taylor and Cooper Streets south of the saleyards was revoked.  Hi-Speed Trucking has been notified of this, but ordinary semi-trailers still have access to the depot.
