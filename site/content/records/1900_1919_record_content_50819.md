History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr No. 1

Initially problems were not great, but as the workings deepened water became a difficulty and four water whims were kept running day and night to keep the water level down and this led to the ordering of an engine.  40 bullocks dragged the parts of it to the mine.  The engine house was built to suit the engine, but it was unfortunately sited.  In the first three years they produced 10,000 tons of copper and realised £700,000 and it was equally productive in the next three years to 1851.  The first setback was the loss of men to the Victorian goldfields and the works ceased and the engine fell idle, allowing the mine to be flooded.

When they came to restart the pump the building was found to be crushing the shaft out of the perpendicular and twisting it.  The house cracked and another shaft and engine were needed.  Even then they positioned its replacement on similarly honeycombed ground and this No. 2 engine (Schneider’s) began to show similar signs of collapse.  The third attempt was Morphett’s on solid ground.  Developmental work was not carried out and any signs of it were stopped by the directors on visits.  The proper management of the mine was hampered by these men, who knew nothing of mining or its requirements.
