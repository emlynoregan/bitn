W.H. Hardy writes to say he is not surprised at the comments the editor made about him in the last issue.  It is only natural since they have such opposite views.  He says the editor is known to be a supporter of those with large purses and would naturally seek to silence a voice supporting the poor and oppressed.  Hardy alleges that the editor altered his letters to make them more vulgar, and then complains of it!

The paper printed: ‘A person who cannot see any further than the flaps of his own trousers.’

Hardy says he wrote ‘ . . . the flaps of his own pockets.’

He accuses this temporary editor of taking a ‘dirty mean advantage’. 

The Editor then comments on what he calls ‘This unique production which we insert in all its vulgar integrity.’ And which he says would speak even more for itself if printed as it was spelt.  He denies utterly any accusations of revenge or the other coarse insinuations of the writer.
