Burra Waterworks

The former lease expired 31 December 1891.  The Government granted a seven year renewal at 5% on the capital cost.  In the year a new Cornish boiler with Galloway tubes and fittings was installed and a new boiler house erected for it.  This will avoid the inconvenience experienced last year from leakage of the old boiler.  I recommend the purchase of spare driving wheels to save delays in the event of breakage.  The plant is now in fair condition and the engineer, Mr Littlejohn, has proved himself a capable officer and discharged his duties with ability.  The water supply has been extended and the assessments now number 467.

The capital account is now £7,842

Income for the year from rates	£441-15-8

Meter charges		£96-4-4

Materials sold		7-9

Cash in Bank		£140-0-8
