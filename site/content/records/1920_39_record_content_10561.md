Bull Trouble.  On Wednesday Ben Hill brought in three bulls from Gum Creek and placed them in G.C. Kuchenmeister’s paddock at the south end of Kooringa.  On Thursday one became frenzied, knocked down a fence and headed for town.  It got into Lower Thames St and thence into Warner’s paddock in the Burra Creek behind the Bowling Green where Mr Kuchenmeister had a few shots at it.  The bull settled in safely for the night and when approached at dawn it again made off towards Aberdeen.  A driver of a dray on the road tried to head it off, but was tossed.  Eventually Ben Hill managed to paddock the beast and it was despatched.
