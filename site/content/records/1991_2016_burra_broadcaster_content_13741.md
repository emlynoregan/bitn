Letter.  Anthony Thorogood writes in response to Vincent Burke’s rather pessimistic view of the decline of the town and district.  He sees it more as a readjustment to changing circumstances.  People are travelling longer distances to shopping complexes.  Population statistics don’t take into account weekenders and so make population decline seem worse than it is in reality.  There is opportunity in Burra for a varied mix of ‘New Age’ tourist businesses.  Burra is readjusting rather than dying.
