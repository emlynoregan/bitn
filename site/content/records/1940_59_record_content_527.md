Burra Town Council

Burra Swimming Pool

The Town Council received a letter from the Under-Treasurer granting an extension of time re the swimming pool of three months.  No further extension is possible, but permission has been granted to spend the £400 loan on other public works.

A letter from the Swimming Pool Committee refusing to hand over their funds of £150 except under certain conditions.

The Mayor said that with £550 in hand and the support of the Seaside Committee he felt a pool equal to Tanunda’s could be built.  If the Swimming Pool Committee handed over their £150 it would go ahead according to the plans submitted when the £400 was borrowed.

The Pool Committee had three choices:

Build with the cash in hand

Return the money that had been donated

Give the £150 to the Council with which to build the pool

Cr Robinson said the Council had given 12 months for the Committee to raise money and three years had passed.

The Mayor said he had no intention of building a stone pool as mentioned by the Pool Committee.

The £2,000 proposal of the Pool Committee was without electricity for lighting and without water brought to the pool.  It was impossible.

A letter from the Pool Committee was received and a reply sent saying that if the money was not handed over the Council would have to consider spending the £400 loan on other public works.
