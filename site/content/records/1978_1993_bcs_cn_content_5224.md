Burra Yacht Club

The distribution of profits for 1981 has been decided:

It was decided to fund community developments rather than sporting clubs because the latter have their on ongoing fund raising activities.

$1,000 was invested until details are decided and other funds raised for a toilet on the eastern bank of the creek.

$500 was invested towards bringing an attraction to Burra next year.

$25 each went to St John Ambulance, Burra Hockey Club and Community News.

$385 was given to help establish a fortnightly bus service to help Senior Citizens do their shopping.
