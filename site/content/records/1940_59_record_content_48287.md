Burra Town Council is to seek to have the road from Sara’s Corner along Young St to the Main North Road placed on the Main Roads Schedule.  At present the designated Main Road is along Morehead St to the Bon Accord Corner and then to the Mt Bryan Road.  The suggested road is certainly the more heavily used.
