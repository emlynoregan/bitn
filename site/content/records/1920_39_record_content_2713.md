Burra High School Social Evening was held in Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall to celebrate the end of year break-up.  Old scholars were invited as were parents, though for reasons best known to the students the latter were conspicuously absent.  Headmaster J. Biddle wished this first reunion well and hoped to establish an old scholarsâ€™ association.  Exam results are printed.
