Elders Pastoral held their centenary market in Burra on 25 November when 26,000 sheep were penned for the occasion.  Eldersâ€™ State Manager Lindsay Wapper gave a short address outlining the history of Elders in Burra.  A copy of the advertisement for the first sale was displayed.  Mr Tom Rogers, manager of Elders Pastoral Livestock Department started the auction dressed in nineteenth century clothing and started the call in pounds shillings and pence.  As was the custom last century when new yards were used for the first time a hat was presented to the first buyer.  Two further hats were presented later in the day.  [Photo.]
