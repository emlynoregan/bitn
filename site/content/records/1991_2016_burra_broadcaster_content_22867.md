Thorogoods Farmhouse Cider was opened by the Deputy Premier Rob Kerin on 13 July 1999.  In 12 months Thorogoods have sold double the quantity in their original business plan.  They have appeared in the TV programs ‘Landline’ and ‘Postcards’ and have outlets in Adelaide and Victoria.  They hope soon to have others in Queensland.  The business has a new name: Thorogoods of Burra, Makers of Fine Apple Wine and Vintage Cider.  They plan to turn Misty Morning into a truly handcrafted, bottle fermented, Méthode champenoise cider.
