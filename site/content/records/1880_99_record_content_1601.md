2nd leader on the need for a new railway station.  The temporary Burra Railway Station has done duty for long enough and cost perhaps no more than £300 to £400.  There is no suitable waiting rooms or anything else.  Refreshment provisions are no more than a table on the platform.  Even for such wretched provision the railways get £65 p.a., which is enough to pay interest at 5% on £1,300.  The urinals are almost in full view of persons arriving at the elevation of a cart.  The platform has never been flagged and all is ‘miserly, incomfortable [sic] and insufficient.’

It is time a new station was built.  A splendid station has been built at Gawler recently and Riverton has thoroughly good and substantial refreshment rooms and many far less busy stations have facilities at least equal to that at Burra.  To the north facilities with every convenience are to be built at Yongala, Petersburg, etc.
