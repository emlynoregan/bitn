Burra Town Council

A. Harris’s tender to fence ground for tree planting at 3/10 per foot per post, wire netted with 2” mesh was accepted.

Burra Waterworks will proceed as soon as possible.

Ten people were granted the right to plant street trees having undertaken to water and care for the same.

The tree guard contract has been extended to 150.

The Burra Football Club was granted the use of the Recreation Ground on Saturdays for half the gate money on any occasion when a charge is made.

The Corporation cannot spend money on a pavilion etc. until their own terms with SAMA are finalised.  Gate money is only to be charged with the permission of the Mayor.
