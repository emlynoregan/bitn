Characteristics of the 1908 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements both local and other.

Page 2.

Smaller advertisements, sales notices, public notices.

Editorials are rare.

News items are annoyingly mixed with paragraphs of advertising matter, posing visually as news.

Page 3.

The news and advertising mixture continues.  The ‘Short & Sharp’ column is not as cryptic as its earlier forerunners, but is sometimes annoyingly brief.  News items are not generally followed up and there seemed little attempt at journalism.  Sport is badly reported.  Football for example is mentioned inconsistently and when it is mentioned the scores are generally omitted.  Clearly if the club did not send in results the paper didn’t follow up.  This page also carries reports from Broken Hill and other country centres in the district and state.  Such evidence as the editor lets slip from time to time suggests a politically conservative view.  For example he never analyses why men might be going on strike, but is always against such action.  Holder had earlier outline reasons for such behaviour, even if he was against the action.

All in all the local news is fairly well covered, but some things slip through and there is little that is controversial and little evidence of a firm editorial hand.
