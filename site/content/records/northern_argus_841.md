Market Square.  A group of members of the Burra Preservation Society waited by the Tourist Office on Friday for the arrival of a Channel 4 news crew who were to do filming about the controversy over the redevelopment of the square.  The society has called a meeting in the Civic Centre on 6 March at 8 p.m. to report on progress on the question.
