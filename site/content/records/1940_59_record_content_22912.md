A fireworks display was held outside, while the hall was prepared for dancing and a big bonfire was lit.  Mrs E.E. Edwards kindly provided the fireworks display.  Dancing commenced at 10 p.m., with Darrell Fieldâ€™s Band providing the music.  Supper was served and later, at about midnight several carloads of people arrived from Burra and Hallett, anxious to continue their celebrations, taxing the Hall to its utmost.
