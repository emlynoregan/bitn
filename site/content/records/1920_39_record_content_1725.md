The Prince of Wales’ visit to Adelaide and the Burra Cheer-up Ladies Band

On 12 July for the official welcome at the Adelaide Town Hall the band was provided with a decorated platform and they shared honours with the Glenelg Band.  They managed very well, but unfortunately just as the Prince was getting out of his car the platform was rushed by the crowd and collapsed on the last note of God Bless the Prince of Wales.  Fortunately, though it caused a sensation none of the girls was hurt.

On Monday afternoon they played from the balcony of the Criterion Hotel.

On Thursday morning they played at the War-Workers’ Welcome Demonstration held at the Exhibition with a rehearsal at 10 a.m. and the show at noon.  At the end of the music at the end of the ceremony the Prince asked for Trix Pearce the secretary and organiser to be presented to him.  In the afternoon they were shown over the Town Hall by the Lord Mayor to see the glorious decorations for the two balls given in honour of the Prince.

On Wednesday they had passes for the Prince’s ship, the Renown, and had an enjoyable day on the dreadnought.

On Sunday 11 July they took part in the Violet Day service at the Anzac Arch near the Cheer-up Hut.  This was the final public appearance of the Band, which never thought it would be on such an occasion or that it would win such personal approbation from the Prince of Wales.
