Jill Polkinghorne

Was educated at Adelaide Girls High School.

Trained as a teacher and taught at Point McLeay Aboriginal Mission Station and Rose Park Primary before marrying.

Moved to Burra with husband and three children in 1977 after working for almost 8 years in Africa.

Burra has a community enriched by history and community spirit and I see the possibility of serving on Council as an opportunity to make my contribution for the townsâ€™ residents.

In particular I feel women in the Burra area do need to be represented at Local Government level.

I have a strong belief that Councils represent people and if elected will visit as many homes as possible to find out the views and ideas of residents.
