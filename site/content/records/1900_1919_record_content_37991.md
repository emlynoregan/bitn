Mr Homburg MP was being driven to Emu downs by E.W. Crewes to address the Liberal Union social.  14 miles down the road Mr Crewes took a wrong turn in heavy fog and on a bad road he ended in a waterhole and broke a wheel.  They had to walk four miles through mud to pick up a buggy to complete the journey and only got back to Burra at 3 a.m. in a borrowed spring dray.
