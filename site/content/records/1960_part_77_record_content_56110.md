The Art Display at the RSL Hall in Burra on Friday drew a steady stream of visitors.  Ron Kellock’s display of gemstones, minerals and Aboriginal artefacts created much interest.  His display of malachite was a highlight for many.  The works by eleven of Mr Len Bence’s students were also impressive and the Floral Art Group gave a fine display despite the wild winds of the recent past.
