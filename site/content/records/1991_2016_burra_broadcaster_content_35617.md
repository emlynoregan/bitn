Mt Bryan Expedition

14 December 2004 was the 165th anniversary of the Governor Gawler-Charles Sturt expedition to the River Murray and Mt Bryan.  On the occasion homage was paid to Henry Bryan who died on or about 14 December 1839.  [There follows about ⅓ page article giving an account of the expedition and of memorials to Henry Bryan, by Graeme McVitty.]

On Tuesday 14 December 2004 there was a service in Henry Bryan’s memory and his soul was laid to rest by Rev. Alex Store.  A plaque was unveiled by Peter Bryan, a family descendant, on the Sampson Well Road, just off the main Morgan-Burra Road.  On Bartsch’s Hill near the Northwest Sub-station the Mt Bryan plaque was unveiled.
