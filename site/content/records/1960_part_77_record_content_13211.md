Burra Town Council

Council is to inspect the section of Thames St required by H. Quissner [sic: Queissner?]

In reply to Mr R.M. Reed the Clerk will write to Mr Reed saying they consider Mr Jeffery has acted in good faith on the word of the previous Town Clerk and they consider that Mr Reed has access to the back of his property by way of Jessie Street and they would require further explanation from him of why Anne Street needs to be open.

The estate of E.T. Rooke was given permission to demolish an old house.

The Clerk will write to the Highways and Local Government Department giving the Council’s views that, with the advent of Grain Silos at Burra, it would be better for the [Bon Accord] bridge to be reconstructed, rather than open Young Street as the main road.

The Clerk will write to the Attorney General about the old portion of the cemetery, asking how old graves must be and what procedure must be followed when reclaiming.

M.E. & E.M. Mitchell will be permitted to open a new pit in the Council’s Mine area and pay 1/- per yard royalty on all rubble excavated.
