ABC Documentary on Burra

When Burra was set up in 1845 it was Australia’s first mining town.*  Early Burra was a fascinating study of how a community’s dependence on natural resources affects its economic role, structure, location, demographic and social characteristics.  The documentary was able to use much surviving heritage to tell the early story.  The account then takes in the transition from private mining town to a self-governing rural service centre and how people dealt with that transformation.  More recently the town, in common with many other rural centres, has faced rural recession.  The ABC crew of five spent six days in Burra to make the film and also spent time on rural properties.  The documentary will air on 21 October.

[*This claim is hardly justified.  Before 1845 coal had been mined in several places in NSW, what is now Queensland and in Tasmania.  Even if the claim is for metal mining, Kapunda was mining copper more than a year before Burra started.]
