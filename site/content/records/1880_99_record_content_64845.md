[Personal interest:

In the flower section Miss Fuss won prizes for a buttonhole and a ladyâ€™s spray, but who was Miss Fuss?  In the art section Miss L. Fuss won a prize for freehand drawing, but who was this Miss L. Fuss and was she the same as the Miss Fuss with the flowers?

Muriel would have been 16 so might have been Miss Fuss perhaps.

In the school class section Hilda Fuss appears with a 2nd for drawing and also for poetry.  M. Fuss (Myrtle) won for large handwriting in Class III and the R. Fuss who won for ornamental text was probably L.R. Fuss.]
