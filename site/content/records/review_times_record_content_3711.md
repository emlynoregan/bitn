The ‘Burra Barrow Birds’, who won $100 as the only women’s team to complete the 1985 Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push, have donated an electric barbecue to the town.  It will be unveiled with a suitable plaque on Sunday.  They were also given an extra $500 by the Retravision Boilers, a Broken Hill team of men aged over 40, and this also went towards the barbecue.  Mr S. Woolley for the Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push Committee said the event would become bi-annual and there would be no push this year, although plans were underway for one in 1988.
