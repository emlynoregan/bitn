John Faint of The Waterloo and District Concerned Citizens Group writes contending that there needs to be much more consultation on wind farms.

‘The Waterloo wind farm has proved to be a disaster socially, environmentally and now we have unacceptable noise levels to contend with.’

‘Only selected residents from the area were invited to attend the opening by the Premier on February 17, thus shielding Mr Rann from the issues he should have been told about.’

‘The community day on February 19, while well attended noticeably lacked actual locals who certainly don’t have reason to celebrate.’
