Burra Burra DC.

The new heritage style cottage, office and kiosk arrived at the caravan park on 24 October.

The Burra Community Activities Centre, formerly the Aberdeen Football Clubrooms, will be completed by 9 November.  The $127,000 project, which has seen the renovations done by D.T. Jacka & Co. with various sub-contractors, will accommodate Day Care, Senior Citizens, Red Cross and Community Groups.  The architect for the renovations has been Council’s Heritage Advisor, Douglas Alexander.  The Hon. Don Hopgood, Minister for Family and Community Services, has been invited to open the building on 15 February 1991.

On Friday 26 October the Burra Burra DC was the successful bidder at the auction of the Australian Telecommunication Building on Smelts Road.  It will be occupied by Burra CFS and used by them and other units in the district for training and communications.  Council has received a grant of $10,000 from the CFS Board and $15,000 from the St John Ambulance Board and the Council will contribute $16,000.  St John’s will now occupy the entire building on Market Street and a long term lease will be arranged between the Council and the St John Ambulance Board.
