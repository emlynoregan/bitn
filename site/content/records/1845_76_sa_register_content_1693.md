A poor maniac has been travelling about warning the colony of a visitation of famine and pestilence as a judgement from God as revealed in a vision.  He began in March and has travelled north to the Burra Burra Mine and is now travelling south again, going from house to house.  He claims to have covered 60,000 miles.
