A letter from Francis S. Dutton, Acting Commissioner for SA [London].

The magnificent display of SA minerals has excited great admiration, both as regards to the specimens from mines and from private collections, particularly those of Dr Maurau, Dr Englehardt and Mr Rollison.  Considering how rare these specimens have become and how many years it has taken to accumulate them, it is a pity that our museum has not acquired them so that they might be sent back to Adelaide after the exhibition.  I would respectfully submit that the committee consider acquiring them, especially as, much as they are admired, I doubt that their owners will be offered as much as the value they place upon them.  The large specimen of malachite owned by Mr Crabb is greatly admired.

The reaping machine of Messrs Mellor & Sons has also excited much attention.  The malachite table contributed by J.B. Graham is superb.  It was made from Burra malachite by Messrs Hall and sons, stonecutters.  There is also a huge block of copper ore from the Cornwall Mine.

The photographic views have been neatly framed and glazed and we proposed to return them to the colony at the end of the exhibition unless we find purchasers at their full value or unless the committee directs otherwise.

[The letter continues with details of the SA Court at the exhibition and of some of the distinguished visitors to it; including the Prince of Prussia and the Duke of Newcastle.]
