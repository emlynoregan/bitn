Burra Races, Saturday 22 January

The day was very hot.  Over the past year the grandstand has been increased by 50%.  The tot has been modernised and 40’ added to it and a ladies’ tote provided.  The saddling paddock has been doubled in size with 32 new horse stalls to make 80 covered stalls in all and various other lesser improvements have been made.  The stakes totalled £455.  There was a large attendance and the gate was £223.  Special trains ran from Adelaide and Peterborough and were well patronised, though the Adelaide one was half an hour late.  Total revenue for the club was £306.  The Burra Cup (£100) was won by J.J. Billings’ Our Artillery ridden by Pearson.
