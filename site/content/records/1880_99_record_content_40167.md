Local Board of Health Inspection, last Wednesday covered:

Burra Railway Station, where the urinals were found to be a disgrace and the drain nearly saturated with disgusting filth and quite foul.  The baggage office was quite unsatisfactory.  It is really the booking office and whatever filth is forwarded by rail finds its way into this room.

Redruth Gaol had two occupants and everything was clean and tidy both inside and in the garden.

Redruth Police Station and Courthouse.  The former was in good condition, but the cesspit at the latter was very bad.

Misses Rabbich’s School, conducted in the old German Chapel, was satisfactory.  There were 73 on the roll and attendance was 60.

Mrs McLagan’s School [Bleak House] was also satisfactory with 20 on the roll and c. 16 present.

St Joseph’s School was satisfactory with an attendance of c. 40.
