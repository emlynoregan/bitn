The Mayor would.  Cr Radford said it should never have been out of Council hands.

The mayor was in favour or re-erecting Deadman’s Bridge and borrowing money to do it.

Cr McWaters concurred.

Crs McBride and Lane thought it would have to remain as it was under the circumstances and Cr Killicoat thought the same until the bridge at Gully’s was re-erected.
