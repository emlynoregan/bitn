Burra District Quilters have again held a successful exhibition at the Burra Art Gallery.  Door takings were over $1,000 and half goes to the Gallery, while the rest goes to the Children’s Cancer Fund.  The Viewers’ Choice Winner was Pauline Miller from Booborowie for ‘Safe Haven’, a lovely autumn toned quilt.  Joint second place winners were Marion Thamm of Burra and Angie Jamieson from Clare.
