Australian Pensioners’ League SA Ltd met recently at the RSL Hall.  Branch President, Mrs G. Eig and Secretary, Mr E. Williams, welcomed visitors from Adelaide, Mr W. Wheeler, Vice Chairman of the League and Mr J.H. Millikan JP, secretary of the league.  Mr Millikan outlined the work of the League since its formation in 1932.  Irresponsible people in the district had been saying that its benefits were not being paid.  Such people need to substantiate their claims and the Board of the League intends to take legal action if such statements persist.

[On page 2 G.G. Gregor has a public notice retracting any statements he has made ‘with reference to the status of the Australian Pensioners’ League SA Ltd.]
