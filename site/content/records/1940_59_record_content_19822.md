Kooringa Methodist Church.  A Christmas service was held on 17 December, as it was anticipated many would be away from the town at Christmas itself.  Rev. S.J. Martin was ill and Rev. A.S. Barrett arranged for Mr H.J. Stevens to step into the vacancy.  Mr G.E. Dane conducted an enjoyable musical experience.
