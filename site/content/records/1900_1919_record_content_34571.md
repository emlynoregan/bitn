Burra Musical & Dramatic Club has not been living up to its name and a meeting with Mr P. Milner (President) in the chair, has now decided to change it to simply ‘The Burra Club’ for the amusement of young men of the town.  Entrance fee is to be reduced to 5/- and subs to 2/6 per quarter.  It was decided to sell the near-new piano, which seems a shame as a concert or two in winter could wipe off much of the £50 owing.
