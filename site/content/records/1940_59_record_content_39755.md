Burra Rifle Club.  Conditions were very bad on Saturday, with the wind blowing straight up the range, with quick unpredictable changes from right or left, along with a heavy mirage and changes of light later in the day.  No rifleman managed a score over 30 for the first range of 600 yards, though things improved for the double 700 yards ranges.  This was the final shoot for the half year.  C.N. Bushell won the Coverdale Trophy for the first eight matches and R.G. Bernhardt won the Hopkins Trophy for the half-yearly aggregate.  Best with handicaps on the day were: C.N. Bushell, F. Kakoschke and M. Stockman.
