Redruth Court, 2 November.

George Rickards was charged with being the bailee of a buggy and pair of ponies being the property of W. Fletcher of the Burra Hotel.  The prisoner had hired the buggy, harness and ponies on 15 August with a promise to return them the following Saturday, but had failed.  There was subsequently an agreement to extend the hire from a month to a longer period.  On 19 August he told Fletcher at Riverton that they would be returned on 28 August.  It appears that Rickards gave possession of the ponies etc. to Godfrey at Black Rock and police enquiries found the turnout at Mannahill, where they were recovered by Fletcher, who confirmed this account.  Rickards asserted that it was his partner Godfrey who had got him into the mess.

[There is an involved story about this partnership and the court was eventually adjourned till 5 November to enable more evidence to be presented.]

When the hearing resumed Rickards produced some evidence of the agreement of Fletcher extending the hire, but Isabella Schrader, wife of George Schrader of the Terowie Hotel gave evidence that Rickards had offered the turnout to them for sale.  He left Terowie for the north, borrowing £4 with the buggy and ponies as guarantee.  He did not return and a cheque sent he sent for £4-10-0 to clear the debt was signed by Godfrey, but turned out to be worthless.

There was considerably more evidence presented over money changing hands, but eventually the bench decided there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the charge.
