RSL AGM was held 4 March with President H.G. Oates in the chair.

The affairs of the sub-branch have improved over recent years:

In 1929 they had £34-15-10 with £4-9-0 outstanding.

In 1930 they had £39-6-2 with £12-14-0 outstanding.

The appeal for TB Soldiers raised £19-1-6.

The appeal for wheat for TSAS for Angorichina will see about 30 bags railed shortly.

The annual ball was a success.

The removal from the district of W.G. Hawkes was a blow and other losses were Miss Bubb and Guy Tiddy.

The trustees of the Brandt Fund have paid over £57-7-6 and retain a balance of £85-14-1.

On the question of ‘The Guns’ the work proposed by the RSL will come up for discussion by the new Council, but no money is available unless a private source is found.

At the last annual meeting the sub-committee formed to enquire into the position of unemployed ex-servicemen received fewer than six names.  The committee will continue to urge the retention of preference for ex-servicemen when a job becomes available.  Rations of 2/6 have been given to down and out ex-servicemen passing through.

Club membership is now 72 against 66 last year.

Elected: President, R.C. Sexton (of the Savings Bank); Vice-Presidents, L.M. Gordon, W. Anderson & H. G. Oates; Secretary, G.H. Dow and Treasurer, J.F. Stephen.

Committee: D. Keynes, L.W. Kellaway, J.E. Hogan, H.J.B. Jennison, M.T. Fuller, J.O. Earle, Noel Tiver and George Powell.
