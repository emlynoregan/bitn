Tennis

Aberdeen I 10-94 defeated Kooringa I 8-81.

Kooringa Tennis Club has had considerable attention both favourable and unfavourable from members of the Town Council.  Cr Bevan in particular has made a most inaccurate discourse referring to statements he said were made by a guarantor of this club.  Neither of our guarantors has discussed tennis matters with him and certainly would not mislead him by making the statement to which he has referred.
