The Local Board of Health is concerned at the lack of action by the Education Department regarding the state of the lavatories, tanks and rooms at the Burra School.  The lavatories have been condemned for some time and tenders have been called and accepted for new buildings.  Two interviews with the Chief Secretary have produced no result.  Cr Baulderstone moved for an inspection with the Medical officer and the Inspector of the Central Board of Health on 20 March with whatever action was deemed necessary to follow.  A copy of the minutes is to be forwarded to the Chief Secretary.

Cricket.  The game concluded with a win to Burra: Burra 5 for 140 defeated Koonoona 127.

Burra Town Council, 6 March

It was resolved that Council proceed with the proposed caravan site.

Mr Booth applied for sole right to show pictures at the Town Hall.  He was advised that the present lease ran till 30 September 1950 when the matter would be considered.

P.B. Oates applied to enclose his verandah.  [Corner of East & Quarry Streets.]

Buffalo Lodge applied for the right to use the allotment opposite the Scout Hall for parking.  Granted.

The tarring of the main road has been completed.

Council will write to the War Memorial Committee asking that work at Victoria Park be expedited.

The Council has agreed to do the work of laying the new tennis court for the juvenile players at Burra North in time for the Easter Tournament with the cost to be paid for by the Aberdeen Tennis Club.

Wool Display.  To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Corporation next year the Council is considering a wool display of the new materials being produced and marketed by the International Wool Secretariat.
