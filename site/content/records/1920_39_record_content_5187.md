Football.  Aberdeen FC met on 29 August and though not agreeing with the arbiter in the Cossey case they accepted the ruling.  They reaffirmed their view that Farrell’s Flat was the best place for play-off for the premiership if needed and they cited at least four other associations that used neutral grounds for such events.

R.J. Waters writes in reply to ‘Left Wing’ saying that the trouble at the game at Aberdeen on 27 August was not the umpire, but the fact that a number of players had decided to play the man and not the ball.

T.P. Ford & R.C. Willshire (Aberdeen delegates) write asserting that having been answered in respect to the facts ‘Goalpost’ has now taken to personal attack and is not worth further response.

R.C. Willshire writes accusing ‘Left Wing’ of personal attack.

T.P. Ford writes accusing the Burra Football Association of being run on selfish grounds favouring Kooringa and complaining about the writers of complaints who are ashamed to use their names.

E.M. Cox, Secretary of the Aberdeen FC, writes promising to refute ‘Left Wing’s’ lies when he signs his name.
