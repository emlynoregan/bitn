Burra Burra DC, Thursday

$10,000 grant was received for work on the unsealed part of the Clare Road near Farrell Flat, which involves a realignment of the Clare water main.

$17,000 from the Commonwealth Government will go into general revenue.

The Golf Club has won a grant of $9,000 for work there.

The Swimming Pool planned renovations cannot proceed till after mid October, which may delay the start of the season a little.

Comment from the community is invited concerning the idea of moving the Institute Library to the new school and forming a Community Library.

The Burra-Spalding Road deputation has seen the Minister for Roads.

Trees will be planted near Booborowie Oval.

The Honda Car Club will be permitted a rally through the district in early November.
