Kooringa District Agriculture.  The season is good with wheat never looking better and sheep and cattle in excellent condition.  Destitution is on the increase, however, as the services of shepherds is dispensed with and employment hard to find.  This follows the fencing of runs into large paddocks with large flocks permitted to run at large with only a boundary rider to look after them.  After shearing has commenced labourers may become scarce and in the drier season men will be needed to help in the case of bush fires.  We may reasonably fear a few from incendiaries.
