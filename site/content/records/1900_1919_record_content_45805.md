Burra Town Council.

Cr Lane reported the fire reel was almost completed.

Re the purchase of a quarry the Hon. J. Lewis preferred to have the present matter settled before entering into anything further.

H. Roach & Sons offered a block in Graham for £100.

R.M. McBride offered two blocks in Graham for £30.

Consideration was deferred.

The Railway Commissioner replied that the fence in question had been there for 44 years and therefore it did not appear that any alteration was necessary.

The Hydraulic Engineer says there has been no shortage of water, but some pipes are corroded and need to be replaced.

The attorney General cannot see his way clear to move the Courthouse to Kooringa and the present Courthouse was undergoing repair.

The Adelaide Australia Day Committee is preparing to celebrate on 28 July and seeks co-operation.

Because there was no water in the railway trucking yards stock was being taken to other stations.  The Railway Commissioner is to be asked to install troughs.
