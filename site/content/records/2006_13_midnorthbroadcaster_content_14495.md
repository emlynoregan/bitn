Marlene Wooton was farewelled recently after 33 years at the helm of Burra Day Care/Leisure Group at a luncheon at the centre.  She has been a tireless worker and set up the Day Care at the Burra Hospital, where she volunteered for five years before becoming an employee of the Health Service.  After a name change and several locations the Leisure Group was housed in the former Aberdeen Football Club rooms at Burra North.  It became, in its day, the bench mark for SA, due to Mrs Wooton’s hard work.  In 1997, Mrs Wooton was hand picked as one of six from SA to participate in a study, which then became policy.  She has long been a strong advocate for the aged and people with disabilities and special needs.  Many volunteers have joined her over the year.  Over the years more than $75,000 has been raised towards improvements at the centre.  In 2001 Mrs Wooton received SA’s first Arthur Cys’ Medal for service to senior.  In 2010 she was a semi-finalist in the Rural Doctors Workforce Agency/Rural Community Health & Well Being Award.  In 2006 and 2009 the Burra Leisure Group were recipients of the Burra Australia Day Community Event of the Year Award.  About 50 people attended the farewell lunch.  Meryl White said grace.
