Ambulance Depot.  Following the purchase of a second ambulance for the Burra District the question of a suitable building to house the vehicles has been discussed on various occasions.  Now the Burra & District Association has invited the District EFS to join in the construction of a suitable Ambulance & EFS building to house both organisations and provide facilities for their crews.  Before this decision the Association had decided to draw up plans and specifications for an ambulance building and get estimates.  The most favoured site is on Council land adjacent to Richards Garage at Burra North.  Some financial assistance is anticipated from St Johnâ€™s Brigade Headquarters.  It is felt that Civil Defence needs might be considered at the same time and an invitation has been extended to Mr Nicholls of the Civil Defence Department to address a public meeting on the matter.
