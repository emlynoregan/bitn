Burra Cheer-up Soc.

On 13 May the Ladies’ band etc. was at the station to welcome Sgt Major C. Wiltshire, whose parents recently moved to Burra.

On 14 May the Ladies’ band etc. met the train to welcome home Courtney Pearce, Albert Bruce and Alan Bertram.

Ptes Carpenter & Fuss returned during the week, but evidently preferred no welcome should take place.  [The Fuss was probably Lyall.]
