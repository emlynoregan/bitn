Floods.  The Eastern Road is still impassable beyond Woolgangi.  Water from the north means watercourses is still flowing and all dams and lagoons are reported full.

The mail contractors deferred the Friday delivery, but have decided to ‘give it a go’ this morning.

The Morgan Road was closed for a few days after the rain.

The Burra Creek reached the Murray, but the flow apparently came from the tributaries flowing from the northeast pastoral country.  A flow of the creek from Burra to Morgan occurred about 25 years ago, when the watercourse at Florieton was about three miles wide.
