This paper cannot agree with either proposal.

The Smelts Paddock site is too small to build a large oval and it would be expensive to level.  There is also some doubt about the successful damming of the creek.

The Victoria Park site has had attempts to improve it in the past.  Attempts at improved grass and irrigation have failed in the past.  It is currently an ugly site, with a quarry and old rubbish tip behind it so it cannot be expanded in that direction and is blocked by the road from expansion in the other direction.  It is unlikely the Government would sell the drill Hall site across the road.  The oval itself is on stony ground and not readily amenable to levelling.

Before deciding on either site, the townspeople should consider the Burra Racecourse, which could become a War Memorial Project.  This site is held in trust by a Committee known as the Burra Sports Syndicate.  It was purchased many years ago by public spirited men who left it to the citizens in perpetuity.  The land is flat and the outlook picturesque.  There is room on it for two large ovals and gardens. It already has a grandstand and substantial buildings as well as tennis courts, golf links and other sporting facilities.  There is a splendid bicycle track and even at times a speedway track has been used.  The racecourse straight is well grassed and water is well reticulated.  It is in short well placed for development.

The present Committee comprises Messrs John Barker (Chairman), Frank Reed, Andrew Tennant, John Gebhardt, T.J. Ashton and M.T. Fuller as Secretary.  This splendid site is largely wasted at present.  The Racing Club uses it once a year.  It gets occasional use for football and the local team is playing there this year instead of on Victoria Park.  The cricket team also uses it.

Public funds held in Burra that could be used here amount to about £1,000.  This would go far to seeing the erection of the more substantial structures needed to develop it as a sporting centre and the fertile soil would support gardens, lawns, ornamental trees and hedges.

Burra will never have these facilities while the community is divided over other sites.

The only thing against the site is its distance from the centre of town, but many other towns have their ovals just as far out of the centre and the shortages of tyres and petrol will not last for ever.
