James B. Davison writes that in a case in the Magistrates Court on 16 January the Magistrate found the preponderance of the evidence was clearly against the defendant and imposed the lowest penalty allowed by the Act viz. £5 and £1-1-0 costs.  The cost to the plaintiff amounted to £6-10-0 so the expenses to the plaintiff were almost as much as the defendant’s costs including his fine.
