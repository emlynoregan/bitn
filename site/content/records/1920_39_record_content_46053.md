Burra Town Council, 15 May

The Taxation Dept. advises that Land Tax would be the first charge on any unclaimed allotments sold.

The Town Clerk advised that water rates would also have to be paid.

At a recent practice fire alarm the men were out of the reel house and down to the mill in four minutes.

The wards are all in credit and projections suggest the Council might end the year with a slightly favourable balance.

Various street and footpath work was approved.

Burra Benevolent Society has received £300 which was a legacy from the late Mrs Mary Thomas.  It will be placed with the National Bank for 12 months at 3%.

The Society will now have £800 at 3½% earning £24 while previously it had £500 at 5% earning £25.

[£800 at 3½% should earn £28!]

George Roger will supply wood this year, as his price was accepted.

CWA Wool Exhibition.  There was a large collection of woollen clothes, rugs etc. and a section of Antiques and special items on loan.  Mrs I.J. Warnes lent a number of items some associated with Queen Victoria.  There was a mannequin parade.  Much interest was shown in the spinning and knitting section.  A prize list is printed.
