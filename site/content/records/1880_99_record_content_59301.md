Federation: in favour and in favour of free trade between states.

Electoral Laws: Against any easing of the freehold property qualifications to vote for the LC, in favour of easing the leasehold qualifications to Crown lessees with improvements of £200and of extending the occupying qualifications to joint occupiers if their respective qualification is over £25 each.

Land Settlement: in favour of liberal land legislation to promote agricultural use of pastoral land in appropriate areas and for the sale of Crown lands.

Northern Territory: for the development of the territory and the introduction of suitable labour, for mining and pastoral development and for handing the territory over to the home government.
