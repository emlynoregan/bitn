Nathaniel O’Brien of BCS has been selected as one of 28 South Australians to perform in the 2013 Class of Cabaret at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival.  The program commenced in March and was designed for Years 10,11 & 12 students and teachers and those interested in a career in cabaret and theatre.  There have been several workshops and the ABC is making a documentary to air next month to coincide with the final performance.  The ABC came to Burra last week to film at the school before continuing on to Nathaniel’s home for more scenes and recording of some of Nathaniel’s own songs backed with harmonies from his Dad and sister.  Nathaniel will also participate in a master class with Adelaide Festival Director, Kate Ceberano in the next two weeks.

While the program includes interviews with seven students, it focuses chiefly on two; a student from Norwood- Morialta and Nathaniel, who is the only student in the group from a rural school.  [Photo]
