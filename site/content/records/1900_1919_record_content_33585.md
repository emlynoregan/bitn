Local Board of Health.

Mr Allenâ€™s place at Redruth is to be disinfected.

All householders are to be given notice to disinfect privies etc.

All cesspools at public buildings are to be condemned.

A new site for a rubbish depot is to be selected.

[A reference on page 2 suggests there had been an outbreak of infectious diseases with admissions to the hospital, but without saying what diseases.  A report on 5 February says cases of diphtheria and typhoid had been brought in from outside the town and the above might be a reaction to that.]
