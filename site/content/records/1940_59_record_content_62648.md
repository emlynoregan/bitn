Road Grants

The State Government has made £400,000 available in Special Road Grants.  Because any money received must be spent by 30 June, most Councils will be unable to make use of large grants.  The Burra Burra DC is considering getting a heavier grader to enable it to use more of the funds available.  It has 1,100 miles of roads, including 123 miles of main road.

With the Government giving preference to Councils bituminising heavily used roads, the Burra Town Council is better placed to get and use a fair share of the £400,000.  Materials account for almost two thirds of the total cost for such roads and thus getting rid of a large grant is easier.  It is likely they will seek a grant to re-bituminise the road under the railway bridge and past the ballast quarry.
