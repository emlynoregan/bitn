25 July 1855, page 3

Accident.  The Kooringa mail-cart on its way from Gawler Town to Kooringa on Friday last met with an accident.  The only passengers were a man and his wife and child and another lad were the only passengers.  At O’Leary’s public House they stopped and Mr Stanaway at the house invited the driver to have a nobbler.  While he was in the house the horses started.  The driver ran after them and succeeded in getting on the shaft, but was pulled off by Stanaway.  He then ran alongside the horses and caught the reins.  He held on with such tenacity that the horses swerved round and overturned the cart.  The woman, child and driver were bruised, but not very seriously.
