Midland Road Board.

Mr Woollacott declined to sign the contract for the Redruth Bridge and sought the return of his deposit. [He appears to cite an error in his tender of £230 as his reason, but this is not entirely clear from the report.] The Board resolved to place him on a blacklist for 12 months and to try to keep his deposit. The next best tenderer was Duncan Grant who accepted the contract when it was offered him.

Captain Killicoat reported that the culvert opposite the Roman Catholic school had diverted water and endangered the foundations. He advised a wall be constructed 20' long on condition the Corporation take it over when built. In Market Square he recommended 6 chains of road be made nearer the frontages. The surveyor is to inspect, prepare plans and present estimates by the next meeting.
