Obituary.  John Weston who died on 7 May was one of the state’s oldest colonists.  He was born in London on 26 October 1849 and with his parents Mr & Mrs John Weston came to Australia in 1853 on the Shakamaxon.  The first lived in Adelaide, later moving to Mt Barker.  At 21 he came to Burra and worked for a time in the Burra Mine.  He worked for a building contractor when the mine closed and the Kooringa Police station was one building he worked on, so was the Jamestown Hospital.  In 1879 he took land at Mongolata where he lived for about 42 years.  He had the hard life of the early settler contending with droughts, wild dogs, dust storms, rabbits etc.  Like other early settlers before the railway reached Broken Hill, he added carrying with bullocks and horse teams to his activities.  He was also for several years a member of the now defunct Mt Bryan District Council.  He retired to Kooringa in 1920 and was an enthusiastic member of the Burra Bowling Club.  He married Miss Mary Ann Hall a daughter of one of the pioneering families of Mongolata.  She died some 14 years ago.  He died suddenly from an unsuspected heart condition.  He is survived by three sons and one daughter:  W.A. [William Arthur] (Kooringa), H.J. [Harold John] (Jamestown), E.H. [Edward Henry] (Copley) & Emma (Sis) Mrs A.H. Kemble (Kooringa).  There are 13 grandchildren & 1 great-grandchild.  Mrs A. Bishop of Hanson is a sister.
