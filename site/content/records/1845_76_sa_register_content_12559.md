Kapunda News, 11 August

The English & Australian Copper Co.â€™s mule team passed through the town last week with fifty tons of copper.  I could not help comparing the copper with that produced at our smelting works; the former is dark-coloured, honeycombed, and badly shaped, while ours is even, smooth, and reflects great credit on Mr Jones, the able Superintendent of the smelting works.
