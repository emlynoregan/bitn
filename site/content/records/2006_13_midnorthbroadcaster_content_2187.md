Rosemary Opperman was presented with a 25-year service award for work with SA Ambulance as a volunteer.  She said it began with a first aid course and grew from the personal satisfaction she got from helping others.  She said her participation was greatly helped by being self-employed and having plenty of baby-sitters around when he kids were still at home.  [Photo.]
