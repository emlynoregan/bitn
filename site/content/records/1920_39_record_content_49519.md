N. Hiles Pearse writes in appreciation of Martin Pederson.  He much regrets the passing of ‘a fine old scout’ with his optimistic and cheery nature, who had started from scratch and made good.  He cannot ever remember Mr Pederson saying an unkind thing or passing a disparaging remark about any of his fellows and as a JP ‘one could imagine him giving the benefit of the doubt to “the other fellow” or the “under dog” every time’.  His breezy and descriptive talent made his yarns about his trips to his homeland at all times most interesting.  He was ‘one of nature’s gentlemen, a type of man who can ill be spared in any community’.
