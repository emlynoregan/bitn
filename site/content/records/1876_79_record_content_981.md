Inquest on the fire at Mrs Green’s Boarding House: held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel last Friday 11 August before J.D. Cave JP, with F.W. Moody as foreman of the jury.

Frances Vivian, a next door neighbour, said she was awakened by the smell of fire and the screams of a woman, between 12.30 and 1 a.m. on Friday morning.  She found Mrs Green about two yards from her back door with the back of her dress alight.  Mrs Green called out that her house was on fire and asked her to call Mr Vivian.

Mrs Vivian took her three children to a safe place and then extinguished Mrs Green’s clothes and called neighbours for help.  She did not enter Green’s house.

William Bullen, another near neighbour, was awoken by Mrs Vivian’s cries.  He and Mr Vivian entered Green’s house and saw her and a man standing close together in the back room.  The back of Mrs Green’s dress was alight.  The door and three boxes of clothing were also alight.  They threw water over the door and carried the boxes outside.  Of the two carpetbags hanging behind the door, one was consumed and the other partly burnt.  There were three men in the house whom Mrs Green said were lodgers.  Two of them were asleep in the front room and the other was standing with Mrs Green in the bedroom.

John Vivian’s evidence varied only slightly from Mr Bullen’s.

J. Drew said he and Vivian had gone into the room and looked around, but could find no clear source for the fire.  They could not wake the sleeping men and believed they were drunk.

Mary Green said she was awakened by the fire and raised the alarm.  She had retired about 10 p.m. and was sure she had put out the candle. She denied she was drunk.  On rising she had put on clothes, which she afterwards was told were on fire.  It was her bustle which was on fire – she had worn it for the last twenty years.  A bottle of brandy was brought into the house on Thursday, but there had been four to drink it.  Two women had visited on Thursday.

George Mayger said he went to Mrs Green’s house about 1 a.m. Friday and saw some boxes smouldering outside.  He met Mrs Green with her bustle on fire and the back part of her dress burnt.  He went inside, but found all had been extinguished.  He could not see any cause for the fire.

The jury’s verdict was that a fire had been caused by carelessness, through Mrs Green and her lodgers having partaken of too much intoxicating liquor.
