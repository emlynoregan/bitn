Burra Burra DC Elections will be held on Saturday 4 May with polling booths at Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan Institute, Booborowie Institute from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Burra Civic Centre.

There is concern at the small number of voters who turn out in the Burra township compared with the outlying areas.  Some outside areas record a 90% turnout, while Burra last time had only 20%.  As a result five of seven elected members are from outlying districts, which means 70% of the districtâ€™s population produces just 30% of Council representation.  You should vote; a more evenly balanced Council is in the best interests of all.
