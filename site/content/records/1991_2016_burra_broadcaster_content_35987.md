The Monster Mine.  The historic open cut will be open for the Burra Jazz in the Monster Mine event this coming Saturday night.  A crowd of several hundred is expected to enjoy the night of entertainment with feature jazz bands from Adelaide.  In days gone by the old open cut was accessible to locals and used as the local swimming pool.  [i.e. the open cut from the nineteenth century mine – before the modern mining operations of the 1970s.]  Nowadays the spectacular view from water level can only be seen by Saturday night’s crowd.  The man-made lake is as big as a football field and stays full at the natural ground water level, being 50 m deep.  The SA Diving School scoured the state for a site with more than 30 m of clear water with no interference from the weather and finally hit on Burra.  They use the venue for teaching new scuba divers.  The Burra National Trust has leased the mine site from the Council and maintains the historic sites such as Morphett’s Enginehouse and the Powder Magazine.  They have an increasing problem with the Aleppo Pines self-seeding and invading the site at an alarming rate.
