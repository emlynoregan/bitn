Accident.  Messrs Hudson & Builder were returning to Kooringa from Farrell’s Flat on Sunday at about 8 p.m. when the horse shied near the Burra Hotel.  Both gentlemen were thrown out and the cart overturned.  The horse was on his back and Mr Hudson was pinned under a rail until help arrived.  Mr Builder escaped with a shaking.  Mr Hudson has also recovered, having been protected by the ironwork of the seat-rail from receiving a fractured skull.
