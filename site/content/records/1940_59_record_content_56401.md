Vegetable entries were few, but of good quality.

Wool put on a good display, but some sections could have been more keenly contested.

Pigeons and poultry were well represented.

School exhibits were very good.

The sheaf tossing contest was won by L.C. Kaehne of Booborowie with c. 36 ft, said to be the highest for a Burra Show.

Sir George Jenkins, the SA Minister of Agriculture, opened the Show.
