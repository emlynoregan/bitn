Long Letter from R.W. Mathews on the likelihood or otherwise of Eternal Punishment.  This followed the report of a discussion on the same subject in a recent YMCA meeting.  [Mathews did not believe in it since Christ had taken away the sins of the world and brought forgiveness.  He gives scriptural references in support of his views.]
