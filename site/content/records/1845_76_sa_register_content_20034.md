Kooringa News, 27 December

Christmas Day in Burra was most disagreeable.  It began with a hot northerly wind, which increased in violence towards noon, becoming a gale, raising clouds of blinding dust.  It ceased towards evening, when it became cooler.  The public amusements were meagre, limited chiefly to tea meetings.
