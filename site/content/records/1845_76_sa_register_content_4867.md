Accident/Obituary.  On Saturday 10 August a man named Leter [sic: for Lester] left the Smelting Co. with a dray loaded with about two tons of copper bound for the Gulf.  Having imprudently decided to ride on the pole, he somehow fell off and the wheel of the dray passed over his chest, killing him instantly.  Mr Robinson of Hill River carried the news to the authorities in Burra Burra and the deceased was taken to the Burra Burra Hotel, where an inquest was held on Monday.

Obituary.  Mr Frederick Lester aged 37 died on Saturday 10 August at the Burra Burra Mines. He was the son of the late James Lester, solicitor of Ashford, Kent.  He met his death while accompanying his dray.  He was one of the oldest colonists and his death was deeply lamented by all who knew him.  He is survived by a wife and four young children.  [Name, date and aged details are confirmed by SA Deaths CD.]
