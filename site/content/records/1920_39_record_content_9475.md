Weather.  The dry spell of several weeks has ended with 109 points since last Friday.  The falls were also welcomed by pastoralists to the eats, but not by the grain farmers who were badly affected, especially in a strip from Porter’s Lagoon to Black Springs, where falls were very heavy.  At Koo-owie 3 inches fell in a little over 20 minutes and turkeys and chickens were killed by marble-sized hail.  No a drop of this fell at Koonoona, but at G.G. Hawkes’ hail up to 1½ inches in diameter fell.  The crops of W.G. Liebech, A. Mickel, E. White, J. Coon, J. Howard, J. Powell, J. Fisher and C. Escott were completely destroyed.  Falls to the east varied from 25 points at Oakbank to 186 points at Ketchowla.
