[It having been previously deferred.]

Cr Sampson was opposed – he felt it unnecessary and that the money would be better spent assisting the unemployed in winter instead of squandering it – as had been done last year.  Eventually a decision was deferred for a month.

21 water meters have been broken.  They will be repaired and legal advice re the cost will be obtained.  (Wilful breaking attracts a fine of up to £20.)

Cr Harris recommended closing the Aberdeen trough.

The meeting was adjourned when a cry of ‘Fire’ was heard.

Meeting resumed on 16 January.

There was a long discussion re the Aberdeen trough.  A decision was deferred till the town inspection.
