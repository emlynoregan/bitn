Sparks Column.

Influenza is rife in Burra.

Obituary.  A young man named Nosworthy was killed at Lucindale last week when his gun exploded while he was getting through a fence.  [Frances Edmund Nosworthy died 15 October 1895 aged 16.]

‘Outsider’ writes with tongue firmly in cheek that W.H. Hardy, W.T. Rabbich and Tommy Halls, as leading men of the town, should be sent to Adelaide as a group to greet the new Governor, Sir Fowell Buxton, when he arrives in SA.
