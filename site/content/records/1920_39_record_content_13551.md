Redruth Methodist Sunday-school.  A successful ‘sock social’ was held in connection with the Fancy Work stall at the Maypole Fair in aid of the new building, at the Jubilee Hall on Thursday.  Over 150 socks were sent out with the invitations and the admission asked was in pennies, double the size of the foot.  £8-8-0 was raised.
