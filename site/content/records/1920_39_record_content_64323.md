Redruth Methodist Sunday School held its Anniversary on Sunday last.  Three services were held.  The morning and evening services were conducted by Rev. A. Dyer and Rev J.P. Tilbrook took the afternoon service.  The usual tea meeting on Monday was well attended.  Mr M.J. Morton chaired the meeting and Secretary J.A. Reed reported a small fall in Sunday school numbers due mainly to removals.  The financial position was sound.  Various items were presented by the scholars.
