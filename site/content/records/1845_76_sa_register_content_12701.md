Comparison of two half-years:

The report for the half-year ending 30 September 1858 showed a balance of £57,435-14-11 applicable to dividends, to which must be added the profits arising from operations of 1859.

In the last six months 6,591 tons of ore were raised; 832 tons less than for the previous six months.  The estimated yield was 22-23%.  743 tons of copper sold in Adelaide realised an average of over £100 per ton.  The general quoted price in London was £107-10-0.  Unsold produce is equal to 1,358 tons of fine copper, which if sold at present rates would produce a profit of £23,531-18-11 to add to the balance from 1858 to make a gross profit of £80,967-13-10.  From this the Directors have set apart a sum of £24,640 for two dividends of 100% (£5 per £5 share) to be paid on 3 December and 3 March next.

The Captain’s reports show continued discoveries of rich ore.

Persons employed by the Association are 1,208 or 83 more than at the last report.
