Solomon Williams: Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s.  (Continued)

One day I witnessed the breaking of a chain when the kibble was nearly at the surface.  As the kibble fell it pulled the loose chain and entangled posts and pulleys and broke timbers.  Men ran in all directions to escape the falling debris.

On another occasion I saw a man kneeling by the roadway and knocking on a piece of wood with the head of a pick.  After shifting position once or twice he commenced digging a square hole, but about a foot down he holed through to reveal a man dripping with perspiration who had been boring his way up to the surface.  This was ‘rising a pass’, which was needed for ventilation and other purposes.

Another day I ran with a group and saw the head of a horse just above the ground.  It was harnessed to a loaded cart which had broken through the ground.  The horse was not hurt, but could not move because of the harness and the surrounding earth.  The men lifted it out by means of a tripod and block and tackle, leaving the mine authorities to extract the cart.

I once visited my father’s pitch.  His ‘pairs’ consisted of three men.  (A company of miners was a ‘pair’ regardless of how many were involved.) On this day there was only room for two men to work at driving through the rock rubble.  The pitch was about 20 fathoms down and reached by a ladderway down a hole about 2½ft square.  We had to descend about 120ft down a perpendicular ladder.  My father went first with a lighted candle and he told me to hold tight with my hands and to be careful my feet didn’t slip.  At the bottom we had to clamber through an old level which was half full of earth and the timbers had sunk so much that we had to crouch low or crawl.  Eventually we reached a light ahead and a man appeared and eying me asked ‘What a new man?  Are you going to shoe him?’  I later learned that this referred to a custom that when a new man joined the pair some beer was shouted all round.  At the end of the pitch in a timbered area the work was in rock needing no timber.  Here the worker took off coat, waistcoat, shirt and hat and put on a close-fitting calico cap called a hat-cap to keep dirt out of the hair.  Rock was loosened by pick and wheeled along the level to be thrown into some old workings.  It was strenuous work hour after hour.

I could only look on and think: ‘Why all this hard work?’  The answer came to me that this is his only way of providing for himself, his wife and his boys and girls.  His paternal instincts prompted him to give to his children better equipment for the battle of life than he himself ever had.  I was one of those for whom he was toiling and looking at his goodly candlelight casting long shadows on the walls he seemed a veritable giant whom I had never before seen stripped and in full physical action.  To my boyish imagination there was something I could admire, something noble, which I could almost put upon a pedestal as a hero.  When our work was done we climbed up through the old workings.  I went first, but I could see no light ahead, for it was night and we wended our way through the silent mine, past the night watchman’s cottage, up the rise and down the long gully to the town, home and sleep.

A resolution formed itself in my mind that I would never become a miner.  I have heard my father say he had worked in places where the air was so bad the candle would go out if held vertically and had to be laid on its side to keep it alight.

A fire in a mine is a time of great anxiety and often accompanied by loss of life.  Burra Mine had this experience and two lives were lost, but I never heard of its origin.  One morning at school a rumour was brought that the mine was on fire.  We were all anxious for the welfare of our fathers and many of us were allowed to go to the mine to see.  Our first act was to find our parents among the men standing about.  Many women had come for the same reason.  Smoke was coming from two shafts.  An error of judgement had been made.  Because some thought the burning timbers would lead to a collapse a suggestion had been made to tip a load of smalls down the shafts.   Tragically this generated poisonous fumes and smoke.  The men should have been got up first.
