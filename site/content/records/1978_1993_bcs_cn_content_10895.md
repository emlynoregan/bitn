Greening of the Burra District

Last seasonâ€™s activities:

Helen Reed and her helpers planted c. 6,000 seedlings on roadsides and private properties in Booborowie, Burra Mines and the town area and at Black Springs.

Clyde Atkins, daughter Marie and son-in-law Graham Harvey had excellent success with planting E. camaldulensis, E. sargentii, Casuarina glauca and Meleleuca decussata around Porter Lagoon with a 100% success rate.

Ron Piggott had 99% survival with Casuarina glauca on his property at Porter Lagoon.

Rob Neill planted 800 Casuarinas along Koonoona Rd with generally good survival, but dipping to 52% on the water-stressed higher rocky ground.

Booborowie Town Centre plantings resulted in only 90% survival despite generous watering.

North of Booborowie roadside planting survival fell to 70% in the face of depredation by mice and on private property at Booborowie where ground was not ripped and water was somewhat saline the trees grew only to c. 35 cm with about 62% survival.
