Hans Hasenfus, a 28-year-old Pole, will fly out a £3,000 Proctor Percival plane for Dr Young-Prouse of Forbes, NSW, to be used as an air ambulance.  This young new Australian was seeking a cheap way to get to Australia.  He saw service with the RAF in WWII, serving in the Middle East, Burma and Germany.  His wife, children and parents were killed in Poland during the war.  He hopes to commence sheep farming on Mr R.W. Needham’s Station at Hallett.
