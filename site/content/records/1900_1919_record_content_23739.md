Redruth Court, Monday

Frederick Neydock was charged with behaving indecently before Alice Bevan a girl under the age of 14 on 14 March.

The girl said the defendant was about 20 yards from his own house and while looking at her he behaved indecently.  She told her father who sent her out again saying he would follow and observe.  The action was repeated.  [Though on cross examination she said she didn’t look the second time and the repetition was observed by her father.]

Mr Winnall for the defence thought that this was extraordinary behaviour for the father.  He also tried to suggest that it was extremely unlikely that someone would behave in such a manner while she was with her father, but the girl insisted that he had.  He was at the time some 50 or 60 yards away.

Alfred Bevan said he was the father of Alice and recalled his daughter telling him what ‘Fred’ had done and he had sent her out again and followed her.  He saw what the defendant was doing and sang out to him ‘that will not do, old man.’  The defendant then went inside.

M-C Clarke then told the court what had happened when he interviewed the defendant.

Mr Winnall said it was quite unreasonable to suggest a man possessing any grain of sense or self respect would carry on as the girl wished the court to believe.  He suggested there was some animosity between the parties and this was how the plaintiff aimed to get even with the defendant.  For this to happen in broad daylight among houses inhabited by people was beyond all probability.  The evidence was conflicting and unreliable.

Fred. Neydock was called and said he was not guilty.  He said he was outside looking for Bill Highet because they always went for a walk on Sundays.  He said his brother Paul was only about half a yard away and his sister Mary was also nearby.  As he was going inside he had heard Bevan call out, but had not seen him.

Paul Neydock confirmed this and said Fred didn’t do bad things.

Mrs Mary Mann, sister of the defendant gave similar evidence.

Mr Winnall said it was a case of trumpery altogether.

The court decided the evidence warranted conviction and though the highest penalty was £10, they would fine the defendant £1 + £1 court fees or in default 14 days.  The fine was paid.
