Burra Community School student Annie Low recently attended the Rabobank Young Rural Leaders Summit in Canberra.  She said: This involved a series of workshops on values, leadership skills and public speaking.  There was a two night camp in a national park.  The core objective was to think of a project to bring back to our home communities.  As a member of the Youth Advisory Council in Burra, we are already in the process of setting up a youth centre and I worked on ideas for this throughout the week.  [Photo.]
