Mrs Nell Pearce has won the Burra Miss Red Cross Contest.  She and Miss Glad scroop, the other contestant, have been hard at work raising funds over the past few weeks.  In the past the Red Cross drive has seen outstanding efforts from people in Burra, but two things have resulted in a smaller sum this year, of £360.  Firstly, Burra had just completed a FFCF Drive that raised £1,160 and secondly the Centenary Celebrations Committee asked that the Red cross Drive be completed by 30 June to enable all future efforts to be made on behalf of those celebrations.  The ball on Friday night was not very well attended, but those there had a happy time dancing to the music of the Black Diamond Band.  Mrs Pearce had raised £245-4-3 and Miss Scroop £112-8-9.  The mayor congratulated both on their efforts and declared Mrs Pearce the winner.
