Park View, Burra North.  Burra Town Council has passed a motion making this the postal address for that area at the north end of Smelts Road overlooking the Burra North Children’s Playground and south to the North Ward Boundary.  [Note that the paper says Park View will terminate at Morehead St; but they meant Ludgvan St.]
