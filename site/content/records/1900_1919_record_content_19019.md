Burra Smelts.  [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.]  A company has been formed to re-smelt the tailing produced when the Burra Slag Extraction Co. crushed the large blocks of slag at the old smelts.  Assays have been encouraging and a smelter arrived from Leigh Creek last week and will soon be erected.  The process could also easily produce building blocks.  The smelter could also be used to process thousands of tons of low-grade ore on the mine site.  Some time ago an attempt was made to extract copper from this source by the magnetic process, but it failed.  Several small shows of copper near Burra could also make use of the smelter.  Some thousands of tons of material passed over by the Slag Extraction Co. could also be processed.

[Concluded on page 3 where it says all this is helped by a copper price which was over Â£100 per ton.]
