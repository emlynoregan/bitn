The Burra Dramatic Society presented De Witt’s Irish drama More Sinned Against than Sinning.  Before the curtain the President of the Institute, Mr T. Edwards, addressed the audience about the Institute’s refurbishment and their financial position.  The local press had accused them of being conservative, but he did not think they deserved that: they had wanted to see where the money was to come from before going into debt.  The improvements had cost something over £500 of which they had raised about £230.  He hoped the improvements would raise more money and so help pay off the debt.  He could not compliment them on the number of subscribers which were only about 80, but the circulation was nearly double that of any other provincial Institute in SA. The one thing he regretted was that the stage was not deeper.  The getting up of a play such as this which would take the whole evening was a thing never before attempted in Burra.

The performance passed off without a hitch.  The whole cast was good and well sustained throughout.  The performance raised about £21 for the Institute.  Mr T. Edwards afterwards entertained the cast in the lodge room.
