Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust has been awarded a grant of $6,600 to fund a Significance Assessment and Preservation Study of the branchâ€™s collection.  Leigh Fisher (Archive & Museum Manager) attended a three day intensive preservation and collection management workshop held at the National Library of Australia, The National Archives and the National Museum of Australia.  He said the grant would provide the funds and the workshop the expertise to help protect the collection and make it accessible while it remains in the local context.  [Photo of Leigh Fisher.]
