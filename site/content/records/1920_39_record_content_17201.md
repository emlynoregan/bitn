Redruth Methodist Church held special ‘Back to Burra’ services on 25 October with:

An Old Time Prayer Meeting at 7.30 a.m.

An Old Time Class Meeting at 10 a.m.

The usual Morning Service was taken by Rev. Alvey and Lady Holder gave the address to the young on ‘Temptation’ and to the older folk based on Romans 12.1

The Evening Service was taken by George Giles of Unley, an old local preacher of Redruth.

After church a further service of musical praise was held in the Memorial Hall.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was one of the soloists.]
