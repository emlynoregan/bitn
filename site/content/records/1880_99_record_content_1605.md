Sunday Closing.  The great battle was fought on Tuesday.  Mr Colton sought entire closing on Sundays, but this was lost 26-13.  The time of opening, after further votes was reduced to the hours 1 p.m.-2 p.m. and 8 p.m.-9 p.m. instead of the 1 p.m.-3 p.m. only as at present.  Mr Colton then moved that beer on Sunday not be sold for consumption on the premises, but this was lost.  A move to allow local option on hours as well as on the number of licences was also lost.
