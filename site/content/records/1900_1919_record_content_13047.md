Accident.  On the way to Martindale Races on Wednesday M-C Phelan stopped to tighten the saddle girth and his horse kicked him in the stomach, sending him seven yards.  He was picked up dazed by the occupants of a buggy and recovered enough to go on, but found walking difficult and is still very sore.
