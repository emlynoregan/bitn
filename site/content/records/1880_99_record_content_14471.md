Burra Town Council, 22 September.

Some of the trees planted had been killed by frost and to complete the planting as intended some 200 -300 more would be needed.

Crs Tiver and Sampson objected to spending more when they were in debt.

The Mayor said that having spent 11/- each on tree guards it seemed absurd not to spend 4d each on trees.

He had personally raised £108, which with the Government subsidy made £216 raised and he now asked them for a few pounds.  But only Cr Brown supported him.

A long discussion on the Aberdeen Reserve followed.  A move to turn it into a town rather than a North Ward responsibility was lost on the Mayor’s casting vote.  He said it could not be compared with the case of the Recreation Ground.

The Hydraulic Engineer will be asked to re-connect the Aberdeen water trough with the water main until the new arrangements are complete.
