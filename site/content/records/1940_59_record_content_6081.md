Obituary.  Mr John Tennant, veteran pastoralist of Princess Royal, died on 26 May and had been associated with Burra for nearly 40 years.  He was born at Myrtle Bank, Glen Osmond on 28 October 1863.  He was a son of the late Andrew Tennant of Glenelg, a well-known pioneer of SA.  He was educated at Prince Alfred College and on leaving school chose to go on the land.  His first experience was in the north at Moolooloo Station.  He married Miss Love of Mitcham in 1898 and later left Australia for the South Island of New Zealand, where the couple lived until about 1902-03, when they returned to SA.  Mr Tennant had purchased Princess Royal Station from the late Alexander McCulloch and with his wife and family made the fine old station seven miles south of Burra his permanent home.  He also had interests in a number of other large holdings.  In his prime he was a great sportsman and supported all forms of sport.  He was particularly keen on racing and hunting, being a great horseman.  He raced horses and as a member of the Adelaide Hunt Club won the club’s cup.  He was a major contributor to charities and to patriotic causes in the Great War and to present patriotic causes.  When the Maternity Wing of Burra Hospital was built due to the generosity of Mrs W.P. Barker and Sir John Melrose, there was a difficulty in financing its furnishing, but at the laying of the foundation stone a letter from Mr Tennant announced his willingness to be responsible for the furnishings to the extent of £700.  He is survived by a widow, one son, Mr Andrew Tennant of ‘The Gap’ and one daughter, Mrs Brian Swift of Adelaide.  There is one grandson.
