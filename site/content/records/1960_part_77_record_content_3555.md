P.H .Quirke MP writes regarding plans to extend electricity supplies over the northern part of his electorate by the single wire earth return system. (SWER)

A 33,000 V line from Jamestown to Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie is needed to serve the area north and south of such a line.  Country to the east of the Hundred of Anne is receiving supply from SWER lines radiating from the Burra system.

The Hundred on Mannanarie and part of the Hundred of Belalie north of Jamestown will be supplied from Caltowie â€“ operations are expected to begin in March 1965.  Yongala could be supplied from this source.

The Hundred of Belalie south of Jamestown should get a service scheduled in October 1964 together with part of the Hundred of Reynolds.

Spalding stages 1 & 2 are due for commencement in 1963 with stage 3 to follow.

The Hundred of Ayers has three areas.  The Burra-Hallett scheme supplies the east and south areas and is due for completion this year.

Booborowie will serve two groups north and south of the town, scheduled for 1963 and 1964 respectively.  ETSA is currently investigating how best to provide the Hundreds of Whyte, Anne and Terowie and an answer is expected in about three months.
