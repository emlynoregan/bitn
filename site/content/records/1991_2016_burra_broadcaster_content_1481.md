Redbanks

The Department of Environment & Land Management is looking to offload crown land known as Redbanks.  Unless an interested party can make use of it with adequate policing, it seems it will be sold off.  DC Chairman Graham Kellock said the decision in a recent court action following a fatal accident at Redbanks indicated the landholder was at fault due to inadequate policing.  The Council has tried to have an area there for picnicking, but the inability to control activities makes it impossible.  Landowners in the area have been patient, but have been hard done by when off-roaders stray and damage fencing and property.  Options have been considered and included negotiations with National Parks & Wildlife, but so far no solutions have emerged.

A public meeting has been called for 21 July to gauge public interest.  Police, SES and Ambulance have been called to accidents there in the past, some of which have involved alcohol and firearms.  The area is at the junction of the King and Eastern stock roads and has never been privately owned.
