Letter from J. Cooksley of Farrell’s Flat, complaining that the Farrell’s Flat contingent were hurried into the brake-van with little air or light until Riverton, when one door was opened, but near Adelaide it was again closed and they endured the heat till the Exhibition Grounds, ‘w[h]ere one poor woman fainted’.

The return was equally miserable except for two women who managed with bad grace to be accommodated in a carriage.  The lack of the extra carriage should have been attended to Thursday night.  Despite suggestions to discomfort was not shared around.

[The editor comments that telegrams were sent about the extra carriage, but to no avail, and several of the committee and Burra children also went down and back in the ‘break’.  The little crowding, which might have been expected, was part of the fun to many.]

There were 670 persons in the train overall.  [Actually 673 according to the figures cited.]
