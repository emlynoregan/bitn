With reference to Mr Hawkes, who says he has been a Board member for 15 years and resigned last January on account of the manner in which the Board conducted the affairs of the Hospital: he was not one of the most regular attenders.  In his last year he attended 12 meetings, but in the previous year only 3.  He was re-appointed last time only after advising the Chief Secretary he would attend.  Mr Hawkes blamed the change in the Board on ‘a new element’ that came in about 5 years ago.

Mr Winnall then cited patient’s payments and free gifts since 1909 to show what the ‘new element’ had achieved in a financial sense.  (In 1909 £371 and in 1917 £702.)

Mr Hawkes claimed the humiliation of the doctors resulted in a complete debacle because doctors will not now come to the hospital.  This surprises the Board because on 26 March 1916 a letter was sent by the Board to the Chief Secretary.  A committee of Mr McBride, Mr Hawkes and myself produced the letter, which was drafted by Mr Hawkes.  It is hard to reconcile that letter with his statements at the deputation.

The letter drew the attention of the Chief Secretary to a serious difficulty that had arisen between the Board and Doctors Ashton and Williams.  The difficulties have spread over a considerable period and have now reached such a critical stage that the Board feels the hospital is seriously imperilled.  The Board sought assistance and direction.  The essentials of the trouble are cited in the letter as:

The Board believed the Doctors were abusing the legitimate uses of the hospital to their personal gain at Government expense.

Despite repeated requests the doctors have refused to attend the usual meetings of the Board.

With reference to (1) above the Board believed that doctors had been sending cases to hospital that could reasonably have been treated at home, using hospital staff, the operating theatre, instruments and dressings.  These patients are charged full fees by the Doctors and while the hospital is a convenience and concentrating point for the Doctors, these actions considerably increase the cost of its upkeep.  Recently a single woman employed at 10/- a week and which the hospital regarded as a non-paying patient received a threatening letter from Dr Ashton’s solicitor demanding payment of £17 odd for medical attendance.  This the Board strongly condemns.  Under the rules the Board can refuse admission, but this is a grave responsibility and the Board must rely on the good faith of the Doctors as to proper cases for admission.
