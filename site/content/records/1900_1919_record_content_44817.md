Burra Institute Annual Meeting.

Rev. J.H. Nield took the chair.  Two of the committee had died in the year: Dr Sangster jnr and Mr W.S. Thomson.  The President (Rev. J.H. Nield) had been given nine months leave for war service, but had returned due to illness, though he had recovered sufficiently to resume duties as President.  In October Dr Steele had resigned due to his war duties.  In July J.E. Pearce and W.E. Hodge joined the committee.

At the end of 1915 the library held 4,442 volumes.

The membership in the year had fallen from 138 to 124.

The financial position was good.

The Orchestral & Choral Classes were much disturbed this year by the illness and then the death of Mrs Dane.

During the year a new escape door was placed on the northern side of the hall.

A fire proof box has been erected around the picture operatorâ€™s machine and panic bolts fitted.

Elected for 1916: President, J. McLaren; Vice-President, J.E.H. Winnall; Treasurer, T.W. Wilkinson (who has been so for over 40 years) & Secretary, J. Drew.
