Municipal Election: East Ward.

W.H. Hardy campaigned vigorously.  Mr Snell did not.  93 votes were recorded: 56 for Mr Snell and 37 for Mr Hardy.  Mr Snell in thanking voters made reference to the yarns circulated about him, but which had evidently not deterred voters.

Mr Hardy in seconding the vote of thanks to the returning officer made veiled references to some ‘outside work’.  When called upon to explain his reference he declined.  He said he had ‘heard things said about me which I will deal with later’. 

Another item in the paper refers to placards reading ‘Vote for W.H. Hardy, the live candidate.’  This seems to have induced some people not to vote as they drew the implication that Snell was dead.
