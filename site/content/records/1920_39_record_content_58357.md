Accident.  Mr Glen G. Hawkes, manager for Koonoona Pty Ltd at Koonoona, had a shocking accident on Wednesday evening.  While attending to a windmill, he fell from the platform.  Before striking the ground his right hand got caught and almost severed.  Dr Steele attended quickly and Mr Hawkes was taken to Burra Hospital, where it was necessary to amputate the hand.  The patient is making a marvellous recovery and is wonderfully bright.
