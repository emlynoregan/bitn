Mongolata Water Supply.  From the SA Parliament recently:

Mr Lacy: Last year £150 was voted for a water supply for prospectors at Mongolata.  £11 was spent.  This year £25 is provided, an increase of £14.  In 1931 the then Government put down a water catchment of a very temporary nature, consisting of rubberoid nailed onto timber – the field then not being regarded as permanent.  By 1933 the rubberoid was frayed and frayed portions entered the water supply, leading to illness among the men – some becoming seriously ill.

Requests to have the rubberoid replaced with galvanised iron have not been successful and each year the rubberoid deteriorates.  When there is a heavy flow of water into the tank the overflow keeps the water clear.  In summer reduced inflows cause rubberoid to enter the tank and cause illness.  With a company presently contracting for a shaft to 400 ft there should be a better supply and yet only £25 is provided.  I contend that £150 should be spent to replace the rubberoid.

Hon. S.W. Jeffries: How many are on the field?

Mr Lacy: About 150.

Hon. S.W. Jeffries: What is the capacity of the tank?

Mr Lacy: About 30,000 gallons and that is sufficient: there is not an actual shortage of water.

[Hon. H.S. Hudd then gave a non-answer on the part of the Government.]
