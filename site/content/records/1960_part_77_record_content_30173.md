Mr B.G. Dangerfield, Tree Advisory Officer for the Botanic Gardens, inspected the Burra Creek area from the Red Bridge to the Caravan Park.  He has recommended the removal of 25 pines because they are growing too close together and the thinning will allow each to achieve a better shape.  Their loss should be compensated by replanting with variations in species at strategic points.  He has recommended planting 7 red gums, 9 red ironbarks, 3 SA bluegums.  Rather surprisingly he also recommended planting 10 pepper trees to act as screens hiding the ugly rear of buildings and sheds.  Three kurrajongs were recommended for shade in the parking area at the swimming pool and four claret ashes for shade in the lawned areas.  He also recommended two more weeping willows.
