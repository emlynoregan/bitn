Characteristics of the 1891 Paper.

Page 1

Advertisements: mostly larger, but a mixture of local and otherwise.

Page 2-3

Classified advertisements, public notices small advertisements and then solid news running across the rest of pages 2 and 3.

There is usually an editorial and reasonable coverage of local news, though the follow-up on some items fails.

The ‘Sparks’ column is annoying in often mentioning interesting and sometimes even significant events in a very cryptic way.  Some of these items seem to deserve a paragraph.

There is no ‘literature’ in the form of serials etc. and on

Page 4

The advertising is especially about patent medicines, the paper itself and associated printing services and items like tobacco and Insectibane.

There appears to have been no significant change when P. Murrie sold out to W.J. Davey, having gone insolvent judging from XII, 1069 [2], 16 Dec. 1891, Page 2.

The first issue under W.J. Davey was XII, 1058, 23 Sep. 1891.

The demand for literature was catered for with a supplement.  This seems likely to have been printed elsewhere and been the same for a number of papers as it sometimes is unavailable in time, not having arrived.  It was a single, full-sized, loose sheet in the middle of the paper.

Numbering of issues of the paper in 1891

1891 begins with Volume XII Number 1021 on 7 January 1891

And runs to

Volume XII Number 1072 on 30 December 1891

In this sequence 1069 is used twice and 1070 is not used.

The Literary Supplement.

This has not been preserved in the hard copy and scarcely in the microfilm.  Whether it continued beyond February is not at all clear.

The microfilm version contains the following:

Date	Poetry	Stories	Gen. Interest Items	Household Hints	Recipes	Humour

14 Jan.	X	Two Wild Wagers	X	X	X

Revenge!

Dr Hoknagel’s Strange Story
