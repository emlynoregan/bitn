A Goyder Development Assessment Panel meeting at Burra Council Chambers last week became heated over the future of wind farm developments.  The panel was considering an application for two new 80 metres wind monitoring masts.  More than 20 people attended, including members of ‘Stop Industrial Wind Turbines’ and Andreas Marciniak and his brother Johannes who live 3 km from the Waterloo Wind Farm.  Johannes gave a heated outburst while addressing the panel, which resulted in local police being called.  Andreas Marciniak said his brother became frustrated when it appeared no one was really listening and their complaints were falling on deaf ears.  He predicted that others would replicate his brother’s actions as others become increasingly frustrated by the lack of attention being paid to their complaints.  The site for one of the new monitoring masts is about 9 km east of Mt Bryan Township and the other about 13 km south of Burra.  After hearing from the applicants and third party presenters the panel decided the masts were not at variance with the Goyder Development Plan and approved their temporary erection – to be removed within 60 months of the approval.
