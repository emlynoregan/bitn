Burra Town Council, 19 April

The Mayor said he believed the old Smelt’s Chimney was dangerous.  It had been struck by lightning and damaged.  During recent rough weather it had been reported to be swaying and now it was sagging.  Children would play near it despite the danger from falling bricks.  It should be demolished.

Cr Bevan said it was on private property and they could not force demolition.  The head teacher is to be advised of the danger and the owner Mr Carpenter will be asked to remove it.

The Bowden Salvation Army Band visited Burra for Anzac Day services.  The band under Bandmaster Heaven and accompanied by Major Jones & Envoy R.C. Winfield arrived on Good Friday and were billeted by residents.

On Good Friday evening an impressive service was conducted by Envoy Winfield to a full hall.

On Saturday they visited Burra North and played both sacred and secular pieces and in the evening there was a performance in the Salvation Army Hall.

Special Easter Sunday services were conducted by the visiting officers assisted by Captain Gannoway and Lieut. Temby.  At 10.30 a.m. the band played at the Burra Hospital and they then took a prominent part in the Anzac Service.

Anzac Badge Day realised £28 on Friday 15 April.
