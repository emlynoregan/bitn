Burra Mine

Mr E.C. Allen today announced plans for the mining of copper at Burra, as advised him by the Hon. Minister of Mines Mr R.C. De Garis.

A consortium of companies comprising Broken Hill South Ltd, North Broken Hill Ltd, E.Z. Industries Ltd & McPhar Geophysics Pty Ltd, advised they were relinquishing interest in the area after almost four years examining its prospects.  The Minister then accepted a proposal from another group, which was prepared to start mining copper at Burra within a few months.  Details of this new group are not yet finalised, but the technical staff will be headed by Mr B.H. Lewis, until recently Chief Geologist with Broken Hill South Ltd.  The company will be mainly Australian, but Mc Phar Geophysics Pty Ltd of Canada has expressed an interest.  The operation will centre upon the recovery of copper by ammoniacal leaching of oxidised ore in and near the old open cut where reserves of c. three million tons of 1.6% copper have been established.  Initially they would treat 200 tons per day and would have a labour force of about twenty men.  This would be scaled up to 500 to 700 tons per day over 18 months and stabilize at 180-200,000 tons per annum to give the known reserves a life of at least 20 years.  This would require a labour force of about 50, which the company would hope to recruit locally.  The Minister was delighted with this development.

The re-opening of the mine has long been sought and although this was a comparatively small operation, it would give the town a boost and continued exploration could reveal greater reserves.

Ore would be mined, taken to the crushing plant and then leached with ammonia in 500 ton vats.  The process would take about one week per vat.  Two vats would be used initially to handle 100 tons per day.  The product would be copper oxide.  The production of copper sulphate is also being investigated.  It is hoped to use natural gas as the heat source required â€“ the nearest connection is 15 miles away.

The open pit operation would involve moving about 700 tons of ore and 1,000 tons of waste per day, or a total of between 1,500 and 2,000 tons of material daily.  It was hoped local operators could do this. The aim was for a long-life operation.

The company has been incorporated in the name of SAMIN Ltd.  It is a public company formed for the purpose of mining Burra copper ore and having also interests in other states in perhaps lead and tungsten production.  As income permits it is intended to continue exploration in the mine area as well as north and south of the deposit.  When work began it was expected extraction of ore for four or five days would be followed by seven days of processing using three shifts a day.
