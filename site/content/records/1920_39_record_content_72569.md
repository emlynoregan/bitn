A minute of appreciation was entered and the resignation accepted with regret.  Other Councillors echoed the Mayorâ€™s sentiments.  Cr Dow thanked the others and said that after 5 or 6 years he found he could not continue without letting some of his private business slide and 5-6 years was long enough for anyone.  [Served December 1932 to October 1938.]
