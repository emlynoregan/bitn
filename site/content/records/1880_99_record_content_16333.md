For some months work has been going on at Roach Bros Burra Mill to take out the old machinery and install new roller apparatus.  The most recent studies suggest that in the old system the damping of the grain and the subsequent heat generated by the action of the stones changes the most nutritious part of the grain and decreases its food value.  In the roller process damping is not required and the grain is gradually reduced without the friction causing heat.  The quality is thereby improved.

All space in the mill including the extra floor is occupied by the elaborate and expensive new machinery.  Alterations to the building were by Sara & Dunstan.  Several gentlemen from Adelaide were invited on Thursday when the Mayor, John Dunstan jnr started the engine.  After that a toast was drunk in champagne and some rolls were made from the 1st roller flour ground the previous evening were eaten.  Henceforth Mr H. Roach will look after the practical milling and T. Roach do the books and outside work.  Mr G. Hewell, Mayor of Unley, proposed the toast ‘the Town and Trade of Burra’.  The other toasts etc. that followed are detailed.
