Mongolata Goldfield

The Department of Mines Report for January

About 60 men are engaged on the field and the Government Battery has been in continuous operation and has bookings for about 250 tons of ore for treatment.  All work in progress is on lode, with alluvial prospecting abandoned.

Baldina Mongolata GM has been producing some rich ore from an 8-inch-wide vein in the open cut and a prospecting tunnel has been driven into the hill some 112 feet.

Burra Mongolata Mine has not yet found anything of importance.

Tributers are working at the Wildildie Mine.

Curlew Mine is providing some good value crushings from small, but persistent veins of quartz and ironstone.

East View is now working in a ferruginous quartz formation about five feet wide, with good values and occasional patches of specimen ore.

Byles’ Mongolata has a vertical shaft being sunk from the adit at a place west of the shaft from the surface and this is now 108 feet below the adit surface.  The intention is to sink a further 100 feet to the water table.

There is a little prospecting going on at the north end of the field, but so far with disappointing results.

The total value of ore raised at the field is a little over £50,000.

Mr W.M. Williams, adviser to Byles’ GM Co., passed through Burra on Thursday and remains enthusiastic about the mine’s prospects.  At Byles’ Mongolata more men are to be put on this week.
