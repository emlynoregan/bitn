Public Meeting.

The severe sentence passed by Judge Bakehouse at Deniliquin on the late members of the Broken Hill AMA Defence Committee were a surprise and regret to all classes living in Burra.  A committee was formed here comprising Crs W.T. Rabbich, W.H. Hardy, W. Linkson along with Mr R.W. Smith & Rev. R.J. Daddow.  They called a public meeting in the Institute which was well attended.  W.T. Rabbich took the chair.  Rev. R.J. Daddow delivered a lecture on labour, capital and unions.

Cr Kitchener moved that the meeting found the sentences passed were unjustified by the trial evidence and by the findings of the jury and that they will intensify class feelings prejudicial to the peace and prosperity of employers and employees and the meeting sympathises with the wives and families of the late members of the Broken Hill Defence Committee and that the resolution be handed in for publication in the local paper, SA daily papers and be sent to Mr Cann MP for presentation to the NSW Government.

The second part of the meeting was a shearing scene carried out under the supervision of Mr R.W. Smith and some splendid shearing was done by expert shearers now in the district.  The Burra Band attended and a collection was liberally responded to.
