Letter.  A.S. Barrett writes on behalf of the Burra Ministers’ Fraternal to protest strongly against organised sport on Sundays.  He considers that the cricket match scheduled for Sunday 22 April to benefit the FFCF is for a good cause, but that it would be better to be minus those few material pounds than to break in on the spiritual purpose of God’s first day of the week.
