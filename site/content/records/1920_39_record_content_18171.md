Christmas.  Christmas Eve in Burra was busy.  Streets were crowded with busy shoppers and scores of cars were parked around Market Square.  The only entertainment over the holidays was the 40 Young Australia League boys who arrived on 30 December and were billeted out.  They performed before a good audience.
