Evidence for the laying out of Kooringa in 1845.

See SA Register 18 October 1845 and Minutes of the Directors of SAMA Saturday 18 October 1845.  Directors intend immediately to accompany Captain Ey and Messrs Dreyer & son to the Mine to make arrangements for the erection of a smelting house and to select the site for a township.

Saturday 22 November 1845.

Site for the smelting house has been selected and one street of the township has been laid out.  Different names for the township were considered.  The first suggestion of the Directors was Redruth and the second was Truro.  On 4 November 1845 the name Kooringa was chosen.  The first hotel was erected and licensed in 1846, later the old hospital, which was knocked down a few years ago to make way for the new hospital wing.
