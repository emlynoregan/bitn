On 2 Feb. tenders were called by Council for 1,200 yards of road metal: 600 yards for the south end of town and 600 yards for the north end.  Tenders to be in by 9 Feb.

By 9 Feb. Council had received two tenders for each 600 yards.

For the south end J. Herbert & Co. for 200 yards or more at 1/11 per yard and R. Hill & Co. for 200 yards or more at 2/- per yard.

Cr Parks moved and Cr Sampson 2nd that J. Herbert & Co.’s tender be accepted for 400 yards.  Carried.

Cr Rabbich moved and Cr O’Leary 2nd that for the north end P. Lally & Co.’s tender for 400 yards at 2/- per yard be accepted.  Carried.

On 11 Feb. the Council met as road commissioners re the Bon Accord crossing and a letter was handed to the Town Clerk and when read by the Mayor was found to ‘eminate’ from P. Lally & Co. explaining a mistake in the reading of their tender which was 2/6 per yard and not 2/- as read, but since the acceptance of the tender and the publishing of other tender prices they were prepared to supply the metal at 2/3 per yard.

R. Cox had tendered on 2 Feb. for 2/3. I moved that the Council accept R. Cox’s tender since it was the lowest tender - intimating that we would then be doing what would have been done on 2 Feb. had the Mayor correctly read the tender at the time.

Cr Watt interjected that we will divide the work between them.  I strongly objected to admitting P. Lally’s amended offer and finally it was agreed to recall tenders for 600 yards for the north end, to be in by 20 Feb.

The following prices were then received:

R. Cox & Sons, 200 or 400 yards at 2/1 yd

P. Lally & Co., 200 yds or more at 2/3 yd

W.J. Woollacott, 200 yds at 2/3 yd

S. Baker & T. Rosewall, 200 yds or more at 2/3 yd

Lihou & Co., 200 yds or more at 2/3 yd

All the metal to be from the same quarry.

Consequently I moved that the lowest tender by 2d a yard be accepted, viz. R. Cox & Son, for 400 yards, be accepted.  Cr O’Leary 2nd.

Cr Sampson then moved that the ballot be used in allotting the work, but considering the circumstances the Mayor thought that absurd.  Cr Sampson then moved that 200 yds only be given to R. Cox & Son, 2nd Cr Parks and carried.

The argument used now was that we should divide the work, but this was totally inconsistent with the procedure for dealing with the south end tenders when J. Herbert got 400 yards when only 1d per yd lower than the next lowest tender.

I left the Council in disgust at the whole business not being consistent with honourable and independent action and I would not to any further extent have anything to do with such, whatever the consequences.

Cr Watt’s motion re an explanation from me is ridiculous and I will appeal to the ratepayers for their decision as to mine or their action under the circumstances.

After I left there was still 400 yds to be divided so why, if equality was the call, was this not awarded 100 yards to each of the equal remaining tenderers instead of, as was done, 200 to each of two favoured parties.
