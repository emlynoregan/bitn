Kooringa News, 29 November

Fire.  On Sunday another destructive fire took place on the run of Messrs Duffield & Porter.  It arose somewhere near the lagoon at Black Springs and travelled towards Mintaro and the Wheelbarrow Hills till stopped by roads.  A small part of Gum Creek Run was also burnt.

Mr Opie estimates the loss by the fire at his place at £200.

Obituary.  Mr Isaac Holder, formerly a sergeant in H.M. 96th and armourer to Captain Sturt’s expedition has died.  He had been living in Kooringa for some time.  He was much respected here for his civility, his business habits and his cleanliness in his trade as a butcher.  [Isaac Holder died 26 November 1864, Kooringa aged 56.]

A great many more miners left this week for Wallaroo.  Many miners complain that they cannot work underground at the Mine due to the noxious gases emanating from the decaying wood with which it is timbered.  If this is so, it should be looked into before the accumulation of fire damp in blocked passages results in an explosion.
