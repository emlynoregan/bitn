Parade to Redruth

On Sunday morning there was a parade of marchers and floats along Commercial Street and thence to Redruth Gaol.  The parade was led by the Caledonian Society’s Pipe Band.  In the gaol grounds there were food stalls, market stalls and a ‘Victorian Picnic’.  Inside the gaol past chairman of the Burra National Trust Dudley Cockington opened the interpretive display.
