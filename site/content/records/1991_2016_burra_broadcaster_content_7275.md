The National Australia Bank has set up a display of local banking history, with interesting copies of early documents, a couple of great photos and old signature books for perusal.  The National Bank of Australasia (as it then was) was opened in Melbourne on 4 October 1858.  The Adelaide office opened 2 December 1858 and the first branch office was opened in Kapunda on 18 April 1859, with Burra following a week later.
