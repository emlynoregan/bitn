Burra Railway Station

The future of this heritage building is critical as lack of funding is threatening planned restoration.  In 2006 the Burra Regional Art Gallery secured a lease on the building in the hopes of transforming it into a mega-fauna inspired Palaeontology Museum, but at present without funding this is not feasible.  A structural assessment of the building is needed, because although the stonework is sound, the woodwork is not.  The Director of the SA Museum is supportive.  The station was erected in 1883 to replace a wooden structure of 1870.  Rail services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988 and the station has since deteriorated.  Its situation has now become critical.

[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect.  Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986.  The last grain trains ran for the 1998-99 harvest in January 1999.  The last passenger train was an ARHS special steam train on 19 September 1992.  The line does not seem to have been officially closed.  ARG ran the last movement on the line when it sent a light engine to Burra 12 March 2004.  The line beyond Burra was taken up 1992-93.]
