Rural Youth gathered at Spalding for the Upper North Zone Rural Youth Rally.  Overall Burra was placed 5th, but some individual members did well.  Burra’s debating team was narrowly defeated by Zone winners, Gladstone.  Mary Woollacott won the public speaking competition and will go on to the State Final.

In the Miss Rural Youth contest Burra’s entrant was Heather Angel.  Zone winner was Valerie Noble of Mt Remarkable.

Other contests involved home crafts for the girls and agricultural and pastoral skills for the boys.  Other contests involved nail driving, car reversing, a shovelling race and a fire alarm race.  A mannequin parade was staged on the final night.  There was a church service on Sunday morning at Bundaleer Reserve.  The Shield went to Spalding with Crystal Brook second.  [Actual results are printed on page 8.]
