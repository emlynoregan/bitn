Burra Waterworks.  The engineer was awakened last Thursday morning to the news that there was a break in the main to the reservoir on the hill.  A tree root had broken the pipe and the force of water through the break had forced 60’ of pipe out of alignment and almost drained the tank.  If the Council wants the Waterworks no doubt the Government will be glad to get rid of them.
