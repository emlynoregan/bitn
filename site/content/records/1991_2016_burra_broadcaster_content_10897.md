Letter.  Jane and Peter Strawbridge write suggesting that the low attendance at the Council merger meeting was less an indication of agreement and more an indication of lack of confidence of ratepayers in direct consultation with Council.  The recent Residents & Ratepayersâ€™ meeting urged a stronger effort to merge with Clare, with which Burra has much closer transport, hospital and tourism links than with Eudunda, Robertstown etc.
