Draught horse entries were fewer, but quality was high.

Horses-in-Action drew entries that were well up to standard and good competition was seen.

Cattle numbers were very small.

Dogs were exceptionally good this year with 30 greyhounds and good competition in other classes.

The sheep show is fully realising its potential now with good entries in sections aimed at all sizes of producers.  (< 250, 250-500, not >1,000 and not >2,000)

The Fleece Wool section was bigger than ever and entries have grown from 2 or 3 to 30.

There was a wide variety of agricultural implements on display.

General Motors brought along a whole convoy of their cars and trucks.

W.R. Lee showed the latest in Ford vehicles.

W.E.D. Young showed six of the latest in Chrysler models.

Horton Jennison displayed several wireless models.

Vegetables were excellent, but dominated by Bert Opperman and Mr W. Moxham and in Fruit Mr R. Hunter of Clare won all except for lemons when the prize went to A.J. McBride.

Flowers were hit by this yearâ€™s heavy frosts, but a good display was still evident.

Cooking entries were numerous and arts & Industries were commendable too.

Photography and Art was a small section.

School Class entries were very good, especially from the small Ayers Forest School and Baldina.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was not represented in the prize list for flowers at all this year, though he was listed among the judges.]
