Obituary.  At about 10.10 p.m. on Thursday night Miss Gwen Elizabeth Ford, a domestic, aged 32, was found shot in the lower chest in her bedroom at the residence of Mr & Mrs J.R. Barker at Baldina.  A double-barrel shotgun was lying beside her.  Her sister, who was in the house, heard the sound of the shot and immediately discovered the body.  She notified the police and MC France and MC Weicks, accompanied by Dr R.C. Heddle, went to investigate.  Miss Ford was still conscious, but died at Burra hospital at 3 a.m. on Sunday.  A report was prepared for the Coroner, Mr H.J. B. Jennison, who deemed an inquest unnecessary.

[Gwen Elizabeth Ford, born 7 March 1916 at Copperhouse: died 27 June 1948, Burra.]
