Federal Election.  C.A.S. Hawker was declared the winner of the Seat of Wakefield at Kadina on 23 October.  At the declaration Mr Hawker (Liberal) and Mr McHugh (Labor) thanked voters.  Mr Collins (Country Party) viewed the actions of the Liberal Federation as contemptible.  He congratulated Mr McHugh of a clean fight, but deplored the dirty tactics employed by the Liberal Federation using half truths and mutilated telegrams.  He could not congratulate Mr Hawker because the fight had not been clean.
