Simon Rowe will return to the Supreme Court to appeal the decision to refuse his application for a feedlot on Princess Royal Station.  Regional Council of Goyder development assessment panel and the Environmental Protection Agency both granted approval, but neighbours Graham Whetstone and John Lindner went to the Environmental Resources & Development Court (ERDC), which decided in their favour.  The Supreme Court then decided the ERDC had not given the matter due consideration and referred it back to them.  The ERDC has now re-assessed the appeal and again ruled in favour of Whetstone & Lindner.  Whetstone and Lindner are concerned about the deteriorating health of Burra Creek â€“ with tree deaths, permanent pools disappearing, boors dropping and being inconsistent and rising salinity in some bores.

They say more time is needed to collect scientific date before deciding on an approval that would see more water taken for a feedlot.
