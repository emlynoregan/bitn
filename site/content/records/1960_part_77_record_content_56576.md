Moving House

A house 27 ft x 19.5 ft high was moved to Burra last weekend.  It had lain empty for some years near the main Adelaide Road near the Holme Hill turn-off.  It was placed on a low loader on Sunday and escorted by Constable Miller of Burra.  On the main road every overhead telephone line had to be lifted over the house.  At Burra the idea was to enter the town via Burra North and Smelts Road to Mr & Mrs N. Fullerâ€™s property south of the cemetery, but the load was unable to negotiate the narrow bridge on Ayers Street, south of Welsh Place.  The next idea was to travel behind the hospital, up Kangaroo Street and then down to the Pig and Whistle Crossing and along Ayers Street.  Except for a few tree branches and wires all went as planned until the load slipped at the turn at the top of the hill and slid gently to the ground.  Not much damage was done, but it took from 1.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. before it was reloaded and it was dark by the time the load reached Thames Street.  The area was closed to traffic for the night and the journey began again at 7.30 a.m. on Monday.  The ford was safely crossed and the home was at its new site by 10.30 a.m.
