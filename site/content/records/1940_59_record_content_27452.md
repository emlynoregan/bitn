Burra Town Council, 8 July

Routine matters for a new Council were dealt with.  Committees were established and representatives for various bodies were appointed.

The Victory Committee sought permission to erect plaques to the memory of the fallen on the War Memorial.  It asked the Council to appoint a delegate to the committee and to suggest where the plaques be placed.

Cr. S.J. Woollacott was appointed.

By virtue of his office T.H. Woollacott had been a JP for the last 14 years.  Council moved to recommend to the Attorney General that he be made a permanent JP.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for Cr Bevanâ€™s contribution to the Council.

Burra Football Club met on Thursday and decided on the program for the year.  Burra delegates will move to wind up the Burra Association.
