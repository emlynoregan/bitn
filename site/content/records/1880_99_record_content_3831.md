St Mary’s.  We understand Mr McCulloch of Princess Royal has given £500 to St Mary’s, it previously having been lent at a low rate of interest.  The gift was in accordance with the wishes of the late Mrs McCulloch who died a fortnight since and in whom the district’s poor have lost a good friend.  She had long provided the Christmas fare for all the poor families of the district.
