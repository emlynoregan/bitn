Burra Chrysanthemum Show was held in the Institute last Wednesday.  It was well attended and was a financial success.  A few years ago small button blooms were passed as highly desirable specimens while now richly massive and symmetrical forms are a triumph of the horticulturalistsâ€™ skill. Prizes went:

18 to Dr Brummitt (5 1st, 6 2nd, 7 3rd)

12 to W. Lasscock

11 to Miss Oppermann (7 1st, 3 2nd, 1 3rd)

9 to J. Lewis

7 to J.D. Cave

7 to Miss Josling

5 to R.M Harvey

T.W. Pearce & Son got nearly all the prizes for ferns.  There were fewer competitors than in previous years, but the season was against them.  The prize list is printed.
