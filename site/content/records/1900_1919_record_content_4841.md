Mr Frank & Mrs Margaret Fisk, former residents of Burra, returned last week and set up in Paxton Square.  They drank and were merry and attracted a group of children.  Police broke up the gathering, but later they were again disturbed by police in Thames St and run in for the night and later fined 10/- each.
