The Anzac Day Dawn Service was well attended at Burra on Sunday.  Rev. Dave Smith of the Burra Uniting Church officiated at the service.  RSL President John Trigg laid the first wreath and others followed representing the Ladies’ Auxiliary, The Regional Council of Goyder, The Community, The Burra Community School and the BBH Football Club.  Terry Wilson played the Last Post, which was followed by a minute’s silence before Reveille.  Tea & coffee and biscuits followed in the RSL clubrooms.
