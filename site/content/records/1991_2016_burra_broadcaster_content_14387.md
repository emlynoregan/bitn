Goyder Council has proposed some zoning changes in the draft Planning Amendment Report (previously the Supplementary Development Plan).  A commercial and light industrial area is being suggested on the western side of the Barrier Highway north of the Burra Golf Course, with heavy industry to remain in the mine area on the Adchem property.  The plan will also include rural living zones adjoining existing roads adjacent to the town on the eastern side of Burra.  [2 photos.]
