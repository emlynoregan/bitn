Burra High School Parents & Friends Annual Report

The Association held a sports day and ball in 1956 and a banquet was held as a Christmas break-up.  Money raised paid for: a lawn mower, a gramophone and records, a record cabinet, cups and books for speech night, a Gestetner copying machine, and an electric urn (the last two items in conjunction with the Primary School).
