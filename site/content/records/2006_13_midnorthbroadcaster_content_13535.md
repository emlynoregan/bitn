The Fire Engine Rally and Craft Fair last weekend was a success.  More than 700 people visited the site during the weekend.  Engine rides proved popular.  The craft fair also went well with different stalls located in each cell at the old Redruth Gaol.  Branch chairman of the National Trust Paul Marsson said the organisers were thrilled with the success.  Stalls included jewellery, handmade chocolates, leather and woodwork, scrapbooking, clothing, plants, trading table goodies, fabrics, Rawleighâ€™s products, stamping and face-painting.
