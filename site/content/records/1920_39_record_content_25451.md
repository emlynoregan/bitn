In February the enrolment was 38 and by September this had risen to 43.  39 were attending in December and so the average attendance is up.  Last year three Intermediate and four Leaving certificates were gained, besides many individual subject passes.  Wilfred Harris gained an Intermediate Exhibition and Patty Pledge was prominent in the honours list in the Leaving Commercial Exam.

The sports fund is doing well and the magazine editors have completed three further issues of typed copies.  In sport we visited Clare in March and December and they visited here in July.  We went to the Combined High School Sports at Kapunda in September.  The tennis courts have been improved.  The concert in August brought in Â£44.  Tenders for the delayed remodelling of the school are now being called and the next step should be taken in January.  On the 4 January the then Premier Hon. L.L. Hill visited and on 21 September the Governor-General Lord Stonehaven & Lady Stonehaven came.  There are indications an enrolment of over 50 could be achieved for 1928, which would mean another assistant.

Dr Steele made an address as Chairman of the High School Council.
