Fire.  On Wednesday 17 August fire broke out in Drew & Crewes’ bulk store at Aberdeen.  Mr Crewes was away on a trip to Melbourne, but Messrs J. Drew and K.R. Crewes were amongst the first to arrive.  The fire reel was attached to a car and was soon in attendance.  Smoke issued from everywhere, which made it hard to find the seat of the fire, which was under the floor.  Water pressure was negligible and even when the engineer had shut down supplies to Kooringa and Aberdeen it remained very weak.  Buckets from a tank at the building were used and after taking up various parts of the floor the fire was extinguished after two hours.  The smouldering fire must have shortly burst out and engulfed the whole building had the alarm not been raised when it was.  The origin remains a mystery and damage is assessed at c. £300.  The failure of the water pressure was due to repairs being carried out on the engine.  An inquest was deemed unnecessary by G. Sara JP acting as coroner.
