Weather.  The May rainfall has been about double the average.  Seeding across the state has been spread out, depending on local variations in the timing of rainfall, but recent falls have meant that most farmers who have not yet seeded will now do so as soon as the ground dries out sufficiently.

Lambing rates have been good, with lower than usual losses.  Feed has been good and foxes, though numerous, have not been worrying lambs unduly, perhaps because they have been taking rabbits instead.  Blowflies have been more of a worry.

Col H.T. Harslett, CO of the 27th Scottish Australian Regiment, visited Burra and stated that a platoon of the Regiment would soon be formed here.  Training, he said, has changed with less emphasis on drill and rifle exercise and more availability of sporting equipment and shooting.  Rates of pay are particularly high.  Recruits attend lectures once a week and go into camp for 14 days a year.  Men 18-35 can join up.
