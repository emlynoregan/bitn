Local Board of Health, 17 February

It was decided to condemn a Burra North house.  Following a previous visit the Medical Officer said no attempt had been made to clean it up.  He believed the disease of TB in the house could not be eliminated without pulling it down and people living there were in constant danger of contracting it.  The owner had not replied to the three options of vacating it, pulling it down or repairing it.  The occupants were given 28 days to vacate.
