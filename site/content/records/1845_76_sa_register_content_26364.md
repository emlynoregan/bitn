Burra, 18 May.

There has been almost a week of heavy rain and now roads are drying out, having been very heavy and boggy.

Yesterday was a general holiday and cricket and other games were enjoyed.

Last Sunday and Monday the Bible Christian Sunday School Anniversary was held.  Revs R. Lang & S. Gray preached.  On Monday the scholars marched through the streets led by the IOGT Brass Band.  Tea and cake followed.  Proceeds from the Anniversary were Â£40.
