Burra Football Assoc. met on 23 April and details occupy c. 1¼ columns.  Various matters were discussed, but much of the discussion concerned who could play for which club and what was meant by ‘residence’.  [Some players worked away from home during the week and so spent more nights elsewhere, so what constituted their ‘residence’?]
