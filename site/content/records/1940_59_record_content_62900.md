Obituary.  Miss Edith Jenkin died 7 March at Burra aged 86. She was born at Burra and lived in the old home for over 80 years, until about twelve months ago when she sold it and moved in with her niece Miss D. Geake, in Queen St.  Miss Jenkin was one of the first scholars to enrol at Burra School and was a member and worker for Red Cross in WWI and made a lot of comforts for the boys in WWII as well.  She was a member of the Rechabite Lodge for over 65 years and of the Kooringa Methodist Church.

Page 6 has some additional information: she was the youngest daughter of the late John & Catherine Jenkins and aunt of Miss Doris Geake.

[Edith Louisa Jenkin born 8 January 1868 at Kooringa.]
