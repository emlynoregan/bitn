Mongolata Goldfield

Following a question in Parliament Mr Butler said he would call for a report on Mongolata to see whether it was advisable to adopt the WA scheme to aid development.

Baldina.  No. 1 Have sunk a trial shaft almost 256ft from the shaft on the north end of the claim.  Struck a seam about 3” wide about 2ft from the surface with good results showing about 2oz per ton.

Continued sinking to 11ft and seam widened to 8” with better values.

Sinking further south, but to date no seam carrying gold.

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co.  On checking rumours of a rich find we learn that a lode about 20ft wide has been struck and tests suggest it should yield up to 10dwt per ton, which is a good value for such a wide seam.  Some directors have subsequently paid a visit.  (D.R. Reid & A.A. Thornton accompanied by I.J. Warnes.)

Takati.  A big lump of ore richly studded with gold was recently found weighing about 30lb.
