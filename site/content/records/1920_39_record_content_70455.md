Burra Hospital Garden.  This has been one of the town’s beauty spots.  It was originated by former Matron Sister G. Siegele and carried on by the present Matron Sister D. Robinson.  The area is about half an acre sloping down to the footpath where there is a low hedge.  There are several rockeries.  The matron’s enthusiastic gardener is Mr Lloyd Parks.  Until Thursday’s high winds it was a beautiful picture of dahlia’s, French marigolds, cannas, rosy morn, petunias, cosmos, phlox and roses.
