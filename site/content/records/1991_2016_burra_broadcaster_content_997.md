The Burra & District CFS Group values the support of private fire units said Group Officer Andy Thomas.  Private units, when attending to fires prior to the arrival of a CFS unit should do so at their discretion and to the best of their ability.  Upon the arrival of a CFS unit the CFS Officer in charge will co-ordinate the fire fighting.

[Group Officer Thomas then lists the procedure to enable this to occur.]
