Child, Adolescent & Family Health Service (CAFHS)

A group of parents and babies meet regularly to discuss mutual problems and issues.  As a result they have resolved to form a Friends of CAFHS Group â€“ an informal gathering of mums, dads and children to exchange ideas and experiences.  The first meeting will be on 9 November at noon.
