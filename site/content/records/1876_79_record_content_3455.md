Hotels. From 1 Jan. 1878 the Licensed Victuallers Amendment Act closed pubs on Sundays except between the hours of 1 & 3 p.m. except for residents and bona fide travellers who lived over 5 miles away and had travelled that distance that day. A first or second offence attracted a fine of £5-£S0, while a third led to the loss of the licence. Consumers of alcohol were also subject to fines of £5-£10.
