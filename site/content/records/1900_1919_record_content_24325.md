Changing Customs.  Once a farmer would scarcely think of going to a neighbour for a cup of tea or a convivial chat, but since closer settlement has come in, dropping in for the evening has become common and usually results in music, dancing, or other amusements.  Accordions and concertinas are the usual instruments, but pianos are used when encountered, of course.
