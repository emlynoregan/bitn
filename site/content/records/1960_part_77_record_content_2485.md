CWA Antique & Art Exhibition

To launch the building fund for their new rooms a committee convened by Mrs A. Tennant with Mrs M. Ashton as Secretary staged a magnificent exhibition of curios, pictures and things of historical interest in Burra Town Hall on Friday 27 May.  The event was opened by Lady Swift who is the daughter of Burra CWA’s foundation Vice-President, the late Mrs John Tennant.  The funds raised will be spent on a CWA building to be erected on land given by the Warnes Family in memory of the late Mary Jane Warnes, Burra Branch foundation President.  Mrs H. Jennison moved the vote of thanks.  The SA National Gallery provided 14 pictures, the Advertiser gave screens, Myers donated carpets and John Martin provided ropes and stanchions.

Burra mining days were represented by relics of mining and by pictures by Gill and Goodhart, arranged by Mrs A. Tennant assisted by Mr L. Bence.

The antique display included period furniture, china, glass, silverware and jewellery.  A wedding table setting was arranged by Mrs Rex Warnes and Mrs R.B. Pitcher.  Mrs H.L. Riggs and Mrs J. Hill arranged a Victorian drawing room on the stage.  An early Victorian table was arranged by Mrs G.S. Hawker and Mrs J.R. Barker.  Mrs L.G. Miller was responsible for a children’s party setting.  Mrs L. Bence, Mrs A. Bence and Mrs C. O’Connor organised an oriental display.  Mr R. Fuss provided articles relevant to Burra’s mining days including a beer pump and a collection of malachite.  [Considerably more detail is printed.]

[The exhibition raised a little over £180.]
