The Conference of Councils for the Burra Burra District, Burra Town, Robertstown, Morgan and Waikerie last Wednesday favoured sealing the direct Morgan-Burra route.  The Governmentâ€™s idea is to open up markets for Riverland produce.  The indirect route along the pipeline and via Robertstown was considered.  Robertstown delegates naturally favoured that, but others favoured the direct route via Florieton and said a splendid road already existed from Morgan almost to Florieton.  The meeting passed a resolution favouring this route (with Robertstown against) and in the event that not being accepted then the route via Robertstown.  The direct route involved fewer bridges and was along a three-chain road, while the Robertstown route was a one-chain road only.
