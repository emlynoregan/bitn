Characteristics of the paper in 1904

1.  The original format.  (January to September)

Page 1.  Larger advertisements, mostly not local.

Page 2.  Larger advertisements and a very few ‘classified’ advertisements.  Generally no editorials and then shortish news paragraphs interspersed with similar looking text that advertises patent medicines etc.

Page 3.  Continuation of page 2 in style.  A jumble of news items and advertisements, plus a serial and some jokes or other light material.

Page 4.  Large advertisements dominated by patent medicines like Seigel’s Syrup, Beecham’s Pills, Vitadatio, with two columns of self-advertising.

2. The new format.  (From October)

Page 1.  Business directory of the town and large advertisements, largely not local.
