Terry’s Mine.  Some driving has produced poor results.  A portion of the shaft timbers have been removed at the 30 ft level and preparations made to re-open an old drive north of the shaft, from which payable ore was won.  25½ tons of underground and dump material has passed through the battery for 5 dwt 16 gr per ton.  In all, 62 tons of ore have been put through the battery from this mine for 51 oz 7 dwt 19 gr.
