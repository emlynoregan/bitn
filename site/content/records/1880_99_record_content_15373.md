Redruth Court.

William Woollacott was charged that on 5 November he assaulted and beat Malcolm Ker.

Woollacott was driving a trolley of boys home from the St Mary’s Sunday School picnic when he saw Ker throw his bun to his sister on the other trolley and it fell to the ground.  He hit Ker twice across the back with his whip and made him walk home.  At a gate Ker, Ker’s brother, and another boy opened the gate to let the others through but closed it on Woollacott’s trolley.  Later Woollacott chased them and gave Ker five cuts with the whip.  As well as Ker, Archibald Wade and Alfred Barrett gave similar evidence, which denied that the gate had struck the horses leading Woollacott’s trolley.  Ker also denied swearing or giving cheek.

J.G.I Ker, the boy’s father, gave evidence of the marks on the boy from the whip.

Woollacott said the boys had broken their buns and were throwing pieces at the girls, not to them.  Ker had been cheeky and had slammed the gate on the horses, which was a dangerous act.

William Gerard, driver of the girls’ trolley confirmed that the gate had hit the horses and the pole of Woollacott’s trolley, which could have had dangerous consequences.

Woollacott was fined 5/- + £2-6-0 costs.
