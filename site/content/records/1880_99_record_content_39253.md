The Editorial is a strong attack on the Municipal Skinflints who have been paying the Town Clerk £90 p.a.: £50 as Town Clerk, £25 as Secretary to the Waterworks, £10 as Secretary to the local Board of Health.  Cr Sampson moved an extra £5 for the Waterworks.  The discussion that followed was mean spirited because ‘Mr Davey receives les remuneration for work done than any other Town Clerk in South Australia.’

Then Crs Watt and Parks moved to do away with any permanent overseer or dayman and have all the work tendered for.  If this is not directed against the present overseer it ‘savours very much of sheer incapacity as local legislators of the Councillors moving in the matter.  To engage a fresh man every other week be mere nonsense.’
