RSL Reunion Dinner for the North-eastern Group was held in the Show Society’s Centenary Hall Aberdeen.  At 7 p.m. returned men marched four abreast from the club rooms with the Burra District Band under George Terry assembled under Drew & Crewes’ verandah, brilliantly lit for the occasion. The men marched around the Soldiers’ Memorial where they paused for a minute’s silence before marching back to the club rooms.
