Professor Andrew Millington & Dr David Bass of Flinders University met with members of the Burra Revegetation Group and the Goyder Council last Thursday to discuss educational opportunities in the revegetation of Burra Creek.  The group approached the University to get some help with questions that arose when replanting was being undertaken: where to plant, what to plant, what about floods, what would people most enjoy etc.  Council CEO John Brak said that one hope was that the project would reduce Councilâ€™s maintenance costs in the long term, thus freeing funds for the further development of the area.
