Mr J. Rumball.

The economies being made in the Government include cuts in the Railways Department and the Commissioners are getting old and faithful servants to send in their resignations.  One such is ‘our old and respected stationmaster (Mr J. Rumball) who for the past 20 years has had control of the Burra Station and during that time has carried out his duties to the entire satisfaction of the Railway Commissioners and also to the travelling public, and by his kindness and courtesy has won the respect of all.  While being courteous and obliging, which cost nothing, he has never forgotten that he had to act fair and conscientiously to the authorities whose responsibilities he shared to a great extent in attending to all business connected with the railway department.  No one can deny that Mr Rumball is an excellent officer, this will be shown from the fact that he has been connected with the railway department for the past 39 years, having filled a similar position to the one he now hold in Victoria.  The news of Mr Rumball’s resignation was soon made known and several townsmen immediately took the matter in hand, and a largely signed requisition has been forwarded to the Commissioners praying that they will reconsider their decision.  The deputation (Mr J. Lewis J.P., of the firm of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, and Mr P.L. Killicoat, J.P.) was promised that the request would receive the Commissioners’ best attention.  We hope the reply will be favourable so that our old friend will be allowed to remain in our midst to look after the general welfare of the Burra branch of the railway department.’
