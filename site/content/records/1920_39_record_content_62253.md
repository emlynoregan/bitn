Centenary Hall at the Burra showgrounds.

Show President I.J. Warnes laid the foundation stone for the new hall on Friday 17 July.  With many country folk in town for Friday, there was a fair gathering at 3.30 p.m. for the ceremony, including A.J. Melrose MP, A.D. McDonald MP, Mayor T.H. Woollacott and Sir John Melrose.  The hall is being erected just above the large luncheon room.  The wind was keen and cold and proceedings were not delayed.  Mr S.H. Robinson, one of the Vice-Presidents presided in the unavoidable absence of A.B. Riggs.  He said that in 23 years as President Mr Warnes had worked hard for the Society and given liberally.  It was only fair he should lay the foundation stone and he presented Mr Warnes with an inscribed silver trowel to perform the act.

Mr Warnes said that in 23 years as President, the people of the town and district had been wonderfully good to him.  He explained the origin of the hall be saying that five years earlier, knowing the need for a sheep pavilion, he said he would put up £250 if others would match it.  The money was raised.  The present building would not be used for sheep, at least for a while, but for a Centenary Hall.  It was his desire it be opened free of debt.  The society was financially sound.  Without this building it owned assets to the value of £4,000 and the overdraft was only between £400 and £500.  The hall, when completed, would supply a long felt want.  He had first come to a Burra Show with his father, as a small boy, when it was held at the old Smelting World, then still intact, with a big wall around it.  His father had been one of the officials.  The show ring was on the eastern side of the enclosure.  His father had won the first and open championship for sheep and also champion bull.  The society had, in its time, received much help from the district and outside folk, the Melrose family, the McBrides and the Bartholomaeus family among others.  It was Mr C. Bartholomaeus who had helped make possible the move to the present grounds.  He believed the first Patron to have been Mr Alex McCulloch, the first President Mr Ben Rounsevell, the first Vice-President Captain Isaac Killicoat and first secretary Mr J.D. Cave.  From the old Smelts the society had moved to Victoria Park and then to the Aberdeen Racecourse and thence to the present spot.  Having a home of its own meant that every penny spent in the property was to the society’s advantage.  Their only regret was in paying to have the railway brought to the ground, as cars were now so plentiful that the money could have been saved.  All that was wanted now was a bitumen road to Burra, which looked like a hopeful prospect within a few years.  He also referred to Sir John Melrose’s generosity in removing all buildings from the old site to the present one without cost to the society.

A.J. Melrose moved the vote of thanks, in which he recounted and applauded Mr Warnes’s generosity to the community and the society.  He was seconded and supported by the Mayor, who added that he hoped Mr Warnes would be back on 3 October to open the hall at the start of the Back to Burra Centenary Celebrations.
