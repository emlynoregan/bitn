Ian Auhl writes to draw peopleâ€™s attention to the recently published book, The Steel Master.  It is the biography of Essington Lewis who was born in Burra in 1881 and became General Manager of BHP and Director General of Munitions and Aircraft Production during WWII.  One photo in the book shows the Lewis home in Kangaroo Street after the snowstorm of 1901.  The book mentions at some length the years when John Lewis lived in Burra as a partner in the firm Liston, Shakes & Lewis (later Bagot, Shakes & Lewis).  Essington attended the Burra Primary School.  The author is Geoffrey Blainey.
