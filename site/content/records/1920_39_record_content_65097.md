Tennis.  New grass courts have been prepared for about twelve months at the southern end of the Sports Syndicate land (Burra Racecourse).  They are rented by the Kooringa Tennis Club and were opened last Monday.  Five courts were planted, but only three were ready for play.  The opening was performed by Club President Dr D.M. Steele.  The first three sets to play were: Dr Steele & J.R. Barker v. J. Gebhardt & B. Hirschausen, Matron Siegele & _______ Burnley v. M. Gebhardt & Mrs A.L. Collins and Mrs J.R. Barker & Miss J. Gebhardt v. Mrs D. Steele & Miss Olah Pearce.
