Porter’s Lagoon has become a popular resort especially of a Sunday evening, for people from Burra, Farrell’s Flat, Manoora, Saddleworth, Undalya and even Riverton.  One evening recently there were about 150 cars there for the ‘sea breeze’ and bathing and to enjoy the Mid-Northern Brass Band (Saddleworth & Manoora).  There is presently one boat there, the Swan, but a second is expected to appear soon.  The President of the Association is H.C. Atkins and the Secretary E.G. Pratt.
