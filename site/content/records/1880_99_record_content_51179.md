Letter to the Editor claiming that the culprits in the Council fiasco are Cr Hardy, who is seeking revenge after his humiliation in his failed libel case, and the Mayor who was likewise shamed by publication of his report with all its errors.  The writer includes a reminder from the trial of when the Mayor evoked a retort from counsel:

‘If the way in which you have given your evidence is a sample of the manner in which you conduct the business of the Council no one need wonder at the dissatisfaction of the ratepayers.’

The writer believed Cr Parks was merely being used, but admitted that Cr Harris was a mystery as ‘he has not even the miserable pretext of revenge to fall back upon’.
