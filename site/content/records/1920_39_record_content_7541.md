S.R. Oborn writes re schoolwork at the show.  At the annual meeting of the Show Soc. it was implied that the teachers were to blame for the lack of exhibits and that some were left in a hep on a table.  The rules state that the exhibits must be in the hands of the secretary a week before the show and the stewards are then responsible for placing the exhibits.  Teachers were not appointed stewards this year and neither of the men appointed were present on the day.  Mr Oborn also denied that ‘some of the work was an absolute disgrace’, as was alleged.

‘Far from not attempting to influence children to compete I set aside lessons, during which show work could be done.’

A teacher who tried to arrange entries found them disordered as fast as he did so by other people bringing in exhibits.
