Election Meeting at Kooringa

On Tuesday there was a very full meeting of electors at the Burra Hotel.  Dr Mayne was voted into the chair.

Candidates were limited to half an hour to express their opinions.

Mr Clark:

On local concerns he thought the sanitary arrangements and state of the roads were most pressing.  He opposed further immigration at the public expense.  He said Mr Kingston was substantially to blame for spending money on immigration in the past ten years.  Much of this money had been wasted; many had felt compelled to go to Victoria to get work and many roamed the streets of Adelaide in search of employment, while at Gawler and Kooringa there were many who had not earned 20/- per week for many a long day.  The district was lamentably lacking in good roads and adequate bridges.  He favoured changing the regulations to prevent land jobbers.  He though absentees landowners did not contribute their fair share to the Treasury.  Education grants were needed for country and suburban schools, but he would not support the withdrawal of the Bible from schools.  He favoured the payment of Members of the House of Assembly.  He favoured the establishment of circuit courts.

Mr Kingston:

While immigration was presently undesirable, it had in the past been beneficial.  Many in Kooringa had benefited from assisted immigration.  As for many not being well paid; that may be true, but they were better off than they had been when they accepted the free passage from England.  The Burra Directors did not wish to lower wages or to oppose railways or good roads; indeed that had, at their own expense, improved the road between Kooringa and the Light.  He believed he deserved some credit for helping to frame the Constitution Act.

[There was a disagreement between Clark & Kingston over whether the latter had purchased land in the Hundred of Clare.]

He did not support payment of Members.  Country schools required more assistance than town schools.  He favoured reading the Bible in schools.  He had supported the erection of the Redruth Court House.  Though it needed amendment, the Real Property Act was a great boon.

A letter from J.B. Neales was read to electors by the chairman, essentially restating his positions published on 12 April.  He thinks that since Mr Clark has come forward his own chances are diminished, but if the voters continue to wish him to stand he will do so and will attend a meeting at Kooringa if it is desired, but important matters prevent his appearance at this meeting.

[There was then a series of questions from the floor.]

When it was put to the vote it was doubtful whether Mr Kingston or Mr Clark had the majority, but it was eventually decided in favour of Mr Kingston.
