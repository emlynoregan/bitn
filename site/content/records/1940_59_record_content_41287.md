Letter.  James H. Schwier writes to complain of a recent DC practice of selling roads.  He considers it is quite a good idea to rent roads to adjacent landowners.  Selling the roads is an anomaly.  Most of the land [east of Burra] is leased and yet the roads are sold, to become private property.  A rented road can be resumed when required.  As an istance of the problems created, he cites:

The road between Sections 17N and 24 in the Hundred of Mongolata.  This was the most direct route between the northern and central portions of the district and the Mongolata Mines.  Now if we want to go to the mines withour crossing private land the distance is four or five miles further.  The road was closed and sold before most people knew anything about it.  It is time the selling of roads was stopped.  The same object can be achieved by renting.  The Council should also exercise more control over rented roads to prevent the destruction of timber and scrub thereon.
