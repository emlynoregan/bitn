Obituary.  Mr George Camp was the second son of Mr Elliott Camp of Aberdeen.  The deceased was taken ill in November, but recovered somewhat before illness again overtook him.  He was operated on for an abscess in the ear and sent away to rest and recuperate.  A few days ago he returned and required a further operation which seemed to have been successful, but apparently the abscess had worked itself on the brain and he died on Tuesday night.  He had been connected with the Aberdeen Football Club and was a good son, steady and industrious.
