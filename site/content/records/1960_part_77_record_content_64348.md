Headmaster’s Report for 1972

I welcome Inspector Mr Louis Kloeden, to the platform along with Mrs Kloeden, a Senior Mistress and Art Teacher.

The year began with an enrolment of 160 and we expect it to be 200 by 1975.

The students have been co-operative and responsible and the prefects and house captains most conscientious in their duties.  Students have done well in helping with the upkeep of the grounds.  A Valedictory Service was held last Sunday in the Anglican Church.

We congratulate Commonwealth Scholarship winners Paul Hogan, Jennifer Holmes, John Lewis, Grant Maxted, Necia Mickel, John Bishop, Helen Beare and Kathy Edwards.

[He then went on to thank the staff and the High School Council.]

Next year Miss Baron and Mr Costello are both getting married and will be transferring to Dover Gardens and Findon respectively.  Miss Lintern has resigned to take a Social Science course at Flinders University.  Mr Allen has been promoted at ASM at Millicent High School.  Their replacements are not yet known.

The Parents & Friends have helped the school with a number of purchases including a photo-copying machine ($850) and library books ($400).

[He then spoke briefly of sports and extra-curricular activities.]

In 1973 there will be no ‘2’ track students and only ‘0’ and ‘1’ track.  All 1st year students will be offered Art as an alternative to French.  1973 will see the introduction of a Hire Book Scheme.

A new Commonwealth Grant next year will see the school receive some $2,750 worth of equipment including books, films, cassettes etc. over three years.

With respect to the new school.  New plans have been drawn up and approved.  It is likely the boys’ craft block and the science block areas will be the site for the new school and Wardle’s paddock the recreation area.  No commencement date has yet been set.

Mr Kloeden was then introduced.

[The list of prize winners is printed.]
