MIM continues to search for copper in the Burra area.  It has been sinking holes at Eberhard’s property, Mullaby and is currently working on A. & P. Stockman’s ‘Midnight Oil’ block [Cobb & Co.’s Corner.]  If finances permit one may go into J. & M. Tiver’s block adjacent to the Barrier Highway and another on a Stockman property.
