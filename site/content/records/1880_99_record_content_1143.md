Letter from W. Jenkin asking why there is no Government day school at Copperhouse and discounting the claim that the place is too close to the Burra School.

Other places with less claim have a school.  Balhannah has a school, despite having a sparse and dispersed population, and being only one mile along a main road from Oakbank with its new

£700 school.  Only three miles further on is the new £600 Woodside School and a further three miles gets to the Charleston Provisional School.  Thus there are four schools in a straight line within about 8 miles.

Neither is the enrolment or the attendance a valid excuse.			Average attendance	Enrolment	Balhannah	35	56	Oakbank	35	55	Woodside	56	103	Charleston	15	38	Copperhouse has about 40 children of school age and the homes average quite three miles from the Burra School.  Over 30 children at Copperhouse have never attended the Burra Model School.

Jenkin does not blame the Burra School Board as they have answered the questions put to them honestly.  The place is within four miles and the Education Act forbids the opening of a school within four miles, but the Act was not intended to apply to townships. [Only to rural areas.]  Proof of this lies in the situation in the City, at Port Adelaide, or in the country at places like Wallaroo and Moonta etc.  The Copperhouse children cannot be compelled to go to the Burra School and yet are denied a school.

The present private school there cannot long continue.  If the man is competent he is forced to teach at a starvation rate of income and if he is not so much the worse for the children.
