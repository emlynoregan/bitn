Robert G. Skinner & Glenys J. Christopher write on the galah problem in Burra.

An article in the Northern Argus of 18 May says that the Burra Burra DC has invited comments from the public on the control of galahs. The birds are roosting in gum trees around Burra Creek and the trees are beginning to die.  The article says Council feels there is not much point in planting trees if we cannot look after the ones we have.  The solution is for the Council to implement a positive program and put in 5,000 trees immediately.  At Ford’s Corner we have planted 2,000 in three years and expect to plant another 500 to 600 this year.
