'Fed Up Ratepayer' writes pointing out to Crs Beckwith and Finch that moves to transfer Booborowie and Leighton Wards to Spalding DC were begun by fed-up ratepayers and not by Spalding Council and to accuse the latter of whipping up animosity is completely false.

Must we go on wrecking our cars on ‘our unformed, neglected, pot-holed tracks’ just so the Burra Burra DC will not be unbalanced, he asks.

He also says it is useless to blame the wet winter, as they have put up with the same bad roads for many winter, both wet and dry.
