Obituary.  Michael (Mick) Vincent McCabe died at Burra Hospital aged 92.  He was the husband of the late Dora.  When the McCabes moved from station life in the north, they took up the corrugated iron house near Meer’s Garage in Hallett.  He became a regular visitor to all the local events and was famed locally for his erratic driving.  [Born 11 November 1922 at Port Pirie West.]
