BBH Football & Netball Clubs Celebrate their 30th Anniversary

About 150 people gathered at Burra Town hall on Saturday 6 August to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the amalgamation of the Burra, Booborowie and Hallett Football and Netball Clubs.  It followed the day’s games, where the home team hosted Blyth-Snowtown – just as they had thirty years earlier for their first game as an amalgamated team.  The entertainment was informal, but included interviews and speeches covering the history behind the amalgamation and at about 10 p.m. entertainer Trent Bell took over.
