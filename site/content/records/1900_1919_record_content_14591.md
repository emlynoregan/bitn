Obituary.  Mrs Percival Giles, wife of the brother of Mr R.L. Giles of Burra, has died in Edithburgh last Thursday after being married just 12 months.  [Elizabeth Giles, wife of Percival Aldridge Giles died 17 August 1905 aged 25.  The marriage does not appear to have been in SA, though P.A. Gilesâ€™ second marriage in 1907 is registered here.]
