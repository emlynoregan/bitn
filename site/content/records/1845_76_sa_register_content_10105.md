16 August.

Mrs Freeman was charged by her daughter Mrs Braithwaite with an assault and Mrs Braithwaite was charge by her mother Mrs Freeman with an assault.  The evidence showed that Mrs Freeman had, with the authority of Mr Braithwaite, taken his child from its mother and that the mother had, in her excitement, broken Mrs Freeman’s windows to obtain possession of her child.  This she accomplished, although it was again taken from her by Mrs Freeman.  On this occasion Mrs Freeman spat on her daughter’s window and on another occasion threw a stone at her.  The cases were dismissed upon Mrs Braithwaite promising not to annoy her mother in the future and Mrs Freeman making similar promises.  The child was ordered to be given to the care of Mrs Freeman, as desired by Mr Braithwaite.

[Susan Freeman aged 17 had married John Braithwaite aged 27, in Adelaide, 25 November 1852.  Her daughter, Susan, was born in Adelaide 5 September 1853.  She grew up and married Ephraim George Dorling 15 November 1877.  John Braithwaite died 1 December 1872 at Blinman aged 48.  His wife does not appear in SA Births, Marriages & Deaths records after the birth of Susan.]
