The retiring President D.L. Kellock reported on a financially successful year in which some improvements had been made to grounds and pavilions.  The roof of the main hall was short sheeted.  The large poultry cages were renewed.  The Pony Club sheep-proofed the arena fence and recovered the jumps with timber.
