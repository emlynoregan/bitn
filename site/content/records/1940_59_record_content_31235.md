Obituary.  G.E. Dane died on Tuesday night 22 April after a fairly long illness.  He was universally liked and respected by all sections of the community and regarded as one of Nature’s Gentlemen.  He was born 16 October 1869 in Aylesford in Kent and came to Australia when 3 in search of health.  [Check: this should probably be when 30!]  He tried WA & Tasmania before coming to Burra, arriving in 1900 and resided here till he died.  He set himself up as a teacher of music and boarded at a farmhouse in the district.  He soon had pupils all over the district and travelled first on a bicycle and later on a motorcycle.  Soon he was organising concerts, operettas and comic operas.  Many older residents remember fondly his Pirates of Penzance which drew huge audiences for two nights in Burra.  He united the residents of Clare and Burra in a production of Handel’s Messiah at a time when combined practices involved horse-drawn transport between the two towns.  Through his efforts famous singers like Peter Dawson and Mrs Oldam appeared in Burra and the town gained a widespread reputation for its singers.  He organised an orchestra of 30-40 members which kept going for many years.  Each year he organised a concert for the Burra Hospital and the fees for the invited well-known singers came out of his own pocket, among them Elsie Woolley.  Many people in the town benefited from his generosity and he contributed anonymously to every deserving cause.  Singers he spoke highly of in Burra included the late Miss Alice Pearce, Tot Harris (now Mrs Greenwood), the late Nicholas Tiddy and Billy Hague and as a comic in his operas the late W.J.C. Ewins: of later years W. Spiers, the late Percy Rosman, Nell Pearce and others.  He conducted the Kooringa Methodist choir for 37 years.  He was also a town councillor from 1915-19.  He was also the last of the founders of the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd.  He managed the Burra Talkies for 25 years and was a JP.  He was a keen bowler and a rifleman during the 1914-19 war and audited the Rifle Club books for 12 years.  In WWI he was a staunch supported of the Cheer-up Girls.

On 6 March 1907 he married Miss Muriel Edith Pearce in the Halifax St Methodist Church.  His wife died some years ago.  He is survived by three children: Allan (Adelaide), D’Arcy (Sydney) and Muriel, Mrs Noel Ditty.
