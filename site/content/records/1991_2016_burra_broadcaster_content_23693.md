Plague Locusts are being sprayed around Terowie.  The number of flying adults has increased right across the northern cropping zone of SA.  The spraying is complicated by the harvest now in progress, which means landowners do not want spraying in their area during harvest.  The weather has so far not been conducive to large distance movements and most flights have been a maximum of 20-30 km a day.  Terowie and Whyte Yarcowie areas have so far had only minor crop damage, but greater damage was reported from the Georgetown area.
