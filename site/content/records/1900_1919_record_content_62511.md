Navy Day in Burra was held on 7 November.

The Navy was represented by Captain C.J. Clare CMG, RAN accompanied by Major B. Connor and Mr J. Lawrence of the Pt Adelaide Seamen’s Mission.  A demonstration was held at 3 p.m. in Market Square.  The addresses were to have been from a platform at the decorated rotunda, but the extreme heat drove them to a trolly drawn up in the shade of the shop verandahs.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ band provided music.  Some had asked why a further patriotic effort now, after the war was over.  Captain Clare said the Navy had made the transport of the men in khaki easy and at the cost of hundreds of lives kept the seas clear.  The merchant service had lost 2,500 ships and 15,000 sailors.  Figures for the Navy had yet to be published.  Mr Crewes thanked J.M. McBride for attending. He had rung him and asked him to do what he could to help the noble cause.  A model of The Rose of Lee was auctioned under the bugler system and was obtained by Mr McBride whose bid was £200 of the £236 raised.

A 2½ ft-long model of Captain H. Butler’s aeroplane was then auctioned and went to N.H. Pearse with a bid of £16.  Afternoon tea was presented, buttons sold and a concert held in the evening.  In all £332-0-3 was raised.
