Cr Jennison thought £20 was too much and if money were spent there ‘naturally the same would be expected for the Aberdeen ground.

[The report then appears to me to become confused because when the motion is put Cr Kellaway appears to be the only vote against.  I would have expected him to be the only one for!]

Cr Dow then initiated a discussion about people playing tennis on the Kooringa courts on Sunday and wondered why the Kooringa Club allowed this – those playing apparently not being members.

It was resolved to take steps to prevent Sunday play.

Mr H.W. Mumme asked Council to place a kerbing around the lawns he had established in front of the Burra Hotel.

While complimenting him of his good work, Council was not moved to comply.  The mayor feared the precedence it would set and there was also the fear that pedestrians might trip over the kerbing.

Eventually the matter lapsed.

There was also discussion about the care and maintenance of the Market Square garden.

E. Jettner writes a letter of some ¾ column on Foreign Traders.

‘A Tree Lover’ writes deploring the damage done to a lovely bushy mallee type tree near the Aberdeen swing bridge.  Apparently a hole was bored right through it to attach some sort of support for part of the bridge.
