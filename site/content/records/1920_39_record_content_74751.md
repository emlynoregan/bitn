The 7th Annual Anzac Sports were held last Saturday at Burra Racecourse under the auspices of the RSL.  The slight rain on Friday settled the dust and Saturday was fine.  The gate of over £60 was £40 down on 1938.  Falling attendance was probably due to the lack of motor cycle and midget car events this year.  Though great attractions their cost exceeds the increased takings.  Close finishes were common and times were fast.  Three aeroplanes from Sa Aero Club put in an appearance.  They carried passengers, gave aerobatic displays and dropped balloon ‘bombs’ on moving trucks (with no direct hits scored).  There were children’s events, guessing competitions and sideshows, but the interest in the sports had the sideshows reporting poor business.  As well as cycle and pedestrian races there were sheaf-tossing, high jump, tug-of-war and a series of military events.  Results are printed.
