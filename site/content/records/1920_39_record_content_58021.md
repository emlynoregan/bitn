Tom Canny writes challenging Mr Hawker’s conception of conditions on collective farms in Russia.  For bad living conditions on farms one only has to go to some of the West Coast of SA or to the Murray Flats, to say nothing of the unemployed who are living in humpies on the banks of the Torrens and elsewhere.  ‘I have not heard Mr Hawker’s voice raised on behalf of those unfortunates.’

‘While I would like it known that I condemn the Communistic doctrine, I do not consider it any worse than the other extreme, i.e. Fascism and Nazism.’
