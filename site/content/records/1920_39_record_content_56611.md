Eastview Mine (Rampton’s).  Three men are engaged continuing the south drive, now at 310 ft and expected to break through to the surface on the south side of the hill.  The last 40 ft is in low grade ore.  25 tons of the old dump have been treated at the battery for 2 dwt per ton.  In total, 144 tons here have produced 252 oz.
