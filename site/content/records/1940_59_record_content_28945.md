Mr J.G. Sara retires from active business life.

Nearly forty years ago Mr J.G. Sara of Burra purchased a little business from the late Mr James Tiver, with stock valued at about Â£200.  Today Sara & Co. has stocks valued at thousands of pounds and is one of the biggest and best known stores throughout the north of the state.  On 1 November Mr Sara, at the age of 83 will hand over his share of the business to Mr R.H. Campbell (who has been managing it for some time) and Mr Thomas Pascoe of Adelaide.  Mr Sara has been greatly helped by his wife and his son Mr F.T. Sara, who returned from WA to assist his parents when they first purchased the store.  He will retain a half share and the firm will continue to trade as Sara & Co.
