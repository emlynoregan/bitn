Burra Town Council, 1 June.

The mayor has seen the Treasurer re the Bon Accord Bridge question and the latter is considering the matter.

Cr Butterworth moved that a footbridge be made over the creek at the rear of Mr Bentley’s.  Carried.

Mr Paynter, who is erecting the plant for treating the old slagheap, enquires about a water supply.  He believes he will require about 6,000 gallons per day and that 2/- per 1,000 gallons would be a fair price.  A proposal to supply at that price was carried.
