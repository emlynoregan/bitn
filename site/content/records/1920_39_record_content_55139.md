The other semi-final between St Mary’s Reds and St Mary’s Blues was a farce.  On the first day the Reds with only 9 men scored 86 and the Blues then scored 0 for 123.  On day two due to a misunderstanding some Reds turned up and then left.  The Blues came later and subsequently the Reds forfeited to the Blues.
