Accident/Obituary.  Death of Mr W. Hopkins.

Mr W. Hopkins left Mr Day’s store in Kooringa on Monday to do the usual grocery round at World’s End.  At the gate of the late William Prior’s property his foot slipped while he was boarding the vehicle and became entangled in the chain attached to the pole.  He clung to the underside of the vehicle and called out to the children at the school to stop the horse.  Mr Bruse, who was repairing a fence, caught the van at Mr Bown’s gate.  Mr Hopkins had been dragged a mile along the road.  His clothes had been torn off and his body horribly mutilated.  He died a few minutes later.  He had only been in Mr Day’s employ about three months.  He leaves a wife and three young children.

[Born William Hopkins 27 April 1877 at Kooringa: died 10 May 1909 Hundred of Baldina, residence Kooringa.]
