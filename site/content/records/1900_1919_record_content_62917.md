Burra Town Council

The new council met on Monday, the Mayor Mr S.M. Lane presiding.

The overseer and roadmen were granted 1/- a day extra.

The Town Clerk asked for £20 a year more, but it was decided to combine the jobs of Town Clerk & Inspector and offer it to Mr E.J. Davey at £180.  His old salary was £100.  Mr Wilks, the present inspector was reluctantly given one month’s notice.
