Burra Races were held last Wednesday and were the most successful meeting since the war.  Preparations were disrupted by the dispute with owners and trainers.  Numerous working bees were needed at the course and Mr H. Scott had to resign as Secretary due to pressure of work.  Mr R.A. Bevan stepped into his place and eventually a first class meeting resulted.  Gate takings were c. Â£180 and 27 bookmakers had a record turnover.  The CWA provided a splendid luncheon.  [Results are printed.]
