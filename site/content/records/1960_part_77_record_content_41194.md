Burra Hospital

The Hon. R.C. De Garis, Chief Secretary and Minister of health opened the Alice Collins Theatre and Casualty Block on Friday.  The Vice-Chairman Mr A.J. Ashby introduced the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone, who gave a brief address in which he went through some of the recent history of the redevelopment of the Hospital.  Chairman of the Board Mr R.K. Pearse spoke, saying that since plans were formulated in 1963 $160,000 had been spent in capital outlay and $40,000 in maintenance. The work had been done in three stages.  Stages 1 7 3 had been accomplished through public subscription from appeals [subsidised by Government].  The second stage had been financed by a bequest from the estate of the late Miss Alice Collins who had spent her last four years as an inmate of the hospital.  Mr Pearse then asked Mr De Garis to declare the wing open.  A plaque bearing the words Alice Collins Wing was unveiled by Mr A.K. Hanlin of Burra.

Accident.  A car driven by Mrs A. Cullen and one driven by Mr P. Lockett collided at 7.45 p.m. on the Burra-Burra North Road.  Both vehicles were extensively damaged and Mrs Cullen received a neck injury.

Burra Town Hall.  The floor surface has been of concern for some time and collections of paper and other donations have raised $562.  Council has decided to go ahead with a hard board covering.  The work of preparation, laying and two coats of Estapol has a quoted price of $810.  It is hoped an opening function will raise the $248 gap.

Accident/Obituary.  On Thursday afternoon on the main road near Black Springs a sedan car driven by Mrs R.E. Dewhirst and a utility driven by Mr C.C. Hopgood of Black Springs collided at the intersection with the Merildin chain road.  It was raining at the time.  As a consequence Mr C.C. Hopgood aged 72 was killed and Mr C.K. Hopgood (36) received severe chest and head injuries and died at the Burra Hospital about four hours later.  Mrs R.E. Dewhirst received head, facial and leg injuries and was taken to Riverton Hospital and later to Adelaide where her condition is now described as satisfactory.

[Cecil Charles Hopgood born 14 January 1898 Snowtown: died 1 August 1968 Black Springs.

Colin Keith Hopgood born 12 March 1928 Porter’s Lagoon: died 1 August 1968 Burra, residence Black Springs.]

Accident.  A semi-trailer driven by Mr Robert Rohrlach of Tanunda was severely damaged when its load struck the overhead railway bridge at Burra North at about 5 p.m. on Wednesday.  The load was a large crane jib, which struck the bridge, moving it slightly out of alignment.  Train services were not disrupted, though train speeds slowed to a minimum until repairs were effected.  Damage to the vehicle was c. $800.
