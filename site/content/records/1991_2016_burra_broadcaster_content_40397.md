Gouder Council, 27 January

Council agreed to offer BRTBA a three year contract [to run the Visitor Information Centre] and that the annual contribution in the contract be increased to $80,000.

Agreed to the display of six Council owned Leonard Bence watercolours in the Leonard Bence Room of the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  Leonard Bence will be invited to open the display.

Mt Pleasant Road drainage project has been largely completed.

Storm water control works are being undertaken on the side of Stock Street.

Kingston Street footpath near the Kooringa Hotel is to be replaced with a spray-sealed bitumen surface.

Burra Council Office will be painted [externally] and the front verandah gutter replaced.

The Water Diviner local premiere at the Blyth Cinema was a sell-out, as were the five scheduled shows in the following week, resulting in three extra sessions being scheduled.
