Ernest Crewes writes saying he has little to add as Mr Collins’s letter does not merit reply, but the latter did fail to mention that he was not at the meeting in October which he says was called for his benefit and that I (E. W. Crewes) was voted into the chair.  Mr Collins says he spent four years trying to find out what his position was on the Committee and did not know yet.  If so ‘then he will never know’.
