Jennison Election Committee writes denouncing the contention that he is too young to be Mayor.  Energetic young men are needed everywhere.  Cr Jennison was born in Fiji and his first eleven years were spent there.  His outlook has been broadened by that and by living in three states since and no one said he was too young or inexperienced when he joined the AIF and served in France.  He has three years’ experience as a Councillor.  John Drew was Mayor at 36 and Dr J.I. Sangster Jnr was still younger.  Cr Jennison has developed a successful business with two branches from nothing.  He has not been too young to represent 600 tyre dealers at an all-states conference nor to be President of the RSL sub-branch, or to be a JP.  [At this time he was 35 & would be 36 in January 1934.  The youngest Mayor was Edward Lipsett, who was 30 when elected in 1877, but Dr Robert Brummitt was 32 in 1883, Daniel S. Packard was 33 in 1885 and Stanley Lane was 37 in 1919, so Jennison’s situation was hardly unusual.]
