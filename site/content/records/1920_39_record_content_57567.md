Mongolata

Rev. Donald Redding conducted his usual fortnightly service followed by community singing.

Mongolata Cricket Club held a successful dance on Saturday in Mr G.B. Morgan’s woolshed, with supper in the hands of Mr W. Carpenter.

Mongolata Sports Club gave its second annual report.  Thanks went to Mr G.B. Morgan for allowing the sports ground to be moved to the more suitable site it now occupies.  The ground has been marked out and a bicycle and running track graded.  [Thanks to a long list of helpers follow.]

On the sports day the gate (in charge of Mr Phil Rule) took £3-1-5.  The dance afterwards at Burra made a small profit.  The sports day saw about 80 boys and girls given a bag of food, fruit and sweets.

There have been many departures from Mongolata and the population has fallen from over 120 to about 80.

[The Secretary, W. Carpenter, goes on generally to express his confidence in the field and how he has hopes for a school to be opened.  Social activities continue and thanks are due to Rec. Redding and his band of assistants and to Captain & Mrs Thompson of the Salvation Army.  The entire report extends to about 1 column.]
