The Boy Scouts were conveyed to Norman farm where they had lunch and were then sent on by Mr A.J. McBride to the Gorge where they arrived by noon.  Dinner followed, after which the tents were pitched.  The afternoon was spent swimming and exploring.  Tea was followed by a campfire concert.  The night was cold, but the boys were prepared.  After breakfast and a swim there was a trip down the creek and time was spent cray fishing and swimming.  The party left about 2 p.m. and got home about 5 p.m.
