Law Courts

William Kelly, George Morgan and William Buckley were charged with the assault and robbery of Robert Henderson at the Stone Hut on 19th instant.

Kelly complained that he had surrendered to face a charge of drunkenness and was now in court with two men he didn’t know for a crime he knew even less about, committed at a place he had never been near.  It was explained that he had been identified by Mr Henderson as one of the assailants.

Kelly was fined 5/- for the drunkenness charge and the other charges then proceeded.

Henderson said he had arrived at the Stone Hut about 3 p.m.  He did not know the prisoner Morgan, but Kelly and Buckley were both there.  Kelly had hounded him for £3, due in wages, but Henderson said he had never employed Kelly.  About dusk he went out to let the ostler know he intended an early departure in the morning.  Kelly and Buckley followed him and Kelly struck a blow that rendered him unconscious.  On coming to he found a red pocket book containing some other papers and three £50 orders from Challoner drawn on the secretary of the SA Mining association, was missing.  During the following day he saw Kelly and Buckley still at the public house and they were there when he left on Monday for Gawler, where he reported the matter to police.

Buckley admitted being present, but claimed that he had followed Henderson to prevent him being struck.  He also said Kelly was not the man who struck him.

James Dunn, miner, of Burra Burra identified Kelly and Buckley as having been at Burra, where they were employed by the Copper Co.  Morgan had also been at Burra, but he believed Morgan had left by himself.

Morgan said he had left with Buckley.

The three were remanded until Saturday week.
