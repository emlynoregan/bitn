Tubercular Soldiers’ Soc. Calls for more assistance, as from 1 June 1939 the Soldiers’ Distress Fund ceased payments to TB ex-soldiers, which added £400 to the calls on their funds.  55 men and dependants used Angorichina Hostel in 1939.  A matchfolder sale day will be held in city & suburbs on 1 March & as arranged in country areas.
