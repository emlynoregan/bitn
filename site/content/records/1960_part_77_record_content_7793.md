The Burra Open Golf Tournament was marred by rain, hail, a bitterly cold wind and the threat of snow on Saturday.  Despite this 96 players paid the fee and entered the event, though not all ventured beyond the Club House.  The Treasurer was probably the happiest person on the day, with Â£70 to bank and some rain insurance money to come.
