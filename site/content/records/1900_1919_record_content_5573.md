Thefts.  A group of four travellers was found camped at the back of the Bon Accord Hotel on Tuesday with a broken sherry bottle stolen from the bar nearby.  One of their mates called Noble had earlier been caught stealing a pair of boots from J.T. Walker’s.  Two others had prevailed upon someone to buy them a pair of boots each from T. Harvey’s in Aberdeen – only to turn around and try to sell the same for drinking money.  The group will appear before the bench shortly.
