SA Mining Association

The report for the half year to 30 September 1874 shows the yield from the Burra Mine was 1529 tons 2 cwt 3 qrs for the half year, compared with 1514 tons 4 cwt 2 qrs for the preceding half year.  This is disappointing.  The value of the March quarter’s copper was £6,081 less than the cost of raising it, reduced to £4,103 after allowing for rents etc.  The loss for the last half was £2,162.  In the six months £24,349 was spent in wages and acquiring plant, stores etc. and 1,530 tons of ore was sold to the E & A Copper Co.

Captain Sanders reports on various economies achieved in this period and cost cutting in management.  The workforce has been reduced by 88 hands.  Economical machinery has been erected.

At 30 September they were employing 233 men and boys and 5 officers.

‘In conclusion the Directors state that although they have reduced the expenditure to the lowest possible point, there is better prospect of obtaining profit in the future without the assistance of a much larger capital to prosecute deep workings that they can expect to command.  They have therefore communicated with the London Board of Advice to ascertain their view as to the propriety of either letting the property or submitting it for sale and winding up the association. An answer is expected by the next or following mail, when an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders will be called to take such steps as the nature of the reply may render necessary.  It cannot fail to excite general regret that the once flourishing Burra Burra should have sunk into so unsatisfactory a position.
