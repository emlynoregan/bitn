Editorial on the New Year

He calls for SA to become more diversified and less reliant upon wheat.  SA has now reached the limit of profitable agricultural expansion.  We should turn to production of butter, cheese and bacon and the preserving of fruit, the growth of flax, and olives for oil, and to manufacturing and mining.

1882 opens with the promise of more mining activity at the Yorke’s Peninsula mines and gold finds at Echunga, Barossa, Ulooloo and Waukaringa.  There are hopeful signs of coal near Salt Creek and at Kingsborough’s in the S.E.  There are also possibilities of ostrich farming.

The Editor is amazed that such huge areas of land are devoted to TSRs in SA to encourage stock from Queensland and NSW to compete with SA producers and yet no import duty is charged (unlike NSW & Victoria).

Locally we hope the mine will reopen.  We need a new railway station.  The Council should also ensure the continued improvement of the town.  He was in favour of borrowing to vastly improve the town.  In the coming year a major effort will be the enclosing and planting of the recreation ground, granted by SAMA.  There will be more tree planting.

We are glad to finally have a splendid water supply in Kooringa.

‘In all respects, commercially, socially and intellectually, we believe we are entering upon a prosperous new year.’

Rev. F. Richmond, who has taken charge of St Mary’s in the absence of Rev. H. Howitt, is about to move to Maitland and Rev. W. Marshall replaces him.  Rev. Howitt is expected to return in September.

Professor A. Mitchell, an Aurist and Oculist, is visiting Burra.

Mr H. O. Hopkins comes to Burra as a teller for the National Bank, from Naracoorte.  He is a keen cricketer.

Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School special services last Sunday were well attended and raised over £15.

Burra Amateur Dramatic Society gave a repeat of Milky White, which was well done, but poorly attended.  The society handed over £10 from the two performances to the Institute, and fixtures and furniture worth another £10.

Bishop Short leaves today for England, having retired.

Burra Show Society has called a meeting for next Friday to consider a showground, as it is well to be prepared for the Smelting Yard becoming otherwise engaged.

The Wheeler Troupe is very favourably reviewed.

The Bands of Hope demonstration and picnic passed off very well and the sports and evening entertainment were well patronised.

The Races last Monday in Mr Duff’s paddock at Copperhouse were successful despite the short notice.  [Results printed.]
