The Burra Branch of SA Stockowners’ Assoc. held its AGM in Pearce’s Building 29 July.  President A.B. Riggs welcomed visitors, particularly Glen Hawkes (the SA President) and A.J. (Jim) McBride.  Elected were: President, Mr John Murray; Deputy President, Mr M.G. Stockman and Secretary, Mr H. Binks-Williams.

The matter of the private telephone lines from Eastern Pastoral Stations to Burra was mentioned.  The point made was that ETSA was putting power lines through to Radium Hill and this will have a detrimental effect on the telephone lines.  It was proposed that the PMG be asked to erect a line from Four Mile Government Terminal to the Chalk Cliffs Junction and the Secretary will request Central Office to approach the PMG in Adelaide.

Mr Hawkes then gave a short address followed by Mr A.J. McBride and Mr C.S. Wood, the State Secretary.
