Burra Hospital.  The 108th Annual Report was presented by the Chairman of the Board Mr Harry Quinn.

In the past year stage one of the Fire Protection Project has been completed.  This is a major undertaking.  In the coming year the laundry hot water system will be improved and a safety verandah balustrade erected.  Advances totalling $639,601 were needed over the year and this was within the allocated budget.

[Organisations and individuals who contributed during the year were thanked, as were Meals on wheels and the sewing circle led by Mrs F. Scroop.]

The Aged Hostel Accommodation Committee has begun steps to get hostel-type accommodation for the aged at Burra and an appeal is likely to be launched to supplement costs.

Harry Quinn was re-elected Chairman with Ron Thamm as Vice-Chairman.  John Maidment replaced Michael Scholz who resigned from the Board.
