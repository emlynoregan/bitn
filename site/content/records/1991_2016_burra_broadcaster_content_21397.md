Heavy Load.  A few days ago a 300 tonne generator bound for Penola, and hauled by two prime movers, passed through Burra with a police escort.  It had been unloaded from a ship in Fremantle because there was no crane large enough to handle it in Pt Adelaide.  Another load, the longest ever at 54m x 4m wide will also pass through Burra going from Fremantle to Brisbane via Burra and Blanchetown.  [Photo]
