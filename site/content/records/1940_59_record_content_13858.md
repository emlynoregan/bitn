Rabbit Levy.  An article queries the appropriateness of the increased Government levy of 1/6 lb on rabbit skins.  (An increase from 9d.)  The top price for fur was briefly 11/8 and then, since the levy, only 9/-.  Worse though, the average price is just 4/5 and in poorer country only 3/- lb, which means the Government tax is between 35% & 50% - hardly encouraging.
