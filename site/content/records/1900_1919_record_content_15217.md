Court.

There is a 1 column report of a case of Albert (Alf) Whicker v. Fred Dew of Blue Bell Farm for 5/- wages and 15/- in lieu of notice.  Whicker was formerly employed by Hyland’s Circus.  The case is [for once] genuinely amusing.  Whicker comes across as a rather astute con man, but this time his case was dismissed.
