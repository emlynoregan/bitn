The New Copper Discoveries

Provided the new discoveries are taken up in a bona fide and not a speculative spirit, they must, if proved to be as rich as they seem, be beneficial to every individual interest in the colony.  If the gentlemen who are going about taking out the large special survey are animated by a spirit to truly develop the mine, the operations will benefit the agriculturalists, flockmasters, merchants, tradesmen, mechanics and others in the colony.  To work even a twentieth of the proposed survey would require several hundred miners with wives and families, plus all those required for transport and in the subsidiary employments to which the operations would give rise.

[The article then goes an at length to explore the ways in which the wealth of the whole colony would be increased by a successful mining operation and how it would attract European and British capital to other ventures in the colony.]
