Burra Local Court, 24 January

Max Pearce of Kooringa was charged with speeding in Market Square on 17 January.  The case was dismissed on a series of somewhat legalistic arguments, but one of them is somewhat curious: ‘That there is no rate prescribed within the Corporation of Burra.’

Walter Finch was fined 10/- plus court fees for the same offence.

E.A. Bristow was fined 10/- + costs for parking without lights in Commercial St.

E.T. Williams was fined 5/- + court fees for parking without lights in Bridge St.
