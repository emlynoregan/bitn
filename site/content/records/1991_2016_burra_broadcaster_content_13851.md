The cost of an election if booths were reduced in number to just four would be $5,943.

He felt that the extra cost was well justified by the significantly higher turn-out of voters.

The Burra-Morgan Road is expected to be completed up to five months ahead of schedule at a cost of $19.6 million – perhaps as early as May 1998.  The road was re-opened in July, but motorists are urged to use other routes wherever possible as there are significant delays on the section under construction between the Robertstown turn-off and ‘The Gums’.
