John Burge

A lifetime resident and involved in local and district affairs since leaving school

Council has achieved much in sealing roads and has assisted with getting a new school, boarding facility, swimming pool, sporting complex, a common effluent drainage scheme, undergrounding of power lines and the promotion of tourism

The population will not grow much, but the sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road should increase economic activity

Supportive of heritage listing, but sees that it brings some restrictions and limitations on progress that leads to some resentment

A large area and a small population makes it difficult to keep rate rises down

Has had a 17 year term as Councillor from 1988 and a further 4 years from 1991.  [This doesn’t make sense – perhaps 1988 should read 1968?]

20 years on the Board of Clare Hospital

24 years as Secretary of Farrell Flat CFS

10 years as Secretary of the local Institute

Member & trustee of St Mary’s Church

A Life Member of the Agricultural Bureau.
