The rates were £456-10-6 and the Government subsidy was £140-7-7 which yielded a total income for the year of £764-6-7.  (The only other large source of income was from dog registrations at £72-16-6.)

Waterworks.

The existing lease expires on 31 December and negotiations have begun for a renewal under more favourable terms.  The works, having been in use for several years and the meters needing repair and maintenance, the Council thinks in common fairness the capital account, now £7,658, should be reduced. [To reflect the lower value of the assets being leased.]  A duplication of certain important portions of the plant etc. is necessary to prevent a failure of the water supply in the event of breakages etc.

An extra boiler and spare set of pumps and driving gear should be at the works.  The waterworks assessment has been reduced, but still presses heavily on some ratepayers.

Income for the year 1891	£596-7-6

Expenditure

Interest	£382-18-0

Other	£299-12-10

Total	£682-10-10

Rates yet to be collected should about balance the account.

The main extension to the supply has been to the Public School from Kingston St.

Unpaid Rates.  Rates have not been paid on about 108 allotments in Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Hampton and Millerton.  Ownership is hard to trace, but action to sell the properties to recover the rates will be needed after securing the necessary legal authority.

Railway Crossing.  Despite repeated requests to the Railway Commissioners we have been unable to secure gates for the Bon Accord crossing.  Action has been promised, but nothing has eventuated.

Trees.  In the town 700 trees were planted this year.  Over 400 were placed in No. 2 Reserve at Redruth and the balance filling gaps around the town.  September’s heavy frost has unfortunately killed many of them.  This work is ongoing and has done much to improve the former barren and uninviting appearance of Burra.

The sanitary condition of the town is good.

The cemetery has a credit of £99-10-9, though regrettably much of this is from interment fees this year.  SAMA has this year granted an extension of a strip 100 feet in width on the south side of the cemetery, now being enclosed in a stone wall.

The main road grant of £300 has been expended to the extent of £298-3-8.

In 1885 the Mayor, John Dunstan Jun., impressed on the Midland Road Board the need for a bridge at the Bon Accord ford, but without success.  This year a numerously signed memorial supported by the Town Council and the Mt Bryan, Hallett, Hanson & Booborowie District Councils (But not the Burra D.C.) was presented to the Hon. Thomas Playford calling for a bridge.  A favourable inspection by the Inspector General of Roads, Mr C.T. Hargreaves, resulted in a vote of £1,500 for the work.  Levels are now being taken and work should begin soon so the northern approach to the town will be much improved.

There was a difference of opinion on the validity of some of the standing orders of the Municipal Corporations Act 1890 and this was referred to the Municipal Association for their advice and opinion.  The committee is still ongoing, but the advice was that the standing orders are sufficient and penalties under them are recoverable in the courts.
