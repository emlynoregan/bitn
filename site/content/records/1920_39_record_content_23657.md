Fire.  About 10.30 p.m. on Saturday a two-roomed cottage occupied by the hospital orderly was seen to be alight from end to end.  The brigadeâ€™s efforts were concentrated on preventing the fire from spreading to either the hospital of the new Isolation Ward under construction.  The building was over 70 years old.  Mr Nelson, the porter, lost some money and all his clothes.  It is thought the fire started from an incubator left alight in the building.  Afterwards two tins of kerosene were found in the debris with the wood casings completely burnt, but the oil had not exploded.
