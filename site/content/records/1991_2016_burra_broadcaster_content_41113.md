Burra’s Old Jinker has become the first movable object to be provisionally entered in the SA Heritage Register.

The jinker was constructed in 1851.  It is 40 feet long and was made by Mr Coulls of Hindley Street, Adelaide and built of iron bark timber.  It was first used in 1852 by bullocky Bell Freeman to transport pumping machinery for Schneider’s Enginehouse, which was to replace the previously installed Roach’s 60 inch diameter pumping engine.  The 17 ton engine was drawn by 72 bullocks.  In 1858 leading bullock driver William Woollacott again used the jinker to transport the engine for Morphett’s Enginehouse.  The return trip took two months.  It was sent to Adelaide in 1936 for an exhibition and only returned to Burra in 1962.  It is now housed in a specially constructed shelter in Market Street.
