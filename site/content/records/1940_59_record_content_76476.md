‘Reluctant Ratepayer’ writes expressing difficulty in understanding Cr Lucas’s statement that he was ashamed to vote in favour of the removal of the overseer.  He says the Highways Department has left ratepayers in no doubt that they make money available to Council’s that spend it efficiently and do jobs of which their engineer approves.  Spalding receives £6,000 for 23 miles of main roads and Burra £10,000 for 123 miles of main roads.

Burra Burra Council officers have admitted they cannot cope with our roads with the present grants.  Spalding Council stated that they have been informed that as long as they maintain their standard of work the Highways Department will keep up the finance to do so.  At least half of the Burra Councillors were prepared to find favour with the highways Department, but Cr Lucas, voting as he did, will ensure the taxes etc. we pay will find their way to other Councils in the form of grants.
