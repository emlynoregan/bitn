Letter.  Ann Royal writes concerning Paxton square.  She wonders, since cash flow for maintenance seems to be a major problem, whether using a barter system for maintenance could be one answer.  Could the labour component of a successful tenderer be met with a cash rebate from rates?  [Further details of her idea are printed.]
