A.L. Langsford writes an erudite letter from Adelaide as an outsider praising the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial, but arguing for the removal of the guns as ‘disreputable eyesores of mechanical monstrosities as sicken the sight’.  Communities throughout England and Scotland have dumped such trophies of war.
