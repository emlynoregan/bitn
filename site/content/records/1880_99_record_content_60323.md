W.T. Rabbich responded.  He had come to Burra 30 years ago when a lad and remained ever since.  He was educated, married and raised a family there and had seen many ups and downs for the town, but was proud of the advancement made in the past few years – the beautiful trees, good roads and pathways.  He thanked them and though there were those who politically could not see eye to eye with him, he believed he was leaving the town without a single enemy.
