Fire

A fire started at c. 10 a.m. on 23 December on the edge of the Burra-Morgan Road 200 metres towards Burra North from Ford’s Corner.  It raced across the back of Brewery Hill and jumped the Kooringa Road.  Fanned by an 80 k.p.h. north wind, in two hours it had burnt a strip 10 km long south to Princess Royal.  CFS scrambled two water bombing ‘Air Tractors’ and a helicopter followed.  Eventually more than 700 personnel fought he fire to save eight farm houses from the blaze.  As fire fighters struggled to save three houses on Princess Royal the wind shifted to the west and pushed the fire into inaccessible gullies and over the hills to the east on a 15 km front.  Quick action by firefighting teams saved the houses on this western edge.  Mopping up was mostly done within 48 hours, though some spots took several crews up to six days to completely extinguish.  About 5,500 ha were burnt, of which about a third was unreaped crop.  Surprisingly, only eight large animals were reported killed.  The local management team of Andy Thomas, David Nourse and Chris Reed deserve a lot of praise for the work done under extreme pressure.
