Weather.  Snow in December!

On Monday and Tuesday last week the temperatures neared the century [in °F], but on Wednesday rain set in and on Thursday temperatures were 50-60°F.  Locally at midday there was a heavy fall of hail with sleet.  No snow fell in Burra itself, but at Mt Bryan snow fell mixed with rain for half an hour.  In some places the snow fell more thickly.  Snow with the rain was also reported from ‘Cappeedee’, Hallett.
