Burra Cheer-up Society.  At a meeting last Thursday Mr Crewes said that since his recent suggestion that the Burra Cheer-up Society might take up the cause of the Motor Ambulance there had been objections saying there were other societies around.  There may be, but none had come forward to make any effort after the topic was first suggested weeks ago.  Ultimately it was decided to call a public meeting to see how the appeal could be best handled.
