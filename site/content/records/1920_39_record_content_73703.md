She was a consistent attendant of Kooringa Methodist Church, but after the death of her husband moved to the city to be near her son.  A few weeks ago she fell and broke her thigh.  There were four sons of whom three survive: Wilfred, Hilton (Inspector of Police) and M-C Philip Grow (Pt Pirie).  [Died 11 January 1939 at Adelaide; residence Balhannah.]
