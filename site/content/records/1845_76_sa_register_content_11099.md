Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its first Anniversary on Sunday 27 September and Thursday 1 October.  On Sunday Rev. J.G. Wright preached impressive sermon in the morning and evening and Mr S. Olly gave a fine sermon in the afternoon.  The chapel was very crowded in the morning and afternoon and many were unable to gain entry in the evening.  The children rendered very credible recitations of prose and poetry.

On Thursday the children, headed by a band and carrying suitably inscribed banners, marched through the town.  They ended at the chapel for the customary tea and cakes.  The public tea meeting drew a large crowd and interesting addresses were delivered.  During the year the school has increased from 40 to 100 and can be considered to be flourishing.
