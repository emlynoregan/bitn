Burra RSL AGM

Elected: President, H. Bert Cornelius; Secretary, Bob Spackman and Vice-Presidents, C.E. Beckwith & R.C. Lott.

Retiring President Howard Griffen reported on a year of interest.  The Royal Tour saw a large number on members attend the parade of ex-servicemen in Adelaide and others went to country towns included in the tour.  The Governor was entertained on his visit to Burra.  The Anzac Day service was conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and the Marananga Band led the march and played at the service.  Remembrance Day was observed at the Memorial and there were addresses at Burra High and Primary Schools.  There was also a service in Air Force Week.  The Fancy Dress Ball was generously supported and the Annual Smoke Social was well attended.  A combined Christmas Party with the Air Force Assoc. was very well organised and successful.  Several successful badge days were run.  We continue to support two Legacy Wards.  Tree planting continues with trees donated by Mr R. Murray and they are being watered and fenced.  Five office-bearers were farewelled during the year.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary has continued to give valued support.  The Burra Record is thanked for its publicity.
