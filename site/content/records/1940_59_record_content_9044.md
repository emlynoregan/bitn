Obituary.  Mr John Nickles died in a private hospital in Adelaide last month.  He was a well-known resident of Copperhouse and Burra.  He was born at Copperhouse 2 January 1884, the son of the late John & Sarah Nickles.  At the time of his death he was the oldest inhabitant of Copperhouse. The oldest female born there is Mrs Woodgate of Prospect who turned 92 last month [actually 91].  Mr Nickles was educated at Copperhouse School when Mr Nevin was headmaster.  He was later employed by the Hanson DC and when the Councils merged he continued to work for the Burra Burra DC until he collapsed at work about 2Â½ years ago.  He fought his illness with characteristic pluck and patience.  He and his wife were once prominent in the Copperhouse Tennis Club and in the Burra Association.  He married Miss Sarah Ryder, who was also [born and] brought up at Copperhouse, the daughter of Mr & Mrs James Ryder.  They were married at Norman Farm in 1905.  They have always lived at Copperhouse until Mr Nickles was recently forced to go to the city for further medical advice.  He was a member of the Methodist Church and for eight years Chairman of the Copperhouse School Committee and his wife was the Secretary-Treasurer.  He is survived by his wife and four children: Ella, Mrs W. Lord of Broken Hill; Ronald Nickles, overseer for the Red Hill DC; Dorothy, Mrs A. Jones of Broken Hill and Mr Lester Nickles of Woodville.  There are six grandchildren.
