Ayer’s School marked the end of year at Leighton Hall on Saturday evening when scholars under Miss Crowhurst put on an entertainment that raised £17.  Other people also assisted.  Miss Mary Longbottom opened proceedings with a piano overture followed by Mr R. Fuss who sang The Admiral’s Broom before the scholars appeared.
