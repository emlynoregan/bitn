Vandalism.  Police are investigating the cutting of the ignition wires and other damage to Dr Stevenâ€™s car.  Minor damage has been done before to the wiring of his car, but none this serious.  It is serious enough for anyone, but more so in the case of a doctor who can be called out any time on life-saving missions.
