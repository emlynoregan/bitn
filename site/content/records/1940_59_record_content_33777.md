Local Board of Health

The Primary & High School toilets have been condemned and it has been suggested to the Education Dept. that a flush system be installed instead.

The drain in front of Elder, Smith’s & Topsfield’s [butcher] was getting worse and Mr Topsfield will be advised that no more waste water is to be put down it.  The drain between Pat Dower’s and the Burra Hotel also needs attention.
