Subterranean Clover.  There is an article attributing its discovery to W.A. Howard of Blakiston SA in 1889.  In 1900 after fostering it he harvested seed.  It was then unknown as a commercial fodder crop in Europe or Australia.  He sold 30lb of seed as Trifolium subterranean and died largely unrecognised in 1930.
