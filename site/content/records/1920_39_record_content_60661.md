Burra Town Council, 6 April

The portrait of the late King George V has arrived and is to be hung in the Council Chamber.

Burra Football Assoc. was granted use of Victoria Park for the usual fee of £2-2-0 for the season.

A donation of £1-1-0 was made to the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.

Aberdeen Tennis Courts are unplayable.  The Council had thought of repairing them but initial discussions with the club revealed some difficulties both with respect to the position of the club and that of the Council.  It was resolved to have a further meeting.

Members retiring this year due to the effluxion of time.

Mayor:	Thomas H. Woollacott

North Ward:	R.J. Jeffery

West Ward:	W.C. Sampson

East Ward:	S. Kellaway

The Mayor would like to be re-elected to see Centenary Year plans through to fruition.

Cr Sampson will not seek re-election due to his business taking him away from home so often.

A ton of salt from Porter’s Lagoon will be purchased and spread on paths at the cemetery to keep down weeds.

Burra Golf Associates held its AGM on 1 April.  Elected: President, Mrs J.R. Barker; Vice-President, Mrs D.M. Steele; Secretary, Miss M. Davey; Captain, Miss M.V. Pearce and Vice-Captain, Mrs C. Whittney.

Burra Reunion and Social League met recently in Adelaide.  The Mayor T.H. Woollacott and Cr Kellaway attended.  It was thought the town should be represented at both the September and December pageants in Adelaide.
