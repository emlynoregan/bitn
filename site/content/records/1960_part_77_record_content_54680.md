Mrs Ruby Rowe has donated the trolly and other items used by her late husband* in droving, to John Hanrahan of Naracoorte aged 81, so that he can return to droving.  He had received plenty of offers of work in the Naracoorte District, but Mrs Rowe’s offer was the only one to supply a vehicle and equipment to set him up for it.  Mrs Rowe’s gift included harness, three tents, tarpaulins, leggings, leather gloves, hurricane lamps, ropes etc.  The trolly left Burra by rail on Thursday.

[* Jack Birkenhagen Rowe 1907-68.]
