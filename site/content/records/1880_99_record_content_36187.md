The rule that ballot boxes can only be opened at the chief polling place in the electorate seems quite silly when they could be opened locally and the results telegraphed and if necessary then resealed and despatched at leisure.  The following shows the folly.  Last Wednesday the Renmark box was sealed and Trooper Tate immediately started for Morgan on horseback, thrice changing horse en route - a distance of about 75 miles.  He arrived in time to catch the train to Kapunda on Thursday morning, another 50 miles.  Then it was horse to Tarlee and thence to Burra by train, another 50 miles.
