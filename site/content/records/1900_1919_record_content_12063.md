Douglas Methodist Church held its anniversary on 20 November with the tea meeting on 23 November, preceded by a game of cricket.  J. Kellock, the treasurer, reported that £24 had been paid off the debt which now stood at £6 and there is sufficient already in hand to pay this off when it falls due on 30 September next.  A men’s working bee will soon erect a new fence around the property.
