Obituary.  Louisa Sophia Doretta Schultz died at Petersburg on 1 February and an inquest decided her death from cancer might have been accelerated by some irritant administered under the direction of Dr Alfieri.  The doctor and a companion recently visited Burra as ‘The Roman & American Specialists’.  It is believed police will take out a warrant for Dr Alfieri’s arrest for manslaughter.

[Registered as Schulz, died 2 February 1895 aged 40.  Born Roennfeldt.]
