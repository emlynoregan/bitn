Local Board of Health

Ralph Hill was re-appointed as scavenger.

Central Board of Health visited Burra last Friday and Saturday and met with the Town & District Councils.  There was no serious objective of the visit, merely a desire to keep in touch with the Councils.  With modern sanitary conditions typhoid outbreaks were rare and the biggest problem now faced was TB.  This was difficult to control because it was often not diagnosed for a long period and this gave a long period during which sufferers could be unconsciously spreading infection.  Early reporting was essential.  Dr Steven said in his twelve years in Burra there had only been on typhoid case.
