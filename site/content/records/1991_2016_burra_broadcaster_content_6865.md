Redbanks Reserve

Last week a major operation was mounted to remove car bodies from the reserve.  Approximately 400 car bodies were recovered from the ravine on the north side of the park.  Most had been dumped in the 1960s and 1970s.  They were recovered by a crane from Clare Valley Waste Service.  A significant amount of associated rubbish remains.  Simsmetal has used a mobile crusher to reduce the bodies into flat lumps of metal.  By Friday two semi-trailers were en route to Adelaide with scrap metal, the sale of which will pay for the operation.  Redbanks still bears the scars of abuse from motorcyclists.  Consultants are preparing a management plan and this should be completed by September.

It is expected the reserve will be closed for some time, but will eventually be opened again so that people will be able to enjoy its permanent water holes, red cliffs and fine stands of mallee and sites of archaeological significance.  It was declared a reserve on 26 November 1993.  Some limited use of the reserve is expected to be permitted soon.
