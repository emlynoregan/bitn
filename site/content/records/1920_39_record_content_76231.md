Burra Improvement Society.  Last week at the Institute the Mayor said one key to improving the town was the improvement of roads leading to it.  R.T. Bowles read the proposed constitution.  The objects of the society he said were to co-operate with the Town & District Councils for better roads, to publicise Burra, to move for universal Saturday afternoon closing and to run a carnival in aid of the swimming pool etc.  F.T. Sara was appointed President with R.T. Bowles as Treasurer.
