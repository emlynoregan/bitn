Mr M.W. Bednall advised that the conveyance of the Burra Institute from the Trustees to the Corporation of Burra had now received assent.  The mortgage was Â£3,000, on which the Council had to pay interest.  He advised that on occasion the Council had substantial credit in its trading account with the Bank of Australasia [Asia in the paper] and this could be set off against the mortgage, saving considerably in interest over a twelve month period.  He suggested a discussion with the manager of the Bank of Australasia Mr M.G. Dobson before the matter was settled with the State Bank.
