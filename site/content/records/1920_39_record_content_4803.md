Mt Bryan Soldiers’ Memorial

I.J. Warnes laid the foundation stone for the Mt Bryan Soldiers’ Memorial on 13 July.  W.J. Quinn presided.  Mr Warnes’ absence in Europe had delayed the ceremony.  The hall was decorated with violets and wattle blossom.  Mr Quinn explained there would be two rooms erected.  The one to the right would be devoted to the boys who fell and it would contain the Roll of Honour.  To the left would be the club room and library.  Of the population of 340 in Mt Bryan 47 had enlisted and 12 had paid the supreme sacrifice.  Mr Warnes said he hoped to see in the Memorial Room an enlarged photo of every boy who fell.  He was anxious that the memorial gave something for the living as well as honouring the dead.  He spoke of his recent visit to the devastated areas of France and Belgium.  He spoke movingly too of the war cemeteries he had visited.  He had visited Ray Flower’s grave.  Mr Hawke MP then spoke followed by Mr Jenkins MP, Mr Dixon MP, Mr E.W. Crewes and Rev. Goldney.  Money collected on the day amounted to £217.
