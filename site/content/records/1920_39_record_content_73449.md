Burra High School.  The Annual Concert & Prize Distribution.

The event was severely curtailed by the epidemic of gastric influenza which afflicted both staff and students.  Nevertheless on 20 December a varied and enjoyable program was presented and the main item cut was the Chinese play, whose main cast members were afflicted.  The concert is reviewed in a little over ½ column.  Due to the heat Dr Steele was brief in his speech as Chairman of the High School Council.  He thought that this would be the last such assembly at the Institute, as by this time next year the school would have its own assembly hall.  He spoke of the opportunities offered by education.  Referring to the departure from town of Mrs G.H. Dow and Rev. Redding he praised them both for their contributions to the High and Primary Schools.
