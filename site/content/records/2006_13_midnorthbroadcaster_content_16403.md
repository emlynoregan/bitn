Roy Sachse of Robertstown writes to point out some of the positive facts about wind farms:

AGLâ€™s donations to local community.

Employment in manufacturing and installation.

No illnesses or reported deaths have been investigated by a coroner.

The low noise generated is insignificant according to EPA report in the Advertiser 5 February 2013.

Coal is dirty & gas expensive.

Nuclear is not safe to use and generates waste to be stored for hundreds of years.

I have visited the Waterloo site often and have failed to hear significant noise or vibrations.

The panel assessing impact needs to be made of independent thinkers and not bow to a vocal minority.

One local resident claims that a noise of 30Db gives kids high blood pressure, when 30Db is hardly a whisper.

Near our house there is a 275KV, double circuit transmission line some 1.5 km from our residence.  With strong northerly winds there is a constant howl, but we have adapted to it.

Also b-doubles thundering past our place in the early morning apply exhaust brakes, but again we have adjusted to it.
