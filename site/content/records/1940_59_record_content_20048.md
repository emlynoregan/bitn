Obituary. A Return Thanks Notice reveals the death of Ern Bishop of Hanson.

[The only likely death I can trace was that of Herman Bishop who died 20 December 1944 at Hanson, aged 54, though a Return Thanks Notice of 65, 2, 16 January 1945, page 2, says he was Hubert.  There is a birth for Herman Bishop on 11 May 1890 near Yongala Station.]
