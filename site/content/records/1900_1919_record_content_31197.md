Obituary.  Thomas Pearce, son of the late S. Pearce of Leighton was injured at Mt Bryan on the Thursday prior to Christmas Day when he slipped while getting onto a wagon loaded with 50 bags of wheat.  The wheel smashed one leg to pulp from knee to ankle and took the big toe off the other foot.  He was sent to Burra Hospital by goods train and died from shock the following morning about an hour before his wife arrived from Adelaide.  He is also survived by two small children.

[Born 1 April 1869 at New Baldry: died 21 December 1911 at Kooringa, residence Cheltenham.]
