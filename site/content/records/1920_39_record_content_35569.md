Harrold J. Button replies to A.B. Riggs’ criticism of his assessment for the Burra DC.  As the new assessment has not yet been adopted it would be improper to argue the point publicly, but he objected to any insinuation that primary producers had fallen between two stools and were being exploited by the assessors.  Mr Riggs, he says, seems to be casting reflections on the intelligence of the Burra DC Councillors: ‘It seems to me that I was not the assessor a certain section of the community wanted, and this opinion has been further impressed on me by the utterances of certain gentlemen before the assessment was made.’  He says that since his new assessment was made various others in SA have been announced and the most drastic cut among them is 25% for Crystal Brook.
