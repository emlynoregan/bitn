Editorial.  The editor considers that since council amalgamations in 1997 the ‘local’ element in Local Government has seriously weakened.  Councillors have less impact on decisions and policy and power has moved to highly paid administrators and higher government direction.  If community consultation is held, it seems to have little effect – see consultation on draft budgets for example.
