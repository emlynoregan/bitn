Obituary.  William Baynes died on Friday 10 June at Booborowie.  He was born at Castle Camps in Cambridgeshire in July 1851 and came to Australia in the Caroline in 1855.  He farmed for many years at Baldina.  He was an active worker for the old Baldina Church and Sunday school.  They moved to Booborowie in 1910 where he carried on farming and dairying.  He married Miss Isabel Cornegia , second daughter of the late Simon & Margaret Cornegia of Kooringa who survives with a family of four sons and four daughters: Messrs Oliver, Harry, Hurtle, & Arthur, and Mesdames C. Dewhirst (Broken Hill) & Hockley (Semaphore) and the Misses Hilda & Florrie Baynes (Booborowie).  Two grown up daughters died recently, which seriously affected Mr Baynesâ€™ health.  [Bertha Baynes died 4 December 1918 and Ada (Mrs T.J. Casey) died 24 July 1920.]
