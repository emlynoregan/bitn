W.H. Hardy writes complaining that the Wallaroo Times has published an article supporting the stance of the Commissioner of Public Works re the Burra Waterworks.  He wonders if the Times knows how Burra Corporation has been fleeced by paying for nearly £9,000 on an account that should have been only £4,000 to £5,000.  The editor of that journal needs to get his facts right.
