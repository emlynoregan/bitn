[Elsewhere the paper reports he had c. £500.]  He was not ill on Monday.

Charles R. Forder reported speaking to the deceased about 8 a.m.  He said when Mrs Edwards came looking for him she expressed the concern that he was going mad, in that he was becoming obsessed with talking about work.

Forder further said he believed the deceased was troubled about not getting employment, though he believed Edwards and his wife lived comfortably together.

L-C Richard Noble described how the search party, comprising John Henry Richardson, August Mill and himself, had found the deceased apparently sitting down against a corner post with his head against the wire fence on section 3031 of the Hundred of Kooringa.  He was hanging by the neck be the rope given him by Charles Forder.

[Evidence was given that the rope was returned to him from a horse Forder had shot for the deceased.]

The body was in a state of decomposition and had apparently been dead about two days.

The verdict was that death was by strangulation while in a state of temporary insanity.
