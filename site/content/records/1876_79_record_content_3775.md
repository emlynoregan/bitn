Remove all loose earth etc.

Someone to be employed to keep the place in order for £12 p.a.

That Jeffrey Pearce be paid for a 200 gallon tank in the cemetery.

"That a light trellis arbor, with a suitable roof, be erected, available for, funerals on wet days, and which, when overgrown with creepers, would be also an ornament to the cemetery."

That the remaining 100' of ground belonging to the cemetery be enclosed by moving the wall that distance out.
