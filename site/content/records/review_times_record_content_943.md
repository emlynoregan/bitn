Burra Community Library has received the official approval of the Minister of Education, Dr Hopgood.  As a result the library will offer the full range of services as part of the Public Library System.  The Institute Library will be dissolved and a branch library will be established at Booborowie.  The actual establishment will depend on completion of the school rebuilding program and availability of funds for the resource centre-library.

Mr John Barton, the new chemist in Burra, who has taken over from Mr Odgers, has also taken over the Adelaide Building Society Agency, which Mr Odgers had since October 1974.  Mr Barton enjoys outdoor life, especially camping in the Flinders Ranges and has been an Apexian for many years.  At Port Augusta he was manager for Carrig Chemists.  Originally from Adelaide, he is married with three children.
