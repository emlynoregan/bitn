Unemployment.  The Farrell’s Flat correspondent reports:

‘Unemployment appears to be rife in the city, but evidently is not confined to Adelaide only.  A while ago here a gentleman advertised for a tradesman and in a very short time had about twenty applications from all over the country.’

An advertisement for a farm hand got ‘about forty enquiries’.
