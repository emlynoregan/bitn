Marriage.  On Thursday at World’s End Miss Johanna Louisa Martha Rooke married Frederick William Duldig.  These are the children of some of the most enthusiastic toilers of the soil in the eastern country and their farms are models of ingenuity and hard work.  Machinery, horses, cows, pigs and fowls are all cared for meticulously.

The marriage was carried out in true German style.  A large number of traps assembled at Mr Rooke’s at about 12 o’clock where the festive part of the ceremony took place.  A start was then made for the Baldina Church.  Horses, traps and whips were decorated with yards of ribbon, with green the favourite colour.  An hour and ten minutes drive got the party to church.  The church was handsomely decorated reflecting to the credit of Miss C. Kickebusche.  The ceremony was performed by Rev. T. W. Leidig.  The eight mile return trip, as is the general rule, saw drivers attempt to pass each other and the journey took only half an hour before the traps passed under a large arch made at the gate.  The pedestrian entrance to the celebration was also arched and in true German style no one was admitted by five little girls dressed in white with blue sashes, until they had placed something in the hat.  The seventy to eighty guests then partook of a sumptuous spread in a tent some 50-60 feet long. Singing and music followed with games and then tea, after which there was an evening of singing, recitation, music and choruses, all nicely rendered.  Mr Duldig amused the gathering with his comic recitation of The Baker and Mr R. Pfitzner also entertained with his German and English recitations.

The bride was dressed in a beautiful black lustre nicely trimmed while on the crown of her head was an orange blossom wreath and a long fall almost touched the ground.  At 11.30 p.m. a large spread that would have done credit to any banquet in the state was provided – the tables laden with every kind of eatable.  The interior of the tent had the appearance of a magic cave.  Custom places the couple under the care of their respective parents until the bride exchanges her orange blossom for a hat and the groom puts on a cap.  The rest of the night passed pleasantly with refreshments constantly served, and on Friday morning visitors began to return to their homes, though some remained to complete the third day’s ceremony.
