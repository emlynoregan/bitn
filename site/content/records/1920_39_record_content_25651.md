Burra Town Council,

The Hydraulic Engineer is considering the size of the mains in parts of the town.

Road Beacons Ltd was given permission to put up direction signs in the town.

Permission was granted for the erection of a wood and iron photo studio at the rear of F. Spencer’s shop.

There was debate over various minor maintenance matters and concern over the abnormally high crown of the road on the Bon Accord Bridge.  The sides are to be shouldered with tarred metal.

Cr Harris said the idea of ranking in Market Square had been a failure.  Considerable debate about parking in Market Square then followed.

Cr Riggs moved the by-law be enforced.  Carried.

A rate of 2/6 in the £ was declared.

The cost of making Railway Terrace is to be borne by all three wards.

Council considered buying a motor lorry.  Cr Pearce thought there were various problems.  Some of the quarries were not accessible to motor lorries, nor were some private yards and a garage would have to be built.  The matter was finally referred back to the Finance Committee for further consideration.
