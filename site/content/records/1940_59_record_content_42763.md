Football Saturday at Burra Racecourse.  A match was played in aid of Red Cross between Old-Timers and the Present Burra Players.  Over £20 was raised.   Old-Timers 6.16 defeated Present Players 4.6.

[Though inexplicably Present players’ score as cited decreased from 3.3 at half time to 3.2 at three-quarter time.]
