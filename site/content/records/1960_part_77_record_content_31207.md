Mr E.W. Dunhill celebrated his 75 years as a local preacher for the Methodist Church with a service at Redruth Methodist Church last Sunday.  He spoke on the subject ‘All Men Seek Thee’.  Rev. M.A. Lind on behalf of the Methodist Church of Australasia presented Mr Dunhill with a certificate.  The service was followed by a luncheon.  His service is a record in Australia and possibly in the world.
