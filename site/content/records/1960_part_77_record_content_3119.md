P.H. Quirke MP writes to advise that a greatly increased demand for water at Whyalla by BHP has occasioned a change of plans in the proposed duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  As a result preparatory work has temporarily been halted.  An official statement will be issued shortly and nothing has yet been decided about any change in the role of the pipeline.  Although people who expect to receive supply are naturally concerned Mr Quirke suggests that they wait for the official statement before taking any action.

The Wheat & Woolgrowersâ€™ Association will hold a meeting at Booborowie on Monday 1 August to choose delegates for Mid North and Central Conferences and to discuss the pipeline situation.
