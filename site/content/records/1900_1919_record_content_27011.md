Mr R. Gull of the SAR has been transferred from Mt Bryan to Adelaide after a stay of three years.  He will be missed as a local preacher in the Methodist Church, leader of the local Band of Hope and a leading member of the Endeavour Society.  He was for a time Secretary of the Mt Bryan Athletic and Tennis Clubs and a prominent member of the Aberdeen Football Club.  He was presented with a suitably inscribed travelling bag.
