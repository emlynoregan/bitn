Obituary.  Mr R.A. Lynch died on Monday morning after an illness of three weeks.  He was known to a legion of friends as Con.  He was born at Gundagai NSW in 1878, the son of Mr & Mrs William Lynch, who were farmers of the area.  After primary school he was employed at the local Stock Inspectorâ€™s office for two years and then in 1898, aged 20, he left NSW for the goldfields of WA.  He first found employment in Perth, before going on to Southern Cross as a billiard marker and hairdresser.  He was an expert billiard player.  He also spent several years at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie.  In 1915 he came to Adelaide and took a lease on the Royal Admiral Hotel in Hindley Street until 1921, when he took over the Pinnaroo Hotel where he was widely popular.  After that he had a twelve month holiday in Queensland and NSW before taking the Kimba Hotel for seven months.  He then came to the Commercial Hotel in Kooringa and held it for ten years.  For twenty years he was a member of the ULVA and a member of the Committee of Management since 1931.  He took a great interest in local sport and sponsored the Draught Horse Race at the Anzac Sports.  He assisted generously in charitable affairs.  He married Miss Adeline Moore of Kooringa, who survives with two daughters and one son: Melva Mrs Con. Samuel, Miss (Nurse) Edna Lynch and Jack Lynch. Jack is still in hospital following an operation for appendicitis.  There is one grandson.

[Died 11 May 1936 Kooringa.]
