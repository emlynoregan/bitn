Mr E.J. Harris has suggested the Council try to get control of the creek huts uncovered by Charles Grow.  They are probably unique in Australia and illustrations of them and of the Mine Pool appeared about a fortnight ago in the Sydney Mail.  The owner is currently digging out a much larger ‘cottage’.  Mr Grow does not seem anxious to sell, but we think he might be persuaded to leave the title to Council in his will and to act as caretaker till then for a consideration.
