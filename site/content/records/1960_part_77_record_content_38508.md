Burra Burra Show Inc, AGM

M.G. Stockman reported on the 93rd show [It was nothing like the 93rd!] opened by Hon. C.R. Kelly MHR on 7 October 1967.  With a new record number of entries it was a great success.  Horse in Action Section was again the highlight. Wool entries were satisfactory despite the poor season.  The sheep pavilion was nicely filled.  Flowers were very good again despite the dry season.  The district schools put on a good display and the Industrial Displays were numerous and comprehensive.  The Agricultural Pavilion was well filled with produce, vegetable, cookery, art and needlework.  Poultry and birds were well represented and dog and goat entries are increasing each year.  Many thanks go to the stewards and convenors and to the new secretary, Julie Sara.  Financially it was a success and the overdraft is gradually being reduced.
