Obituary.  A man named Fritz Martin, a journeyman tinsmith working at Messrs Jones & Boulder’s  at Kooringa, was suddenly taken ill with vomiting and died within half an hour.  He was noted for drunken habits and is supposed to have died from heart disease.  A jury found a verdict in accordance with the above facts and that death had been accelerated by drink.

[This would appear to refer to the registration in SA Deaths CD of Frederick Adolphus Marthan who died 17 December 1869 Kooringa aged 49.]
