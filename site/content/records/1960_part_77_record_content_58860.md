The Bushranger Baker (Continued) By Ian Auhl.

A report from the SA Register newspaper of 30 October 1871.

The desperado was held in Redruth Gaol.  A man named Dolson also in prison on a charge of horse stealing managed to feign illness and was placed nearer to Baker, doubtless in order to speak to him.

Gaoler Perry overheard the pair planning to escape by forcing a hole in a lath and plaster ceiling with a wooden ford and thence to remove a sheet of roofing iron to effect an escape.  Perry heard them wrench a form from its mortice and replace it, preparatory to the escape.  Next day he placed the men in irons.  On Monday a search found that Dolson had concealed a hammer in his boot.  Baker asserted his intention to escape on his overland journey to NSW, where he faced charges of stealing four horses from Mt Murchison, robbery under arms at Cobham’s Station and theft of a revolver, gun and 4 or 5 horses.  A man named Edwards and Mr Curtis of the Pig & Whistle Inn at Kooringa was there at the time.  Bertram, who had since been hanged, was with him and was foremost in the action while Baker kept guard.  The horses on which he came down were stolen from O’Leary in the North East, the owner residing at Pallammicca.  On his way down from the Barrier Ranges the bushranger had 2 revolvers conspicuously in his belt and £3 given him by a hawker and it is said others also handed him money.  On his way to Burra he proposed to a person well known in Kooringa to join him and they would soon make £200 or £300 each.

(Paper report ends.)

Baker was taken from Redruth Gaol in November and escorted to Adelaide.  The judge in Adelaide heard the charge and ordered him taken to Wilcannia for trial, in the custody of Constable Murphy.  He was placed in irons and travelled to Kapunda by rail and thence to Wentworth on the Murray for delivery to the NSW police.  Murphy had little sleep on the four day journey and handed the bushranger over to Constable Makin of Booligal for transfer to Wilcannia.  On 18 December he was tried at Wilcannia in a crowded court.

Baker remained alert and defiant and put on the appearance of impudent bravado.  He cross-examined each witness and complained to the judge about brutal treatment from his police escort.  He was found guilty and remanded to Bourke for sentence.  Constable Murphy was again in charge of the transfer by coach for 200 miles.

It is reported that at Dasham and McGovern’s Tankarooka Station 75 miles up the Darling River he attempted to escape, although chained.  He broke the handcuffs, struck Murphy twice on the Temple and kicked him in the stomach.  Murphy got him by the throat and held him down and was assisted by Captain Parker of the steamer Kennedy.  Baker’s hands were then strapped behind his back.  He was placed in the mail conveyance and after some time, at the prisoner’s entreaty, his hands were released.  They reached Bourke on Sunday between 3 and 4 p.m.  Constable Murphy deserves great praise for his pluck and skill in handling such a ruffian.

Baker served three years hard labour at Bourke.  The robbery under arms charge had been dropped, as it was the late William Bertram who had pointed the revolver each time.  As far as can be discovered his bushranging days finished at Bourke.
