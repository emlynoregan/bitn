Elected were: President, Mrs S. Kirt; Vice-Presidents, Mrs L. Jennison & Mrs C. Stockman; Secretary, Mrs A. Webster; Assistant Secretary, Mrs M. Alderson and Treasurer, Mrs M. Broad.

The President reported on four main projects for the year.

New curtains were hung in the school library.  They are lined to make film projection possible in the day time.

A new typewriter was purchased.

The publication of a recipe book for which many thanks go to Mrs Ray Alderson for her editing work and to the Grade VII children who canvassed the town and sold $100 worth of the books.

(Items 1 & 3 were subsidised by the Education Department.)
