Burra Rifle Club

Improvements have been made to the range to enable the conducting of an Open Prize Meeting on Anzac Day.

The club is trying to increase the roll of efficient members.  The Defence Department allows 300 rounds of ammunition worth 16/6 and 5/- cash as an efficiency grant for every member who fires three separate rounds of eight shots on three separate days.  Any youth over 16 can qualify.

[The nature of the improvements is not specified, except to say they affected range safety.]
