Editorial on Council Matters & the Mayor’s Report.

It praises the role of the Town Clerk and is averse to his salary being cut, though the writer questions why he was paid £10 more than he asked for.  He also questions the need for an overseer who was kept on with nothing to oversee in the latter part of the year.
