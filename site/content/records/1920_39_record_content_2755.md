Mr Warnes said the Club had always used the Society’s things and vice versa and the Club’s letter should not have been written.  Mr Radford said ‘the tone of the Club’s letter was certainly not nice and calculated to rub the wrong way’, but he also observed that ‘the reply would not be oil on troubled waters’.
