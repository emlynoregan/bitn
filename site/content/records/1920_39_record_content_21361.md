Redruth Court, 15 November

George Shattock was charged with driving a car while drunk on 2 November. His vehicle struck the back of two cars and a bus parked near the Institute.  The car continued to the post office and was pulled up on the right hand side of the road.  It then drove off leaving behind the left hand side rear door and the hood lying on the roadway.  It stopped at the Mine Bridge where two approach rails on the left hand side were broken and a parapet corner stone dislodged.  The evidence goes on for over two columns and the case is dismissed on the grounds of reasonable doubt.  The driver produced witnesses to show a defective steering gear (though not enough to make the car undrivable) and he claimed a stuck accelerator.
