Burra National Trust needs your help in developing the end cottage of the Kingston St row of Paxton Square near the bridge as a typical cottage of circa 1850-70.

The cottage is to be known as Malowen Lowarth (Hollyhock Garden).  The Trust would appreciate any suitable Cornish relics that would suit a cottage of this period or a pot plant typical of the time; to be transplanted into the garden.  Examples would be hollyhock, lavender, violet, honeysuckle, old style geraniums, daisies, marigold, parsley, thyme, fennel, mint, sage, rhubarb, garlic, saffron, ivy and apple.
