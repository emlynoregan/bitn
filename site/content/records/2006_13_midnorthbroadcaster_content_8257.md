Booborowie Community has won $20,000 for being named Best Never Heard of Town by Channel Seven’s ‘Sunrise’ program.  Last Wednesday morning more than 150 residents welcomed the popular weather presenter Fifi Box.  Local resident, Heather Davey, who had entered the town in the competition, was contacted on Monday morning with the news that they had won.  The community will get together to decide how to spend the prize money.  [Photo]
