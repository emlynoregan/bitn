Burra Swimming Pool.  In answer to a question in Parliament, the Minister for Education, the Hon. Trish White said that the Joint-Use Agreement would be forwarded to Council this week for its consideration.  An easement for draining purposes was also being prepared and should be finished in two weeks.  An agreement with SA Water is also needed as only one sewer service feeds both the school and the swimming pool.  Council Planner, John Brak says that even if all this goes smoothly there is no certainty that a contractor can be found to do the tiling in time for the seasonâ€™s opening.
