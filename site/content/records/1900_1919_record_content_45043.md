Redruth Police Court was so hot last Wednesday that the SM, Mr W.J. Hinde, permitted those present to remove their coats – clerks, press and members of the profession.  Several of the windows could not be opened and the furniture ‘is absolutely obsolete’ said Mr Hinde.  A year ago SM Mr S.J. Mitchell made similar observations.
