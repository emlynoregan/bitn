He then worked for Dr Brown of Buckland Park as a bullocky till March 1859 when he moved to Stony Gap where his father had taken land, but the year was exceedingly dry and stock had to be fed on Sheoak etc. which caused sickness.

The homestead was alongside the little back country church (since demolished) and the family were staunch supporters of Methodism.
