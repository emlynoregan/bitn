Goyder Council is looking into reducing the number of rubbish dumps in its area.  Kerbside collection is also being investigated – at resent this is only done in Burra.  A review of recycling will also be undertaken.  Council will seek funding to seal Kooringa road (from Kooringa to Ford’s Corner).  And also the road from Farrell Flat to Mintaro and Garden Hill (Inspiration Point) Road at Robertstown.
