The name Burra is still of doubtful origin, but much of the evidence suggests a Hindustani origin.  The name was first used in 1843 by Captain Charles Frome, Surveyor General of SA – two years before copper was discovered.  In his Northern Expedition sketch book he has a water colour entitled ‘Shepherd’s Hut on the Burra Creek’.  The hut is undoubtedly that of William Streair, who first found copper on the present Princess Royal property.  He worked for James Stein, who in 1843 held a lease along the Burra Creek and Indian coolies worked for him and gave the name Burra Burra to the creek – it being Hindustani for big-big or great-great.  Streair’s hut was near the present Princess Royal homestead.  The directors of Sammie first called their mine Wheal Grey after the Governor, but soon changed it to the Burra Burra Mine.  The directors always assumed it to be a Hindustani name without giving a reason.  Later it was suggested it was of native origin, but the early evidence points to the Hindustani origin.  The collection of towns around the mine gradually came to be called ‘The Burra’, though the name was not used officially until after the opening of the railway station in 1870 and did not come into local use until after the foundation of the Corporation in 1876.
