Too many differences in types of paving – some of which are slippery when wet.

Unsafe drains.

Lighting is poor in both power and design.

Public space is too disjointed, with too much bitumen.

There is inconsistency in the width of crossovers and many lack handrails.

Poor signage, and inconsistent in style.

The Post Office is an eyesore and doesn’t fit in the heritage core of the town.

Trucks backing into Landmark are disruptive/dangerous.

There is a lack of designated parking for caravans, coaches and 4WD vehicles.

There is a perception that the Council Car Park area is not open to the public.

Traders park in front of their shops.

There is a need for greater pedestrian safety in Commercial St.

The jinker should be more prominently displayed; either near the Mine entrance or in Market Square and should be better protected and lit.

The present jinker site would make a good coach parking bay.

Alfresco dining areas could be developed in Market Square.

Market Square needs better landscaping and public furniture.

Some people wanted Market Square and best Place to remain basically unchanged.

In particular people wanted to retain:

The stone kerbing

Angle parking

The rotunda rose garden

Wide streets

Idea 1 seems to have attracted most favourable comment.

Idea 2 was the least favoured because of the problems generated by high speed traffic coming round the corner from Commercial Street

Idea 3 was favoured by those wanting little change.

At Best Place the main changes wanted were:

Better lighting

Better signage

Lower speed for through traffic (presently 60 km/hr)

Most favoured changes were:

Clearing of vegetation from around the old Redruth Bridge

Landscaping the area behind the Royal Exchange Hotel

A realignment of the bike track to loop over and around the Redruth Bridge

Detailed plans will now be developed.
