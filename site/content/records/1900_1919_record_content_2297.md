Burra Town Council.

Street lighting will be increased in 1901.  A lamp is to be fixed on Redruth Bridge and one on Lewis’s Bridge.   The East Ward footbridges are to be repaired.

Tenders are called for painting the seats and mortuary at the cemetery.

Market Square pump is to be repaired.

It has been decided to continue leasing the Burra Waterworks on the same basis as now.  [From the Mayor’s annual report this would mean as monthly tenants.]
