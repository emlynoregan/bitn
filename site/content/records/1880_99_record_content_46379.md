Inquest on 13 August into the fire at J.A. Watt’s store adjoining Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s in Kooringa.  J.D. Cave, coroner and John Sampson, foreman of the jury.

J.A. Watt:

Am a draper in Kooringa and a resident of Aberdeen.  On Wednesday last closed the shop and went to dinner at Pressick’s and then to the rifle range, returning to Kooringa about 5.30.  Left rifle etc. at the Commercial Hotel and was driven home.  Around 5.10 a.m. was aroused and told the shop was on fire.  Got there as soon as possible to find the roof had fallen in and the place gutted.  The premises are on a lease from T. Parks Sen.  The stock is insured by the Northern Fire Insurance for £600 and the building for £200, the verandah for £30 and the fixtures and window for £100.  At the stock-take in February stock was £384.  No idea how the fire started.  Have often complained to Mr Lewis of smoke issuing from the wall of his office into the shop.  He had it attended to, but it made no difference.  The fireplace in the shop was not in use.

Mrs Matilda Polkinghorne:

I reside on the corner of Commercial St and Chapel St in Kooringa.  My window is opposite Mr Watt’s premises.  Heard crackling noise at 4.30 a.m. and saw smoke coming from the roof.  Roused the neighbours and informed Mr Thomas (policeman).

W. Datson, the neighbour, confirmed the above.  Went to Mr Jenkin’s for the Corporation hose.

George Parks:

Live in Chapel St about 50 yards from the fire.  Was woken by my father about 4.40 a.m. and saw smoke coming from Watt’s shop.  Sent word to Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s clerk and to Mr Watt.  Went to back of shop: fire must have started at the front as that part burnt first.

L-C Thomas confirmed the above times, having been roused at 4.35 a.m.  Noticed the shutters were up and the front door closed.  Saw Charles and George Parks and J. O’Leary there.  Thought there was a Corporation hose and sent Mr Datson for it.

The verdict was that there was no evidence to show how the fire started.
