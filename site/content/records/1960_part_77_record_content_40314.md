Fire/Obituary.  Mr Donald Simmons (46) a bachelor farmer of Whyte Yarcowie was a guest at the Burra Hotel on Thursday night.  He retired to an upstairs bedroom and apparently was smoking in bed when his bedding caught alight early on Friday morning.  At 6.25 a.m. the proprietor Mr King Grubb arose and found smoke in the building, which he traced to the upstairs room.  He groped his way to the bed and found it still occupied by Mr Simmons.  He pulled the man into the passage and called the fire brigade, the doctor and the police.  Both Doctors Kirk and Miller attended and found the man dead.  The bedding was not actually in flames, but the smoke had suffocated the victim and smoke damage to the room was estimated at $300.

[Born 5 September 1919 Terowie, died 7 June 1968 Burra, residence Whyte Yarcowie.]
