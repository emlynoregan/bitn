Burra Sporting & Athletic Club.

A wallet has been sent to Pte Clarrie Brown of Hampton who has been invalided home.

A Ragged Ball will be held on 3 October in the Skating Rink for Club funds.  It is a ball to herald in the spring.

Gunner A.J. Dunning writes from France about a more relaxing time back from the firing line.

‘Admirer of the Band’ writes praising the band highly, but slating those employers of the girls who are proving less enthusiastic when it comes to granting leave to play on patriotic occasions.
