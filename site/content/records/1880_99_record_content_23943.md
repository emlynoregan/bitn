Burra Town Council.  The total liabilities of the Council on 1 January 1886 was £346-4-2, including a sum of £144-17-6 which the Government claimed as having been overpaid to the Corporation in 1884.  The total liability at the end of the year is expected to be £380, or an increase of £35.  The actual overdraft is £254-18-9 with c. £125 allowed for contingencies to the end of the year.  This seems a very reasonable result seeing that the year has been so hard.  (There are bonded debts to £2,400 repayable mostly between 1890 and 1897, but with £100 due in 1887 and £200 in 1888.

A list of the year’s works is given.  Most of the work was on road forming and metalling of 264.5 chains and the making of 187.25 chains of footpath.  There were also 39.25 chains of kerbing and 40.75 chains of water tabling.
