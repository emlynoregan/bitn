Police Court, Kooringa, W. Lang, Resident Magistrate, 16 June.

A summons was obtained against John Webster for depositing filth in the public street.

Agnes Dunn, for the fourth time, applied for a decision in her case against Dr Bull.  The agreement between them was for six months as a general servant at £20 p.a. plus board and rations.  If she stayed three months half her fare was to be deducted from her wages and if for six months Dr Bull was to pay all the fare.  He dismissed her after six weeks when she refused to change her sleeping arrangements from the kitchen to the sitting-room adjoining Dr Bull’s bedroom, and through which he would have to pass if called out during the night.  The plaintiff said Dr Bull has offered to pay her 11/- and later 13/- for her six weeks’ service.  She had served Mr Dashwood for three months and the Advocate General for nine months and had always maintained a good character.

Dr Bull complained of her misbehaviour, impertinent answers to Mrs Bull, laziness and late rising.

Mrs Bull said the plaintiff had been on occasions most insolent and had refused to obey her orders.

After further evidence of the plaintiff’s alleged behaviour Mr Fitzgerald asked for a decision.

Mr Lang said he was prepared to give it, but recommended an adjournment to give the parties time to come to some arrangement, and although they agreed to the adjournment no acceptable decision could be reached.

Mr Lang then ordered that Agnes Dunn accept £2, which Dr Bull had offered to pay, or go without anything.

Mr Fitzgerald was indignant at His Worship’s ruling, which would leave his client with virtually nothing after paying 14/- court costs and other necessary expenses, but under the circumstance he had to advise her to accept the arrangement.
