W.H. Hardy writes complaining of the implication in the editor’s comment that now the Waterworks’ engineer will have to be paid an extra £31-4-0.  He claims that the work to be done is now specified where it wasn’t before and so that although he was previously paid 8/- a day it cost over 10/- a day to get the job done.  Now for £3 a week he will have to do the work.  The extra 2/- a day is thus well spent.

The Editor replies at length.

‘It is to be very much regretted that Mr Hardy cannot go to work with his colleagues in a proper and gentlemanly manner instead of rushing into print to try to show them up, but even in this feeble attempt he has failed.’

‘Mr Hardy is the misleading star.’
