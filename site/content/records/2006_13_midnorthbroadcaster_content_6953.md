Burra Regional Art Gallery had the Clare Valley artist Harry Sherwin along on Friday night to open their latest exhibition, The Art of the Region.  The works on display were the result of a two-day workshop in acrylic landscape painting that was tutored by Harry Sherwin in September last year.  [Photo of Harry Sherwin at the opening.]

The Regional Council of Goyder will share in $120,000 to support important local heritage places.

Funding for eligible conservation work has been increased to up to half the cost of that work to a maximum of $1,500.  Stonework, roofing and timber conservation work are examples of eligible projects.  [Photo of Council CEO, John Brak.]
