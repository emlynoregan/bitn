Redruth Court.

Edward Williams was charged with deserting his wife four years ago in Port Augusta.  He then had nothing, but since had prospered and now earned £4 a week and was quite willing to support her.  He was ordered to pay 25/- a week and his railway fare from Pt Augusta. [sic]  [Perhaps her fare?]
