Editorial on Christmas Thoughts.

This is the usual goodwill and Christian wishes, but rather ironically for the last Christmas before the outbreak of WWI the editor writes:

‘Ideas rule the world and stronger and stronger, year by year, the conviction is growing in the minds of the people that war can be abolished, and therefore abolished it will be.’
