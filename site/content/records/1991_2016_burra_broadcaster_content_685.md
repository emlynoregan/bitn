The Burra Cycling Classic

The first official Burra-Adelaide Cycling road race was run on 21 September 1907.  The machines were then rather heavy single geared cycles.  The roads were mostly unsealed.  Despite the difficulties the winner was credited with the time of 6 hours 11 minutes 13 seconds.  The race became an Annual Promotion and was eventually raced for Burra to Adelaide and Adelaide to Burra in alternate years.  The route varied considerable and the distance covered fluctuated between about 100 and 120 miles.  Many of the nationâ€™s best cyclists have competed, especially in the 1920s and 1930s.  Names like Hubert Opperman, Bill Moritz, Deane Toseland, Keith Thurgood and Ron Whitehorn appear among the contestants.  Many Burra riders have competed.  Ian Auhl has a photograph of eleven locals in a race from the 1930s: Don Kerin, Clem Wilson, Leo Taylor, Tom Allen, Eric Scroop, Theo Pohlner, Bob Morton, Charlie Griffiths, Rex Opperman, Tom Garrard and Keith Lower.  The race was not run during WWII, but returned in 1948.  Traffic conditions and traffic signals in the metropolitan area saw the end of the race move out of the city centre.  Several destinations were tried and in 1985 a race was conducted on an out and back course, finishing at Burra and this proved to be a successful format.  The 1992 fixture is scheduled for 12 September over 125 km from Burra to Riverton and return.  The race will start at noon in front of the Burra Hotel and end at about 4 p.m. by the Commercial Hotel.  On 13 September a Graded Criterium [sic] event will be raced on a Burra Street Circuit.
