Obituary.  Mrs T.H. Wheare died a few days ago at Lake St Trafalgar WA.  She had lived for many years in Thames St Kooringa and leaves two sons and five daughters, 29 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.  [Possibly the wife of Thomas Henry Wheare.  She was born Caroline Sparnon (or Sparnall in one source) and they had 8 children in Kooringa, but the balance of sons and daughters does not seem to find a ready match with the two sons and five daughters that are said to survive.]
