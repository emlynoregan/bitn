George Parks was charged with embezzling £6 & £5 respectively while acting as clerk and servant of the Burra Burra Lodge of the Order of Oddfellows.

Elizabeth Ann Mills gave evidence of paying £6 for interest due from her husband in December last and of getting a receipt for it.

W. Thomas similarly produced a receipt for £5.

W. Lasscock, saddler and auditor for the Lodge, said he could find no corresponding entries in the Lodge books.  W. Davey said he could find no entry to correspond either.

The Prisoner said people often paid him in the street and when they called for a receipt he would write it out in a hurry without filling in the heel.  At audit time he would make the entry in the heel.  He denied any fraudulent intent.

Mr Anderson for the defence said that his client was not intentionally a defaulter, but had been guilty of carelessness, mainly owing to the excess of work apart from his duties as lodge secretary.

The jury found him guilty and the judge sentenced him to three years’ hard labour.
