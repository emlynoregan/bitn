Burra Show, 23 October.

The weather was not particularly good with strong NW wind raising dust.  Nevertheless attendance was very large.  Entries for horses were up.  Cattle, pigs, sheep and dogs were about average.  Implements were well displayed.  In flowers the Messrs Fuss secured most prizes with W. Carpenter getting the honours in sweet peas & stocks and N.W.R. Pearce for roses.  Mr Chin Young’s vegetables were first class.  Dairy produce had a good display, especially Mrs W. Bryce of Hallett.  Competition in cookery was keen.  Children’s work and art and industry displays were admired.  Art prizes went particularly to Miss Vera Pascoe, Mrs Bridgwood & Mr L.H. Foote.  Side shows were numerous and did good business.  Gate money was £1 up on last year despite members’ vehicles getting free admission for the first time.
