Burra Town Council

Messrs Bartholomæus, Volmer & Topperwein asked that a small reserve opposite the Primitive Methodist Church, Redruth, be fenced.  If the council will fence it at an estimated cost of £4 they will undertake to plant trees there and tend them.

Messrs Francis Clark & Son offer to remove their boring plant in Market Square to any other spot and to begin again, under specified conditions.  The Mayor will seek further details.
