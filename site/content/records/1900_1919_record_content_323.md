Obituary & Inquest into the death of James H. Doherty, jockey.

[Born James Hilarian Doherty 21 October 1887: died 31 January 1900 aged 12]

E.W. Crewes JP as coroner and C. Fuss as foreman of the jury.

W.J. Richards said he saw the lad ride into the post as far as he could judge in the dust.  He helped August Fuss put the lad into a trap for the hospital.

Dr Sangster operated to relieve pressure on the brain, but the damage was such as to preclude the possibility of recovery and death occurred about 11.30 p.m.

Augustine St Justin Doherty, brother of the deceased, thought his brother incapable of controlling the mare – both parents however, had consented.  Deceased had been riding in races since 26 December 1898.  He thought the posts [i.e. those marking the track] should have been painted or had flags on them.  The turn into the straight was also too sharp, which made the running dangerous for large fields.  [There had been nine horses in the race concerned.]

William Turner Thompson gave the most detailed account of the accident – seeing the horse suddenly veer right, apparently trying to avoid the post, and the jockey was leaning to the left and collided with it.  The rider was thrown back onto the hindquarters and fell off on the right hand side some four yards past the post.  He also considered the posts should have been painted and that the turn was unsafe.

The jury decided that death was due to accidental collision with a post on the Burra Race Course and regretted having to add that the parents were somewhat to blame for allowing a lad of ‘tender years’ to ride in the race.
