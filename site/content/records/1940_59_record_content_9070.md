The Burra North Mill

With the wartime needs for metal, the galvanised iron storeroom at the old mill has been demolished for use in the war effort.  The mill has been closed and its contents rusting for some time.  It now faces demolition.

It was originally owned by John Roach Senior who was here some time in the 1850s.  It then passed to his son Henry â€“ better known as Harry.  Later it was acquired by Thomas & Co.  The late P.L. Rosman being their manager for many years.  It was Thomas & Co. that closed the mill.

[The mill for Mr Roach was erected in 1874 and a capacious wheat store is mentioned the following year.  This article lacks precise details of what was going on, but it would seem only the wood and iron structure was involved in this demolition, because in the Burra Record 63, 16, 20 Apr. 1943, page 1 we are told that until March 1943 all the machinery was intact along with the stone building that housed it.  By the end of April 1943 the machinery had gone and the stone walls alone remained, without roofing or timbers.  In the Burra Record 63, 18, 4 May 1943, page 1, P.A. Roach says the machinery had been unused for about twenty years.  The place had been operated as a grain buying centre rather than as a mill in that time.  The stark ruin was to stand by the roadside until finally demolished late in 1963.]
