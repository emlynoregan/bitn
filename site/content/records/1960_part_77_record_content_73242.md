St Joseph’s Church

Bishop Gallagher will consecrate the church at its Centenary Celebrations on Friday evening.

Churches are not consecrated till paid for and although St Joseph’s was paid off years ago, the fact that it was not consecrated had been overlooked.  The church has a new altar, lectern, seating and carpeting.  On Sunday there will be an open air Mass on Aberdeen Oval followed by a Parish Picnic.  A booklet outlining the history of the church will be available at the weekend.
