Redbanks Reserve.  Eighteen months ago local Danny Heading noticed some bones poking out from the wall of a creek bank at Redbanks.  National Parks ranger Ian Falkenberg was informed and he passed the message on to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which contacted representatives of the Ngadjuri Aboriginal group.  Their heritage chairman Vincent Branson attended the site last week for the careful excavation and examination of the remains by archaeologists from Flinders University.  Their conclusion was that the bones were those of an adult Aboriginal woman with the body of an infant under her arm.  The Ngadjuri will arrange a suitable reburial.

Over the years the area has yielded significant finds of mega fauna fossils.
