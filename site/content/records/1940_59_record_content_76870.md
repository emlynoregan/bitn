Obituary.  ‘Old Sport’ writes in tribute to the late John Kelly.

The late John Duncan Kelly was the best all-round athlete this district has ever known.  I first knew him when he was at Prince Alfred College and as we lived in the village of Copperhouse, I knew him well.  When he came home on holidays he would have us younger ones timing him with a stop watch as he ran on the side of the road.  I believe he held several records while at college and afterwards was the best all-round athlete in the district.  He broke the cycling record from Broken Hill to Adelaide and was one of the best footballers, playing in the Burra side that defeated Broken Hill.

‘One Boxing Day at Victoria Park after competing in most events he was feeling the strain.  Before the three-mile cycle scratch race he sent for a bottle of beer, it did not arrive until the race was about to begin, but the starter waited for him to drink it.  He took hurdles, sheffields, tossing the caber and high jumps equally in his stride.  With his passing the district has lost one of its best sportsmen ever.  He was known as the ever-green Jack Kelly – his colours being green with a black sash.’

[Born 14 July 1873 Mt Bryan: died 21 December 1955 Hallett.]
