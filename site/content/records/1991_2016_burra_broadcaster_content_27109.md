AGL Hallett Power Station

Work has virtually been completed and engineers are commissioning the 12 generators.  Premier Rob Kerin launched his party’s energy policy last Thursday and in the process turned on one of the twelve turbines.  The commissioning will see the capacity grow from 45 megawatts today to 180 megawatts over the coming months.  AGL Director Greg Martin said AGL intends to add a further 50 MW to increase the capacity to 230 to 250MW in the medium term.  The plant is located on the North Booborowie Road a few kilometres south of the Hallett-Jamestown Road, at appoint where high tension power lines cross the Moomba-Adelaide gas pipeline.  The plant will operate c. 5% of the time – on peak demand days, usually high temperature days in summer.  There will be one or two full-time staff.  [2 photos.]
