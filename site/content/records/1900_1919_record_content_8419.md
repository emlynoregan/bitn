Phosphate Mine.  Messrs Baker, Killicoat and Rosewall have secured three search licences each of 640 acres in the Hd of Bright for phosphate.  Two are to the south and one to the north of Field’s workings and evidence of that deposit has been traced.  Samples sent were assayed at 59¼% tricalcic phosphate in stones very different from those at Field’s.
