Rev. E. Lawson sued E.F. Marston for £99 for libel.

The action arose out of comments published about an advertisement inserted by the plaintiff on 2 July.  Rev. E. Lawson claimed his reputation had been injured.  The plaintiff’s counsel considered the defendant’s comments imputed a charge of falsehood on the plaintiff.

Mr Bednall for Marston argued that the comments were not capable of libellous meaning nor could they be so understood by any reasonable person and asked for a non-suit.  The magistrate decided to hear evidence.

Mr Shierlaw presented arguments for the plaintiff.  The defence presented no arguments.

Judgement was for the defendant with costs against the plaintiff.
