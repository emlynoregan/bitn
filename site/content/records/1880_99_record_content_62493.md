St Joseph’s Entertainment on 21 June was excellent and the hall was crowded – local talent was augmented by visitors from Adelaide: Miss B. Pflaum and Messrs B. Maegraith and W. Howard.  Pflaum & Maegraith played a piano duet and Pflaum later followed with a song.  Mr Howard also sang later with a clear alto voice.  The local talent rose well to the occasion.
