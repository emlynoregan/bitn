Court.

J. Varley was charged with carrying 6 tons 17 cwt on a wagon with tyres only 3½” wide – 11 cwt over his licensed weight.  Fined 10/- plus 10/- costs.

T.P. Halls was charged for the second time with taking his cab onto Station property without a licence.  The Railway Commissioners have apparently said they will not issue any more licences.  His defence was that he was not touting for business as he was a free cab to the Burra Hotel.  He was fined 5/- + 10/- costs.

He was also charged with leaving his cab without first chaining the wheels.  Fined 2/6 + 5/- costs.

[Unable to pay, he fled to Waukaringa and was brought back to work it off in jail: see XV, 270, 15 Nov. 1893.]

Charlie Grow was fined 10/- + 10/- costs for driving his cab without lights.
