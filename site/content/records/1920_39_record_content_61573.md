Young Australia League Boys from Victoria came by the afternoon train on Monday 1 June.  They were met at the station by the Mayor and Crs Jennison & Kellaway.  There were 37 lads and three officers. The boys marched through Aberdeen and were then taken by cars to Kooringa where they marched from the Institute through the main street, respectfully saluting the Soldiersâ€™ Memorial as they passed.  They were given a tour of the town and then sent to where they were billeted with families.  In the evening they gave a bright and colourful entertainment at the Institute after a civic welcome from the Mayor.  They left Burra on the morning train, bound for Angaston.
