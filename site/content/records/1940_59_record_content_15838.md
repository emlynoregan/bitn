Kooringa Methodist Church held a Christmas Choral Service on last Sunday evening.  The choir was led by Mr G.E. Dane and the performance included four well-known Cornish Carols.  Rev. Barrett gave the short address on the coming of the Messiah.  Mrs Max Pearce produced the gem of the evening when she sang I Know that My Redeemer Liveth from Handelâ€™s Messiah.
