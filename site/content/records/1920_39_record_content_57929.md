Mongolata Goldfield

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata for the fortnight to 20 September

The main shaft has been sunk to 71 ft.

In the open cut stripping timber from the No. 1 shaft has been completed and open cut work has commenced.

The consultant W.M. Williams and directors visited the mine on Monday and we believe they are very satisfied with the preliminary work done on the open cut and the main shaft.  It is anticipated the whole open cut will be a payable proposition.
