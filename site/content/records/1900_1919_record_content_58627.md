Bob Fuss lost all his sheds, outhouses and a beautiful garden, together with a spring dray, six tons of hay, tools, tool house, poultry, poultry yards and a 2,000 gallon galvanised-iron tank.  Mrs Fuss and her neighbours removed the furniture onto the road and soon the back of the house was alight, but was extinguished with hard work.  He estimates his loss at Â£70.
