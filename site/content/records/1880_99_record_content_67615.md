Editorial on the festive season and looking back on 1899 which has been a year of war in Transvaal and of tolerably good results commercially, though grain was not as good as hoped for, but wool was rising to high prices.  There have been four years of bad harvests.  Population in Burra was about the same as twelve months ago in spite of the general depression and employment has been found for all, which is more than could be said 12 months ago.

Our Boys Brigade will camp at World’s End for 26 & 27 December.

Sports will be held at Booborowie, Black Springs and Waterloo on Monday (Christmas Day) and at Burra on Boxing Day, Tuesday.  Business places will be closed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church will celebrate its last anniversary services on Sunday next, before the Methodist Union comes into effect.

Kooringa Masonic Lodge on 12 December held its first annual meeting since the lodge was resuscitated.

Reaping will be in full swing in the coming fortnight.

Burra Mutual Improvement Soc. will hold its first social in the Wesleyan Lecture Hall tonight with a program of songs and recitations etc.

W.K. Shortridge, eldest son of T.T. Shortridge has left Adelaide to take an engagement with A.E. Builder of Cue, WA.  He was previously with Messrs Charlick Bros of Rundle St, from whom he received excellent testimonials.

Obituary.  Thomas Shaw Allanson, aged 79, employed for many years at Faraway Hill Station, died at Chalker’s Station on his way to Burra Hospital following an apoplectic fit.  He was an old identity of the Eastern Plains.  One son, Thomas, is a storekeeper at Cockburn.  [Died 14 December 1899]

Fire.  On Saturday night a lamp was dropped in John Hunter’s Boot Palace when a lad was taking it down.  It burst into flames, but they were fortunately extinguished before much damage was done.  The town still possesses no fire fighting equipment!

A Concert in aid if the Transvaal Patriotic Fund will be held in the Burra Institute on Thursday 28 December.

A Memorial Service for James Chynoweth was impressive at the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church last Sunday evening.
