The Vice-Regal Visit of Sir Edric & Lady Bastyan went smoothly last Friday.  The hospital and school were visited and there was a Civic Ball in the evening.  In the afternoon Sir Edric visited the Mine while Lady Bastyan was entertained by the CWA.  Prior to the Ball, Sir Edric paid a visit to the RSL.  The Town Council entertained the visitors at the Kooringa Hotel for luncheon.  At the hospital the Governor met staff, the Board of Management and patients.  In the latter group were: Miss A. Simmons (who with her family owned land near Ulooloo gold fields), Mrs Ellery (who with her husband was a drover in Queensland), Mrs R. Steele, Mrs G. Dollman Jnr, Mrs R. Cullen, Miss S. Murphy (late of England), Mr L. Hirschausen, Mr Leo Wilson, Mr G.E. Phillips, Mr S. Sanderson (retired farmer of Gum Creek), Mr George Goodridge (of Mt Bryan), Mr B.H.K. Dunstan (grazier of Mt Bryan East, whose father was first postmaster at Mt Bryan) and Mr Gordon Fenton (Boer War veteran, fought in WWI and tried to enlist for WWII.  He rode in the Coronation Procession of Edward VI [sic: for VII] in 1903).
