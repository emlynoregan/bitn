Pages 2 & 3

The dividing line between the two was very flexible, but these two pages held most of the local news in small paragraphs.  The editorial and 2nd leader (sometimes with a 3rd as well) were quite varied in length.  They frequently dealt with SA Parliamentary issues or other matters beyond the town itself.  The Town Council meetings were usually reported only briefly, but there are some exceptions where considerable detail is provided.  The Midland Road Board’s activities are reported in rather more detail.  There are reports from correspondents in other northern centres and these are both numerous and significant.  Advertisements do not intrude into the news.  Overseas news is significant, but is usually reported in very short paragraphs without headings or breaks.  Headlines are small and used only for major articles.  Many smaller items blend into one another.  There is rarely any prose fiction and only occasionally a poem.
