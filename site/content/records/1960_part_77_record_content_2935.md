Burra Town Council, 28 June

Mr E. Finch & Dr R.B. Pitcher were welcomed as new Councillors from 1 July.

Mr R.J. Jeffery presented a case for the purchase of the laneway at the rear of his premises.

Mr Pollnitz of the Tourist Bureau will visit Burra on 9 July to inspect the Mine area with a view to Council receiving a subsidy for work to promote tourism.

Outstanding rates have been reduced to £49.

ETSA will install new lights near the new footbridge.

Crs Cummins and Lehmann moved that the decision to offer the old Town Depot to the Bowling Club for £100 be rescinded.  They argued that the cost of effecting the transfer of plant, tools etc. Would be £50 to £60 and this too should be recovered.  Carried, with the offer price to be determined after the move.

The footbridge in Chapel Street is to be repaired with new decking.
