Burra Football Association AGM was held at the Burra Hotel on Thursday.  The Association is in good credit.  The secretary J. Allen, said the Hallett and Farrell’s Flat clubs favoured joining, so there could be five teams in the competition this year.  Present train arrangements would make games possible.  Mr Truscott was appointed chairman of the Association.
