The Lucky Dip in Market Square has been less than lucky this week.  Vandals smashed a front window on Saturday/Sunday night.  On Wednesday morning, proprietor Colleen Spackman walked in to find the entire roof of a back room had collapsed.  A huge amount of dust had swirled into the shop, covering all the stock.  Her collection of porcelain Christmas figurines was buried under the collapsed debris.  [Photo.]
