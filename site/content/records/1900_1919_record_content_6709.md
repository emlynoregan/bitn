Ettie Walhert was charged on the information of Carrie Jones with the theft of a gold ring valued at 15/-.  The defendant said she found the ring near the Church of England.  Mrs Jones alleged it was taken from her house, but in her evidence revealed that the ring had been found by her little boy some two months before.  The case was dismissed and the ring held with a view to finding its rightful owner.
