The Parent & Friends’ Association has been very active.  They provided afternoon tea for Sports Day and arranged a most successful Ball (profit £100).  Tomorrow they will provide a sit-down banquet in this hall for over 200.  £200 has been spent on library books and physical education equipment.  The prefects have set a high standard of conduct and served the school well.

The successful Swimming Carnival was won by Steele House.

There was a whole school excursion to Renmark via Truro, Blanchetown, Waikerie, Kingston, Berri and Morgan.  Many people are thanked for the provision of transport.

The variety evening performance in the Town Hall was an innovation, which proved very successful and raised over £30 for the magazine fund.  Many parents and friends took advantage of the visiting day.

The Intermediate Class visited Clare to see a performance of The Merchant of Venice.

Last week an Advertiser tennis coaching school was run on the school’s tennis courts.

Clubs were introduced this year: public speaking, Red Cross, gymnastics, motor mechanics, musical appreciation, athletics, clay modelling and dramatics.

Burra won the Handicap Shield at the Inter-High School Sports.

The school won £40 from the Savings Bank Award.

Various speakers addressed the school about employment prospects.  A new tennis wall has been erected on the Statton Sports Area and a large area asphalted for playing space.  The newly developed playing ground is covering well with grass.  Books worth £170 have been added to the library and £100 worth of physical equipment has been purchased.  A new record player has been purchased.  Some improvements have been made to toilets and others await completion.  Approval has been given to convert the old laboratory to a staff room, but so far this has not happened.  Other approvals have been for a new change room, a chain wire boundary fence and repainting.
