Joseph Thomas of the Congregational Manse Booleroo Newcastle NSW writes as an old Burra boy concerning the death of Sir Frederick Holder.  He urges that something of a tangible nature be done to perpetuate Sir Frederickâ€™s memory.  He suggests a monument in Market Square where Sir Frederick not only conversed with his constituents on Market Days, but stood beside famous open-air preachers such as Rev. S. Knight, the late Father Wright & Charles Tresise.  He would be pleased to contribute towards any such memorial.
