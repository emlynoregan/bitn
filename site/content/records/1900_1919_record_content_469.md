Obituary.  Annie Smith, widow of the late Peter Smith, residing with her 90-year-old mother, has been burnt to death.  The old lady was out in the yard getting water when the daughter ran into the yard with her dress all alight.  The flames were extinguished by neighbours, but Mrs Smith died shortly after Dr Brummitt arrived.  [The marriage information suggests she may have been born Anne Lynch who married Peter Smith at Mintaro 19 October 1864.  Her age matches this person, but the only very old Mrs Lynch registered as dying in SA was Bridget, widow of Michael, who died at Yongala aged 106 on 10 September 1905, so she doesnâ€™t fit in with being 90 in 1900.]
