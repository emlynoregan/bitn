Burra Town Council, 6 May

Dr Brummitt and other members of the School Board of Advice sought to have the bridge at the rear of the Burra Hotel moved further north to save the children from passing ‘such a malodorous place’ and to increase the convenience of the general public.

Crs Hardy & Pinch thought it better to remove the odours and Pinch said the old bridge would have to remain in any case.  The outcome was they had no funds at present to do the work.

The lamp in Market Square is to be lit for three months from 1 June.
