At present the operation of two bores costs $50,000 annually.  Of this about $10,000 is spent on servicing the pumps due to poor water quality.  368 million litres of water is provided, but it appears that the creek lies on a gravel bed and a fault line, which causes a high loss of this water back into the aquifer.  The present withdrawal rate is unsustainable.  The west bank in particular needs further development to render it usable by visitors and the community.  Ideas being considered include:

The lining of the creek with clay or an environmental liner to reduce water loss.

Combined walking/cycling paths for both sides of the creek.

A new recreation area on the west bank below the Town Hall car park.

Management of the weed/reed growth to provide bird habitat, but without choking the creek.

Planting with appropriate native trees and shrubs.

A prohibition of vehicular access to the banks to prevent compaction of soil and so extend the area of useful park.

A reduction in the area of the current water feature to reduce the cost of maintenance.
