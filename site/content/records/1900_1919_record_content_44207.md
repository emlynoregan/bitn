The Mayor’s Report for 1915.

After last year’s disastrous drought this year’s season has been very good with prospects for an excellent harvest.

Unfortunately the war that started in August 1914 still rages.  In supporting the war effort Burra has shouldered the burden with energy and a great cheerfulness.

Burra and district has sent 220 men, 2 chaplains, 5 nurses and 2 doctors to the front and subscribed £13-968-14-9:

Patriotic Fund Cash	£301-0-0

Belgian Fund Cash	£1,156-15-3

Belgian Fund Clothing	£100-0-0

Commercial Travellers’ Day	£279-0-0

Red Cross Cash	£324-0-6

Red Cross Clothing	£122-0-0

Cheer-up Society Violet Day	£414-0-0

Cheer-up Society Cash	£103-0-0

Cheer-up Society Blanket Fund	£250-0-0

Soldiers’ Aid Society Cash	£109-19-0

Soldiers’ Aid Society Clothing	£210-0-0

Australia Day Cash	£2,100-0-0

French Flag Day	£608-0-0

Soldiers’ Memorial Fund	£50-0-0

Cheer-up Day in Aid of Soldiers’ Hut

And Wounded Soldiers’ Fund	£805-0-0

Cash direct to City Funds	£7,036-0-0

The Cheer-up Society is doing wonderful work for those who have left for the front and for those returning sick and wounded.

The Soldiers’ Aid Society is working hard doing similar kinds of work to the Red Cross.

Violet Day was a red letter day in Burra with the auction of a bunch of violets raising £384 and a total of £414 for the day.

Australia Day was the town’s best effort with £2,100 raised.

French Flag Day raised £608 for the French Red Cross.

On 13 October the town welcomed Sir Henry and Lady Galway.  Welcome arches were erected at the station gate, in Aberdeen and in Kooringa and the whole town was gaily decorated with flags and bunting.  Of the £805 collected £250 was sent to Adelaide toward the Cheer-up Hut while £550 was kept for the purpose of assisting wounded soldiers who may return to us later on.  The funds are still open to receive donations.

During the year the drought broke and heavy rains did much good, but consequent floods badly damaged roads, footpaths etc. and swept away three of our bridges: the one near Lord’s Hotel, one at the south end of town [presumably at the Pig and Whistle crossing] and one at the old White Hart Hotel at the north end of town.  We have received £350 special grant to repair roads and arrangements have been made to replace the bridges.  Plans and specifications have been received from the Government Engineer and tenders called for the first one to be built across the creek opposite the Burra Institute.

The town has been brought under the Building Act which will prevent the erection of unsightly buildings in the town.  It has also been placed under the Places of Public Entertainment Act which provides for means of safety in places of entertainment in the event of fire or panic.

For many years Burra has been totally unprovided for in the event of fire.  In the last 12 months there have been several outbreaks.  In most cases we were fortunate to control the fires before much damage was done, but in one case considerable loss of property resulted.  The Council has now purchased hydrants, a hose and a hand reel and have organised a volunteer fire brigade.

The Burra Band continues to make progress and has rendered great service to the various patriotic committees by responding to their appeals for help.  Mr James Bentley has resigned from the leadership and Mr A.G. Shortridge has taken his place.

Rates collected:	General	£437-15-4

Parklands	£73-2-10

Health	£255-5-6

Lighting	£109-6-11

Total outstanding rates	£12-19-4

The general account began the year £24-18-9 in debit and is now £68-0-3 in credit.
