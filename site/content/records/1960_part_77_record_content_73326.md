Obituary. One of Spalding’s oldest residents Mrs Elizabeth Ann McAvaney died in Clare Hospital on 23 September aged 82.  She was a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Robert Lister and was born in Redhill in 1892 and began her schooling at the Collinsville School.  She married Thomas Vincent McAvaney at St Mary’s Cathedral Port Pirie in 1913.  They lived at Broken Hill for two years before moving to Spalding.  She was a zealous worker for her church and a member of the Red Cross, CWA and Senior Citizens Club.  She is survived by two sons; Reg. (Adelaide) and Geoff. (Spalding).  There are 8 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

[Born Elizabeth Ann Lister 12 October 1891 Collinsfield.  Since Collinsfield was located 8 km south of Redhill, the reference above to Collinsville is likely a mistake for Collinsfield.]
