Back to Burra Schools Reunion

Despite atrocious weather that included a few snowflakes, about 700 people registered for the reunion on 21 & 22 October.  This included 35 from interstate and 40 former staff members.  All events had to be held indoors due to the very wet and wintry weather.  Information given allowed at least 40 schools to be identified.  A booklet titled ‘School Daze’ was printed and each senior citizen was given a copy.  Dinners on Saturday night were held at the Sports Complex and the Burra Hotel and each was booked out.

Sunday’s assembly was moved to the school gymnasium, where former headmaster Colin Morrison conducted the assembly.  A salute to the flag was followed by much reminiscing.  Addresses were given by:

Ray Jennison – dux of the school in 1942

Kevin Fahey – Present Principal

Graham Kellock – Chairman of the Burra Burra DC

Robyn Page – Chair of the Burra Jubilee 150 Committee

The Burra Community Library had a display of school memorabilia.

A bus tour in the afternoon visited the sites of St Joseph’s School and those at Copperhouse, Ayers, Leighton, Gum Creek, Wheetelande and others.

At Ayers a former teacher, Mr George Murray (almost 90) spoke to the group and a cairn of stones had been built by Don Lloyd in readiness for a plaque.

All in all it was a very successful reunion despite the weather.
