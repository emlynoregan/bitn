Jubilee 150 Scale Model of the Burra Mine Project.

Initial work has been carried out in preparation for the display of the model.  Since mid-January the basic framework has been almost completed.  The display area is 5 x 6.5 metres.  Thirty-three groups of buildings will slot into the landscape to show how the mine looked in 1860.  The landscape around the models will be completed by May.

Pam Marlowâ€™s family will be moving from Aldgate to Pinnaroo this year, which will limit her on site work to school holidays.  The display will be glazed before September to enable fitting of the models and final finishing in time for the opening of the Bon Accord Mine Museum in October.
