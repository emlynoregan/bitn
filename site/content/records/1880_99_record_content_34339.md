Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting.

The Mayor presented his report last Friday.

In the unavoidable absence of the Mayor Cr Pinch read the Mayor’s report.

Dr Brummitt was voted into the chair to give Cr Pinch freedom to speak.

The Mayor’s report was adopted.

Cr Rabbich said the achievement of the year was to end in credit instead of in debt as last year.  He was also glad that by taking the Waterworks back the Council had been able to return to the general account over £60, which had been absorbed by the works when the Council had previously had charge of them.

The Council had paid several accounts that previous Councils ought to have paid and had done good work in tree planting.  The town was a paradise to what it had been a few years ago.  Much good work had been done by the Inspector in the difficult period of the typhoid outbreak early in the year.  The cemetery was in good order and its account in credit.  He was glad the Waterworks had been taken back for three years at 5% and looked like being about £25 in credit at year’s end, despite repaying £69 to the Council and £90 to the Government for stock and material.

Cr Pinch supported the report, but felt it was unnecessary to go through it after what had been said.  He was sure Council money had been well spent this year.  He was less confident than Cr Rabbich about the Waterworks and thought their cost to the Council was far too high.  He believed they would soon be glad to hand them back to the Government.

Cr Watt supported the report and so did Cr O’Leary.  The latter added his support to Cr Rabbich’s view of the Waterworks and though disappointed at their price felt they would soon be able to reduce the rates.

Cr Hardy supported the report, but as he was not up for re-election did not think it necessary to go into details.

Mr W. West thought the report most satisfactory and was surprised at the large amount of work done at so small a cost.

T.W. Wilkinson, as Mayoral candidate, had no policy speech, but would answer questions.  He felt present legal cesspits a failure and felt that earth closets would be safer.  He did not like to see councils receiving liquor licence fees and preferred the old Government subsidy.

George Butterworth, as candidate for North Ward, had little to say.

D.J. O’Leary was standing again for West Ward and promised more of the same and hoped to lower the water rate.

Thomas Kitchen, standing also for West Ward, felt the previous Council had greatly improved the town and he would like to see such improvements carried on.  Though he had advocated the Waterworks, as things had turned out he would have opposed it.  He thought now they had to make the best of it.

Cr Sampson was absent due to illness, but sent a letter of apology and announced his intention to stand again.

All candidates said they would try to reduce the water rates and the interest charged by the Government for the Waterworks.

All were in favour of free access to the oval except for sports.

The chairman asked if candidates were in favour of the Council taking over the new footbridge near the school.

Wilkinson, Kitchen, Williams and Rabbich were for it and O’Leary, Watt and Hardy were opposed.

A move to gauge ratepayers’ views on this was lost when Mr West moved an amendment leaving it to Council.
