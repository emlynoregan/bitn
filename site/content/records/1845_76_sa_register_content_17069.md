Kooringa News, 19 January

Accident.  Mr H. Dawson was coming from the Mine in his cart on Wednesday last and opposite the Telegraph Office had to pass a dray, which did not draw aside in time and the cart went too near the edge of the embankment and capsized.  Fortunately Mr Dawson sustained no serious injury.

Weather.  On Thursday there was a fine rain for some hours and the creeks flowed as they do in winter.

To the north it has been very hot with reports of 105Â°F at Boolcoomata, but there has also been rain from thunderstorms.

Fire.  A very large fire has been raging on Booborowie Run.
