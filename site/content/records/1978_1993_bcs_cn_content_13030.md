Burra Burra DC

The new assessment shows an increase overall of 50% from that of three years ago, with the main increase in the Burra Township and rural properties in the Eastern Ward.  In Burra many residential properties increased by 400% and commercial properties by 85 to 200%.

Council adopted an average 7.64% increase in rates.

The estimated income for 1986-87 is $557,640.  [Major expenditure items are then listed.

Council is still considering a contribution towards the mezzanine floor in the Burra Community Library.

The Minister for Tourism advised Council on 14 August that approval had been granted for $68,000 to be expended on the Burra Mine site adjacent to Morphett’s Engine House.

The Engine House and shaft will be officially opened 5 October 1986.

In April 1986 Council predicted an $86,500 deficit at 30 June 1986, but in fact a surplus of about $2,476 was achieved.  This was due to the resignation of four employees, highways grants received during the year and the deletion of several items from the budget.
