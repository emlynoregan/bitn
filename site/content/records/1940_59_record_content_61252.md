Laurie Partridge, drover of Burra, lost his horse, a wireless, and other provisions in an accident near Redcliffe Station last week.  The horse seems to have decided on a drink in the dam while still attached to the van.  The weight of the van appears to have pushed the horse into the water, where it drowned.  A tractor retrieved the van and horse.
