Redruth Court, 14 January.

James & Lucy Gully v. Fred Kemp & Mrs Ann Kemp, for slander and

James & Lucy Gully v. Susan Charlton for slander.

All the characters in the drama lived near each other at Hampton.  There had been gossip in which Lucy Gully had been accused of taking a staple out of Mrs Hendy’s door and stealing the (or a) carpet.  The verdict was, after a column of evidence, in favour of the Gullys in the sum of £1 plus costs in each case.

There is a report running for almost a column on the case of Charles Roberts who was accused of stealing in excess of £70 from Andrew Fairbairn and who was ultimately committed for trial in Adelaide.
