Dr Ashton’s response to the Board of Enquiry runs to almost three columns.

He blames the ‘new element’ on the Board for the trouble and brands the Enquiry a whitewash of the Board.  To say he is the cause is to confuse cause and effect.  He draws attention to the way hospital finances improved after he arrived towards the end of 1910.

Income from subscriptions and free gifts 1909	£371

£242

£376

£660

£645

£726

£388

(In 1915 an accounting change meant this figure was for six months only.)

£702

Dr Ashton was excluded from 5 August 1917 and the present unsatisfactory state of finances hardly indicates the brilliance of the ‘new element’.

Dr Ashton gave no evidence to the enquiry because on the day the Premier heard the Board’s side of the story he was served with a writ and so he declined to attend.

Ashton’s response to allegation (a) is confused, or at least confusing.

To allegation (b) he says he personally heard the offensive remark to Dr Steele who expressed his disgust.

Of allegation (c) re written instructions to staff he says the findings are irrelevant and merely camouflage hostility and discrimination to Dr Ashton.

On allegation (d), that the Hospital Board refused to admit cases, the finding flies in the face of facts and is inconsistent.  In the time of the Riese case there were 30 patients, some delirious, and five nurses and there was a refusal to get more staff.  In the later situation with only 11 cases and those chronic and convalescent, admission to all but emergency cases was denied.  The hospital contains 35 beds.

With respect to the allegation (e) concerning the hours of operations, Ashton essentially denied the allegation and claimed operations were at reasonable hours.

Allegation (f) was covered under (c).

Allegation (g), that he requested an operation before the theatre was fumigated, was a fabrication.

As for allegation (h) alleging personal animosity, that is clear from his being excluded from the hospital and then offered Honorary Surgeon’s rights.  Honorary Surgeons are not allowed to charge fees.

In allegation (i) the Board disregarded long established custom at the hospital allowing private fees to be charged: a custom followed by the other practitioner and acknowledged by the Inspector-General.

Allegation (j) accused Ashton of overcharging Miss Stone & Mr Honeychurch.  Ashton includes a letter from Mr P. Honeychurch disclaiming any complaint about charges and similarly from E.J. Villis and another disclaimer to which no name is attached, but the sum involved suggests Miss Stone.

Allegation (l) suggested he left the hospital without a medical man to conduct operations, but the resolution of the Hospital Board reported in the Record of 17 October 1917 refutes the finding.

With respect to allegation (o): if there was no need for patients to go elsewhere why have patients other than Ashton’s chosen to do so?

As for the allegation concerning the instruction to Nurse Fuss – Ashton says he has a witness who heard him give the intimation first over the phone to the probationer and later on, the order to the nurse.

‘I certainly hold the view “that the Hospital should exist for the convenience of all sorts of sick people” and fail to see why I should be censured for maintaining that view against recent innovation.’

Essentially Ashton shows that he held the view that he had been victimised and singled out unfairly and treated very unprofessionally.
