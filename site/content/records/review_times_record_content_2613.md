Burra Burra DC has taken the first steps to draw up a new development plan.  A committee has been established to draw up a brief to present to consultants and it is hoped to appoint the consultants at the next meeting of Council.  The Administrative Planning Officer, Mr John Brak said each Council was required to prepare a supplementary development plan for presentation to the Minister of Environment & Planning and for approval by Parliament.  These had to be enlarged local versions of the State development Plan.  He expected the process to take about twelve months.
