Burra Hospital Board.

Drs Ashton & Williams failed to attend the meeting held last Thursday.

Miss G. Berriman of Saddleworth was appointed Probationer Nurse.

Matron clarified the confusion over the previous appointment of a probationer and the Board accepted it was a misunderstanding.

The Superintendent of Public Buildings gives no hope of a cellar, wash-up house or new isolation ward till the war ends.  In the meantime wooden ramps will be made where needed.

Mr Winnall & Mr Gebhardt said they were a waste of money and too steep to be used – one was a slope of 1:5.

The Board reviewed the case of Dr Ashton’s complaint about inadequate nursing.

The Board considered Dr Ashton had first attacked the nursing staff, then when the patient had admitted being drunk; he shifted his ground to the inadequate numbers of staff.  When asked for an explanation the two doctors merely acknowledged receipt of the letter and had now declined to attend a meeting of the Board.  Dr Ashton refused to attend until the censure motion was expunged.

On the 12 December a motion had been passed requiring an order from a member of the board for admission to the hospital etc.  This was awkward.
