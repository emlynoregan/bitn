The deceased was employed by Mr Barker of Baldino [sic: Baldina] and was found in his watch-box on Friday morning quite dead.  The police brought in the body.  Evidence was given that deceased had a heart disease and on Thursday evening had over-exerted himself trying to catch one of his sheep.  Dr Morgan was of the opinion that this was the cause of his death.  The jury decided that Peter Murphy had died from the visitation of God.
