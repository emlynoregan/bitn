James Bentley was farewelled by the Redruth Methodist Church in the Memorial Hall last Wednesday, with a social gathering.  Messrs P. Rosman and L. Thomas began with a duet with piano accompaniment.  Mr Stan Woollacott then spoke for the Church Trust.  Mr Bentley had put in sixteen years as a member of the Trust with twelve of them as Secretary and in that time the Memorial Hall had been built.

Mr Bob Morton then gave a mouth organ selection.

Mr Frank Sara spoke on behalf of the congregation, regretting the loss of such regular attendants over 27 years.

Mr I. Gare and Miss Clarice Reed played a piano duet before Mr A.B. Riggs spoke for the circuit.  He regretted the loss of the family to the church.  Two of the girls had already gone and now the parents and Miss Joy were leaving and no one was coming along to take their place in either the church or the town.

Mr Boyce then gave the appropriate recital Packing Up, followed by the encore A box of smiles.

Mr L. Thomas then spoke for the choir, of which Mr Bentley had over the years been a member and soloist and in later years was still always ready to play a role when needed.

Rev. Dyer then made a presentation of a case of cutlery and a beautifully bound copy of the new Methodist Hymnal and Mr J .Morton also presented a Hymnal to Miss Joy Bentley.

Miss Jean Aughey then made a presentation to Joy on behalf of the Junior Christian Endeavour Society.

Mr Bentley in replying expressed his thanks and sense of loss at having to leave in the interests of his family and he took some time to reminisce about his time in Burra, to which he had come at a very early age.

The evening concluded with a humorous recital by Mr P. Rosman.

There was also a farewell for Mr Bentley at the Burra Council Chamber on Thursday evening, when the town’s businessmen met.  Speakers included Mr A.B. Riggs, Mr H. N. Potter (of Drew & Crewes), Cr Jennison, Mr F. Sara, Mr Max Pearce (Elder, Smith’s – as a Member of the Institute Committee), Cr Kellaway, Cr R. Jeffery, Mr E.J. Davey and the Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott.
