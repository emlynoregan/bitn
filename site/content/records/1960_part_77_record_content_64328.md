The Mid North Tourist Development Association held a competition to design an emblem.  It was won by Miss Eunice Mosey of Robertstown from 75 other entries.  The emblem on a green background features a large W for wheat, wool and wine.  There is a ramâ€™s head, a bunch of grapes and a chimney to symbolise the mining era.
