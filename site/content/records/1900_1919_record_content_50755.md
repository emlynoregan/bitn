The Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band was formed to replace the Burra Coronation Band that disappeared with the enlistment of most of its members.  The first practice was on 9 November under Mr Jim. Bentley.  The Burra Town Council donated the Coronation Band instruments, but most had to be replaced.  The band first appeared in public on 19 February 1917 and has appeared on a number of occasions since, including the opening of the Girls’ Reformatory lawn a few weeks ago.  The band now has 7 new cornets, 4 new tenor horns, 2 new baritones and I new euphonium with 12 new music stands and 4 acetylene gas lamps.
