Burra Town Council.

A letter was received from Mr Fuss objecting to the Government Road near the railway station bridge being fenced.  The road will be thrown open.

The Council has purchased that piece of land in Thames St, now used for a depot, for Â£30.

The bridge in front of the post office in Kooringa is to be removed.
