Merino Field Days will have a new format from 2001.  They will be reduced from three to two days.  This reflects similar changes recently in other states.  They will be held on 19 & 20 March 2001.  Day one will feature a centralised showing and certain selected on-property displays.  The second day will feature on-property displays only, for studs from the Gilbert valley to north of Hallett.
