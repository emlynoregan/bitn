Sun Race 2002

Solar powered cars and electrical vehicles passed through Burra on Saturday 16 February en route to Peterborough.  Several dozen people gathered in Market Square for a look at the vehicles as they paused for a driver change-over.  Race contestants spent the night in Peterborough before going on to Broken Hill, Mildura, Melbourne and Canberra, before reaching Sydney where they are due on 24 February.
