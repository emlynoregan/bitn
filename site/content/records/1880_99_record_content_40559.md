The Council then discussed the explanation of Cr Rabbich and we learned afterwards:

Cr Sampson moved that Cr Rabbich be requested to withdraw the statement he made unconditionally and to apologise satisfactorily to the Council and in the event of his refusal to be fined £10 in accordance with standing order No. 40 and that he be allowed one week to give the explanation and that he not be allowed to sit until the explanation be given.

Cr Parks 2nd and carried with only Cr Butterworth opposed.
