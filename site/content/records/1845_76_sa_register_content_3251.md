Now our ancient enemy, Mr George Stevenson, who fraternizes with the Burra Burra Directors, has also commenced a suit against us.

We could not imagine in what way we had offended him, until we noticed in the letter of our correspondent ‘Teamster’ in last Wednesday’s Register that in commenting upon his conduct as a public journalist, he had been referred to as ‘Honest George’.  It is something new to find a man offended by an epithet that is usually regarded as complimentary and stranger still that the ingenuity of lawyers can twist such an expression into a libel, when there is nothing in the context or in what follows to indicate it was intended to be taken other than literally.

‘We can see nothing to apologise for, unless we were to express sorrow for having permitted our correspondent to call him “Honest George”.’

[George Stevenson had been in charge of the SA Register (then the SA Gazette & Colonial Register) up till 1842, when the journal passed into other hands.]
