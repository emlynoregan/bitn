Teetulpa Goldfield.  ‘A Digger’ writes again that about 2,000 people at a meeting with the Commissioner of Crown Lands expressed their concerns about the lack of a water supply and poor sanitation.  The Commissioner said he believed the richness of the place was not overstated.  But people are again leaving faster than they are arriving: mainly due to the water supply.  Dysentery and cholera are present and people are beginning to die.  A cemetery has been selected at the foot of Brady’s Gully towards Mt Victor.  Horses are dying all around.  Though there is gold it costs perhaps £5 to get £1 worth.  The writer believes that (a) the gold-bearing area has long ago all been taken up, and (b) it has largely been worked out.
