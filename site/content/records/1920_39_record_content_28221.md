Burra Show

Friday was very windy with afternoon rain, but on Saturday the weather was good.  The Point Pass Brass Band was much appreciated.  Mrs J.B. Rowe’s catering was excellent.

There were fewer sideshows this year.

Agricultural produce was better than the season gave cause to expect.

Dairy Produce gave an excellent indoor display – especially of note were the efforts of Mr & Mrs E. Finch of Wandillah.

Poultry was up to standard.  Pigeons were a fair showing – well represented in some classes, but with few entries in others.

Draught and Blood Horses were of good quality, though few in numbers.

Horses in Action attracted nearly 300 entries and were the focus of keen interest.

Cattle.  Jerseys were the only class well represented.

Dogs came in a wide variety, but the judge was disappointed in the greyhounds considering the number of coursing clubs in the area.

Sheep from small breeders were well represented, but the entries from larger and stud breeders were not as numerous as their importance would suggest.  In the latter area Maurice Collins, Henry Collins & Co. and T.J. Bailey were notable.

Fat Sheep, Shorn.  W.A. Swearse took most awards and also in the Fat Sheep section.

Fleece Wool had continued to expand as an exhibit and this year’s stretched almost the length of the long shed.

Implement made a good display.

Cars were displayed by Wright’s Motors Ltd, G.H. Dollman of Burra Motors, W.R. Lee (Ford Dealer) & H. Jennison showed a good display of Harrington’s Wireless.

The Vegetable Competition was dominated by B. Opperman & W. Moxham once more.

Fruit was barely represented following the boisterous weather which kept R.L. Hunter from Clare away.

Flowers.  Boisterous weather of late had reduced some classes, but the display remained impressive.  Roses, ranunculi and pansies were very good.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was listed as a judge, but did not appear in the prize list.]

Cookery was very well represented as were home made sweets.

Arts & Industries seems to have been boosted by the decision to limit it to a radius of 60 miles, which gave locals a greater incentive to enter and win prizes.

Photography & Art was an interesting exhibition and an improvement on earlier years.

In the School Class Section Burra was not well represented, but other district schools made up for that.  Ayers Forest with 58 entries scored 50 prizes and World’s End, Leighton, Copperhouse and North Booborowie were all well represented.

On Saturday President I.J. Warnes had an excellent luncheon for 100-150 guests which included several Members of Parliament.  The speeches of the occasion are reported in 1½ columns.
