Burra Burra DC

Burra Town Hall upgrading continues.  Some new seats will be bought.  The stage curtains will be altered to provide wings at the sides.  New welded steel handrails have been placed at the side of the external steps at the entrance and these have been painted white.

Work on the beautification of Burra Creek is proceeding, with the new car park opposite the Town Hall being levelled and a low stone barrier wall will now be erected.  Seats, tables and barbecues will be placed on the opposite sides of the creek and extensive tree planting will be undertaken.  The Tourist Promotion Committee is co-operating with the Apex Club and the Community School in this.  The National Trust is planning to embark on tree planting as well.

About 20 properties on which rates have not been paid for at least three years will soon be sold by the Council.

Peacock’s Chimney has been floodlit and looks very impressive.  Young vandals on bikes were seen throwing stones at the lights on the second night of illumination.

Late night shopping will operate in Burra on Christmas Eve, Friday 24 December.  The usual merry-go-round will operate in the afternoon and evening.

Matriculation Exams are in progress in the Catholic Parish Hall this week and next.

A Burra Caravan Park Occupant writes objecting to the noise throughout the night created by a group of youths 12-14 years old who appear to be at a shed near the lawns beyond the Caravan Park.  District Clerk T.G. Perry would appreciate any relevant information.

BCS.  The Management Committee has been looking at the possibility of the BCS Library becoming a Community-School Library.  The present library is set up to serve the needs of the school students.  If it became a Community-School Library it would be funded in three ways; through the Education Department, through the State Government vis the State Library and through the local District Council.  As well as books there would be periodicals and cassettes available.  Access would be given to all State Library resources.  It would normally have 14 books per head of population and the annual replacement would be about one seventh of the stock.  Institute libraries in the district would have to be dissolved and in return the Community-School Library would set up branches, which would provide books and periodicals and change the stock regularly by means of the school bus service.  Books of historical or local significance would be retained by the local branch.  The whole arrangement was discussed by representatives of those involved at a meeting on 11 November.

Each Council and Institute must now make its own decision. So far the Burra District Council has come out enthusiastically in favour and the Booborowie Institute has also agreed.  Other decisions are eagerly awaited.
