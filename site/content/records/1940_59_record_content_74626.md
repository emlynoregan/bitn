The Burra Show was held last Saturday.  At 12.45 p.m. the President Mr Rex C. Warnes introduced the Director of the Royal Agricultural Society Mr H.J .Finnis, who opened the show.  G. Stanley Hawker moved a vote of thanks.  The official party adjourned to the main pavilion for luncheon.  The weather for the show was perfect.  The gate at £162-10-0 was slightly down.  Sideshows were less numerous due to the shift from the holiday weekend.  The flower display was outstanding, perhaps the best ever.

The school displays were bigger and better.

In Art entries were few, but the quality was good.  The main prize winners were J.E. Zanker and M. Perry in the Children’s Section.

New ideas in photography hold promise for future interest.

New skylights greatly improved the poultry pavilion.

Cattle numbers were disappointing and except for the prize winners, lacking in quality.  F.M. Jefferies took the aggregate prize.

Dog numbers were down, bur a reorganising of this section produced a better class of entries.

The whole of the pavilion was taken up by a magnificent flower display, probably the best ever.  Much credit goes to the Chief Steward Mr R. Fuss, who has done much work on improvements to the display and offers every assistance to exhibitors in staging their entries.  The main prize winners were: R. Harris, R. Fuss, Mrs H.A. Edwards, M. Falkai, L.G .White, A.C. Ford, R.W. Humphrys and Mrs W.H. Nankivell.

The judges said you wouldn’t see better in the Adelaide Show in the Floral Art Section.

C.H. Behn won the trophy in Grain & Fodder.

Horses in Action drew fewer entries because the Hamley Bridge Show was the same day.  The main prize winners were W.G. Couzens, W.F. Meyer, M. McWaters & T. Williams, while locals to take prizes were G. Gask and Miss M .Tiver.

Needlework entries were of excellent quality.  The Warnes Prize for a collection of fancy work went to Mrs P.V. Oates.  Others who featured were Miss Jean Ley and Mrs G.R. Finch.

Sheep.  Murray Thomas won in the Open Class strong wool section and Champion Strong Wool Rams.  The Champion Strong Wool Merino Ewe was entered by C.R. McInnes.

The Open Class Medium Wool Trophy went to J.L. Edmonds.

In 1000-2000 Class C.R. McInnes showed the Champion Merino Ewe.

East Bungaree Ltd had the best collection of vegetables.

In Wool the Champion Fleece was exhibited by K.R. Phillips of ‘The Gums’.
