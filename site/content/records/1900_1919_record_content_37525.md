Obituary.  The body of Edward Passman Sanderson was found on Faraway Hill Station on 3 March and S.M. Lane drove out to investigate.  He was heading for Buckalow Station in NSW in a sulky.  His sulky was noted about 3 miles from Faraway Hill on 28 Feb. but no one thought it odd enough to investigate till 3 March.  Death seems to have been suddenly from heart failure.

[Born 20 April 1868 Gawler: died Far Away Hill Station 28 February 1914.]
