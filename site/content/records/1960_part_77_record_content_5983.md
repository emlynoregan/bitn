Burra Racing Club held a successful meeting at the local course last Wednesday.  The running track was in excellent condition.  The meeting was unfortunate in having a fall or stumble in the first race when Yvette broke a leg.  The rider R. Wittwer escaped serious injury.  The CWA ladies provided lunch.  The main race was the Maylands Handicap of £100 and £16-5-0 trophy.  It was won by the favourite Burbyng owned by J.A.M. Mitchell & H. Stratman and ridded by May.  [Other results are printed.]
