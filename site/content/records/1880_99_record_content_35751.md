The editor goes on the correct the above.

The poll was not just in South Ward, but was of the whole town.

The ban was in fact enforced for a considerable time until eventually a laxity of supervision crept in.

[He might also have pointed out there was no ‘Kooringa Corporation’.]

As for an insidious attempt to strike a blow at the liberties of the licensed victuallers: this is all nonsense.  The Mayor could not override the law and there is nothing to show he tried to do so.  We are sorry to see the Lantern rail at an event it evidently knows nothing about.
