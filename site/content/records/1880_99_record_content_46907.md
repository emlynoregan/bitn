Redruth Court.

A. Moore v. F.T. Jones for £1-4-0 as balance due for rabbit scalps.

This was a messy case without counsel and in which no proper contract had been arrived at.  The decision was finally for the plaintiff in the amount asked for.

Matthew Ryan, alias Hennessy, aged 45 was charged by S. Hill of Burra with having attempted to commit an unnatural offence at the Burra Hotel on the previous night.  Ryan said if he did what he was charged with he must have been beastly drunk.  He was committed for trial.

David Roberts was ordered 14 days for being drunk & disorderly.
