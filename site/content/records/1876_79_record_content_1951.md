Entertainment: Cooper, Bailey & Co.'s Circus

Very bad weather made ground too sloppy for a circus performance. The tent for the menagerie show was erected and opened at 4.30pm, but as flood waters rose and the tent was flooded it had to be closed at 5.00p.m. The tents were on the Redruth side of the creek and the troupe had to travel 2-300yds in fast flowing water from 1-3ft deep just to get across the bridge and away to Kapunda. The special train departure was also delayed as the evening train did not get in till 2.15am.
