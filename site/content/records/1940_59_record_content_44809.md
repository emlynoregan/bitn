Burra Burra DC, 6 March

It was resolved to trade in the 1935 Bedford truck and purchase an Austin truck.

Clare Council is not prepared to assist with the cost of burning alongside the railway line in co-operation with the SAR Burning Gang.  In future Burra will not assist into the Clare Council area.

The Education department has approved a new school bus route via Copperhouse Road to Shafton Hill Corner and then over the hill to Mr Stockmanâ€™s and back to Burra.  The local Member of Parliament, G.S. Hawker, will be asked to bring the question of fox control to Government attention.
