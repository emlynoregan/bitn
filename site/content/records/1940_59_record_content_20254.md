It was decided to send a deputation to the Premier or Minister of Education urging the construction of a house for the headmaster of the High School.  The Department had owned a block of land in the town for some time, but no house had ever been erected.  It was also resolved at the same time to ask that accommodation be erected for railway employees at Burra North, some of whom were forced to live in Burra, due to the lack of accommodation nearer the railway station.
