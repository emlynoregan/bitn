Cr Ridgway moved payment without prejudice and that the commissioner of Public Works’ attention be drawn to the dilatory way the Department had carried out the work and the unsuitability of the engine and the impossibility of erecting it until a piece of land had been acquired.  Everything should be in place before a penny was asked for.

Placing the engine on the road would destroy the frontage of a portion of Bon Accord property and render the Council liable for damages.

Cr Sampson would not pay the account till the items had been supplied.  He thought they should ask for a detailed account.

Cr Tiver seconded the proposal to pay under protest.  The matter of the engine was done in an unbusinesslike way.  Mr Jobson had done his work well, but the Commissioner should come up and the Council should point out the blunders that had been made since then.

Cr West moved an amendment that the account not be paid till the details were supplied.  He felt the truth of Cr Ridgway’s remarks, but they did not want to become hostile to the Department.

Cr Symons asked what more they wanted?

The Mayor said they didn’t know what they were being charged interest on.

The motion was amended to make payment dependent upon receipt of the details and was then passed on the Mayor’s casting vote.

Cr Symons could not see who had been dilatory, as all had praised Mr Jobson.

Cr Sampson said that making East Ward pay for part of the cost of the new footway could not be put without a call of the Council as the Council had previously made the centre of the road the boundary.

The Mayor said the last meeting had heard the resolutions read and under them, unless some other resolution were passed, the cost must be equally divided as orders were for footways on both sides.

Cr Sampson said it was contemptible, all East Ward had got was a heap of rubbish.  To finish the job would take three times the sum already spent.  He would take extreme steps to prevent it.

Cr Symons did not know that any East Ward ratepayer wanted the footway and he would move that East Ward pay only the cost of levelling.  Cr Sampson 2nd.

Cr West said Cr Sampson wanted to gain all he could at the cost of West Ward.  The footpath would be used by all persons on both sides and should be paid for by both.

Cr Ridgway moved that West Ward pay ⅔ and East Ward ⅓ and that East Ward finish the other footway.

Cr Tiver did not wholly agree, but would support that if it was a way out.

The amendment was finally carried.

2,000 trees were ordered for use and distribution.
