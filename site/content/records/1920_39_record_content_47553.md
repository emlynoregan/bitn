Burra Local Court

N.F. Pens was fined Â£1 + 15/- for being drunk and a general nuisance at a dance in Aberdeen.  He was warned that a repeat would result in three month in jail and in his being declared a habitual drunkard.

P.H. Darcy, a shearer, was fined 5/- for being drunk in a public place.

Colin Dormer was fined 5/- + 15/- costs for driving a motor cycle without a licence.  (It was viewed leniently, as it had expired three days before.)
