A.C. Aughey farmer of Springbank injured his big toe badly a fortnight ago and on 14 January caught his right arm in the thresher injuring it badly.  He was able to stop the machine, but was trapped in a painful position for half an hour before help came.  The wounds are mending, but sinew repair will be slow.
