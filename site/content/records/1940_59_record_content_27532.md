Burra Town Council

[The debate on the declaration of the rate is rather confusingly reported.  Cr Kellaway moved that the rate be 2/8 with 2d earmarked for the Town Hall.  This actually meant a General Rate of 2/6 and a special rate of 2d as reported the previous week.]

The Town Clerk said he estimated costs had risen by £400 since 1939 and he considered a rate of 3/- would be needed to avoid a deficit by the year’s end.  Cr Reed moved an amendment that a rate of 2/11 be struck.  The original motion of Cr Kellaway was carried.

[Presumably both the Town Clerk and Cr Reed’s ideas included 2d for the Town Hall?]

The Fathers’ Association put on a very successful Amateur Hour, Quiz and Dance at the Burra Town Hall on Friday evening.  The profit was £55.  [Reviewed in c. 1 column.]
