Burra Town Council

Burra Electric Supply Co. advises that the Rotunda light would cost £7-17-6 p.a. for 100 c.p. and £6 for 50 c.p.

Council agreed to take an annual rental on the Council Chamber for £36.

The Council decided not to sell the land requested by either Mr Blunt or Mr Short.

Mr Blunt will be given a 20-year lease at 5/- p.a. with the lease terminable by either side on three months notice.

A motion to rescind the decision placing the guns in Holder & Lane Gardens was carried.

It was resolved to confirm their present location on either side of Lewis’s Bridge.  [Commercial St.]

Mr Collins MHR will be asked to give a lease on land to enable an aerodrome to be established where Captain Roberts landed recently.
