Accident/Obituary.  Two well-known Mid North identities died last week.  Collinsville studmaster Wal Hennessy and Jamestown businessman Ross Downing were killed when a light aircraft in which they were travelling crashed on Kilfera Station, south of Ivanhoe on Wednesday.  They were attending a field day.  It is alleged the plane veered to avoid powerlines, but clipped a radio tower and hit the roof of an old homestead, before bursting into flames.  Wal Hennessy was a leading Merino expert and had been studmaster at Collinsville since its purchase by Paddy Handbury in 1994.  He is survived by his wife, Ann and three children.  Ross Downing was known for his transport and contracting business.
