Weather: Snow & Frost

Several residents reported snow at 3.30 a.m. on Saturday morning, to a depth of about one inch.  Before dawn a heavy shower of rain washed away all traces.  The frost on Monday was probably the heaviest for many years.  Mrs E.J. Lehmann hung out some washing at 5.30 a.m. and at 6 a.m. it was frozen as stiff as a board.  Mr Lehmann took passengers to the train before 6 a.m., picked up parcels and delivered them, and then took a passenger to World’s End and on reaching Burra again at about 8 a.m. his car was still white with frost.
