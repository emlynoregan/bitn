Rev. Father Redden was farewelled at the Institute on 7 August by a fairly large crowd which presented him with an illuminated address and a purse of 46 sovereigns.  On medical advice he goes to Belair for one month’s holiday, then to his family at Pekina before an extended sea trip.  He will be missed by many friends and in the cricket, football and ‘other manly recreations’.
