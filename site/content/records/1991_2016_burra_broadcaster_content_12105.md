Burra Burra DC – December

Council approved work needed to make and finish the sealing of the road around Burra Oval.

Vic & Monique Haddow have resigned as managers of Paxton Square Cottages at the end of their contract, but will continue in the role until Easter.  A Council sub-committee will select replacements.
