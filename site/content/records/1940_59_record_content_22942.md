An Urgent Appeal

Now that the war is over there will be many returned and returning servicemen in the town and there is an essential job to be done in supplying them with suitable Club Rooms for general relaxation and social purposes.  With this object in view the Burra Sub-Branch of the RSL is determined to get going quickly to reach this objective within three months.  The aim is to build or furnish suitable premises and this will cost a considerable sum.  The aim is to raise £2,500 quickly.  The appeal has been started with the following donations:

Estate of the late John Tennant	£500

R. Reed & Son		£100

Mr & Mrs E.C. Collins	£100

Mr Stanley Hawker	£100

Mrs Stanley Hawker	£100

Mr L.W. Gebhardt	£100
