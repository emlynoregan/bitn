Burra Pictures.  On Wednesday night the Town Council discussed the on-going losses of the Burra Pictures.  One possibility is to decrease the frequency to fortnightly or monthly.  The future of the pictures and the election of a body to run the Town Hall will both be considered at a public meeting to be called by the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone.  One wonders whether it is the noise and behaviour of some patrons that keeps others away.
