Mount Alexander.  A former compositor for the Register (W.W.) writes from the diggings:

Been here 3 weeks

It was a desolate 80 mile walk from Melbourne with neither houses nor shelter.

It took a week, with luggage on a bullock dray.

Our first search was fruitless.

Joined in then with a rush to a new site with 1,000 or so others, but got very little in our first week.

The second week yielded 2 oz per man after extremely hard work and great privations.

On the Saturday ending the second week it rained and hailed in bucketfuls; all was thoroughly drenched.

In the last week we got gold worth c. £8 each, but that is little enough recompense for the labour and privations.

Some here strike it lucky, but I have seen parties who after three weeks have not enough to pay for their expenses home.

Licences cost 30/- a month, so we will go on for a few weeks longer.

Some parties have dug nine holes without any luck.

To my late companions: ‘My sincere advice to them and all others who find themselves comfortable at home, is to remain there, as gold-hunting, to 19 out of 20, is not such a mode of making a future as many suppose.’
