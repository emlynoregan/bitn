In 1926 a syndicate placed a 16 ft clinker-built boat on the lagoon and hired it out for 2/6 an hour or 6d on Sundays and public holidays.  In 1927 it was christened The Swan by Mrs Atkins and a single plank jetty was erected.  A second boat was called The Gull.  A regatta was held for some years around Australia Day with such events as bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel and a 440 yard swim.  Laurel Neill recalled thousands attending.  But the water level fell and by 1937 salt scraped from the surface was being sold.  The lake filled again in the 1950s and water skiing became popular.  Peter Caddy brought a team from Barmera and the Australian Water Ski Championships* were held on Porter’s Lagoon in the mid 1950s.  Water skiing was also popular in the 1970s with Burra families like the Websters, Shipards, Stockmans, Burges, Baums and the Kellys.
