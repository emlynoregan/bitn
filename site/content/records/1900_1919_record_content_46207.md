The All-British League.  A branch was formed in Burra at a meeting called by the Mayor on Thursday evening last.  He worked himself up into a fine patriotic fervour reading from a speech delivered by the Kaiser in 1908, which outlined the latter’s plans for world domination.  The Mayor went on to say that ‘no one blames a German [in Australia] simply because he was a German or of that descent, but it was expected that everyone with German blood in his veins who lived in a British community and enjoyed British liberty and prosperity, that they should stand up and declare on all possible occasions that they had no sympathy with the Kaiser and his brood.’ Etc., etc.

In church one man could sing the hymns, but was dumb when the National Anthem was sung.  In Market Square some omitted to take off their hats when the National Anthem was sung.  Should Britishers take these insults?  The Government was still giving jobs to Germans when Britishers volunteered for the front.  The Mayor then read the objects of the league and people who joined should be prepared to carry them out to the letter.

Mr Pederson said that according to the rules he was not eligible to join, not being of British lineage, but he had seen German armies overrun his own country [Denmark] in 1864 and had suffered under German rule.  This was sufficient evidence that the movement had his sympathy.  Many years before he had been a member of the volunteers.

Mr Lane gave it his support as did Mr Milner.

Mr Lawn thought it should have been long established.

Mr W.H. Pearce moved that a branch be formed and W. Lee 2nd.

Mr Crewes was elected President and Mr Horner, Secretary.

Vice-Presidents are: Messrs I.J. Warnes, E. Cock, T. Sandland, A.J. McBride, John Tennant, R.J.M. McBride, W.G. Hawkes, J.M. McBride & P. McBride.

During an interval in the meeting Miss Bullen was presented with a farewell gift of a travelling case and rug.

A big meeting is called for 18 May.
