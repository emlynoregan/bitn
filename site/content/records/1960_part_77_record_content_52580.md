Burra Mine

Roche Bros. Pty Ltd have won the tender for mining the waste and ore at the Burra Mine.  The treatment plant, which will comprise an ammonia leach operation producing copper oxide, will be designed and installed in two stages.

Stage 1 will be designed to use 300 tons of ore per day.

Stage 2 will allow this to increase up to 1,000 tons per day.

Tenders have been called for installation of Stage 1.

Removal of waste and preparation for ore extraction will begin in September with the Stage 1 plant expected to be commissioned early in 1971.  Stage 2 is in the design stage and should be commissioned by November 1971.

The plan is to site the administration office, workshops and amenities buildings on vacant land south of the Burra Railway Station.

The open cut and treatment areas will be securely fenced and tourist roads will either be maintained or re-routed where necessary.

Mr H.J. Rich has been appointed manager of the operation.

It is estimated 60-70 people will be employed fairly evenly split between the mining and the treatment-administration sites.
