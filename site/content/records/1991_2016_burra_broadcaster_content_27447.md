Dugouts

Peter Birt & Catherine Hunt archaeologists from Flinders University have discovered a well preserved entry path to a dugout.  It is stone paved and about 0.6 m wide.  Part of the dugout it leads to has also been excavated.  On 23 March Peter will present a paper on the Burra Community Archaeology Project at a conference of the Society for American Archaeology in Denver.
