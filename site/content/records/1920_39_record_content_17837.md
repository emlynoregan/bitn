‘Mordecai MacCobber’ gives a visiting author’s impressions of Burra.

He is surprised by the number of prosperous and up-to-date residences in the surrounding districts and by the gardens and flowers.  He admired the Institute library and was much impressed by the work of G.E. Dane who was coaching local talent for ‘his cloches de Corneville’.
