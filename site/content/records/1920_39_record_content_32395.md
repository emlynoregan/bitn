Burra Town Council, 4 November

Wright’s Motors were granted permission to erect another petrol pump.

Mr Bednall solicitor advises that the piece of land along sections 333-338 owned by Mrs Smith has not been gazetted as a road and so Council has no power to close it.  The Town Clerk is to ascertain who owns it and have it deleted from the plan as a road.  [This was a strip south of George St on the eastern side of the allotments on the eastern side of Ayers St.]

Cr Lee asked if Mr Treloar had redress if the pines were damaging his property.  The Mayor said he had, if he could prove it.

Cr Allen gave notice he would move to rescind the motion refusing to allow their removal.

The Inspector reported on the problem of starving stray stock.  The pounds in the district had been closed as poundkeepers had been running them at a loss.  Owners found the cheapest way of getting rid of starving stock was to let them be impounded.

There was discussion about reporting owners to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Lee on the death of his mother.
