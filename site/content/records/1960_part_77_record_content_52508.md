*These results do not make sense.  The absence of Colts results would suggest they are mixed with the above.  In the ‘A’ Grade the description says Riverton won by 31 points and this fits neither of the results, but perhaps the second of them is the ‘A’ Grade and the first the Colts.  In the ‘B’ Grade the match was described as evenly contested with Aberdeen winning, so perhaps the first is the ‘B’ Grade and the second the Colts, but that can only be speculation.
