The Burra Institute held its half-yearly meeting of subscribers.

The income for the period was £141-11-1 and the expenditure £125-8-10.

The building expenditure had caused them to have a bank overdraft of £343-17-7.

A sum of £210 was to come at once from the Government towards this sum, but work in hand was yet to be paid for.  Subscriptions will be sought to meet the debt.

Income from lodges and other bodies is large and increasing.

Membership is now 135 compared with 55 six months ago.
