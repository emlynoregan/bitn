Burra Community sports Club Inc.

President Paul Wilson’s report for 1988-89

This was a short year due to the decision to change the AGM from July to March to coincide with the summer-winter sports changeover.  This year the club’s books went from debit to credit, though we will have to use our overdraft to operate some fundraising events later in the year.  There is a plan to install a dance floor and earthworks still have to be done in the Small Bore Rifle Range area to make room for more parking.  We are also waiting for a quote to effect repairs to the oval’s watering system and for the repair and rejuvenation of the turf.

[Thanks to individuals and the Ladies’ Auxiliary follow.]

Elected for 1989-90: President, Paul Wilson; Vice-President, J. White; Secretary, C. Robinson and Treasurer, D. Day.
