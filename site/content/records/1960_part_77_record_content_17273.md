Adelaide-Burra Road Race was run on Saturday in heavy rain and gale force winds.  Thirty-seven riders departed Cavan at 10.04 a.m. and took three hours to reach Tarlee and arrived in Burra just after 4 p.m.  The time was 5 hours 36 minutes 52 seconds, which was good in the conditions.  The winner was Bob Panter of Whyalla.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone presented the prize money to the winner and the place-getters.  Next year the race will be from Burra to Adelaide.
