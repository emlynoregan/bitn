Obituary.  On 28 September Robert James Woollacott was killed in action in France. He was the 5th son of T.H. Woollacott and was aged 28.  [Born 10 March 1886 Aberdeen: died at Vermelles, France.]

R.J. Woollacott was born at Aberdeen.  He learned shorthand and typing in Melbourne and worked with Mr Radford.  He left there and went to work at the Magnetic Works under Mr Maryatt.  When the works closed he went to Adelaide for a time before getting a position in electrical machinery at the Central Mine in Broken Hill.  Here he studied and passed exams in 1905-07.  He continued studying electrical engineering in 1909-11 while working in an electric tramway powerhouse.  He passed each year with honours and became an inspector over his own and other powerhouses.  In May 1913 he went to work for Sims Bros of Stafford in England â€“ electrical machinery manufacturers.  He intended to return to a position in the Melbourne electrical railway system.  When war broke out he enlisted on 3 September 1914 and was in the trenches from about Christmas time until 28 September when he was killed.  He distinguished himself in the army, rapidly rising from the ranks and being mentioned in despatches by Sir John French for valour.
