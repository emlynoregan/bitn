Burra Community School’s Bi-Annual Continental was held on Friday despite the searing heat.  Numbers were large, though perhaps slightly lower than in previous years.  Stalls and activities were spread around the school and focused on the theme of Rainbow Circus.  The Burra CFS unit was a great hit with the younger visitors, with chances to hit orange traffic cones with the big hose.  The bouncy castle and the rock wall were also popular.  Painted faces, glow sticks, live music from Kerry Davy, show bags and food were all well patronised attractions.  Thanks are extended to the Goyder Council for providing the jumping castle and the rock climbing wall.
