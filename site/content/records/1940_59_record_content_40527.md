Burra Town Hall.  The Savings Bank of SA will consider a loan of £3,300 against the Town Hall.  The interest would be £3-7-6 per cent per annum and therefore the half-yearly payments would be:

£195-15-8 for a 10 year period

£141-1-9 for a 15 year period

£114-2-5 for a 20 year period.

The Mayor said they were currently not paying off capital and this scheme would save £30-£40 p.a. or about £1,000 over 20 years.  Consideration was deferred.
