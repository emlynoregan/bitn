Scouts.  The Scout Bazaar at the Institute last Friday took over Â£30.  It was opened by Rev. Coles who said when he came to Burra he found a small troop of cubs that had been started by Rev. F.B. Hewitson and about twelve months ago he had managed to get a Scout Troop going with Mr D.T. McBain as Scoutmaster.  Membership was now c. 20.
