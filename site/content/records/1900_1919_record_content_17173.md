Divorce.  Elizabeth Hancock asked for the dissolution of her marriage to Henry Thomas Hancock on account of cruelty and misconduct.  They were married at Redruth in 1879 and had six children.  She gave evidence of severe assaults in 1899 & 1901 when his ill treatment compelled her to leave the house.  She also alleged misconduct with a woman at the respondent’s house.  As a result of the mistreatment she said she was blind in one eye.  The judge said he would report to the Full Court that the allegations of adultery and misconduct had been proved.

[Actually according to the registration data Elizabeth Esau/Esaw/Easaw married Henry Thomas Hancock on 1 January 1879 at the residence of William Hancock, the groom’s father, at Broughton.  There were five sons and one daughter born either at North Adelaide or the Clare Valley and also he had a son by Ellen Thrush at North Adelaide in 1904.  Since Elizabeth was born at Riverton in 1853 there is no clear Burra connection without further information.]
