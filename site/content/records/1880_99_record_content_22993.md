Burra Cemetery.  The cemetery is still a place of recourse on weekends, especially on Sundays when it is a ‘common place of rendezvous for all sorts of people, including nurse girls and their charges, and children of all ages.  Too often, besides other unpleasant incidents, the crowd almost prevent the mourners and relatives attending the funerals from coming right up to the grave, and the crying babies and talkative children very seriously interfere with the service.  Dogs, too, often find their way into the cemetery with the people . . . the sight of boys running almost over graves must be most painful to friends’.  The writer felt that some regulation was needed and perhaps a police presence.
