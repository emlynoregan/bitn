Violent Robbery.

On Saturday, Mr Robert Henderson, stone mason, was savagely and murderously attacked near the Stone Hut.  He was on his way to Adelaide and was carrying three £50 orders on the company for work done by him.  He had put up for the night at the Stone Hut public house.  It was ingoing out to tend to his horse, that he was attacked and rendered unconscious.  When he came to he was barely able to get up and was covered in bruises, with his face horribly swollen and bruised.  His pockets he had been rifled of everything, including the three £50 orders.  When he returned to the hotel he was surprised when the landlord, Mr Harris, nonchalantly observed that he must have been watched by someone.  Police were notified and last night a report was received that the supposed perpetrators were in custody at Gawler.
