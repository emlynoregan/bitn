Community Revegetation Project

An information day will be held at the proposed site of the nursery at Leighton Cricket Club Oval on Sunday 28 June.  The idea is to grow species not otherwise obtainable, to complement planting of existing and traditional species.  Goyder Council has allocated $3,500 from the Burra Ward Capital Fund.
