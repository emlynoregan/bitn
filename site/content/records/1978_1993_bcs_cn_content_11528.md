Burra Pool Management Committee reviewed the Gone Fishin’ project and was disappointed to note that there must have been considerable pilfering of the fish stocks.  This is disheartening.  The actions of a few members of the community have severely limited the success of this fundraising effort by a non-profit making community group.
