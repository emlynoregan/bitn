The Local Board of Health, 5 February.

At an earlier meeting Mr V. Davies of the Burra Bacon Factory had been instructed to erect pipes to carry the businessâ€™s waste water across the creek to be absorbed in a sandy area.  After the minutes were read the Mayor said he wished to have recorded as a dissenter to the motion.  Cr Kellaway said the minutes had been confirmed and it was now too late to effect alterations.  After some further altercations about the position of the Medical Officer, the Mayor said that having raised the point, he was now satisfied.
