Earthquake.  Last Saturday at about 12.17 a severe earth shock occurred in Burra.  It was the worst ever felt here.  It appeared to travel from west to east.  Two after shocks were felt in the afternoon.  The post office building was cracked in a couple of places and the dressing rooms at the Institute.  Every second-floor ceiling at the Royal Exchange Hotel was cracked.  Several chimneys in the town lost bricks onto roofs and in four private houses walls opened about 2-3”.  On Sunday at 9 p.m. a similar shock occurred and similar damage was reported.

The World’s End correspondent reported five tremors in 48 hours, but no serious damage.
