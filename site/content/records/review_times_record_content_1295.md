Obituary for Bill Brown

Bill was the founder and manager of ‘The Grove’ Merino Stud.  His administrative skill had been fully used as President of the Merino Stud Breeders’ Association and as Chairman of the Burra Burra DC.  As the Bowling Club’s next President we had every reason to believe his enthusiasm would be channelled for the benefit of the Club and bowls generally.  He skippered a 1st Division team and last year, with John Calnan, won the Club’s Championship Pairs.
