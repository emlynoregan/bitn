Burra Burra DC, 3 June

Road closure order form plan 20 is to be signed and sealed.

Cr Wedding moved for a deputation to the Minister urging him the urgency of completing the work on the main road from Manoora to Hanson, Burra and Terowie to Broken Hill.  The deputation is to include the Corporation of the Town of Burra, Hallet DC and Burra Burra DC.

It was resolved to act as soon as the other Councils confirm their co-operation.

A presentation was made to Cr Beckwith for 10 years of service.  [He had not stood for re-election.]
