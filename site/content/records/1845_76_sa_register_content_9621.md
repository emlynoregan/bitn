Escape from Redruth Gaol

A lunatic escaped from the gaol on Tuesday evening while the keeper was in his own house upon business and the turnkey was in another part of the yard.  The man scaled the gate before the turnkey could prevent him.  Mr Perry, the gaol-keeper was immediately informed and gave chase.  After about a mile and a half he succeeded in recapturing the prisoner.  The blame does not attach to the turnkey, but is due to the want of proper security at the gaol.  It is to be hoped that construction of the new gaol will soon commence, giving proper security and accommodation to prisoners.
