Southern Cross Television says it is on the way to fixing the poor reception problems.  Since broadcasting in Digital Widescreen they have had problems with the existing Microwave Link System.  This has proved unreliable and a Digital Video Network fiberoptic cable from Adelaide to Pt Pirie is replacing it.  The date of completion is uncertain, but is being worked on for a good signal as soon as possible.
