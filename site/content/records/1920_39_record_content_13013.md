Letter.  Maurice Collins writes to complain that a circular put out by the Liberals says he would prefer to see Labour win rather than the Liberal government returned.  In a heated exchange with Maurice Radford recently what he said was ‘I would certainly prefer to see the Labour Party returned to power than the present government, if there were many men like you in it.’  The context makes his position clear and the circular, by misleading the people has been put about ‘no doubt at the instigation of its worthy President, Mr Radford.’  [Collins was a candidate for the Country Party.]
