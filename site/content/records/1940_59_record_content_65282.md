Vegetables had some fine examples.

Arts & Crafts, Dairy Produce, Cookery & Fruit were sections where the number of entries fell.

School entries were quite good from the district schools, but were disappointing in that Burra High and Primary Schools were not represented.

Bruce Stockman won the sheaf tossing at 36 ft.  Three feet better than his win last year.

Ring events were as popular as ever with 350 entries.

The Boxing Troupe of Major Wilson attracted great interest.  Burra Rural Youth had an exhibit for the first time and it was truly remarkable.

The Gala Night at the Show Ground with the dance in the hall was well patronised and added Â£53 to the takings.

President Rex C. Warnes introduced the Minister of Agriculture, Hon. A. Christian MP who opened the show.
