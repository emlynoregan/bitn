Mary Heinrich of the Burra Hotel writes to complain of the ineptitude and/or laziness of M-C Clarke following on from the recent case involving the stolen boots.  Some larrikin locked some of Heinrich’s fowls and a duck in one of the hotel’s bedrooms and all M-C Clarke did was to suggest they see a solicitor.  He was also asked to compel a dismissed ‘boots’ to return the hotel’s keys to the gas-house, cellar and stable, but refused to take any action.
