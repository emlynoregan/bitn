The Burra to Robertstown Road has been sealed by Regional Council of Goyder staff members under the direction of Peter Boaden Director of Operation.  About 70 invited guests and interested locals joined the Council at the unveiling of a cairn to mark the opening of the new road by Hon. Bob Sneath MLC representing the Minister for Transport on the outskirts of Robertstown.  The road covers a distance of 29 kilometres and was completed at a cost of just under $4 million.  After the opening the guests adjourned to Robertstown Peace Hall.
