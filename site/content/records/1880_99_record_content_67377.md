He came from Leighton buzzard in Bedfordshire and sailed for SA with his wife in February 1848 in the David Malcolm, arriving at Port Adelaide in May 1848.  He worked in Adelaide as a tailor before moving to Burra in 1849.  When the goldfields opened up he went to Victoria for c.  2 years.  Back again in Burra he was a tailor before trying farming rather unsuccessfully.  He was a member of the Burra Burra Lodge for 49 years, having joined in March 1850 and was very active in it.  In 1878 he was financial secretary and was treasurer until 1894 when he retired as the result of a serious accident.  He is survived by his wife (aged 80), four daughters and one son.  There are 32 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.  He took an active role in the Wesleyan Church.  There will be a memoriam service on Sunday evening by Rev. W.G. Clarke and the funeral is today at 2.30 p.m.  [Born 9 November 1820: died 14 November 1899]
