The Northern Railway Commission was taken over the Farrell’s Flat-Spalding route on Thursday.

The advantages for this route were cited as:

It serves the Hill River & Spalding area as well as a line from Clare would.

It would serve the Booborowie area in addition.

It is a much shorter distance to build.

It is in better country for construction and would thus have lower running costs too.

It would open up over 10,000 acres, which with a railway could go into dairying.
