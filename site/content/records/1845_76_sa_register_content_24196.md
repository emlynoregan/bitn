Bushranger Captured

John Baker, who was arrested last Friday at Kooringa, seems to have been devoid of the bushranger’s usual prudence.  In May 1869 a warrant was issued at Wilcannia in the Darling District of NSW charging him and William Bertram with horse-stealing from Mount Murchison Station.  There is also a charge of robbery of a hawker in the Barrier Ranges.  Bertram has since been hanged for murder and robbery.  Baker has eluded capture despite a £50 reward.  He spent his younger days at Burra and was employed at the Cross-roads grounds about seven years ago as assistant rider.  Later he broke colts for Messrs Macdonald & Hosking, the present mail coach proprietors of the Northern Line.  It is surprising that being known in the district he should go to Kooringa, enter a barber’s shop to have his hair cut and ask to have it dyed and then express impatience at the time the operator took to cut his hair after refusing to dye it.  He then walked with two other men to Redruth and sat down outside the Court House door and began cutting up tobacco.  The Court was sitting and the place was full of people.  The police had received news he was en route for Burra and were taking measures to secure him.  Lance-Corporal Smith who had previously often seen the prisoner in Burra was astonished to see him outside the Court House.  He and Police Constable Noble at once arrested him.  After walking a few steps and on being told the charge he bounded into the air with great agility and had not the police been very quick, would have escaped.  It was only after a violent struggle that they managed to get him into a cell.  With his very small hands he managed to slip the handcuffs.  There was a revolver in his swag, but no arms were found on his person. He asserted that his reason for visiting Burra was to sell some horses he had brought with him.  He is a smallish man and of a wiry build.
