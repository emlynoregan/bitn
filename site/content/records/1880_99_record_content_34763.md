2nd Leader on the failure of the Black Hills claims to live up to hopes and to be abandoned.  Then there were also claims owned by the Burra Manganese and Silver Mining Co. at Iron Mine, which have also to be abandoned.  Now the Burra ‘Joker’ property of a local syndicate, some 60 miles east of Burra.  Much has been expended, mostly by very small investors - workingmen and tradesmen - several experts have visited - some encouraging and others urging caution.  The Inspector of Mines, D.D. Rosewarne, now reports on the claims in the Hundred of Ketchowla on a large iron outcrop some 30’ wide at the surface.  A shaft has been sunk 160’ with little to indicate valuable minerals.  To the east are two shafts: one a vertical of 80’ and the other an underlie shaft to 30’ and neither show any mineral save iron.  This would, if it were on a railway line, be useful for a flux.  The Inspector would not advise that any mining operations continue.
