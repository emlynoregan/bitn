‘Hazeldean’ Merino Stud hosted a seminar at Burra Sports Complex on 21 June.  Hazeldean Principal Jim Litchfield welcomed the participants and said the industry had to become more efficient and to a great extent that depended on genetics.  Beef, pork and chicken producers had all gone down that track, but wool had lagged behind, split between traditional approaches and more scientific ways forward.  Keynote speaker was Professor Andrew Vizard, Associate Professor of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne.  Other speakers were Albert Singh from PIRSA and Bill Walker from Classings Limited.
