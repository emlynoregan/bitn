Attempted Arson.

On Tuesday 5 March an attempt was made to burn down Drew & Co.’s (late Drew & Crewe’s) and Mr J. Snell’s premises.  Kerosene was poured under the door of the drapery section, but so closely does the door fit with the flagged floor that little of it penetrated.  The wood of the door was charred and numerous matches had been used to try to set it alight. It is thought to have been attempted between 1 & 2 a.m. on a moonlight night.

Kerosene had also been poured over the board threshold and boards leading to it, of Mr Snell’s shop.  Again despite the amount of wood there the fire failed to gain a hold.  M-C Jemison had been called to Clare on Tuesday night, a fact no doubt known to the arsonist.

M-C Phelan was contacted and took action to trace the arsonist.  A blacktracker was sent for and arrived Wednesday morning.  Tracks in the vicinity of C. Grow’s stables led to Thomas Byrne’s house in Thames St.  There was at first insufficient evidence, but Byrne was arrested on Thursday morning.  The case lasted from11 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. and will be reported next issue.
