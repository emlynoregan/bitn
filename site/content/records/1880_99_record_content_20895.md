‘The City of Big-Big’ Letters XXIV & XXV

The Literary content of the 1885 paper.

There was always a serialised novel and in addition there was a fluctuating amount of other material made up of non-fiction articles of general interest, some poetry and a column headed ‘Wit and Humour’. 

The serialised novels were:

No Alternative, by the author of Denis Donne etc., which ran from 2 January to 24 March.

The Last of the Montezumas: A Tale of Life’s Sunshine and Death’s Shadows, by Ben. Franklin Langford, which ran from 9 January to 3 March.

Life at the World’s End, also by Ben. Franklin Langford, followed the above and appeared on most weeks until  21 August.  It was not a novel, but a satirical view of life as seen from the ‘township’ of Lapford at World’s End.  The township at this time comprised a house or two and a lot of rapidly disappearing survey pegs marking out the streets and allotments.  The satirical nature of the pieces does not allow a clear understanding of what can be taken as a literal picture of the life there, but the general impression is clear.

The Wicked Wood of Tobereevil, by the author of Hester’s History began on 20 March and ended on 28 July.

Lelgarde’s Inheritance, ran from 24 July to 21 August.

Madame Delamere: How I Found Her, How I Won Her, and How I Lost Her, by Ben. Franklin Langford ran from 18 August to 28 August.

A Sicilian Story ran from 28 August to 8 September.

Young Mr Nightingale, By the author of Hobson’s Choice etc. ran from 11 September and was still continuing at the end of the year.

After Life at the World’s End concluded Ben. Franklin Langford began a long production under the pen name of Lankfürt von Löwenhertz, MD, DCL, LLD, FRCS etc.

This was entitled The City of Big-Big and purported to be: ‘A series of letters descriptive of the condition of society in the community which was formerly known as “Kooringa”, in the years 1910-11 and 12.’

I think modern readers would find it very tedious and hard going, though when first published there must have been references to both people and events that we now fail to see the relevance of.  Even allowing for that, I think there can have been few readers of the paper who were educated enough to plough their way through his verbosity.  That some did is clear from the complaints about what he said that appeared from time to time.  There are portions of the work that readers today can readily see as being obvious satirical attacks on aspects of life then that are recognisable.  In the first letter for example there is quite a good description of the Burra Creek, which in its nastiness can only have exceeded the real thing by a fraction.  I cannot pretend to have read the whole work to seek further gems hidden in the vast outpouring of the writer’s vitriol.
