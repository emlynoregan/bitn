Burra Town Council

At the last meeting a petition signed by 100 ratepayers demanded the Council hold a poll to decide whether it could borrow £400 on the security of the General Rate, to build a swimming pool.

Cr Dow questioned the validity of the petition, but after perusal by the clerk it was received.

The Mayor said there had been a lot of dirty work done in connection with the pool and a lot of dirty things said about him.  The plans had been drawn up by experts.  One builder said there was no roof on the pool, showing how ignorant he was of pools.  He was sure a pool could be built for £250, but he was going to wash his hands of the whole concern.  The business people of the town were losing a great opportunity for increased trade.  He had £50 worth of promises in his pocket, but the petition amounted to a vote of no confidence in the Council and he was absolutely finished with the whole thing.

Cr Dow said it had been said the extra 3d on the rate had been to pay for the pool, but that was a lie as all Councillors knew.

The Mayor said some people were against the site, but it was immaterial if it was shifted elsewhere.  Swimming should be a part of every child’s education.  If any other builder in town was capable of seeing the project through for £250, he would be pleased to see him.

Cr Kellaway though Council was taking the wrong stand.  Every Councillor was in favour of the pool and they should welcome a poll.  If supported, it would relieve the Council of responsibility.  The ratepayers had a right to demand a poll.

Cr Dow wanted the petition to lie on the table until the next meeting.  He objected to it as being not spontaneous, but organised.  His motion was not seconded.
