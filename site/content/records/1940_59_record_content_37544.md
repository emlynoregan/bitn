The Premier Visits Burra

Burra Town Hall was comfortably crowded last Thursday night when the Premier (Hon. T. Playford) delivered an address on the development of the Leigh Creek Coalfield and the building of the Whyalla Pipeline.  The lecture was illustrated by moving pictures in technicolour.  Prior to the meeting His Worship the Mayor of Burra (Mr H.J. B. Jennison) tendered a Civic Reception to the visitor.  The Mayor Elect, Mr F.T. Marston, spoke in support of Mr Jennison’s welcome.  During the welcome the opportunity was taken to remind the Premier of Burra’s needs.  The nearness of the Whyalla Pipeline had not seen it extended to Burra, a promised bitumen road connecting the town with Adelaide had seen no action, the Ballast Quarry was leased to the Government for 99 years, but had seen no action, and the government’s moves to decentralise industry had not resulted in any benefits for Burra.  Smaller towns than Burra had area schools, but despite Burra being the centre of the best sheep district in SA, there had been no move for one here.

Cr T.H. Woollacott endorsed the Mayor’s remarks.

The Premier said he would support the establishment of industry in Burra and was glad to see so many children present.  He hoped they might get a half holiday because the evening’s films were so educational.  He also provided extra commentary on some of the scenes shown in the films.

Afterwards the Mayor and Mayoress entertained to supper, the Premier, members of the Burra Town and District Councils and members of the Agricultural Bureaux of the district.
