‘Disgusted’ writes about the milk supply.  Cr Hardy asked how many milk licences had been applied for and how many had been granted.  The answer was none in each case.  Why has this been allowed to slip past the Board?  It is a serious and dangerous proceeding for a person to sell milk without having their premises passed by the authorities.  ‘Disgusted’ goes on to echo the sentiments of ‘One of Them’ concerning the notice boards on footpaths.
