The Associates are an essential part of the club and their catering has been especially capably handled.  The greens were reasonably good throughout and were good for Easter and the inter-divisional championships of the women’s Bowling Clubs.  The purchase of a new mower will make the job of the Greens’ Manager Edgar Pietsch easier.  Andrew Phillips had done good work preparing them for play and Wally Fridd is thanked for attending to the watering.
