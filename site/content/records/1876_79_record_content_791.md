Editorial on The Eastern Road.  [Burra-Morgan Road]

From what transpired at a meeting of the Midland Road Board on Wednesday we are of the opinion that a great misunderstanding has arisen on this issue, resulting in a contest between the two ends of the town.

Redruth and Aberdeen are fighting for a road via Diprose’s Creek, under the impression that Kooringa wished to retain the existing road over the Breakneck Hill and if they did that the steep gradients of the present road would be forced upon the district.

The remarks of Messrs Warnes, Lane and others, however, suggest neither party wants Breakneck Hill.  The opposition really wants a deviation via Nankivell’s Gully and over a natural saddle in the hills.  This they say would reduce the number of bridges required from five to two with no significant difference in the gradient.  Having only limited acquaintance with the terrain, we will not hazard an opinion as to the better course, but at least it needs to be judged on the correct information.  Perhaps the best solution would be for a public meeting to reach an equitable decision.

The Second Leader discusses the activities in Parliament in the past week.  The Legislative Council is considering a law requiring all vehicles within 10 miles of a Corporate Town to carry lamps after dark – previously a requirement only in the city.

The Burra-Hallett Railway Bill has passed.

Commonage.  A Baldina settler is complaining that having paid £40 for commonage rights it is not available.

Copper.  Mr Grenfell and party have made a rich discovery of copper about 11 miles south of the Burra Mine.  It is a north-south running lode some two feet wide of grey ore mixed with gossan.  Sinking has begun.  [Wheal Grenfell.]

Accident.  Yesterday a boy standing on the road by Orchard’s Hotel Aberdeen was knocked down by the shaft of Dr Nesbitt’s buggy as it passed.  Miraculously the horse and the vehicle both passed over him without touching the boy who escaped with a shaking.

Fire broke out in Mrs Green’s boarding house at Kooringa this morning at 2 a.m.  When help arrived Mrs Green was alight and the door leading to a bedroom was burnt half-way through and some articles were damaged.  The cause is not known.

Accident.  Mr Henderson of Statton & Henderson had a little finger of his right hand severely cut in a circular saw about a fortnight ago.  It has now had to be amputated.

Baldina.  New settlers are busy ploughing the ground.  A recent visit revealed only one crop and that very backward on account of the dryness of the season.

Weather.  There has been widespread rain in the [western] agricultural areas from last Saturday to Tuesday.  Burra recorded 1.31 inches for the week.

Redruth Primitive Methodist Church had special services on 6 & 7 August in aid of the Kooringa Manse Fund.  Rev. E. Masterman of North Adelaide preached on Sunday and his address at Monday’s tea meeting was on ‘Missionary Life and Labours in London’.

A second tea meeting was held on Tuesday.  Proceeds of about £30 bring the total raised for house enlargements for the past three months to £130.
