Weather.  The rainfall total for 1957 off 11 inches is the lowest for 43 years, but is still 3.83 inches higher than the 7.17 inches recorded in 1914.  The relatively good distribution of the rain in 1957 resulted in a relatively good harvest.  The eastern pastoral country benefited by heavy falls over Christmas, ranging from 30 points at Baldina to 159 at Old Koomooloo and 170 at Parcoola.  Falls exceeding 50 points were general and many received more than 1 inch.
