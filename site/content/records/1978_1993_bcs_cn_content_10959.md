At the Family Heritage Picnic about 90% of students and 100$ of staff were dressed appropriately.  An extra touch was added by the visit of the Grand Bard of Cornwall, Mr Hugh Miners.  He was given a Civic Reception in the morning.  Mrs Reta Jennison made the official opening at 12.30 p.m.  Primary classes went back to the good old days with a morning assembly, an inspection and saluting the flag.
