Patrick LeVagueresse, founder and president of the Burra Baseball Club, writes expressing pride at the official grand opening of the inaugural series of the Burra Baseball Club on 21 September.  The baseball field looked great and Graham Gunn MP and Mayor Peter Mattey were supported by Crs Peter Reilly and Adrian Gill.  The players were resplendent in their new uniforms, but he was embarrassed by the lack of public support.
