He is a resident of Whyalla.  The party focus is on health care, disabled and special needs education and the family unit.  His wife was the candidate at the last election.  The shortage of doctors and specialists in rural Australia needs to be addressed.  Hospitals should be controlled by local boards.  Farmers need more support and re-education when they are forced to leave the land.  Mr Holland (61) is a former builder carpenter and interstate road train driver.  He is also a qualified counsellor and a facilitator of a self-help program.
