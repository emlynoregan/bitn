Police Court, 21 May.

Mary Johns appeared on summons from Ann Jones, the wife of Gran Jones, smelter of Kooringa.  She was charged with a violent assault.  The two women began quarrelling at Mr Taylor’s shop in Aberdeen.  Each lady defended her case in broken English and sometimes in Welsh, which Mr Lang did not understand.  The case was adjourned for the production of more and more understandable evidence.

Elizabeth Gladwin alleged that Catherine Hutchins had illegally in her possession a ring the complainant had lost about two months before.  When she saw it on Mrs Hutchins’ finger she asked her how she had got it and was told she had bought it for £1.  She subsequently said if the complainant could tell the marks, she would give it up and be the loser of £1.  Mrs Hutchins denied all the evidence of Elizabeth Gladwin.

William Bailey swore he had seen the ring on Mrs Hutchins’ finger, but P.C. Rogers had only seen her wearing the two plain rings she then had on.

Jane Gladwin, mother of the complainant, gave the same account as her daughter.

Case adjourned for further evidence.

Benjamin Aldene was charged by PC Fitzgerald with having in his possession a box of stolen items.  These items included shoes, boots, coats, trousers, waistcoats, muslin dresses and shawls.  PC Roberts corroborated PC Fitzgerald’s evidence and said from patterns of various goods he had received from Mr Hutchins, storekeeper, he believed the goods were part of those stolen from Mr Hutchins and so arrested the prisoner.

James Pearce, timber merchant of Kooringa, said the prisoner had asked one of his draymen to take him and the box to Kapunda, Adelaide or the Gulf.  From circumstances, which had come to his knowledge he refused the request.  He identified the box.

William Hutchins identified some of the items as being stolen from his shop.  Some time elapsed while some witnesses went to compare chisel marks on their premises with a chisel found on Aldene.

In the meantime His Worship continued with the case against James Jones brought by James Pearce.  Jones had also been apprehended in connexion with the above case.  Pearce said James had assaulted him; apparently because Pearce had given the police some clue in the case.  James admitted the assault and was fined 10/- plus 21/- costs.
