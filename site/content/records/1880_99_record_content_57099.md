Princess Royal Rabbits

Six gentlemen went out to a shooting party on Princess Royal as guests of Mr A. McCulloch.  After a substantial repast they set out for about five miles and returned by another route.  By about 5 p.m. they had accounted for 238 rabbits.  In the past few months Mr McCulloch has been doing extensive work with phosphorised pollard and ploughing up burrows.
