James Mason is a new resident of Burra.  For 25 years he lived in a Milson’s Point apartment under Sydney Harbour Bridge.  The price of this prime location was high and he spent $20,000 looking for the best place to live, finally deciding on Burra, when he found Pearce’s Buildings for sale for about $200,000.  He intends to spend less than $100,000 doing it up.  You could not get a tin shed in Sydney for $200,000.  [Photo.]
