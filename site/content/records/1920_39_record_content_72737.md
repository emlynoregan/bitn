Burra Town Council, 17 October

The Finance Committee agreed to donate £60 towards debt reduction of the Institute and to donate 21/- to the Lord Mayor’s Czechoslovakian Fund.

With no nominations to fill the vacancy in West Ward created by Cr Dow’s resignation, W.G. Terry was appointed Councillor for West Ward.

Cr Samuel said he believed the Swimming Pool Committee was to hold a big meeting on the subject of erecting the pool in the week.  He asked where the Council stood with regard to the £400 it would have to pay if the scheme went ahead.

The Mayor said if the Committee found the funds needed in excess of the £400 the Council would have to pay the £400.

Cr Lott said the Clerk’s estimate showed they would end £230 overdrawn.

If the scheme went ahead the overdraft would be £630.

The Clerk said he could not show an item of expenditure which might not eventuate.
