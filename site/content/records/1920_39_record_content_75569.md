J. Brereton writes to correct statements in the report of the Burra Burra District Council.

Council apparently advised the Director of Lands that the northern portion of the Hanson Park Lands had been planted with trees and stock used the other portion when travelling to Burra Markets.  Brereton says that in fact only two acres of the north portion are planted and not the lot as implied.  As for the east portion, this as well as the north portion is let for grazing rights for sheep, giving the tenderer sole grazing rights and depriving travelling stock from using the land.
