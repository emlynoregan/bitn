Burra Town Council, 8 July

W. Carpenter was sworn in as Mayor and Crs Pritchard, White & Bernhardt as Councillors.

Parkland No. 7 adjoins the railway line and was previously entered from the stock road.  The District Council has sold the stock road, leaving the parkland without access, except through Mr T.H. Villis’s property.  The Clerk will enquire of Mr J.G. Carpenter if, under the circumstances, he still requires the lease.

There was considerable debate over the Mayoral allowance for the Jubilee Year, but the outcome is not clearly stated.  £70 seems likely.

Committees were appointed.

Grants for roads 1951-52 were £500 for main roads with the District Council’s contribution £100.

A federal Rural Grant of £400 was made to complete Eyers St [sic.]

There was a £150 grant for Smelts Road.
