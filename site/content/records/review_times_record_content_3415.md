Collinsville has fared very well at the Royal Adelaide Show, setting a world record price of $102,000 for a ram at the Adelaide Merino Ram Sale.  The ram with strong, dense, well-nourished wool of 27.8 micrometres will be used in an A1 program by Goyaike Breeding Society at Santa Cruz in Argentina’s southwest.  The same buyers paid $26,000 for another Collinsville ram.  The previous world record price was $79,000 for a Collinsville ram sold in 1981.  Joel Burke of Wyoming USA was the losing bid on the top priced sheep, but he bought one East Bungaree ram and twelve other Collinsville rams for a total of $284,600, paying $66,00 for Collinsville’s first pen.
