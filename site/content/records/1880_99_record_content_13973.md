‘Industry, Thrift’ writes arguing that contrary to a recent assertion a man might keep a wife and six children on £2-2-0 a week and in fact he knows of a case where it is done on 17/6.  It is the bottle and tobacco and the extravagant dress of wife and daughters, music lessons etc. ‘that does not become their class - that keeps them in such poverty-stricken circumstances’.
