Fire.  A spark from a goods train caused a fire on Saturday night at A.L. Collins ‘Stud Park’ Mt Bryan at c. 8 p.m.  Fire fighters soon assembled and controlled the blaze before much damage was done.  The stud rams in the paddock were promptly removed by Mr Schuyler.  About 20 acres of grass and lucerne was lost.
