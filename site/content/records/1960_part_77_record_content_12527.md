Burra Burra DC Weed Control Program is getting under way.  The main aspects of the program following the appointment of Mr Ian Fry of P.G. Rehn & Associates as Weeds Officer are:

Control of roadside weeds

Control of weeds on Council property and on Crown Lands

Control of weeds on private property

Mr Fry is concerned to remove reservoirs of seed wherever they lie.  The first step is a circular that has been sent out to ratepayers asking them to list weeds on their property and what steps are normally taken to control them.  Mr Fry has begun a survey of the district.
