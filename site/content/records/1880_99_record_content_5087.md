Redruth Court, 21 September.

John and Richard Harvey were charged with stealing two £1 notes from William Crawford in the night of 19 September at the Pig and Whistle.  The money was found under a carpet in the room.  The information was dismissed, but the prisoners were cautioned.  [The level of intoxication of all concerned made several aspects uncertain.]
