Kooringa Court, 30 August.

John Lines was charged on the information of Charles Ullmann, baker, with being unlawfully on the latter’s premises on the night of 29 August.  John Lines and James Knevitt entered Ullmann’s bakehouse in Kingston St and asked for a loaf of bread.  Ullmann said he didn’t have a loaf, but would give them a piece.  They then entered his bedroom and bread and a candle were thrown at him and one of the two then assaulted him.  Panes of his window were broken and later he noticed some buns and a white pudding were missing.
