Hon. R.S. Richards addressed a large assembly of electors as the ALP candidate for the Burra District in the House of Assembly on 26 February.  He berated the LCL Government on finance and said they could hardly claim to be Anti-Socialists in view of the Playford Governmentâ€™s record of State Enterprises and socialist undertakings.  The State Government followed the policies of the Federal Chifley Labour Government; policies being undermined by the Federal Liberals under Menzies and Fadden.  [The rest of the speech continued to develop the financial theme and is reported in a little less than 2 columns.]
