Rev. P.N. Potter, President of the Methodist Conference of SA, visited Burra last Wednesday.  160 guests welcomed him and his wife at the Redruth Hall where he met the Chairman of the Middle District, Rev. W. Stafford & Mrs Stafford.  Also in the official party were Rev. & Mrs Lind, Mr & Mrs B.P. Thamm and Mr R.M. Farrow who acted as MC.  Mr Thamm as Senior Circuit Steward welcomed the guests and the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone also extended a welcome on behalf of the Town Council.  Rev. Stafford briefly explained the workings of the Middle District and Rev. Potter gave an address.  He had been stationed in Burra some 26 years ago.  Rev. Potterâ€™s address was on Church Union.  It is hoped a Union of Presbyterian, Congregational and Methodist Churches will be finalised by 1971.  There are about 24 united parishes at present.  He also spoke on the need to adapt forms of worship for the young and for some new twentieth century hymns.
