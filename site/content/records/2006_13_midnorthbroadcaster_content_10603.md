Burra Creek beautification works have begun.  A plan has been adopted and contractors are planting and trimming trees.  The Kingston Street Bridge has been painted and repaired.  The next stage will see work on the section south of the bridge.  Dead reed beds will be removed by burning.  The weir near the dugouts will be removed to allow better access for future maintenance and planting of trees and ground covers will follow.  The area just north of the bridge will be upgraded in the next two years with landscaping, walkways and picnic areas.  The water level in this section will be maintained at its present level but there will not be permanent water beyond the present control weir [at Ursula St.]
