A.L. Walker, storekeeper:

Hear the alarm c. 11.30 p.m.  When I got to Dalgety’s Corner the fire was coming out of Allen’s office.  Took a fire extinguisher from our drapery store to the fire.  I put out the flames in the front rooms, but did not notice the flames in the back room.  Before more water could be got the fire burst out again.  Went to the adjoining shop.  There was then no sign of fire there.  Opened the back door to unlock the gate and filled a bucket with water in case fire should break out at the back.  Went into the street and closed the doors.  10 minutes later re-entered our shop and found flames coming along the ceiling in the back room.  Premises were insured for £500 and the stock for £300.  Our financial position is good.  On Wednesday night when the second fire occurred I was with M-C Queale from 6.30 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. and from 9.00 to 11.00 p.m. at my home with Mr Day.  Could not replace my stock for under £500.  There is no trace of fire at Allen’s back door.  Thought the fire must have originated in the front of Allen’s.  Was in the room at the back of Harrap’s between 7 and 8 Wednesday.  Mr Crewes and Harrap and some boys were there.  Harrap showed where the ceiling had been burnt a little.  He put a match to the ceiling and suggested he should burn it down.  I told him to stop.  He said it would be better burnt because it might catch fire in the night and ignite the buildings across the lane.  I said it would cost us the insurance to do so.  He said it would clean the whole place up.  I said he was a fool to do so.  When M-C Queale sent for me at 10 o’clock there had been a fire in Harrap’s yard in the outhouse and against the washhouse.
