Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd complained that a number of street lamps had been broken and that this is by no means uncommon.  It was a result of vandalism by young boys.  The directors have a shrewd idea of who is to blame and have decided to take drastic action.  At the annual meeting of the company on Thursday E.F. Marston took the chair.  The company is gradually overcoming the problems initially caused by insufficient capital.  Customers have so increased that the capacity of the engines is now reached on Friday night peak load.  This is preventing people from buying electric washing machines, carpet sweepers etc.  In the present economic circumstances expanding the plant would be difficult.  Mr W. Lee was appointed a director in place of the late E.W. Crewes and E.F. Marston replaces M. Collins who resigned.  W.H. Sandland & J. Edgar Pearce were re-elected for a term of two years.
