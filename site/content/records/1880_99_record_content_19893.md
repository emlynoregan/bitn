Burra Races went very well last Monday, although the townspeople did not attend in very large numbers the country folk were numerous.  Mr Barnett of the Commercial Hotel did a grand trade in his booth.  Cheap Jack and Lottery men started, but were stopped.  The rider of H. Northridgeâ€™s Norman (Moyle) was thrown at the third hurdle and though severely bruised escaped without broken bones.

[Note the term Hurry Skurry is not used in Burra as defined in the Dictionary of Australian Words, as the winner and second in it were both winners in previous events.  It would appear that here the race for horses not winning in other events was called the Consolation Race and was last on this card.]
