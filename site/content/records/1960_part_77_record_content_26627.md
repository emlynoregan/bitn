St Mary’s Guild held a very successful Musicale in the Town Hall on Tuesday.  It was organised by the Guild President Mrs Arthur Wright and over 150 people enjoyed the program by Mrs Joyce Thomas and other Adelaide artists.  In the official party were the Rector & Mrs Sibly, Rt Rev. Monsignor P. Hughes, The Mayor and Mrs Baulderstone, Mrs Thomas (pianist), Mrs Moss (Contralto), Mrs Drew (Soprano) and Mrs Oaten (Elocutionist).  The delightful afternoon raised £95, which will be shared between Guild funds and the Mitchell River Aboriginal Mission.
