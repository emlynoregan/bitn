Goyder Writer’s Workshop

A successful writer’s workshop was held at the Black Sheep in Burra last week, to encourage people to write from our region.  It was hosted by the Burra Broadcaster and facilitated by Dr Kristine Peters (of KPPM Strategy).  Local Hallett writer Brenda Villis shared her knowledge about small town topics.  Brenda’s monthly updates were a major driving force prompting the workshop.
