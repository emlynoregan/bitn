There was a Welcome Home Social at the Burra Town Hall on Friday for ex-servicemen – some ‘said a few words, which would not have been very palatable to serious thinking members of the community.

Sgt Malcolm Cox – enlisted in 1939 and left Australia in 1940, serving in the Middle East and the Islands.

Cpl Wally Williams – 5 years of service – seen much action and proved himself a splendid soldier.

Cpl Ivan Wohling – son of Mr & Mrs E. Wohling with 5 years of service – had been at El Alamein & in the Islands.

Pte L. Ward – 4 years of service as a transport driver.

Staff Sgt Ted Riggs – son of the late Arthur Riggs & Mrs Riggs.  Had seen a lot of service.

L. Steele – one of the first to volunteer for the RAAF from Burra.  His father had been a returned soldier.

Cpl Bob Lee – 4 years of service in the RAAF.

Cpl Don Halliday – went to the Middle East in about 1941 and recently discharged after service in the Islands.  He was starting a business in Burra.

Sgt Burt Broad – well known in Burra before enlisting at the start of the war.  He had seen much service in the Islands and was a member of the famous Gold Fish Club.

L-Cpl Dick Barratt – had seen 4½ years of service and was the son of Mr & Mrs Doxo Barratt of the Royal Exchange Hotel.  His father was a returned soldier.

Captain Don Warren – a visitor from Queensland who had seen much service in the Middle East & New Guinea.

Pte Launer – of World’s End – enlisted early in the war and had seen service in the Islands.

Mr M.G. Dobson spoke on behalf of the RSL, followed by Rev. Barrett.

Sgt Malcolm Cox felt that ‘the fellows who returned were not getting their just dues.’

Captain Ivan Wohling said ‘it was about time the people got together and started to do something for the boys because there were thousands of them still to come back.  It was just as well for the future prosperity of the boys that there was an RSL to stand behind them.

Pte L. Ward said ‘Burra wanted rubbing out and drawing again.  It was alright for the boys when they were going away, but now they were back and the war had been won it appeared as if it cost two bob to say good day to them.  They asked for hospitality and got none.  If it were not for one or two people like the Mayor, fellows would hardly know they were home.’

Staff Sgt Riggs thanked the people of Burra for what they had done for him and all those organisations which had assisted with comforts etc.

Similar views were expressed by R.L. Steele, Bob Lee, Don Halliday, Burt Broad, Cpls Barrett & Warren and Pte Launer.
