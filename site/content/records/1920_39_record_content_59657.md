Burra Honours the Memory of Our Late Beloved Monarch King George V

On Tuesday, as in all parts of the Commonwealth, most businesses closed from 11 a.m. to 1.30 p.m.  At 11.30 a.m. a memorial service was held in the Burra Institute.  The attendance was representative, with prominent citizens, returned soldiers and a goodly attendance of ladies.  The Burra Band was on the back of the stage and played softly before the service the old Hymn Rock of Ages and Divinity.

The stage was draped in purple and black.  Mayor T.H. Woollacott presided and also on the stage were the Councillors and their wives and the Town Clerk, the [Protestant] town clergy, President and Secretary of the RSL and Lt H. Warnes of the 18/23 Regiment of Light Horse.  The Dead March in Saul was played while the audience stood with bowed heads.  Rev. E.G. Neil read the 95th and 27th Psalms and the band played The Recessional.  Rev. D.L. Redding gave an inspirational address.  Rev. G.C. Hutchinson then offered a prayer, followed by the audience standing with bowed heads for two minutes’ silence.  The service ended with the trumpeter sounding Last Post and Reveille.

[There are also extended reports of the services conducted elsewhere in the town.]

St Mary’s Church of England held a memorial service on Sunday evening attended by the local Light Horsemen, during which H.E. Fuss read one of the lessons.

Kooringa Methodist Church held a service on Sunday evening, which the Town Council attended.

The Salvation Army’s memorial service included an address by Captain Cresswell.

The RSL held a memorial service at the War Memorial on Tuesday Evening at 9.30 p.m. to coincide with the service at Windsor.  It was conducted by Revs D.L. Redding (Anglican) and G.C. Hutchinson (Methodist), both formerly of the AIF.  Many returned men attended.
