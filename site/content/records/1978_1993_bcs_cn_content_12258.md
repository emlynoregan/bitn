Market Square

On 21 February the Executive Committee of the Burra Burra DC went to Adelaide for a meeting chaired by Mr John Womersley of the State heritage Conservation Branch to discuss Market Square redevelopment.  At Mr Womersley’s request representatives of the Burra National Trust and the Burra Preservation Society attended as observers – represented by Mrs Maureen Wright and Mr Gerry O’Connor respectively.  There were representatives from the State heritage Branch, the Highways Department, the Road traffic Board and the Urban Conservation Committee of the National Trust of South Australia.

The Council produced a plan of the square, which it had approved.  In the course of discussion the Council agreed to retain the existing curved kerb line, to remove the proposed protuberance from the north side of Commercial Street adjacent to the ANZ Bank and in place of proposed protuberances on the south side of Commercial Street, to incorporate slightly raised areas for the existing roadway, which would be outlined with a painted line.  State heritage will now allow the plan to proceed on the basis of this agreement.

Council also agreed to look into the matter of lighting and to resolve this issue within the next two weeks.
