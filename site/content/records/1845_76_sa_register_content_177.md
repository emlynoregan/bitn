More Copper than Tin

When the Burra Creek or Monster Mine first came to be generally known, the great size of its riches not surprisingly led to such an intense struggle to get control of it that people were willing to make sacrifices that may have been of questionable prudence.  The excitement caused more accurate research and now we hear of another Special Survey in the same district that far exceeds it in extent and apparent richness.  Discoveries are being made almost daily in almost every direction, to an extent that would appear incredible were they not described by parties with cool heads and no personal interest in the matter.

We may say that one object of His Excellencyâ€™s present excursion is to see a copper lode more than 12 miles long and of a greater breadth than the one on Burra Creek.  It lies some 8 miles east of Balhannah.  We might name a dozen other discoveries of great richness (omitting here the vast mineral deposits in the great district of Port Lincoln.)
