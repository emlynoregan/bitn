The Occupational Health & Safety Commission is reviewing child safety codes in response to the high rate of on farm injuries and deaths to minors.  The new code would prevent children (under 16) from being in the vicinity of farm machinery.    Although a code of practice does not have the force of legislation and differs in its flexibility, it could form the basis for prosecutions.  The code would impose a hazard assessment process, removal of hazards and instruction for the child.  It says children should not be in areas likely to pose a risk, such as silos, dams, the vicinity of animals and power driven or other machinery.  The UFS says that while it is concerned about the injury rate for rural children, they do not support the code, which places penalties on farmers and their families and is essentially unworkable.  What is required is better education and increased awareness of the dangers.
