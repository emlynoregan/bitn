A Record Merino Ram Price of 9,000 guineas was achieved at the Perth Ram Sales.  The Record quotes a London paper as saying: ‘In Australia it is possible to pay more for one sheep than for a Rolls Royce.’

[It is typical of the reporting style of the paper at this stage that the article doesn’t say who sold the ram, though the headline presumably reveals it: ‘Such is Fame … Collinsville – Rolls Royce’.]
