A public divine service in connection with the United Presbyterian Church was held in the Primitive Methodist Chapel at Redruth on Sunday.  The Rev. James Lyall of Adelaide gave two excellent sermons in the morning and evening, while in the afternoon Rev. M. Davidson, who intends settling in the district, preached to a crowded congregation.  It is understood that the Presbyterians have engaged the Primitive Methodist Chapel for six months for the purpose of holding weekly services therein.

The new Kooringa Bible Christian Chapel will be opened next Sunday.

A public meeting was held at the Court House Hotel yesterday evening to afford Mr Dale MP an opportunity to explain his opinions on the woodcartersâ€™ tax memorial and on the new tariff.  The meeting was numerously attended and expressed general approval for the course adopted by the gentleman on both subjects.

There is news today of the discovery of another rich lode at the Burra Burra Mine.  It is hoped this news may lift the spirits of tradesmen, who have lately had good reason to lament the dullness of trade.
