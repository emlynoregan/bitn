Raymond & Susan Parker write to express their opposition to the proposal by the National Trust branch in Burra to sell Kotz Cottage:

The heritage Branch and NTSA spent nearly $10,000 stabilising the cottage in 2008.  We believe the cottage should be retained and renovated as funds become available for several reasons.  There is an enormous amount of information, including photographs, about the various residents of the cottage, which was occupied by the Voumard family for many of its early years.  There are members of this family still living in the Mid North.  Its place in the development of Burra once mining was no longer the primary industry is irreplaceable as it demonstrates the emergence of agriculture within the Mid North region.
