Burra Walk of Fame

The Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, Neil Andrews will open a new ‘Walk of Fame’ and unveil a restored portrait of the first Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Frederick Holder, who was at various times editor of the Burra Record, town clerk and Mayor of Burra.  The ‘Walk of Fame’ plaques are to be set in the footpath outside the Town Hall and feature people who have made a major contribution to Australia and have a strong connection to Burra and District.  They include Sir Henry Ayers (Mine secretary and Premier of SA), George Strickland Kingston (first Member of Parliament for the District), Mary Warnes (founder of the CWA in SA), Essington Lewis (engineer, miner and founder of BHP) and John Collins (founder of Collinsville stud).  It is envisaged that the walk will be extended in the future.  The new portrait gallery in the Town Hall will also be opened to house paintings and photographs of community leaders since 1876.  The organising committee expects a number of family members of those in the ‘Walk of Fame’ to be present.  The day will feature maypole dancing and in the evening a music hall variety program.  On 11 November there will be a breakfast in the park along the creek followed by the Armistice Day ceremony.
