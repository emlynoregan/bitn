Australia Day Awards are reported.

Burra Ward Citizen of the Year is Ian Denton of Farrell Flat.

Ian Joseph Denton was born 20 May 1937 and was educated at Farrell Flat School and an Adelaide college.  He started working for his father at the family garage 1 July 1954.  He soon became involved in the town’s sporting clubs.  He is a devoted husband and father of three.  His wife Jenny is also a tireless worker for the community, working for the aged and sick in local hospitals and aged homes.  Ian’s likely retirement in the near future will be a severe loss for the town.
