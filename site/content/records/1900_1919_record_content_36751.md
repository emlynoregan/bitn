Volume XV which had previously run from 7 December 1892 to 5 July 1905 and which was resumed with Volume XV Number 921 on 4 January 1911 began 1913 as well, but from 23 April the volume number changed for no apparent reason to XX.

The sequence of numbers lurched from 1060 on 17 September to 1861 on 24 September.

The year began with Volume XV Number 1024 on 8 January 1913.  Not number 1023 was not used.

And continued to Volume XV Number 1038 on 16 April 1913.

Then Volume XX Number 1039 23 April 1913.

To Volume XX 1060 17 September 1913.

And then leapt to Volume XX 1861 24 September 1913,

Which then continued to Volume XX Number 1874 24 December 1913.
