Was not concerned with Legislative Council reform.

Favoured smaller Government and less taxation.

Land reform was needed - land was worth less now than in the past - perhaps only 10/- and acre.

Wheat should travel more cheaply on the railways.

E. Ward

Advocated sweeping way Goyder’s Line.

For a reform of Legislative Council powers and a division of the colony into electoral districts for its election.

For the inter-colonial railway.

For a plebiscite on the payment of MPs.

[F.W. Holder said Mr Ward’s speech made his blood boil]
