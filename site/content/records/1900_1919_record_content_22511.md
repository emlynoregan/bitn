‘Disgusted Shareholder’ writes about the soon-to-be-issued half-yearly report of the Burra Burra Copper Co.  The writer says it is time that more information was given of the directors’ intentions.  The Government should buy the mine and work it.  Then the state ‘could make a good thing out of it’.
