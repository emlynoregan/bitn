E.C. & H.C. Lockyer complain that the Unicorn Brewery is not dead as stated last week and that:

‘As a matter of fact negotiations are pending.’

‘You need not say the Walkerville wants to come in with us, but merely state we have been approached.’

Later J.E.H. Winnall sent a solicitor’s letter demanding a retraction and contradiction of the story – a totally unnecessary letter as we had already agreed to do so with the Lockyers.
