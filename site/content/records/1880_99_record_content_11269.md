Mr Coglin, having been asked to stand addressed the group.  South Ward had the problem of many creek crossings and a small income to cover the outlay.  The road to the cemetery was an urgent need.  He felt this should not be a South Ward responsibility alone.   He was in favour of increasing the size of South Ward to increase income.  Cr Ward, who is retiring was not present.
