Burra Town Council, 10 January

Mr Tiver advised to remove old buildings from a block following a request by Mrs E.R. Kotz.

Burra Hospital contribution for 1960 has been set at £410.

Moved Crs Cummins & Lehmann that the name E.R. Davey be removed from the honour roll of Town Clerks.  Carried.

[The honour board of Mayors and Town Clerks was still in the Town Hall in 2014 and Mr Davey’s name was still there.  The name of J. Fogg who was appointed Town Clerk in January 1879 and was compelled to resign in April 1879 is however, missing.  From the reports in the paper he seems to have been extremely neglectful of his work and also to have misappropriated a cheque for £12.  A later report says all but £2 had been recovered.  He was not pursued in the courts because, the paper says, he was not worth 12/-.  He promised to repay the losses when able.

See also comment at 90, 14, 19 April 1960, page 1.]

18 January

A recommendation was accepted that £500 be spent on seating for the back portion of the Town Hall.
