In the year Mr Holland replaced Mr Foster as caretaker.  The strawberry fete was a great success.  In the year the bowling green and croquet lawn were laid out and planted: a well was sunk, a mill and tanks erected, all for a cost of £164-19-3.  The overdraft has risen from £28-18-11 to £134-14-3, against which there are improvements worth £164-19-3.  The lease of the polo ground is to be transferred to Leighton hall and A.T. McWaters replaces the late Mr Field as a trustee.  The position of caretaker was dispensed with.  Elected were President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-President, D.E. Williams; Treasurer, A.D. McDonald; Secretary, Rex Warnes; Assistant Secretary, M.S. Edwards.
