CWA International Day was held last Friday.  The country chosen this year was China.  For the occasion the meeting was held in the capacious supper room of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge.  The address was given by Miss Flint, who had been evacuated from Hong Kong two years ago after a residence of seven years.  Thanks were expressed to Mrs A. Tennant for re-arranging and improvements at the Rest Room, which will re-open in December.
