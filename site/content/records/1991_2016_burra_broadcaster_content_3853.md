Burra Gardening Group met last Friday at ‘Kookaburra’ where Mrs Barbara Rayner of ‘The Bluff’ Hallett spoke on trees.  The group has been meeting for some four months after Helen Cleland of ‘Kookaburra’ floated the idea.  It is an informal gathering of those who enjoy swapping knowledge, cuttings, bulbs, etc. and generally learning about growing plants in this particular climatic area.
