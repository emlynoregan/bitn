Tubercular Soldier A.S. Costume Party from Adelaide visited last Thursday to augment the appeal for funds for the Angorichina Hostel being made by Mrs W.J. Davey Jnr.  Attendance was poor and even though it had only been advertised in the previous dayâ€™s paper it should have been better.  The concert was excellent with every item a masterpiece.
