Burra Town Council, 2 November.

The Council received a petition from the Municipal Association concerned about the removal of Government subsidies to Councils and opposing their abolition.

Cr Ridgway moved it be signed and Cr West 2nd.

He felt that if subsidies went then the Council needed to retain locally raised fees (Licences etc.)  Some Councillors dissented on the grounds that subsidies favoured the city over country areas.

Cr Sampson thought they should not have to pay for police and yet not get to keep hotel licence fees, since without hotels there would be no need for police.

The petition was signed on the casting vote of the Mayor.

The matter of the half-yearly Waterworks account was raised.  It was for £138-0-5.

It had been stipulated to the late Council that no interest was payable till the works were complete.  Cr Ridgway maintained they were not complete and would not be for 6-9 months - though any small contractor would have done the work in three.

Cr Symons said that was all nonsense - under that argument the works would never be completed while additions were being made.  He moved the account be referred to the Waterworks Committee and this was carried.

The new assessment was adopted.

The Court of Appeal will sit on Friday 27 November.

Mr Morris, of McLaren, White & co. has offered verbally to sell to the council the Aberdeen Reserve.  A written communication is awaited.

Cr Sampson asked when the making of the ford between East and North Wards was ordered.  [This seems to refer, given later discussion, to the ford in St Just St]

The Mayor could not say: he recalled the order, but would have to have the minute looked for.
