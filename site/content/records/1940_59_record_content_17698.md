Miss Gertrude Pearce was presented with a wallet containing c. £20 and with a Methodist Hymnal last Wednesday in a function arranged by Kooringa Methodist Church members.  Rev. S.J. Martin presided.  Mr G.E. Dane was unable to be present, but sent a letter expressing his appreciation of her assistance over many years.  Miss Pearce in replying said her family had been associated with Burra Methodism since 1847 and also her late grandparents Mr & Mrs Frank Simons.  Her late father had been church organist for 35 years and her sisters had followed him.  Friends will be glad to know that Miss Pearce’s health has improved since her retirement from business.  She is now living at Ketchowla Station.
