Maureen & Barry Wright of Burra last week began a long journey to update their popular River Murray Charts.  They began at Yarrawonga last Monday and will have the company of Lisa Smedley and Ron & Geraldine Smedley as road crew.  The charts have been available since 1975 following an adventurous trip by the couple in a boat called Peregrine from Murray Bridge to Yarrawonga in 1973-74.  More than 60,000 copies have since been sold, with regular updates as the charts have been reprinted.  Now there has been a good flow down the river for the first time in many years, they have deemed it timely to undertake a major update.  They will travel in a 4.2 m runabout and expect to take up to eight weeks for the 1,420 km round trip.  The new eighth edition is to be released in time for Christmas.  [Photo]
