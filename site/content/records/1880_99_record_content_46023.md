Mt Bryan East.  Conditions are bad and sheep farmers are losing lambs through lack of feed.  Hares are plentiful with one man shooting 16 on Friday.  Last week a coursing meet was held on Wilkins’ Netfield Farm.  Nine hares were let in a 400 acres wire netted paddock.  Mr Russell’s Tip was judged the best dog.
