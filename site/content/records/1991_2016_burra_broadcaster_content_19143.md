Ovine Johne’s Disease was found on the Woollana Stud near Mt Bryan last week.  Rob Ashby, Chairman of the SA Sheep Advisory Group says sheep men should still have a reasonable degree of confidence about continuing to buy stud merino rams from the Mid North.  The testing that has been done means there is a better chance of buying disease free animals from the Mid North than from any other area in Australia.  Most studs have been voluntarily tested and all have been accredited as having achieved MN1 status - the best assurance sheep breeders can get.  Buying from an untested flock carries a much greater risk, he said.  The ‘Woollana’ case was discovered during a routine post mortem, which is part of the accreditation process.  Woollana has been quarantined with sheep only allowed to be sold for slaughter.  The disease does not spread easily or rapidly.  Flocks across the state will now be tested.  If incidence turns out to be low an eradication program is then the likely response.  If it turned out to be widespread then a control program may be the best option.
