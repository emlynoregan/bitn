Treloar says he little thought that when Walker brought down a carload of books from the Burra Mine and when he (Treloar) got another load from the Mine Office, that they were saving the history of the mine for the state.  And it will now live in book form at the Archives.  The Directors of SAMA have also given the books they used.

James Pearse (of Jeffery Pearse’s family) and I (Treloar) went to the Archives on Monday and spent several hours wetting [sic: whetting] our curiosity.  The Mine started in a small way in 1845.  The first balance sheet in 1846 showed a primitive affair and yet they began as self-supporting and didn’t look back for many a long year.  Before smelting began the ore went as fast as bullock team could cart it to Pt Adelaide and thence to Wales for treatment.  In 1847 they started paying quarterly dividends of 200% or 800% p.a.  This was not distributing sufficient of the profits and directors advised a payment of 1,000%.
