Ursula Street

The New Work Opportunity Team [Photo] is presently working on upgrading Ursula Street (between the Burra Hotel and the Snack Bar).  The team had previously laid a slate footpath in front of Paxton Square cottages in Bridge Terrace and has laid a watering system and seeded the old swimming pool site and also given the creek bank below the motel a facelift.  A few months ago they worked on box-thorn eradication at Redbanks Reserve.
