Booborowie School – An article by ‘Anxious Parent’.

The South Booborowie School, which has operated in the Methodist Church, has been closed.  Despite a grant on the estimates nothing was actually done and the church eventually refused to allow the situation to continue as their premises were deteriorating to an extend making them almost unfit for future use.  All the Department could suggest was closing the school.
