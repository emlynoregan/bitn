The President reported on a successful year.  £150 had been given to the men’s club.  This was £50 less than in the previous year due to the Association’s own needs.  They had purchased 12 stack-em chairs, a coat and hat rack, new lino and cutlery.  They had catered for the Easter Tournament and had run monthly trading tables.
