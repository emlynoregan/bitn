ETSA intends to build a modern office and depot in Burra, with a permanent maintenance staff and a small construction gang stationed here.  ETSA has been operating in the district from Clare, but growth of services in this area has led to the decision to establish a depot for line maintenance and minor construction work.  It will serve the area from Ulooloo almost to Morgan in the southeast and will include Hallett, Booborowie, Hanson, Burra and Robertstown.  It will maintain two major transmission lines providing power to the Upper Murray.
