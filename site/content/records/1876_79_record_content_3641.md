Water Supply. A meeting was held at the Aberdeen Hotel on 16 Feb. with J.D. Cave in the chair to consider the water supply question. Henry Dawson ran back over the events leading up to the present situation: Rosman's motion for a trough at the Railway Station gate, The committee to see to the erection of the trough and the collection of subscriptions, Ridgway's motion to extend the supply down Morehead St, Young St and Best's Place.

Now when the Govt. has taken it upon itself to vote £820 to supply Aberdeen with water, the Mayor has taken offence and believes Kooringa should also benefit. Cr Roberts condemned the Commissioner for his action. The Mayor then said they should get an independent member to introduce their deputation to the Commissioner if Mr Rounsevell was not able. [The other local member, Mr Rees, would appear to have been blamed for the Govt.'s decision in the first place and so was persona non grata. I

The Mayor was of the opinion that a trough at the Railway Station gate would satisfy all. The meeting however, felt that this would deprive Aberdeen of their rights with the pipe already laid to the near the National Bank with a standpipe and trough erected. The meeting then resolved unanimously "This meeting disapproves of the action of the Burra Corporation in interfering with the water supply of this Ward, thereby damaging the best interests of the ratepayers and the public generally.
