Miners' Arms Hotel. We have seen the plans for the new Miners' Arms Hotel. The old building stands back 28' from the frontage to which the new hotel will be brought. The old cellars and as much of the assembly room as were uninjured by the recent fire will be worked into the new one which will consist of a basement, first floor and second floor. The height of the top of the front will be 47'. A balcony will run around the front and part of each end, accessed by French windows. A lift is included. Upstairs will hold 21 bedrooms and two bathrooms. The bar entrance will be in the centre of the frontage and private and billiard room entrances over in each wing. The billiard room is to house two tables. [Obviously this was never constructed and the second floor wasn't added to what was built until about 30 years later.]
