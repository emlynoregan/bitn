Football.  Aberdeen last Saturday was the scene for a poor match with bad football played in bad spirit and including ‘a most disgraceful scene’.  An Aberdeen player struck a Kooringa player and in the following melee play was halted till one of the Kooringa players left the field (under protest).  In the last quarter another Kooringa player walked off in disgust at so many of his own players arguing with the umpire.  Aberdeen 29 defeated Kooringa 15.
