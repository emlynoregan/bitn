Lions Senior Citizens Bus Service

Commencing 17 December 1981 a weekly bus service will assist Burraâ€™s Senior Citizens with their shopping on Thursdays.  The service will be for two hours, i.e. the first pick-up will be at 9.15 a.m. and the last drop-off must be done by 11.15 a.m.  The cost is 40c per trip, payable to the driver.  The bus will set down at Matthews Emporium and will remain there until departure.  This is a three month trial service.

[The names and addresses of 12 Senior Citizens and their addresses are then listed as users of the service.  All were women.]
