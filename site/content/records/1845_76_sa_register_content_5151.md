These disbursements coupled with the dividends paid have put into circulation £244,456 in one year.

The richness of the ores have also induced the establishment of several smelting establishments within  the province – probably benefiting the colony to the extent of about £60,000 annually for the last two years.  These will render merchantable a vast amount of copper from ores not sufficiently metalliferous to bear the cost of exportation in their crude state.

The Burra Burra Association is an extensive seller of copper received from the Kooringa and other smelting plants as the proceeds from moderate and comparatively low percentage ores, which it would not pay to send to UK or European markets.

The Patent Copper Co. has received 10,981 tons of ores in the past year for 432 tons of metallic copper, valued at c. £31,000.

Captain Roach’s report indicates the Karkulto Mine will prove exceedingly fortunate.

He recounts the discovery of a large rich lode of malachite while excavating the foundations of the house for the new winding machine and of this already 60 tons of 40% have been obtained.

The new engine shaft is 13 ft by 8 ft and the sinking is being done by six men and is now at 14 fathoms in favourable ground.  The shaft is well timbered.

Captain Roach hopes to have the crusher working in two months, which will save much work presently done by hand.

At present he reports:

45 whim & whip shafts

7 trial shafts

35 winzes & ladder roads

3,876 fathoms of levels (or 4⅓ miles) and excavation of 30,185 cubic yards.

His report is eloquent in describing the richness of the mine.
