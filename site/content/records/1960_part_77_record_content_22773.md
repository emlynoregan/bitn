Burra High School Speech Night

Headmaster R. Mueller’s Report for 1964.

The School re-opened with an enrolment of 185, up 34 on 1963.  This is due to the retention of students in the upper school, possibly influenced by the raising of the school leaving age to 15.  It is likely the future enrolment will fluctuate around the 200 mark.  Staff changes: Miss N. Lawes resigned to change her name to McElroy.  Mr B. McElroy transferred to Gilles Plains.  Miss A. Aistrope moved to Adelaide.  Miss E. McCabe went overseas and Miss B. Hogan and Mr W. Standing were appointed to Teachers’ College.  Mr K. Hicks was transferred to Nuriootpa during the year.  Mr R. Wright came from Gladstone, Mr I. Norton from Salisbury, Mr E. Johns & Miss L. Briggs were appointed from Teachers’ College. Local, Miss P. Zanker, was appointed a Junior Teacher.  Mr Heywood from Streaky Bay replaced Mr Hicks.  This year we have been informed that Senior Master Mr O’ Connor, is moving to Peterborough.  Miss Callier is moving to Darwin.  Mr Johns is also being transferred.  Miss Zanker moves to Teachers’ College.  I am being transferred to Naracoorte.  Replacements for 1965 will be Mr Farrow as Headmaster from AHS, Mr Brand from Peterborough as Senior Master and Mr Morris as Junior Assistant.

The High School Council has given the school sound support under Mr Jennison’s leadership.
