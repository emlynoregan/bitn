Burra Show Society.  General Committee Meeting 11 January

W.H. McWaters moved to rescind the motion fixing the date of the show as 4th Wednesday in October in favour of the 1st week in October.  Originally the later date suited horses in the ring, but conditions had changed and horses were now ready anytime and the earlier date better suited sheep.

Mr Marston said the show had moved a number of times from mid-September to the end of October.  In 1919 it was the 4th Wednesday in October, then it was changed to the 1st Wednesday, then this was said to be too late for sheep and too early for producers.  In 1921 it went back to the 4th Wednesday in October since when the show had boomed.

A.B. Riggs supported the move.  (He also favoured the Friday & Saturday.)

Mr Warnes said sheep had been well represented of late, but he was for the earlier date.

Mr Radford said the 1st Wednesday clashed with the Blyth Show.

The motion was carried.

Roy Humphrys reported making good progress in gathering support for a sheep shed.  The President said the one in Adelaide was 70ft x 80ft x 16ft high and had cost (fully fitted) Â£950.
