The Past.  [Based on an article compiled in 1961 by Rev. Harry Alvey.]

The first mention of Redruth appeared in the minutes of the Kooringa Circuit in 1850.

Later in that year Redruth received from the Government 20 acres of glebe land and half an acre in the township.  The foundation stone of the first chapel was laid in February 1851.  Soon afterwards the gold rush began and the chapel was deserted except for a few women and children and in 1854 it was dismantled, to be reconstructed when the men returned in 1857.

In August 1873 the Trustees resolved to build a chapel on the present site.  It ultimately cosy £1,340 and was later extended to become the building it is today.  Kooringa Circuit was divided in 1889 with Redruth becoming a separate circuit with Rev. T.M. Rowe as its minister, living at Aberdeen.  When Methodist Union took place in 1900 the Primitive Methodist Chapels at Redruth, Ironmine and Copperhouse became part of the Redruth Circuit.  As the town’s population declined it could not support two Methodist ministers and the SA Conference approved the amalgamation of the Kooringa and Redruth Circuits in 1956.  For the past 14 years the two churches have been continuously used and maintained for weekly worship.  It is now acknowledged that the church in Burra must now become a united family.  The Trustees do not want to see the buildings stand neglected and unused.  The best solution would be for Christians of another Communion to take over and to this end a delegation will confer with the local Lutheran Pastor.
