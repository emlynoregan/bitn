Burra Racing Club has not held a meeting for 5 years and though the last meeting was a success the interest the next year was so slight that no meeting of members was called.  Now with interest rising in northern towns a meeting of supporters is called for next Wednesday.  A meeting could be arranged for April.  The old club has a satisfactory bank account so the movement would not start from scratch.
