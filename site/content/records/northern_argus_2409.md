Donna & Bryan Salter are entered for the Mid North Tourism Awards in the Tourism Services Category.

They are lessees of the Bon Accord Mine Museum.  Every Hour they conduct a tour of the Bon Accord and seek to build up a picture of how miners worked and of the conditions at the mine.  The fine displays set up by curator Colin Fidock add to the overall impression.  Bryan has previous experience as a TAFE lecturer and works the forge at the ‘Bon’.  Both are active members of the National Trust and prior to working at the Bon Accord Museum, Donna was a tour guide for the Trust in Burra for two years.  She took an active part in the creation of Malowen Lowarth Cottage in Paxton Square.  Bryan was involved with building the framework for the mine model.  Both are keenly interested in preserving Burra’s heritage.  [Photo.]
