Burra Rifle Club.  The 19th stage of the Fearon Trophy was fired on 5 May.  H.H. Byles & A.C. Aughey scored possibles at 200 yards in a day of unremarkable shooting generally.  H.H. Byles cannot now be overtaken for the marksmanâ€™s trophy.  W. Woodman has a four point lead for the Fearon Trophy, but several people could yet cause an upset there.
