Burra Town Council

The Government intends to alter the Act so that the fines from car owners go to the State Main Roads Fund.  There is £3 in the Main Roads account and no more funds due till October.  Main Road grants are always inadequate.  It was resolved that the Finance Committee meet to consider a strategy to address the problem.

Cr Woollacott moved to ban football on Victoria Park on Sundays.

Cr Kellaway said it would have little effect as they would go somewhere else like Aberdeen.  The motion was carried.

The Mayor wanted a resolution to the guns problem.  He was still in favour of moving them [to a site opposite the Institute] and nothing and no one except the RSA would move him in that.  He complained that he had received nothing in writing from the RSA by way of a scheme.

Cr Woollacott said that they had met the RSA and heard their views.  He didn’t recall anything being said about a written response and wondered what more information was wanted.

Cr Riggs thought the Council should present a scheme to the RSA rather than the reverse.

Cr Kellock moved the Council write to the RSA saying it was waiting for its scheme to be submitted as arranged.

The Mayor didn’t want a scheme; he wanted to know what financial assistance the Council could expect from the RSA.

Cr Harris objected to any scheme that closed the gap between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

Cr Allen suggested a scheme be submitted to the RSA.

Cr Kellock’s motion was carried.
