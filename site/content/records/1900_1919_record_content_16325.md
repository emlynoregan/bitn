Obituary.  Mary Ann Heneker, wife of Mr T. [Thomas] Heneker of Whyte Yarcowie died on 4 January after a ten-year illness.  She leaves a family of four sons and three daughters.

[Age on registration of apparent marriage is not quite consistent with that of 57 given for death, but she was probably born Mary Ann Murray.]
