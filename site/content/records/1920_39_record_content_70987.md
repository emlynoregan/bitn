Methodism celebrated the bi-centenary of the birth of the founder of Methodism John Wesley, last Sunday.  Special services were held at Redruth & Kooringa Methodist Churches.

[This is incorrect John Wesley lived 1703-91.  1738 marked his evangelical conversion and so this celebration was the 200th anniversary of the foundation of Methodism.]
