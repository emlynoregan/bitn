Burra Agricultural Society (Show Society)

President’s Report

During the year the society lost its patron, Hon. John Lewis, who died.  He had been associated with the show since its inception 50 years ago.

The dog trials were a success and the annual show on 24 October was the best shoe ever held.  The Governor and his party attended and the gate takings were bigger than ever.  The rain late in the day was a shame and the committee must consider if a two day show would reduce this risk of bad weather.  The financial position is sound.

The New Showground.  For years I have advocated a home of our own.  The continual work of preparing and dismantling takes about a month and the expense is a dead loss.  Messrs Bartholomæus & Warnes offered the society 20 acres free of cost and the committee recommended the acceptance of the same and a special meeting of the society has agreed.  Mr John Melrose volunteered to move out things from the old site and this is being done.  Much work is being done at the new ground.  The ring will not be as good as the old one, but the rest of the ground will be much better.  The new site is near town and the railway line where we hope to have a siding to get machinery onto the ground.  I promised £300 or a portion of that £ for £ for subscriptions by members of the public and this is coming in.

Isaac Warnes

President.
