Burra Lion’s Club donated $1,350 to the Burra & District Ambulance Association on Wednesday.  This along with funds from the Burra Ambulance Association will attract an $8,000 subsidy from the St John Ambulance Association and enable Burra to be serviced by a $12,000 radio base station to provide uninterrupted communication from Burra to Peterborough.  A 100 ft mast will be erected on property above Heathmont and a co-axial cable will be laid to Burra Hospital, the 24 hour transmitting point.
