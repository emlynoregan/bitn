The secretary then read an interesting letter by H. Carl (Charlie) Herberle he had found on the mine property in which he says he worked on the mine from arriving in SA in 1855 to 1877.  In the letter he explains how the mine was worked.  The writer concluded that more ore existed below than had been raised, that in Morphett’s Shaft at 600ft there was good purple and yellow sulphide and similarly at 60ft in Peacock’s Shaft and at 50 fathoms in Groves. [Graves?]
