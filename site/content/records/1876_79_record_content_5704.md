The Health Rate Meeting

On Friday evening about 50 people assembled at the Institute to consider the question of a health rate for 1879. The Mayor, Dr Nesbitt, took the chair and he described what had taken place in Council. The meeting could memorialize the Council to rescind its motion, but the final decision would rest with the council.

Cr Ridgway moved: -`That providing the Corporation relinquish their claim to a health rate this meeting authorise it to levy a general rate of 1/3 in the £ instead of 1/-. '

He argued that a rate that produced £150 was nothing to what was required to place the town in a thoroughly sanitary condition. The main problem was impure liquids running in gutters and to the creek and this evil had been untouched by the efforts of 1878. A general rate of 1/3 would be more useful than a health rate of 3d. The extra general rate would attract another £150 Govt. subsidy.

(Actually the Govt. only subsidised up to a 1/- rate, but the extra would free more of the rates to be supplemented.)

There was some debate about the legality of the meeting.

Cr Geake then spoke in favour of the health rate. He believed that the rate last year had been of great service. The health rate would not do all that was needed, but would be very useful. A trip to the North Ward depot or to slaughterhouse gully would show a large quantity of rubbish had been removed. For workingmen the extra rate probably meant about 2/6 a year and if the general rate went to 1/3 they would pay that much and still have to pay 1/6 or 2/- a time to have their rubbish taken away. He also spoke against referring Council decisions to public meetings as it could be most destructive of council. He moved as an amendment that they have the health rate.

After some discussion Mr Geake withdrew his motion.

Mr Lipsett thought the meeting illegal and moved as an amendment: -`That this meeting cannot interfere with vote for a health rate inasmuch as it was carried by a majority of the Council.' After considerable discussion this was carried.
