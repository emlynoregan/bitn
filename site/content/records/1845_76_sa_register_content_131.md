The Monster Mine is not taken up after all and still remains available to the first applicant who has the money at command.  However, the impression of its great value is unabated.

The men of Hindley St confessed to being fairly beaten last Saturday and they have since come into collision with the Bank of SA.  The South Australian Company is also stymied and is apparently waiting on the arrival of the Dorset.  Without a coalition of forces the Special Survey must remain in abeyance, unless the associated merchants and traders find means to grasp the whole.

All parties are spurred on by the intimation that the Governor is in daily expectation of despatches from the Home Government ordering him to suspend the sale on mineral lands of the Province.

We think that gigantic operations of this kind ought to be financed from either specially imported capital or surplus capital of the colony.
