Burra Rifle Club AGM last Thursday.  Captain Lord in the chair.

There has been some slight increase in membership, but more are needed considering the desirability of being an experienced shot in time of war.  Captain Lord is disappointed they have only one active member from the north end of town.  Trophy winners for the last year:

Club’s Trophy (£2-2-0)	R.D. Pascoe

300 yds Trophy		E.A. Riggs

500 yds Trophy		G. Herbert

Best 10 shots at 600 yds	J.E. Pearce

Highest score for the year	E.A. Riggs & A.P. Harris tied and the £1-1-0 was donated to the Belgian Fund in lieu of a shoot-off.

Elected: Captain, G. Lord; Secretary, J.E. Pearce; Treasurer, R.D. Pascoe.

‘Rifle Notes’ by ‘Target’ include an observation that a ‘Willing to Serve Society’ is superfluous when there is a Rifle Club.  Some of the talkers should become workers.
