The Deputation to the Government concerning aid for unwatering the mine met the Hon. J. Vardon, Minister of Mines, on Thursday.  The Mayor presented the case as outlined at the recent public meeting.  Dr Sangster & E.W. Crewes also spoke.  The Minister said before the Government did anything final in the matter they would need some representation from the directors as to the money they had spent, what they had on hand and what they were prepared to do in the future if the Government came to assistance.  The Government would need some guarantee there would be no outlay [by them] of capital.

There was a suitable plant at Sliding Rock Mine which they might be willing to lend for some small consideration.  Estimates of unwatering the mine varied from £6,000 to £10,000.

The Mine.  Since the meeting of 17 February the town is hopeful of some development of the mine.  So far the ‘imaginings’ of various people have been fruitful and now the imagining the Government would lend a pump has been fruitful.  We are now ‘imagining future developments in the mine’ [The article continues on page 3.]

There are those who will say what’s the use – the game is not worth the candle.  It is expected the pumping plant will be sent as soon as possible.  The Government has agreed to deliver it to Burra Railway Station free of charge.
