The writers say they got a ride to Booborowie Station with some shearers in a cart.

They went around Shafton where they got great views of magnificent crops.  They passed the home of Mr Stockman – the former home of the late Mr Cockrum.  The plains gave a tremendous yield of hay or wheat.  To the right lay Mr Chapman’s and towards Braefoot Mr Forrest’s and then Mr Webster’s.  These were three new houses and out houses.  As they passed Gum Creek there was land under lucerne and the wheat crops were in places as high as the fences.  The most notable farm in this area belonged to the Bailey Bros. and was a model from an agricultural point of view.  At Braefoot the feed was extremely short and the land seemed to have been overstocked generally.  There was more feed around the homestead, but by the end of shearing this would have gone.  There were some fine crops towards Booborowie; often higher than the fence and a number of neatly kept farm houses were passed.  They arrived at Booborowie Station in time for afternoon tea.  This substantial meal was served on spotless tinware and ended with ‘brownie’ – a novelty for them.  It was an agreeable surprise being a very nice cake, although they were told it comprised only fat, currants and flour.  They inspected the shearing shed of 20 machines, 10 on each side.  It is one of the largest and loftiest in SA and was all in keeping with the cleanliness of the dining room.  The night accommodation for the shearers was satisfactory.  The shearers they found to be well mannered, courteous and of refined language.  They returned by the main road past Ayers Forest which looked like natural growth.  The trees were doing well and they felt sure that very few people in the town were aware that they had such a magnificent forest within a few miles of their doors.
