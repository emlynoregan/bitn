On Saturday afternoon the Mitcham Band and the Ladies’ band provided music at the War Tank Demonstration at Unley Oval.  A large crowd had come to see the tank from the French battlefields.  Lady Galway christened it by the name of ‘Grit’ it with a bottle of champagne.  A silk Union Jack was then auctioned and the Burra Cheer-up Society bought it with a £60 bid.  Mr Crewes was presented with the flag by Lady Galway and he had a ride in the tank, which went over trenches and obstacles in a demonstration.  It finally demolished a stone building labelled ‘German Headquarters’.  The Band returned on a special train at 7 p.m.
