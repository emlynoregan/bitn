Helen Szuty, Burra Ward Candidate for the Goyder Council, would like to see council meetings held in the evenings and rotated across townships within the Council area.  She believes major decisions like the recent recycling collection arrangements need to be more widely discussed with local communities.  Local government should be more accessible and more communicative, she said.
