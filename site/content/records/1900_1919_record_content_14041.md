A Bolt.  W.T. Truscott’s horse bolted as it was being taken out of the butcher’s cart on Wednesday.  It careered down the lane at the back of the shop and into Chapel St then round Kangaroo St and Stock St to Thames St.  There, opposite Frederick’s eating-house, the traces still attached to it twisted round a tree and the animal was brought up against it with great force.  A near side rib punctured its hide, stripped about three feet of bark, and was embedded in the trunk.  Despite this and grave internal injuries it made off again between the road roller and a fence, but was stopped and led back to the stable where it had to be put down.
