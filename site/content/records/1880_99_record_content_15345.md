The Waterworks

At the start of the year the Commissioner of Public Works presented a draft agreement for the Waterworks which would on completion be leased to the Corporation at an annual rental of 3%, 4%, and 5% for the 1st, 2nd,and 3rd years respectively and at 5% thereafter.  It was signed on 28 April and the works got under way after some considerable delay.  Many have now applied for connection and several extensions have been, or are being made.  Proposed charges for meters and service pipes were so high that we fought to have them changed and they will now be charged to a second capital account at 5% from the first year.  Consumers will simply be charged at 6/- per 1,000 gallons.  We hope at the end of the year to reduce this charge.  This will depend on consumption, but the works are rapidly growing in favour.  The total outlay to date is approximately £4,000 and on this interest in the first year will be c. £120 plus interest of £16 on the second capital account for a total of £136.  Labour will cost £140, fuel and oil £74 so that total first year cost is estimated at £350-0-0.

Guarantees from users amounted to	£296-15- 0

Plus 18 other users at		27- 0- 0

2 standpipes & 2 troughs expected to bring in	40- 0- 0

Total income		£363-15- 0

Additional guarantees from people not yet requiring water have been made for £50-4-0 and further extensions are contemplated.  I am confident that further extensions will add little to the expense, but will increase revenue.  Mr Jobson, the Superintendent of the Works has done much to keep down the cost on the capital account.
