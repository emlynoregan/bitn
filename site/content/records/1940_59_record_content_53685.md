Obituary.  Ben Hill, known in the town for many years as ‘Old Ben,’ died at Burra hospital on Saturday.  Never blessed with much of this world’s goods and never attaining high office, he was nevertheless well known and held an affectionate spot in most people’s hearts.  Twenty-seven cars followed the hearse when he was given a Military Funeral on Sunday, with a Guard of Honour and a Union Jack draped over the coffin.  He was 69.  Ben was renowned for greeting anyone in the street at 5 or 6 a.m. with his very deep bass voice.  For many years he worked for the late Tod Sandland on Balah Station.  He had a value to the boss and even though he would sack himself occasionally, he was always back at Balah a few days later.  One legendary story reports that one day he wanted something from Burra that the Boss thought was not good for him and which he consequently ‘forgot’ to bring out.  Ben sacked himself in indignation and walked the fifty odd miles to town.  When he arrived his thirst was as epic as the journey.  He always claimed to be the first man in town to drive a car.  He was working for Dr Jack Sangster when the doctor bought an Albion motor car, the first in the town.  Ben laid down the reins of the doctor’s spanking ponies and took to driving the new vehicle for him.  He saw service in WWI and the RSL provided the bearers at his funeral: Ian Richardson, E.R. Davey, H. Cornelius and L. Kellaway.  Rev. Line officiated.

[Benjamin Hill born 10 August 1882 Kooringa: died 1 February 1952 Burra.]
