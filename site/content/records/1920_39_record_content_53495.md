Burra Town Council, 5 November

The new Act controlling District Councils and Corporations provides for postal voting and has closed the municipal year on 30 June instead of in December as previously for the Town Council.  As a result the Mayor and Councillors will remain in office till June 30 1935.

Kooringa Football Club wrote saying they found the charge for Victoria Park to be excessive and they enclosed £5.  Cr Dow’s motion that the £5 be accepted on account with the balance to remain due and owing was passed.

Secretary J. Allen of the Football Assoc. wrote saying that it was not a responsible body and money was distributed to the clubs which each had to pay its own expenses.

The kerbing in front of Whittney & Tiver’s is to be removed.

It was resolved to take drastic [but unspecified] action to reduce the stray dog nuisance.

Cr Kellaway in reporting from a conference on unemployment said it had been suggested that in reference to the Mayoral Fund for the relief of the unemployed instead of sending to Adelaide for clothes, coupons should be issued on local traders.  The present system was a nuisance as often clothes did not fit and had to be returned.

The Mayor said he had sent for £16 worth of clothes from the city, but the Government was buying up to £20,000 worth at a time and could buy more cheaply than the local merchants.  Women got the advantage of the goods and in some instances if money were given it would never reach the home.

Mr & Mrs Gordon Grubb were given a farewell at the Oddfellows Hall in Aberdeen on Tuesday.  Mr Grubb had been in Burra for a number of years as goods clerk and assistant stationmaster.  He has now been promoted and moved to Gawler.  While here he has shone at football.  A dance followed the speeches and presentations.  Mr A. Ratcliffe spoke and presented a travelling rug, an inscribed tobacco pouch and a gross of matches.  Mr Warnes the stationmaster spoke in eulogistic terms of Mr Grubb’s capabilities and popularity.  Mr H. Schumacher of the SAR also spoke.

The Leighton Strawberry Fete was followed by a well-attended concert and proceeds were satisfactory.  [Details are given in c. 1½ columns.]
