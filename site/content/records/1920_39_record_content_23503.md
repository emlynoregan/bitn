Burra Show Society.  20 June

The committee discussed carious organisational aspects of the show and considered the special trains.  Last year the Adelaide train had cost them about £40 while the Terowie train made a profit.  The arrangements are that if a train makes a loss the guarantors pay it, but if the train makes a profit the railways pocket the lot.  In other states 10% of any profit goes to the guarantor.  As an additional insult SAR carries stock on the specials, but gives no allowance for so using the train.

Charges are suggested for the sideshows of 1/- per foot of frontage instead of a flat rate and for the payment to be made in advance.

The Dog Trials ran at a loss of £33 compared with £35 the previous year.  A long list of changes to the prize list was offered.  Various changes to the sheep section will favour the smaller producer.  In the ring horse-drawn vehicles are giving way to motor vehicles.
