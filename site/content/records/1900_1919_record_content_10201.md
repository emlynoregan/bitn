The Old Smelts

For many years the slagheap went untouched.  Then 10 years ago Mr Paynter erected a small plant to treat the slag to extract copper, but the primitive machinery was not equal to the task and after only a short trial it was taken down and removed.  Several attempts with hammer and pan followed, but without providing any financial rewards.  Four to five years ago Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler undertook a much larger scale operation.  The task proved more difficult than envisaged and many alterations to the machinery had to be made by Mr Mat. May, but eventually the whole heap was treated and in the process about Â£90 a month was paid to employees.  We understand that the company was amply rewarded, though the fluctuating price of copper was responsible for lower returns that hoped for.  Having now no further use the whole plant will be levelled and the materials sold by auction.  The machinery itself will be sent to Gawler.
