Cost of transfer & incorporation	£48-1-9

Petty Expenses	£5-6-2

Renovations & alterations	£700-0-0

Billiard table 	£25-0-0

£2,942-9-7

This means the RSL still has to raise £251-12-7 to complete the building, plus the cost of furnishing, including seating for 190, some small supper tables, lounge furniture, a refrigerator and a piano.

This will all add up to c. £600.

In the eventuality of the RSL dissolving (as is inevitable if there are no more wars) the assets will vest in the Town of Burra.

It is also intended that as well as RSL usage, the premises are expected to provide facilities for the general public for pleasure and sport.

An RSL Auxiliary has already been formed, open to all ladies for a joining fee of only 1/-.
