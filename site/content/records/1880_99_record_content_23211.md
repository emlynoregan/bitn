Political Meeting.  On 26 August a public meeting was called at the Institute which was a rare example of local interest in wider political issues.  It attracted 150 people.  Mr Venning spoke of the need for a State Bank.  Mr Holder spoke of the need to pay Members of Parliament, lest only the wealthy be represented.  C. Drew opposed this, as did Mr Lockyer.  There was general support and when Mr Drew moved that the meeting did not support payment of members the result is confused in the report.

Dr Brummitt spoke against the sale of Crown Lands at a low price to pay the national debt.  He moved the meeting be not in favour of it.  P. Lane moved that the sale of Crown Lands be suspended (regardless of the terms) and that was carried.

C. Drew moved that the meeting express its disappointment at moves to legalise the Totalizator.  Carried.

Mr Venning was thanked, but there was no motion on the State Bank question as it was felt that more information was needed.
