Riggs as Secretary reported that they had 11 members, of whom about 6 or 7 attended the monthly meetings regularly.  They have distributed money and clothing donations to needy people, but have not been able to meet all needs for firewood because of its cost and scarcity.  She paid tribute to the late Miss Craig, who when younger had been a member of the Society.  Elected: President, Rev. C.L.H. Pitman; Secretary, Mrs A.B. Riggs; Treasurer, Rev. R.S.T. Pettet.
