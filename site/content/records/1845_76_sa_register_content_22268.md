Burra News, 5 August

Rev. Stanton arranged a pleasing entertainment at the Institute on Monday evening.  [Details are printed.]

The sum raised goes towards the purchase of gymnastic implements for the grammar school.  The building was literally crammed for the occasion.

The Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association held a soiree in the schoolroom on Tuesday evening.  J.R. Stephens initiated a discussion on the effects of the poet, statesman and warrior on the civilised world.  Messrs Lane, Ridgway and Oldham took part.  Rev. D.S. Wylie presided.
