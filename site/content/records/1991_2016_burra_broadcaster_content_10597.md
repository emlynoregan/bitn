Burra, Clare and Snowtown Hospital Boards continue to meet to advance their merger into a single Board of Directors.  Initiatives to improve services are already being taken across the three hospitals, even before a final constitution has been agreed.  They are sharing resources and expertise in quality assurance, occupational health, safety and welfare, payroll and financial reporting and a service manager.  The new board will also manage the Lower North Community health Service.
