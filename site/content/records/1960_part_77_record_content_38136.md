John Richards the driver of the semi-trailer mentioned last week thanks all for their help, especially Jennison’s Tyre Service, Des Woolley and Mr & Mrs Brian Bevan.  His motor blew up at Florieton when the cab temperature was 147°F.  A day or so earlier near Hay he had been behind a transport driven by a mate when it burst into flames, killing the driver and his 10-year-old daughter.  He hopes for an uneventful trip now to Perth and intends to give up driving and settle in Burra.
