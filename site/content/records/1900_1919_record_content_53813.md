Hampton Court – Redruth Reformatory

Last Saturday invited guests and the Cheer-up Ladies’ band attended the opening of the new tennis court.  This has been prepared entirely by the girls and staff in their leisure time.  The court is protected by a row of gums.  It was declared open by Rev. S.J. Bloyd and his remarks were supported by Rev. D.B. Bridgwood and Rev. A.J. Finch.  Miss Bubb thanked them for their remarks.  Four of the girls – Misses Lily Robertson, Pretoria O’Brien, Jessie Harvey and Violet Benson, played the first set, which was won by the latter pair 5-2.  The second set was played by Rev. A.J. Finch & Miss Trix Pearce v. Norman Pearce & Miss Delcie McWaters and was won by the first pair 6-2.  Miss Gert Pearce & Pretoria O’Brien then defeated Miss Gert Williams & Violet Benson 6-3.  Hampton Court had been the Band’s first performance when the croquet lawn was opened 10 March 1916 and Miss Bubb thanked them for their return.  Mr J. Bentley responded.
