Burra Mine

We hear from the best authority that a contract to unwater the mine has been signed and work will be pushed on as soon as possible, though nothing of note will be done till the new year.  Sceptics still think this is only to allow further time to do something else.  Captain Pryor has gone to Kapunda to have a look at some machinery there which, it is said, is suitable for the treatment of ore here.
