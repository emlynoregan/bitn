R. Mahon of Hindmarsh writes to comment on the fast approaching actions between the Burra Directors and Mr John Stephens.

With respect to the private characters of the Burra Directors, I make no comment.  There are among them individuals for whom I have the greatest respect and whose characters have stood the test of time.  However, when the various pursuits of life and especially the pursuit of wealth enter into it, the character of a man in public life is not that of his private life.  Mr Stephens has scrutinised the Directors as Editor of the Register, that is, in his public life, not as a private person.  I believe the Directors would be justified in their action if they truly believed that their characters had suffered in the estimation of the public, and if a court of law was the only means through which they could gain redress.  But, I do not believe this is the case.  The Directors are fighting under false colours.

Mr Stephens has ever been the champion of the working classes and has always exposed cases where injured poverty has had to contend with the arrogance of wealth.  What is it that prevents the frequent infliction of injuries upon the weak, but the fear of exposure in the columns of the SA Register?

Do not lose sight of the fact that a few actions such as these will, if successful, deprive you of a zealous defender.  You are therefore bound by every tie of interest, and by every claim of gratitude, to support the man who has been your steady and your ready friend.  Rally therefore in his support.

[The letter is long and the advocacy more detailed and flowery.]
