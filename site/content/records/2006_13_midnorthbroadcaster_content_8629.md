Weather.  Burra SES personnel were called to a house in East Street at about 7.30 p.m. on Monday night after strong winds caused the front verandah to work loose and fold back onto the main house roof.  The movement also compromised cables to the main power box and power had to be temporarily shut down.  The large section of verandah was secured with ropes until contractor builders were able to safely remove the damaged roofing.  [Photo.]
