Obituary.  Arthur L. Bence was born at Hampstead, London in 1892, the eldest of three children.  Both parents died when he was about eight.  His brother and sister went to live in Acton and he lived for the next three years with his maternal grandparents at Chiswick.  When his grandfather died he applied in 1903 to become a Bernado’s Boy and was taken to a home near Whitechapel.  He was trained as a bell-ringer and mandolin player and went on tour with fellow boy musicians to Southern England, Wales and the Channel Islands.  On one tour when he was fourteen he met Olive Stringer and eleven years later they were married in Singapore Cathedral.  
In June 1908 a small party of Barnardo’s Boys led by Rev. W.J. & Mrs Mayers, with Mr Aarons as Musical Director, toured Australia to raise money for the Barnardo’s Homes.  They arrived at Fremantle on 8 August 1908.  They visited each state and New Zealand.  A few weeks before the end of the tour Arthur, with the consent of Rev. Mayers, accepted the offer of a home and job in Melbourne.  A few weeks later his employer lost the agency he had been running and Arthur had to fend for himself.  He worked in Sydney for two years and then answered an advertisement to become a trader in the Solomon Islands in 1912.   At that time he did not see another white face for months.  Eventually a passing schooner picked him up from Guadalcanal when he was seriously ill from malaria, having been deserted by his native helpers, who said he had ‘devil-devil’.  He was returned to Australia, where he recovered.  Over the year he had kept in touch with the Stringer family and on his recommendation they had migrated to Victoria, where they had a grand reunion.  He was still in no position to become engaged to Olive and he returned to the Solomon Islands in 1913 and continued to trade and recruit labour there till 1916.  He then received news that his brother had been severely wounded in the war and he joined the Australian Forces.  He arrived in Egypt early in 1916 and later went on to fight in France.  In 1917 he was badly wounded and convalesced in England before being returned to Australia.  On returning he became engaged to Olive Stringer.  His wound had left him with only one usable arm.  Being used to handling native labour, he decided to become a rubber planter in Malaya and sailed to Singapore in 1918.  He got a plantation manager’s job with control of 250 coolies.  He soon sent for Olive and they were married on Easter Saturday 1918.  About eighteen months later, soon after the birth of their daughter Lotus, the rubber price plummeted from 5/- per pound to 6d per pound.  Mrs Bence and Lotus returned to Australia and three months later Arthur followed.  They settled in Burra where he became an auctioneer.  He also travelled the eastern country selling goods and was soon able to start the business Bence’s Ltd, which still flourishes.  The first sale at the Burra Auction Mart was on 7 September 1921.  The Record reported that this innovation would be a boon to many people, as Mr Bence would be ‘prepared to submit to auction on any Friday, anything brought in from a sucking pig to an elephant’.  They expected it to be an unqualified success.

By 1924 Bence’s – Burra’s Cash Drapery Store was established and they had a second child, Len, the store’s present manager.  During WWII Len was stationed in England where he flew Wellington Bombers, returning safely with an English wife.  Lotus married an Australian flying officer, who was killed by the Japanese in the Solomon Islands after his Catalina crashed.  She remarried and now lives in Norway.

Through good and harsh times the store survived and both Arthur and Olive put much time and effort into its continuing success.  Stories of personal generosity in the supply of clothing etc. to struggling families come from the depression days.  They were both workers for charity.  Despite the disability with his arm, Arthur was an accomplished tennis player and golfer.  Many people will remember the beautiful Pearly King and Queen costumes Mr & Mrs Bence wore to fancy dress functions at times.  Arthur also appeared as Father Christmas and made one novel entry to the RSL Hall when he descended to the floor hand over hand on a rope suspended from a skylight.

[This was a neat trick for a one-armed man!]

They retired in the early 1960s to Glenelg and remained there till Olive’s death a few years ago.  [1971] Mr Stringer, her father, lived to be over 100 and only died in the last couple of years.  Arthur returned to Burra to live in one of the Barker Cottage Homes before going to an Adelaide Nursing Home for a short time and dying there on 3 July.  [2 July according to a previous report.] Father John Morley conducted the funeral in St Mary’s on 5 July.  He is survived by a son, a daughter, four grandsons and one great-grandson.

[Arthur Leonard Bence born 15 October 1892 Hampstead, London: died 2 or 3 July 1975 Adelaide.]
