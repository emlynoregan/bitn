New Burra CFS/SES Headquarters are being planned at the old railway goods shed on Copperhouse Street.  They will share a radio room, training room, ablutions block and garage facilities, but will have separate storage rooms for equipment.  At present Burra CES had no permanent venue and was using the Town Hall for meetings and the storage of equipment.  The CFS was sharing the St John Ambulance Centre in Market Street.  The secretary of the CFS said this was adequate because the town had a fire brigade and the CFS only fought grass fires in summer and helped with serious town fires.  Locating the CFS and SES near each other would allow them to combine resources.
