Sowing is about finished and the early sown wheat is up, but not far forward.  The season has been very dry.

We have had boisterous weather lately, and on Friday there was a heavy fall of snow and of snow, hail and rain mixed.  The snow has not yet disappeared.  It is charming in the morning to look at the snow clad hills, but it would be much pleasanter if there was less wind by three-quarters.

Grass is scanty and the late rain has not been sufficient to make it grow faster than the rabbits can eat it.

The Rabbit Acts needs to be made compulsory.  A school and District Council are needed.  The creek crossings need repairing.
