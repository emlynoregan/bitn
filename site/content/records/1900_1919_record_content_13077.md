John Carey celebrated his 85th birthday on 10 February.  He was born at North Molton, Devon, in 1820.  He trained as a carpenter, and then went to work for Sir William Dearing in Kent.  He came to SA in the William Hamond, arriving 19 January 1854 after a fast trip of three months.  He worked briefly in Adelaide and Gawler before coming to Burra District where he worked nearly 20 years for Doctors W. & John Browne at Booborowie and in 1874 bought the business of H. Woodgate at New Aberdeen: chaff cutter.  But he soon moved to Kooringa, buying the business of W.H. Banks, where the Burra Hotel stables now stand.  About 12 months ago he broke a leg and now gets about with sticks.  Three children are living: Mrs A.G. Muller (Broken Hill), Mrs R. Webber (Mt Bryan East), and Fred.  There are 22 grandchildren and 8 great grandchildren.  His memory remains good and he reads the smallest print without glasses.
