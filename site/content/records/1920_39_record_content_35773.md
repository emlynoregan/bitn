Burra Brass Band has been defunct for many years, but a number of enthusiasts gathered at J. Allenâ€™s rooms on the evening of the 14 October with the idea of reviving it.  President, P.W. Clarke; Secretary, J.T. Pascoe and Committeemen, W.J. Lee & Lisle Pearce were asked to continue in the offices they held when the band went into recess, with the addition to the committee of A.W. Andrews, J. Allen & L. Blott.  J.H. Murison was elected bandmaster.  About 30 names of potential members were taken.
