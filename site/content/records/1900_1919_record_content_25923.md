Trip to World’s End, 1 January.  The day was hot, but pleasant with a nice breeze.  Visitors on New Year’s Day could either watch the races or spread out their rugs under the gum trees and have a picnic.  They could walk up the gorge to the world’s End Ranges and the beautiful waterfalls and admire the overhanging gum trees and stately pines.  Scores of people availed themselves of the opportunity.  The wheat yields in the vicinity have been most satisfying this season.  There was not a blade of green to be seen, but there were a number of haystacks as farmers here provide well for their stock.  All World’s End and his family were out for the day on 1 January.
