Obituary.  Up to 800 people attended a memorial service for Barry Stringer, a renowned North Eastern and SANFL footballer at Spalding Town Hall last Wednesday.  He had died following a heart attack the previous week aged 57.  He had played junior football at Redhill and then played for North Adelaide.  In the SANFL he played 220 games and took part in Northâ€™s premierships in 1971 & 1972. He was then captain for two seasons and won the best & fairest awards in 1974 & 1977.  Throughout his SANFL career Barry travelled each week from the family property at Koolunga for training and the matches.  After retiring from North Adelaide in 1981 he played briefly for the Proprietary Football Club Pt Pirie before becoming playing coach of Brinkworth/Yacka in its final year 1984.  He was the playing mentor for Brinkworth/Yacka/Spalding for the two years it existed.  When the Brinkworth/Spalding/Redhill club was formed in 1987 he became its coach, retiring in 1994 after seeing them to four premierships.  He changed the style of play in the North Eastern competition said BSR club spokesman, Peter Meyer.  [Two photos.]
