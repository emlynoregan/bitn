Letter.  Vincent Burke of Burra writes congratulating young people of Burra for their efforts to offer a positive contribution to the debate on the future of the town as reported in recent issues of the Broadcaster.  Having done market research and consulting work in some thirty rural towns, he says that all too often young people see only a bleak outlook in their towns and have done little to help themselves, so this response in Burra is a delight.
