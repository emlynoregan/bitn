The Defeat of the Burra Burra Directors

The news of the verdict in the Burr v. The Board of Directors’ case was immediately despatched to Burra.  The verdict not only relieves Mr Burr morally and financially, but also manifests an honest boldness in the gentlemen of the jury.  It is a signal of a righteous judgement for what appears to have been an attempt by the Board of Directors to get rid of an officer they had engaged for three years at what they afterwards came to regard as an expensive salary.  Their attempt was discreditable on the grounds of the concealment of their ulterior motive and this is clear from the letter of 7 September, written only twenty-four hours before the letter of dismissal.  The content of the 7 September letter completely negatived the allegations of his negligence or alleged inability to conduct assays.  The procedures on the following day were perfectly outrageous.  The secretary’s letter of 7 September reveals that the first reaction to news from England of a decrease in copper prices was a resolve to reduce wages throughout the mine, though this was concealed or denied.
