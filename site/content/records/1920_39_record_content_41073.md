T. Halls and Alex Bevan complain that they pay 3/- p.a. permit to run cabs to the station and 5/- driver’s licence and 10/- Government driver’s licence, while others earning a living in the same way pay nothing.  (The letter actually cited charges of earlier years.  Last year the Council collected £1-10-0 from them.)  But last year the fee had been reduced for 12 months and as that arrangement had lapsed the Town Clerk sought the full account.  It was resolved that the fees be the same as last year.
