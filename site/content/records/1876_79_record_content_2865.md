Burra Burra Mines. [This announcement on page 3 of the paper has no headline and runs for about 10cm of one column!]

`In consequence of the low state of the copper market the Directors of the Burra Burra Mines have decided to temporarily suspend all operations, and the workings will be stopped on Saturday, September 29. A few men will be kept on for a few days in order to get the pumping machinery in a position to start again as soon as the copper market rises.'

This will reduce money in the town by c. £30,000 annually. Wages at present are about £2,000 monthly and firewood over £500 a month. 300 men and boys will be thrown out of work. We hope some relief will come from railway construction and work on the Eastern Road.
