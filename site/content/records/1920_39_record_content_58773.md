Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 30 November

Lean’s Hill.  Driving continued under the north end of the hill to 78 ft.  The face of the tunnel is now penetrating the west bar, which is prominent in Lean’s Shaft.

Farnden’s Hill.  The floor of the cut has been taken up for 16 ft and the upper part has been timbered to secure the hanging wall.  About 12-14 oz of specimen ore was extracted.  30 bags of ore are at grass, estimated at 1 oz per ton.  Gold is showing in the face of the lower cut.
