Burra Town Council, 7 October

L.L. Fiebig of Burra North said he was licensed to sell petrol from the pumps opposite Sara’s at Burra North and he wished to make certain alterations to the site and enclosed a plan.  He also sought permission to erect a small building thereon.  Granted on both counts if he obtains the necessary building permits.

As noted elsewhere Aberdeen Tennis Club asked for £35 financial assistance, which was denied.

The Highways Dept. advised the Main Road Grant this year would be £500 and the Council’s contribution £100.  They also asked for all road signs reading ‘To Kooringa’ to be returned and they would be changed to read ‘To Burra’. 

The Corporation of Clare advised the retirement of Inspector Davis and asked for a donation to match that of the other two Corporations in his area for a presentation.  Agreed.

The RSL advises it has bought the club rooms for £2,000 and asks the rates to be based on that.  To be advised the Court of Appeal had been held and Council has not the power to reduce the assessment.

The tender of £10 each for the 7 cedar chairs owned by the Council was not up to the minimum required.  No tender was accepted.

The Town Hall cottage is to be rented to the Town Clerk at 16/- a week.

The footpath from Burra to Burra North is to be bituminised.

The piece of ground near the old betting shop in Best Place is to be bituminised.

The white line used for the recent penny drive looks like the edge of the gutter at night and is causing nasty falls.  The people who painted it will be asked to obliterate it.

The light on Lewis’s bridge in Commercial St is to be moved to the corner of Ware St.

Tenders are to be called for the renovations to the Lodge Room at the Town Hall, including repairs to the ceiling.

Thomas Warnes writes on behalf of himself and his wife to thank all those who took part in the search for their daughter Christobel.
