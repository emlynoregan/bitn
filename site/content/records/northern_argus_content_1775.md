Ratepayers Wish to Secede

193 Burra Burra Dc ratepayers have proposed seceding from the District and joining Hallett DC.  A hearing will be held in November.  Hallett DC has proposed to the Local Government Advisory Commission that the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of Ayers be annexed to Hallett.

Spokesman for the 193 ratepayers, Bob Gebhardt, said Burra roads and Council plant were run down because of lavish expenditure on unnecessary projects like the J150 project and tourist ventures.  Also Burra rural rates were twice those of Hallett and there was no communication between the Council and ratepayers.

Burra Burra District Clerk, Rodney Walsh refused to comment.  A meeting of Booborowie and Mt Bryan residents (who are in the affected area) set up a steering committee of twelve at a meeting on 26 June to plan the secession.  Further ratepayer meetings were held at Mt Bryan on 15 September and at Hallett on 18 September.  Chairman of the Hallett DC, John Hale, said that Council was in favour of the move.  Hallett had only one permanent and one casual staff, while Burra had 6 administration staff.  The change would add one to Hallettâ€™s staff.  They would like to see Burra return to a Corporation while Hallett took care of rural ratepayers.
