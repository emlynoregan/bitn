2nd Leader on the fiasco of the parcel delivery system of the railways.

Recently tenders were called for parcel deliveries and suddenly the cost of getting a parcel delivered rose from 3d to 6d.  The contractor gets 1d and 5d goes to the revenue of the colony – this is in addition to the fee already paid for carriage on the railway.  To make is all the sillier, if the receiver refuses to pay the exorbitant charge the parcel is returned to the railway station where he can collect it himself without further charge.  The whole thing is grossly unfair to both the customer and to the contractor, who has been put to expense of a horse and dray to operate a system that has failed as most parcels are now marked ‘to be called for’.
