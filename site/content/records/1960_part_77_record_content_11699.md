1934

The staff was E.A. Haese, Doris Parry, Olive Prior and Beryl Waterhouse.  On 15 March it is noted there had been no homework for the previous two weeks because of the excessively hot weather.  Mr Haese was transferred to Peterborough and Mr T. Charlesworth was appointed from the start of second term.  On 13 July the Minister of Education Hon. S.W. Jefferies, accompanied by the district MP visited the school.  This was the first year that an end of year banquet was mentioned.
