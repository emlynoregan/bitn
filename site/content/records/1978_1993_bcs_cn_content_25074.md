BCS.  New students are listed.

In this year the second stage of SACE will be established.

BCS will become a host school for Open Access students and School of the Air students.  Miss Cathy Sleigh, the itinerant teacher will be based at BCS.

Planning for the new BCS-Burra Swimming Pool is well in hand and the Memorandum of Understanding of use between parties is almost complete.  The pool is expected to be ready for use at the end of 1993.
