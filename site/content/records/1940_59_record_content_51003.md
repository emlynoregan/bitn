A severe hailstorm in the third quarter forced the teams off the ground at Booborowie, where Burra was playing the local team.  So dense was the downpour that half the spectators did not even know the players had left the ground.  The fall lasted about six or seven minutes.  Twenty players made for the same small truck and car on the eastern boundary and could only shelter their heads.  Several inches of hail piled up on their backs and necks.  The match was declared a draw, as both teams had scored 4.6 when play was abandoned.
