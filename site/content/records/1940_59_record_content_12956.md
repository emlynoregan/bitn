RAAF Film.  A very fair number turned out for the program of films shown on Wednesday by the RAAF unit visiting Burra.  As well as showing the wide range of RAAF activities the officer in charge FO Hutchinson took the opportunity to urge support for the Volunteer Air Observation Corps.  Even without enemy activity the VAOC were useful.  Only recently a group at Loxton had guided a plane that was running out of fuel to a safe landing.
