Robbery.  Mr J.A. Watt’s drapery store was entered between 9.30 p.m. on Saturday and 8 a.m. Monday.  Mr Watt did not notice anything unusual till he sought his cash box at about 8.30 a.m. and found it gone.  It held about £15 comprising £6-10-0 in gold, 5 or 6 £1 notes, a cheque and a postal note.  Subsequently he also missed 1 Berlin Coat, 1 black suit, 3 imitation silk handkerchiefs, 1 towel, several shirts and beaver moles.  The burglar appears to have gained admittance through the front door by key.  [Beaver mole = a form of woollen trouser.]
