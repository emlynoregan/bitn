Petrol Ration Tickets

Notice is given of the arrangements for the issue of petrol ration tickets for the next few months.  December tickets will not be available until Monday 1 December, but consumers will be permitted to draw December and January rations at one application, if they wish.  But due to heavy postal traffic over the Christmas period the issue of ration tickets will be suspended from the close of business on Tuesday 16 December till Monday 5 January.  [Further details are printed.]
