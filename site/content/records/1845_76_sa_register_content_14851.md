The new German Lutheran Church at Redruth was opened last Sunday.  At about 10.30 a.m. a procession was formed at the home of Mr F. Vollmer and proceeded from there to the church.  First came a party of men forming the choir, then 12 young girls dressed in white and bearing the Bible, the key to the church, two wax tapers, a miniature crucifix and the communion service.  These were followed by the Prediger [Preacher] who was to officiate; Rev. Fiedler of Hahndorf.  A number of Germans brought up the rear.  At the church the choir ranged on either side of the door and sang a hymn.  A solemn benediction and extempore form of consecration followed, pronounced by the Pastor, who then opened the door and everyone entered to entirely fill the building.

The choir sang a piece and the Pastor offered a prayer.  The 415th hymn followed, after which the Pastor chanted the Augsburg Confession and gave a discourse on the Epistle for the day; the 5th Chapter of Galatians.  After the singing of the 460th hymn the Pastor delivered an impressive inaugural address, after which there was further singing during which a collection was made.  The Pastor then delivered a doctrinal address and an exposition of part of the 6th Chapter of Matthew.  The service closed with singing.  An evening service was also held with a large congregation.  All the proceedings for the day were conducted in the German language.  It is understood that it is intended to open a day-school in connection with the church; the master to conduct divine service until the arrival of a minister from the fatherland.
