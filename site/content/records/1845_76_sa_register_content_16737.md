Mintaro News, 3 August

Tempestuous weather in the last two weeks has made the local roads quite unsafe.

Two new schoolmasters have been obtained to replace our recent losses.

I recently inspected the splendid tomb at Penwortham Cemetery, erected to the memory of the late Dr Sokolowsky.  It is erected in Mintaro slate and beautifully cut in relief.  The doctor was greatly respected and died 22 December 1862 aged 44.
