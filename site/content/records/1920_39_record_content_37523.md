Ministerial Visit

Hon R.S. Richards Minister for Mines & Commissioner of Lands addressed a meeting at the Institute on Friday evening.  He was accompanied by local MPs McHugh, Critchley & George.

The Mayor in introducing the Minister said in the town 100 men were on rations, meaning the Government had to provide for from 200 to 250 people.  The Minister had been busy.  He had been at Parliament House till midnight and then come up from Adelaide by road in the morning and had visited Mongolata.

Mr Critchley spoke first.  [But offered only platitudes.]

Mr Richards then outlined some of the suggestions the Hill Government had adopted.  First he spoke of the position the Government found itself in and its difficulties and the world-wide nature of the depression.  The Government had drafted a bill to provide the machinery to give those who provided credit to farmers a preferential claim to payments from the crop.  He then outlined the items that would rank pro rata in preference to other debts.  The object was to have normal credit providers give the aid to farmers that the Government could not.  They also intended a Bill to have a single land valuation for all purposes and a Bill aiming to resume undeveloped land and put families on it â€“ good land in well watered areas.  Also they planned a Bill amending the Mining on Private Property Act, reducing the royalties paid.

The Premier would visit next Friday.

Mr McHugh agreed that the most urgent thing was an Act to relieve farmers or else 4-5,000 would go insolvent.  Some 2,000 were likely to do so anyway.

Mr George spoke in support and said he would do what he could to aid the Mongolata miners.
