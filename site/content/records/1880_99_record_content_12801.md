He again went through the actions of the late Parliament.  He did not think the time right for federation.  He opposed annexation and the Exhibition Scheme, but was for payment of MPs.  He also favoured the retention of postal charges for newspapers and was for the Government ownership of wharves.  He opposed an all-Government education system and thought it ought to be locally controlled.  Taxation should be aimed more at the rich.  He favoured perpetual leases for land and while against any extension of the current railways he was for a new line to the northeast [Broken Hill].  He supported assisted emigration where the emigrants were selected by their friends.  [Presumably he was actually discussing immigration!]  He favoured the abolition of road boards, the Military Force and the Marine Board.
