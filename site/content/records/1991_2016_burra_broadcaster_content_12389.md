Housing in Burra.  The demand for houses was about the same in 1996 as in 1995.  24 houses were sold in the Burra Burra DC area and the average price remained fairly steady.  It was $52,204 in 1992 and $56,318 in 1996.  1993 was a boom year when 50 houses changed hands at an average price of $63,576.  AdChem’s rationalisation has placed a number of houses on the market and at present there are a number of fine bluestones available in a buyers’ market.  A number of Burra businesses are still doing well however, by appealing to a broader market.  These include: Stephen Angel’s Décor Made Easy, Gary McPhee of McPhee’s Butchers and Saltbush Clothing.  The sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road could see some boost to economic activity.
