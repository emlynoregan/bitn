Mrs T.H. Eustice of Boolgun writes a rather confused and confusing letter on the change in post office names, but essentially she considers the change unnecessary.  If the postal authorities can’t correctly deliver letters addressed to Kooringa, Burra; Aberdeen, Burra and Redruth, Burra; then it is they who need changing and not the name.  She also asserts that Kooringa and Burra are native names and should not be changed.  She also says she remembers being told by several people that a man named Weston built ‘Johnny Green’ on Morphett’s Shaft, but that the figure was not called ‘Johnny Green’.  The Editor notes that Burra Burra is an Indian name meaning ‘Big Big’.
