Mt Bryan.  A public meeting on 4 August is reported in an article extending for over 1 column.  The main demands are for a goods shed at the station and a school & teacherâ€™s residence - attendance being sufficient to justify the same.  The meeting approved the purchase of the old Wesleyan Chapel for use as a Council Chamber.
