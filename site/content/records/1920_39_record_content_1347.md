St Mary’s Annual Vestry Meeting.

Mr W.G. Hawkes has donated the whole window proposed as a war memorial last year, as a memorial to his son and his comrades who paid the supreme sacrifice.  Mrs J. Sandland and family will erect a memorial window in memory of their son and brother who also died in the war.  The Bailey family will erect a window in memory of their father and mother.  All the windows will be by Jones and Willis of London.

The erection of the new rectory is now in hand with a contract to Messrs Woollacott Jun. and F. Pearce for an 8-roomed house in Bridge St.

The east end of the church is to be rough cast as the only effective cure for its deterioration.
