Obituary.  Albert Duell who died 26 October [Registered as 25th] was one of the district’s best known graziers from World’s end.  He was born at Beaumont SA 27 July 1853, [Registration says 28th] the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Duell.  When he was young the family moved to Kapunda and from there he moved to Eudunda before settling at World’s End in 1876 where he lived until retiring to Kooringa in 1923.  At world’s End he was a member of the Apoinga Council and for a long time the postmaster and Returning Officer, also secretary and treasurer of the World’s End School Committee and was the last of the original trustees of the World’s End Wesleyan/Methodist Church.  He was for a long time a member of the Foresters Lodge.  He had a precise knowledge of the rainfall figures of World’s End.  In 1886 he married Miss Charlotte Baynes who died suddenly on 29 July 1925 just three weeks after they came to Kooringa to live.  [Note this is inconsistent with 1923 mentioned above.  His wife’s obituary (XXXXVII, 30, 5 Aug. 1925, page 3) says she died about six weeks after they moved to Kooringa.]  He leaves three daughters: Mrs G. Henderson (Torrensville), Mrs M. Phillips (Kooringa) & Miss Duell (Sydney and one son Mr Fred Duell (World’s End).  There are 9 grandchildren.

His brother Henry aged 90 also survives.  [Died 24 January 1938 at Parafield aged 91, but actually 89, as he was born 3 June 1848 at Gleeville (Beaumont) SA]
