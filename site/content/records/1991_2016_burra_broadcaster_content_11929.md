A Tourism Advisory Committee was formed in November 1995.  In March 1996 the Burra Burra DC decided to restructure its tourism assets.  It decided not to renew the Tourism Executive Officerâ€™s contract and managers of the several operations would now be answerable directly to Council.  In its budget for 1996-97 the Council allowed for a 20% financial drop in its tourism involvement from $700,000 to $534,120.
