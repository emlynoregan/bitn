Jennison’s Tyre Service is 40 years old today.  Mr H.J.B. Jennison opened the business on 22 May 1922 as a tyre retailer and repairer.  Years ago tyres had to be ordered from overseas with waiting periods of six months.  Now the stock held can supply most needs for cars, tractors and farm machinery.  The business has expanded to include repairs and a Lubritorium.  A big change has been to get the public to buy Australian tyres and another was the change from solid to pneumatic tyres on tractors.  Methods of retreading tyres had also changed in that period.
