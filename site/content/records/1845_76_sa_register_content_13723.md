Kooringa News, 2 October

The past week has been very wet.  It started with a sharp shower on Saturday night, but on Sunday it fell in torrents accompanied by fearful lightning and thunder.  The creeks and streets were deluged.  Commercial Street and others became navigable rivers.  Subsequently the creek rose, broke its banks and swept all before it.  Fortunately it did not rise as far as anticipated and the main damage was to some ore washing machines near the Mine.  Although the streets were left in a deplorable state, the warm dry weather since has allowed them to dry considerably.

The little chapel, Paxton Square, belonging to the Congregationalists and latterly used for divine service by the Welsh Church has been thoroughly repaired and renovated and on Sunday was re-opened by the United Presbyterians; Rev. W. Davidson of that body intending to settle here.  Services were conducted in the morning by the Rev. Davidson, in the afternoon by Rev. Whittaker and in the evening by Rev. Lloyd.  It was exactly ten years since the chapel first opened for public worship.
