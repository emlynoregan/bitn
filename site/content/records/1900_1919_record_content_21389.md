The young men who were engaged at the boring operations have behaved in an exemplary manner: ‘their lives and conduct can well be emulated by young men even in our town.’  They were required to maintain a very quiet attitude in respect to the progress of the bores and what was being discovered and not once did they betray the confidence reposed in them.
