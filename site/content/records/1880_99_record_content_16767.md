Editorial on the Town Council and Cr Ridgway in particular.

‘Cr Ridgway, however, on last evening fairly eclipsed even himself’

After last week’s exposure of the mistakes in the Finance Committee’s report he,

‘wildly charges us with torturing the Council week by week for trying to reduce the debt, and damaging them in the eyes of the ratepayers and of the public.  He said too that we should do better to help them in their work.  As a matter of fact it takes us most of our time to correct the mistakes of Cr Ridgway.’

‘Besides we have frequently praised the Council and when we have criticised it has been with an honest desire to help forward the interest of the town.’

He says that the £1,200 we claim was spent last year on works includes interest and the bond redeemed.

But the audited and published balance sheet shows our statement to be correct.
