The Page Family will leave Burra in early January.

Robyn says it is 18 years since they came and rented a cottage in Thames Street before buying the Coach House in Ware Street.  Some years later they bought Cyril Irlam’s house opposite the Gaol, along with 70 acres and some red deer to run, before finally moving to Paradise.  Neil ran his office in Burra for many years and Robyn was appointed to BCS after being with the Regional Education Office in Clare for two years.  She did some part-time work when her children were young, before returning to full-time teaching.  She made a great contribution to community life.  She joined the National Trust in 1982 and was secretary for a number of years – at a time when the Police Lock-up was condemned and the Redruth Gaol was unpainted.  The archaeological dig was done on the White Hart Hotel and she and other members dug out cubic metres of pigeon manure from Morphett’s Enginehouse.  She also served on the Lewis Board, Burra Mine Museum, and the Burra Tourist Association and was a Councillor for three years and Chairperson for the J150 Committee for five years.  She was coach of the netball club and contributed to the School Council’s Curriculum Committee, the Crippled Children’s Association and the Board of the Art Gallery, the Town Hall Steering Committee and the Blue Light Disco Committee.  She was also a member of the Jam with Ham Band and has been involved with school musicals.  She was chosen Burra’s Australia Day Citizen of the Year in 1995.  Neil has been involved in Apex, the Football Club in a number of ways, with tennis, the Burra Traders’ Association and the Tourism Association.  He also won the Mail Medal for B Grade football in his playing days.

Their son Lachlan will be going to Scotch College next year after winning a scholarship – he is very interested in a musical career.  Kendall will probably attend Burnside Primary School and Robyn has a one-year position at Blair Athol School in Year3-4.  Neil will continue his work in estate administration and as a consultant to law firms.
