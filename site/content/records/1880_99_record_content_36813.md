Bible Christian Sunday School Anniversary 25 & 26 May.  Attendance was down on previous years, especially at the morning service.  This was partly due to other special services no doubt, but also to removals through the year.  The childrenâ€™s treat saw them march from the schoolroom to the Burra Oval led by the Burra Brass Band, for sports and then tea and cakes.  The report of the Sunday school showed a fall in numbers due to removals to Broken Hill etc.
