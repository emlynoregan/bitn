SAR Commissioner J.A. Fargher reports that the railway from Broken Hill to Port Pirie is being converted to standard gauge and the question of a standard gauge connection with Adelaide is being discussed. Though not yet decided, it would probably be along the Port Pirie line, at least as far as Merriton.  He considered that even when constructed such a line would have little if any affect upon the number of railway workers living in Riverton.
