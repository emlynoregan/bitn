This year funds were allotted to Wards according to the length of roads and paths to be maintained.  S. Kellaway asked for Councillors views on this.

Crs Lee, Morgan and Woollacott were in favour, but Crs Allen, Harris & Pearce were opposed, believing generally that money should be spent where it was raised.

Mr Kellaway asked if Councillors favoured asking the Fire Brigade authorities for a faster vehicle for the fire reel â€“ at present it could do about 15 m.p.h.  The Mayor said yes.
