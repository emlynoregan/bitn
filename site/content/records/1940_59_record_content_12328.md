Mr H.V. Wilson overseer for the Town Council was returning home from work on his bicycle when he sustained a nasty fall in front of Mr Pledgeâ€™s house in Thames Street.  The cause is uncertain, but it is thought he may have fainted due to the hard work he had been doing combined with the extreme temperature.  He sustained abrasions to his head, a cut ear and a broken collarbone.  He was treated at Burra Hospital.
