Flinders University Dig Group gave a talk to locals on Thursday last to explain its operations at their dig to commence in early April.  Paul Sacki did a study as an honours student into the value of cultural tourism in Burra 1997-98.  He found it was worth $712,000 to hotels and accommodation houses, $88,500 in passport sales and $384,000 in food, petrol and shopping.  It contributed over $1 million to Burraâ€™s economy at that time.
