Amelia Doe - wife of James Doe.  Husband came home c. 9.45 p.m. on Friday and did not leave until called by his assistant R. Pascoe about 3.30 p.m.

Richard Pascoe.  Left the shop on Friday at 7.30 p.m. and did not return until hearing of the fire about 3.15 a.m.  Went and found Doe.  Don’t know how the fire could have started.  Doe gave me notice on Wednesday on account of the dull times.  Would have left [his employment] on Saturday.  Knew he was hard up.  Used to buy candles regularly at Geake’s.

[Doe had said he didn’t use candles for light, but used candle-grease for the strops.]

William Geake - grocer.  Heard of the fire about 2.30 a.m. when it had just reached the Record office.  Most of the fire was put out on my premises when I arrived and found the door had been broken open and books and cashbox taken out.  Estimate damages at £15.  Insured stock for £300 and the building for £300.  Doe bought a candle the night previous to the fire.

The coroner made a long summing up and the jury had a lengthy consultation before deciding there was not sufficient evidence to show how the fire originated.
