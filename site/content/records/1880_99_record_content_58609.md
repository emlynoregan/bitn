Thomas Davies asked questions about the awarding of work to higher priced tenderers and the giving of work to certain favoured ratepayers.

The mayor said that in the particular case referred to the highest tender was accepted on his casting vote and he believed the money was well spent.  He would repeat the choice.

He would not elaborate on why Mr Bartholomæus got the assessment job over Mr Snell.

Mr Davies said that only a year or so ago the court had upheld the value of SAMA’s assessment as being c. £100 higher than the new assessment.  He queried whether the assessor had done a good job.

Mr C. Fuss warmly protested Mr Davies questioning of the Mayor’s honesty.  He believed the Mayor had done his work in a straightforward and conscientious manner.
