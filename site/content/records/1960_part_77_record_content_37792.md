Characteristics of the paper in 1967

Generally quite a good coverage of local news, though a considerable amount of the material refers to more distant mid north centres like Spalding, Saddleworth, Manoora and Riverton.  After the first couple of page sport dominates the paper.

This carries most of the news.

For much of the year this was the familiar mixture of a few large advertisements with public notices, advertising for land sales and for district events.  This changed late in the year (from 24 October) when editorials reappeared for the first time in many years.  The page was then typically: Editorial, Cash Column, some larger advertisements and local news and sports, with the previous page two material moved on to page 3.

Pages 3-8 & from October page 2 & 4-8

Typically dominated by larger advertisements with perhaps 2 to 4 columns devoted to sports and some news.  Of the latter District Council reports comprised a large, but rather unedifying part.  Some non-local pieces were common, including a regular column on ‘Last Week in State Parliament’ by the local MP John Freebairn.

Out and About by ‘Mrs Maggs’ (Mary Woollacott) was an important and very useful column for local births, birthdays, deaths and other events.  This is a valuable help for local historian, even if the obituaries etc. are exceeding brief.  This varied in location, but was often on page 7 and varied generally from one to two column
