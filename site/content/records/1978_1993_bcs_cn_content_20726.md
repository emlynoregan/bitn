Burra Youth Centre

A survey is included in this issue because ‘we’ would like to reopen the Youth Centre and approval has been given to use the prefabricated building near the sporting complex on a three month trial basis.  Returns are to be sent to Dennis Mason of BCS.  [It is not clearly specified who ‘we’ might be.]
