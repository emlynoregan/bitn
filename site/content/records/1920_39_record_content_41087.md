H.W. Morgan replies to Mr Parsons about Mongolata leases.  He contradicts the condition of leasehold â€“ a claim has to be worked 44 hours a week irrespective of days.  If Mr Parsons thinks mining land is too valuable to lie idle can he explain why he pegged 80 acres and gave the impression it was all registered when only 20 acres was registered.
