This produced much debate.  Cr Riggs thought three at Sara’s corner would provoke confusion and it was finally decided to begin with one at Sara’s, one at SAFU corner and one at Chapel St.

Cr Riggs sought an hour’s limit on cars standing in the street – perhaps only on busy days, but this was not seconded.

The Inspector reported that car No. 64459 had been driven on footpaths in Kooringa and under the Kooringa Hotel verandah.  He also reported 14 cases of stray cattle which he would only take to court if owners refused to pay the 10/- fine.

Cr Kellaway said that 11 pines had been pulled out by boys.

Cr Riggs brought up the imbalance in ward funds and specifically the problem of North Ward’s greater length of roads with less funding and recently the railways had opened a new gate giving another road to maintain.

Cr Kellaway wondered whether placing metal in Market Square was economical if the monument arrangements were soon to be completed.

The Mayor thought there would be no likelihood of that soon.

The Electric Light Co. is to be asked the cost of a light between Lewis’s bridge and the hospital.

The Railways are to be written to re the terrible state of the road from the station gate to the station.

The Mayor thought that perhaps the Department should be asked to remove tie-up posts at the station.  Other Councillors thought ‘the horseman was not yet quite out of commission’.
