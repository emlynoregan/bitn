A Southern Rangeland Rural Plan Meeting was held at Woolgangi Station 1 August, attended by about 25 people.  Present from the Southern Rangelands Taskforce were Hon. Graham Gunn MP, Vice-Chairman Chris Reed, Julia Clarke, Michael McBride, Wendy Shirley, Jim Cawthorne and Joe Collins.  Tas Sundberg the facilitator for the Central North East Farm assistance Program.  This program developed out of the two failed Exceptional Circumstances applications – a $4 million program to help people living in the old E.C. Area.  The workshop looked at three questions:

What is the thing that made most difference to your life in the past 10-15 years?

‘Lack of money’ was the overwhelming response.

Tourism for the area and setting up an ideal sheep property.  (EWE-TOPIA)

Become a bureaucrat and develop some strategies to help people in the Southern Rangelands.

Some long term strategies emerged from the discussions, but no immediate solutions.
