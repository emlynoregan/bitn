Letter.  Rev. David Burgess of the Anglican Parish of Burra writes to express his fears about the war in Iraq and the impact it has on a life of hope.  He invites all, whether believers or non-believers and of any faith to form a peace circle each Wednesday at 12 noon for half an hour in St Mary’s Anglican Church Hall where – ‘We will sit in a circle, in silence, to grow hope and build peace.’
