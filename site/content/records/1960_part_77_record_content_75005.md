Stockowners Association of SA.  The Burra & District Committee held its annual meeting in the RSL Hall and elected: President, J.G. Duncan; Senior Vice-President, J.T. Drew; Junior Vice-President, R.J. Ashby.  The address was given by M.I. McTaggart.  The President reported on the year’s activities.

The wool sales in September saw values slide a further 15-17½% with the average bale fetching $176 at the last sale – a slight improvement.  There was a year of record rainfall resulting in huge losses in pastoral areas due to blowfly attacks and more recently from grass seeds and worms.  Some producers say this combination has been more worry than a drought.  The bushfire hazard has been extreme.

Cattle prices have been low, but stable and with an estimated backlog of 2 million cattle to be slaughtered, the outlook is grim.

Pig meat and grain fed lamb prices have been quite good.

Rising costs in the sector in wages, workers’ compensation, fuel, payroll tax, super bounty and depreciation, along with depressed markets are forcing producers to the wall.
