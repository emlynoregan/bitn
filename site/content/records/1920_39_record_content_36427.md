Burra Mine

P.A. McBride has given permission for men to go onto the Burra Mine property.  39 unemployed men have signed on.  A practical miner’s help is needed and also assistance with tools.  Mr McBride attended the committee meeting on 11 December and gave his consent.  He said he was willing to do so without charging any royalty until a man’s income exceeded £4 a week or the basic wage.  Over £4 he would expect a small royalty towards paying the rates and taxes.  He also guaranteed the right to use any equipment now on the mine.  All men to work at the mine do so at their own risk.  The Minister of Mines Mr McHugh is to be asked to visit as soon as possible.  14 men started on Monday, but they have practically no tools and a call for such has gone out.  Washaways in the open cut over the years have uncovered considerable quantities of good ore, but the services of an experienced miner in selecting the good ore is really needed and if an old tributer could assist it would be appreciated.  On Tuesday one gang under Mr Les Wall opened new ground near Morphett’s Shaft and about 20 men were at work with 39 signed on.  At present the water is 11ft below average and a few feet more would give access to one of the old mine’s best drives.  Some tools have been donated and a ‘jig’ for washing the ore is now needed.
