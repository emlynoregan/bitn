Burra Swimming Pool

The pool itself has practically been completed, but more cash is needed to complete the surroundings, dressing rooms, paddle pool etc.  The filling of the pool will begin tomorrow.  The earth surrounds are being settled and when this has been done the concrete will be laid and at the same time the foundations for the dressing sheds.  The pool has been surrounded by a 6 ft cyclone fence.  A toddlersâ€™ pool will be placed at the northern end and will be separately enclosed.  It will be approximately 12 inches deep.
