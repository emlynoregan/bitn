1889 begins with a large overdraft increased by accounts due and coupons due on 1 January to over £300.  With bonds of £300 to be redeemed there will be little left to spend on public works.

The Park Lands income has similarly fallen.

1886	£126-15-5

1887	£112-8-5

1888	£89-5-9, with a bond of £100 to be redeemed this year making a 2d rate essential.
