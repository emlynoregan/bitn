Burra Town Council.

The Registrar-General refuses to bring the cemetery under the RPA without an order first being obtained from the Supreme Court.  To avoid this expense the Council resolved to take a conveyance under the old system.

Tenders opened for lamp lighting in Kooringa.

R. Ockenden’s was accepted for 8/- per lamp per month.  (E.A. Moore’s tender was for 8/- per week.)

Footpath in front of Dr Sangster’s to be tar-dressed for a width of 6 feet.
