Burra Town Council, 21 May

The principal corners have been marked to show the 25ft from the corner.  Cr Riggs thought that more, especially at the north end of town, should be so marked.  The Inspector will investigate.

The Town Clerk is investigating people plying for hire with cars without a licence.

A draft letter drawn up by solicitors has been prepared to be sent to by-law breaking motorists who do not immediately make a subscription to Council funds.

The Superintendent of Railways says the road to the station has been repaired and a light will be installed at Railway Terrace.

The PMG is considering the withdrawal of the telephone at the Burra Railway Station.  The Mayor thought it should be reinstated.  The Town Clerk said it cost the Department Â£1 p.a. to collect the calls and the revenue did not amount to that much.
