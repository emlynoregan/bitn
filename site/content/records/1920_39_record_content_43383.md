Obituary.  Mr James Reed died suddenly of heart failure at his home in Aberdeen on Sunday 25 September aged 61.  He was the youngest son of the pioneer pastoralist Richard Reed who died in 1930 aged 93.  James Reed was born at ‘Wandillah’ on 15 August 1871 and was educated at Burra Public School and Prince Alfred College.  He was a staunch Methodist attending Redruth Wesleyan Church and Sunday School, becoming a teacher as a young man and was several times the Superintendent.  He took a great interest in the erection of the Memorial Sunday School in which he was the prime mover.  He was a generous supporter also of the Blind Institution and other charities.  In the Great War he was generous in all patriotic efforts and a most reliable helper when a car was needed meeting lads at the station.  While his health allowed he was a keen sport, especially football and was a member of the Burra Bowling Club.  He was an original member of the Burra Electric Supply Co. and a strong supporter of Burra Burra Show Inc.  He owned extensive sheep properties: Bendigo Station, part of Loch Winnoch and Wandillah and the handsome home in Aberdeen.  On 5 January 1898 he married Elizabeth C. Bentley, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs W. Bentley of Aberdeen and is survived by his widow, two daughters and three sons: Miss Clarice Reed, Mrs I.E. (Nell) Gare, Alick Reed, Ted Reed & Richard M. Reed.  There is one granddaughter.  Richard Reed of Aberdeen and John Reed of Gawler are brothers.  Mrs C. Bartholomaeus of Glenelg and Mrs W.H. Gare of Aberdeen are sisters.
