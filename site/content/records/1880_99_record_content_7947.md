The Burra Show was held on 22 September at the English and Australian Copper Co. grounds at Redruth.  It was an unqualified success despite the unseasonable weather.  The attendance was c. 2,000.  Sheep and poultry were the chief exhibits.  Cattle were slightly improved and horses were good.  Implements were better represented and two stump-jump ploughs were shown.  Mt T.H. Pearse of Hallett showed two traps.

Wool was of a superior class and wheat in ear was good, but in bags was down in quality.  Local vegetables were very poor and C. Oppermann was the only prizewinner.

In flowers Messrs Fuss and Packard showed ‘what may be done even in Burra’.

[H.C.W. Fuss, usually known as W. Fuss and D. Spencer Packard.]

Local fruit was shown for the first time with oranges, lemons and olives from Captain Killicoat.

The Burra Brass Band played.
