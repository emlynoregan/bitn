Burra Benevolent Society held its AGM on 17 August.  M. Riggs, Hon. Secretary, reported that there were 11 financial members, but only a small attendance at meetings.  This year the society lost its Chairman, Rev. C. Pitman and then his replacement Rev. E. Tregilgas, through removal from the district.  Arrangements were made for several families to collect goods to a specified value from a town store to make Christmas a happier occasion.  Wood was distributed to needy folk from trees felled by Council and wood merchants have also assisted.  Two wheelchairs are held by the Society â€“ one in use and one at the Hospital.
