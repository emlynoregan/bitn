The Burra Broadcaster is celebrating its 500th edition.

Our first edition* when we arrived in 1993 reported Adchem’s gold bullion production had passed the $1 million mark.  It had the Variety Club Dash Falcon of Craig Wissell, Richard Dollman, Andrew Nourse and Alan Jacka on the front.  Redbanks was featured the following week as the Department of the Environment sought to unload it.  In August the old Post Office was to be auctioned.  1995 was a big year – the sesquicentenary of the town.  After many years of writing Mary Woollacott ceased her highly valued contributions in 1997.  Helen Stockman has been editor for the last three years.

[* This refers of course to the first edition after Terry & Jill Wilson took over.  It was Issue 118 of 7 July 1993.]
