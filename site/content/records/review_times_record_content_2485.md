Burra Common Effluent Scheme

Five men have been working on the scheme since December and have generally impressed locals with their working habits and handling of equipment, even though most are new to the firm of Snowcrete Services and virtually learned on the job.  Mark Hoffmann (21) is the back hoe operator and has been digging trenches up to 11 feet deep.  His father, Eric Hoffmann of Tanunda owns the business and Mark has been with the firm for five years.  Peter Jones (19) of Gawler is the loader driver and has been with the firm for two years.  He forms the metal bed in trenches and backfills.  Rudy Sphere (22) is a newcomer and a truck driver.  Rick Thiele (18) of Blanchetown has been with them for twelve months.  He prepares the metal beds and lays the pipes.  David Wilkinson (35) is foreman with eight years with the company, and he does the line and level reading and fills in wherever needed.  The Public Health Department is represented by former local Maurice Woollacott.  The gang commenced work at the oxidation lagoon in the creek area below the cemetery and the project is due for completion in July.  There are 1,196 yards of trench with six inch pipes, 2,781 yards with four inch pipe and 706 yards of four inch connecting pipes to 131 properties.  There is then 2,062 yards of trench to take the pump line.  The gang has managed to work on a given section each day with minimum inconvenience to residents and traffic.  They have managed to avoid PMG cables and water pipes, except for one of the latter in Market Square.  The hardest digging was in Lewis Street in the Housing Trust area where jack hammers were needed.  There were hard sections in Commercial Street too, but the back hoe and ripper sufficed.
