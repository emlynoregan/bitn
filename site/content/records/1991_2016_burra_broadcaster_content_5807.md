Hallett Primary School Council has written a strongly worded letter to Rob Lucas, Minister of Education & Children’s Services, outlining the ‘lack of understanding and support shown by the Department and Members of Parliament’ during recent events surrounding the removal of the school bus service.  At the time the bus was one child short of the number required for retention and a simple rerouting would have given sufficient numbers to keep it going – the family in question was incorrectly located on Departmental maps, making them seem closer to the Burra Secondary School bus.  Now parents are being encouraged to remove children from Hallett because Burra’s secondary School buses are being made available to pick up Primary students.

[The article goes on to mention dissatisfaction with the headmaster and with the District Superintendent and the process of selecting a new headmaster.  The Council feared the school was being undermined so that it could be closed, despite reassurances that this was not so.]
