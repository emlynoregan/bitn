Some large local advertisements, but mainly notices of sales and activities and small classifieds.  Sometimes news begins late on page 2 and sometimes not till page 3.

Page 3

Sometimes page 2 advertisements continue, but the page is mostly news, which is frequently detailed and provides a good record of local activities.  Some advertisements.

Page 4

News and large advertisements in fluctuating proportions.  There is little ‘padding’ in 1925 and non-news items are not very common.

Supplements are common and appear more often than not.  Some are smaller than the rest of the paper, but often they are full size, though some are printed on one side only.

Beginning with XXXXVII, 39 of 7 October 1925 the size of the broadsheet increased becoming slightly higher and changing in width from 7 to 8 columns.

All in all the paper provides a good record of local activities, but with minimal editorial comment and not very obvious reasons for the attention to detail given to various stories or items.
