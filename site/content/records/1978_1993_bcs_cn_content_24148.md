Burra North Red Cross

The report is a little cryptic, but it would appear that at their AGM on 2 June the branch resolved to amalgamate with Burra Red Cross Branch and that an amalgamated AGM would be held on 7 July in the Burra Activities Centre.  In the meantime the Burra North Red Cross held a very successful trading table on Saturday 6 June and raised $324.  [The decision to end the separate branch at Burra North is also implied in the notice for the AGM in the issue of 21 May 1992.]
