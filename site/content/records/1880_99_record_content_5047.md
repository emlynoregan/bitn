The £400 grant really represented a Government repayment of £400 of ratepayers’ money which had been expended on completing the Government bridge in Kooringa (The Government vote having been inadequate.) and thus it could have been expended on Corporation streets, but was spent on the main road.  They had also spent an additional sum of £253 in Market St and £160 in Commercial St - both of which are main roads.  The maintenance allowed by the Board due to main roads was inadequate for them to do all that was required.
