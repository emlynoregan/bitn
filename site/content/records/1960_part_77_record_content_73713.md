Characteristics of the 1974 paper.

There was not a very comprehensive news coverage of Burra.  Sports get a reasonable coverage and reports from many societies’ AGMs are frequent, but anything actually written by the paper itself is sparse and often inadequate.  The reports on the two floods in Burra for the year are typical of this, being quite brief and lacking in detail.  Even the ‘Out & About’ column is less comprehensive than in earlier years.  There are many articles that act as ‘fillers’ and many items of general interest (particularly to primary producers), but also fillers giving hints to the handyman (on painting for instance).
