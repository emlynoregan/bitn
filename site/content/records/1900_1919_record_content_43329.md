Obituary & Inquest.

Cornelius Horrigan died 16 September at the Burra Hospital from a broken spine sustained in a railway accident on 1 September.

[Death registered as Cornelius Hoorigan 15 September Kooringa, residence Brompton aged 47.]

E.W. Crewes was coroner at the inquest.  Dr Steele gave evidence of the spinal injuries.

Michael Bolton, spiker, gave evidence that three section cars were travelling to the work site on 1 Sep.  He was on the second which was carrying 12 men when it ran into the first at about 4 m.p.h.  The third then ran into the second knocking their car into the first and forcing it off the tracks.  The deceased was thrown from the first car and found lying on the ballast.  He attributed the accident to wet rails and a stiff brake.  He denied any racing or speeding.  He thought 12 men too many for the car.  The stiffness of the brake had not been reported.

John Ross, labourer gave similar evidence.

Daniel Ryan had been working the rear handle of the first car and the deceased the front handle.  Ryan was also thrown off and somewhat hurt.  He saw Horrigan dragged along under the car.

Francis Butler was on the second car and gave supporting evidence.

E.S.J. Clark, foreman, said he had reduced the numbers riding on cars from 14-16 to 12.  There was no rule.  [Ten cars had left Hallett that morning.]

Verdict was accidental death.
