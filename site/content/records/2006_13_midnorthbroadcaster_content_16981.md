We would certainly appreciate any photographs of the personnel on the list.  Any photographs would be scanned and the originals returned promptly.  A more frustrating problem has been our inability to identify all the people on the roll.  In a few cases we think we know who the person is, but have been unable to find the service records.  More commonly we have simply been unable to put a name to the initials.  Sometimes there are several persons with the same initials and the records carry no information that would enable us to make a choice. In a few instances we think the person concerned enlisted overseas and the records are not readily available.  If you can help with any aspect of this project it would be greatly appreciated.

We have been unable to identify the following people in service records:

Brown, H. (Herbert Henry?)	Clarke, W. (Mt Bryan East?)	Colbert, T.J.

Collins, C.	Collins, H. (Leighton area?)	Doherty, P.

Dolan, J.	Falkner, J. (Nurse) (Faulkner?)	Fricker, W.

Hartley, W.H. 	Hayes, R. (Not Robert.  Ross?) 	Hogan, N.J. (Leighton area?)

James, J. (World’s End area?)	Johnson, F.G.	King, H.R. (Black Springs area?)

Lacey, F.	Lee, H.J.	Lee, J.J.

Lilley, A.	Lowe, B. (Not B.C.Lowe)	Mason, E.

McMahon, J.F. (or F.J.?)	O’Grady, S.	Pavy, A.
