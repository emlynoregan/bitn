‘Erratic Correspondent’ writes on:

General Booth and the poor in England.

Business ethics [which the writer would have regarded as an oxymoron, though he didn’t use that term.]

‘Sweating’ in the production of religious publications.

One law for the rich and another for the poor.

Christianity and death.
