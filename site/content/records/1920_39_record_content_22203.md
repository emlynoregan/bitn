Visit of the Premier

The Premier Mr L.L. Hill was met at the station last Friday and then entertained at lunch at the Burra Hotel by the Mayor.  In the afternoon the party visited the school where at the High School the Premier said they would be spending £800 to remodel it by putting in larger windows and new floors.  The party then visited the Burra Hospital where they were met by the Chairman of the Board Mr W.G. Hawkes, before going on to see Mr R.D. Pascoe’s wonderful collection of sheep photographs.  In the evening there was a civic reception at the Institute with a fair attendance.

The Premier spoke at some length on the Federal Disabilities Commission which was looking into the financial disabilities the states had suffered under Federation.  [Over ½ column.]

He also spoke at length on the Government’s plans for further land settlement in Counties Hamley, Young, Robe and McDonnell and on the need for drainage to open up land in the South East.  He spoke too of cutting up various large estates for closer settlement (Mortlock’s, Duncan’s & Angas’s), though the Legislative Council had prevented compulsory acquisition.  He spoke of the role of the State Bank and other ways his Government had aided the man on the land.

The Members for the District also spoke.
