Burra Town Council

The Hon. John Lewis writes saying he is only responsible for Paxton Square rates from 9 June 1915.  The Town Clerk replied pointing out that the Council had only been trustees and all the rents paid had gone to him and thus he was responsible for the rates.

Lady Galway writes seeking Council help in making French Flag Day a success on 16 September.  A public meeting has been called for next Thursday.

The Wattle Day League has written seeking Council help in making future Wattle Days a success.  Left in the Mayor’s hands.

The garden in Ludgvan St is to be prepared for planting.

Council is to write a letter saying it cannot see its way clear to provide £600 for half the cost of the bridges, but asking instead for a special grant of £600 for which it would undertake to erect the bridges – the letter to be supported by a delegation.
