OSHC Burra has received a cheque for $1,500 from the National Bank’s Community Grants Program.  Burra Community School Principal Tony Maio said the grant was very welcome and helped to stabilise a desperate situation.  The four week review has been concluded with the result that it has been decided the Burra OSHC will remain open with an update of changes resulting from the review.  These recommendations have been ratified by the Governing Council and will apply to the Vacation Care and the after hours care in term four.
