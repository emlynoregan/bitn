Father John Morley was born in 1924 and lived with his family on a small orchard and vineyard at Williamstown.  The family moved to Adelaide in the 1930s and John attended Urrbrae Agricultural HS and Pulteney Grammar School.  After school he went jackerooing for Mr Chris Wade on Thistle Island for a year, before working for Sir Philip McBride on Conmurray Station in the South East.  He joined the RAAF as air crew in 1942 and was commissioned in 1943, eventually becoming Radar Leader for 102 Squadron, flying in Liberators.  After discharge he returned to Conmurray for a time and in 1946 bought a virgin property on the Avenue Range, which he named ‘Dingley’.   He developed 1,300 acres before selling it in 1957.  He ran 1,500 to 2,000 sheep and Aberdeen Angus cattle.  He studied for the ministry at St John’s College, Morpeth, from 1958 for three years.  He has been a keen sportsman, playing football and cricket for more than 20 years and now plays golf and a little tennis.  He used to show horses in the South East and also played polocrosse.  He is married with three children and three grandsons.  His son, John, is married and works at G.H. Michell & Sons.  Rosemary is married and Susan is still at school at Woodlands, doing matriculation this year.
