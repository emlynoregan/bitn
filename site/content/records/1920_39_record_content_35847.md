Frank Treloar was given a farewell at the offices of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. on Monday afternoon with Mr A.G. Gebhardt presiding.  Mr Gebhardt was representing the Burra Burra Sports Syndicate from which Mr Treloar was resigning as secretary as he was leaving Burra due to the ill health of his wife.  Mr Treloar had been secretary since the Syndicate’s inception in 1908.  Three of the original members had died (Hon. J. Lewis, J.H. Gallagher & W.P. Barker).  The grounds owned by the Syndicate were ideal and had been well cared for by Mr Treloar.  At the time they were bought there had been great interest in all classes of sport, but that had long since deteriorated.  The show had been held there for some years.  Sir John Melrose had paid for the removal of sheep pens from Victoria Park to the Aberdeen grounds.  J.R. Barker supported Mr Gebhardt’s remarks about how much Mr Treloar would be missed and Messrs W.H. Sandland & L.M. Gordon added their voices.  The Chairman then handed over a cheque in appreciation.
