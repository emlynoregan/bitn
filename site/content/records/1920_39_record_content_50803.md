There was another building known as the Independent Church across the road from the south side of Paxton Square.  This was long unused, but served for a while as a Presbyterian Church under Rev. W. Davidson.  The discovery of copper at Moonta and Wallaroo caused the migration of many from Burra and all three Methodist Churches were weakened and attendance fell further when the mine closed.  Ultimately all three combined in the Methodist Union [1900].
