Apoinga Gold Mine.  T. Geach (manager) reports the shaft is at 70ft.

The lode increased from 2’ to 3’6” and eventually to 4’7”.  From time to time some nice little noodles of gold have been found.  Other ore bodies run parallel to the present lode.  At 100’ driving on the course of the lode north and south will be undertaken with crosscut east and west to intersect with the parallel lodes.  The lode is black and red ironstone impregnated with yellow quartz of the honeycomb variety.
