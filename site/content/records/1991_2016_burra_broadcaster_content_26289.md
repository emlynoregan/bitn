Robertstown Celebrates the Centenary of Federation

There was a Saturday night screening at 7 p.m. of a free film at Peace Hall, funded by the International Year of the Volunteer, featuring the film Cats and Dogs – followed by a sumptuous supper.  The film Moulin Rouge concluded the evening.

Sunday began with an ecumenical church service led by Pastor James Janetski (Lutheran) and Rev. Tony Chapman (Uniting).  Later silhouettes of an old locomotive and tender of a type seen on the Robertstown line 80 years ago and of a German wagon were unveiled by Hazel Mosey and Nell Nuske.  Goyder Council Chairman Denis Keller unveiled the plaque and wall tiles, which were a project of Robertstown Primary School.  This gateway makes an attractive entrance to the planned Centenary Gardens in which ‘Goyder’s Line’ will run down the middle, separating plants typical of the outside country from those of the higher rainfall areas.
