Obituary.  Anna Elsie Voumard died at her daughter’s residence on 2 April aged 92.  She is survived by 3 sons and 2 daughters: R., A. & W. Voumard and Mrs A. Hirschausen (Burra) & Mrs B.J. Taylor (Adelaide).  There are 21 grandchildren & 8 great-grandchildren.  [Born Anna Elsie Guerrion 27 August 1843 died Anna Elise Voumard 2 April 1935, Marleston, but in the children’s births in SA she appears also as Annie Elsie and Anna Eliza and the surname as Guerrin, Guerrion and Gunnen: the last probably due to bad hand writing.  In one case Voumead also appears.  The longer obituary offers yet another option.]

Mrs Hannah E. Voumard, relict of the late John Voumard of Burra, died 2 April in Adelaide in her 92nd year at the home of her daughter Mrs B.J. Taylor.  With her husband and five children she came to SA from Switzerland in 1876 in the ship Forfarshire and after a few weeks at Pt Adelaide they made their home in Burra.  Mrs Voumard was essentially a home woman and very highly esteemed.  Until the last fortnight of her life she maintained a wonderful vitality, though slightly deaf.  She is survived by her sons Robert, Amos & William (Kooringa) and daughters Hannah, Mrs A. Hirschausen (Aberdeen) and Marie, Mrs B.J. Taylor (Adelaide) with 21 grandchildren and a number of great grandchildren.
