Geoff Buyrn of Mt Bryan CFS was responding to a fire in November 2006 when the truck he was driving rolled over on a steep hillside and as a result Mr Buyrn was left a quadriplegic. He had been a dedicated fire fighter for sixteen years.  An appeal has been launched as a measure of repayment for these years of service.
