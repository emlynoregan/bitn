Burra Town Council, 19 June

The bridge near J. Parks’ has been repaired.

M.W. Bednall wrote enclosing a copy of Section 39 Redruth and asking the Council to publish in the Government Gazette a notice of a road that had been used for more than ten years – to be called Fuller Street.  The proclamation will be published.

J.O. Denton of Farrell Flat submits a quote for a reconditioned Ford V-8 engine at £85 plus the cost of a carburettor, pump and distributor if required.  (A new engine would cost £299.)

A reconditioned engine is to be installed.

A motion to have a bus shelter erected at the railway crossing at Burra North was deferred until the new Council meets.
