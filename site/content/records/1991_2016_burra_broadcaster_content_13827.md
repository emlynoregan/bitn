Credit Union

Public meetings at Burra & Eudunda last week called for a working party to report back on the feasibility of a credit union and to outline the options.  More than 70 people attended in Burra and 35 in Eudunda.  Two representatives of Credit Care addressed the meeting in Burra.  Credit Care advises communities interested in setting up a credit union.  The representatives said banks had made a commercial decision to withdraw from rural Australia to maximise profits for shareholders.  Credit unionsâ€™ responsibility was to their members and so channel their profits into better service and social programs.  Typically credit unions only allow 10% of loans for commercial services and so no one has lost money in credit unions in the last 25 years.  Credit unions can issue their own cheques.  [Photo.]
