Mr Essington Lewis visited Burra on Monday evening 18 December [sic: for September] and handed over to the town two historical pictures of the town painted in 1843.*  Unfortunately only three private citizens joined the Mayor, Councillors & Town Clerk for the ceremony.  [Mr & Mrs A.B. Riggs & Mr H.J.B. Jennison.)  Mr E.J. Davey, Town Clerk, said he himself could remember a time when he was chased by blacks in this locality.  He also said he would not be carrying on for much longer as Town Clerk.  Mr Riggs was disappointed that more people were not present and Mr Jennison thought it a disgrace.  The Council now owns three pictures painted by the same artist.  [S.T. Gill.] [*Obviously the date 1843 is an error, since the copper deposit at Burra was not found till 1845.]
