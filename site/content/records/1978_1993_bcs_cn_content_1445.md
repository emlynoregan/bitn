Burra Conservation Study.  Part 2 has seven sections.

Section I deals with the approach the authors are going to take.

Section II describes social and economic influences on Burra including location, population, employment, economy, facilities, community attitudes, etc.

Section III includes a heading Townscape

The architectural character of Burra is particularly diverse.  There are contrasts of large and small, humble and affluent, timber and stone.

An early dugout phase was followed by simple Cornish cottages with straightforward hip roofs and chimneys, sited directly on the footpath with a central doorway and a room either side.  Houses often stepped down the contours, which has provided interest and variety in many streets.  Verandahs were an Australian feature added later, as in Paxton Square, to moderate the harshness of the climate.
