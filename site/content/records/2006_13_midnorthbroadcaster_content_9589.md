Burra Regional Art Gallery had a good attendance for the opening of the Germein Art Focus exhibition last Friday evening.  The exhibition was officially opened by Kirstie Jamieson, arts officer and director of the Port Pirie Regional Gallery of the Mid North and Southern Flinders.  The gallery is also hosting two other exhibitions by local artists: the ‘Terowie Terrors’ and ‘My Story’.  Susan Johns opened the former and Heather Parker introduced the latter.
