Mongolata Goldfield

Prospects continue to be good with some nice parcels of ore discovered.

A whole heap of statistics are printed showing yield is quite high and the average per ton as higher than at Tarcoola or the Barossa Fields, with only Birdwood showing as rich.

A table of all parcels treated at Peterborough is given showing the weight of ore, bullion recovered and yield per ton of ore from the discovery of the field to 10 October 1931.

[The yield per ton is often very good â€“ the main drawback seems to have been the very narrow lodes being followed.]
