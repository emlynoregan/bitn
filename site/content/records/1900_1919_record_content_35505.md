Redruth Court, Wednesday 3 September.

Goodridge v. Roach in a claim for the value of a horse killed in a recent accident in Commercial Road, Kooringa.  [This would seem to be the accident reported in XX, 1049, 2 July 1913, page 2, in which case it was near St Mary’s in Market St and not Commercial Rd.]

The verdict was for the plaintiff for £7 value plus £2 removal costs plus court costs.
