2nd Leader on The Institute.  He is greatly in favour of it and praises the efforts resulting in the new era of success from 1875.  The main building included a hall, a large entrance and four other rooms.  Since the new order [1875] it had also been enclosed with a stone wall and ornamental railings.  A cottage has been erected for the librarian and a large room for Masonic and other lodges has been built.  Two rooms have been provided in what was the entrance hall - one entirely fitted with shelves for the library and the grounds have been planted.
