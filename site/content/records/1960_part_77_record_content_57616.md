Burra Burra DC has kept its rate unchanged despite rising costs because of the difficult state of primary industries at the moment.  The collection of rates this year has also proved difficult.  The Council presently employs 19 men on outside work plus some owner-driver contractors on roadwork funded by Government grants.  Council work has reached a high level of efficiency.  [There is then a lengthy analysis of income and expenditure giving figures.]
