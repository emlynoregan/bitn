W.H. Hardy, candidate for North Ward, said he was getting old and not as lively as he used to be.  He was concerned with the Waterworks and thought the present plant of little or no use.  He believed that a move to Jilbert’s Well on the opposite side of the creek and still pumping to the present reservoir would serve and cost about £250.  It would be better in Council hands rather than with the Government.  He favoured spending money on trees and in beautifying the parklands, including Victoria Park.

Cr Cox moved that ‘it was desirable to hand over the Waterworks to the government’. He was 2nd by Cr Pederson.

Mr Jenkin spoke against.

Mr Hardy moved ‘the matter be allowed to stand over for the new Council to deal with’ and was 2nd Mr Jenkin.

[The report is not very clear about what happened next, but it seems that Hardy’s amendment was lost and the Cox motion carried, which then allowed the question to be put to the ratepayers at the municipal election on 1 December.]
