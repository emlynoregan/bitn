Mongolata Goldfield Water Supply

We are disgusted to find how inadequate the water there is.  About 12 months ago the Government sank a catchment which we believe to be a white elephant and a veritable flood will be needed to put any depth of water in it.  But however much water it gets the quality is of doubtful standard for human consumption.  The huge tank is lined with tar and the catchment itself is rubberoid.  The taste is better imagined than described.  It is a yellowy-black colour and unfit for drinking.  Men had arranged for water to be brought out from Burra.  The whole thing is a disgrace.  Had the Government installed a supply similar to that for the Burra Electric Supply Co. an adequate supply would have been obtained.

[Burra Electric Supply had underground tanks fed from the run-off from a corrugated iron surface laid on the ground.]
