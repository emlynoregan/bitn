The Marrabel-Cockburn Road is now in such a poor condition that travellers are finding different routes where possible, to the detriment of towns en route, especially Burra and Terowie.  Potholes, corrugations and dust are causes for the complaints.  People are by-passing Burra to get to Peterborough.  This is a main road and should be bituminised.
