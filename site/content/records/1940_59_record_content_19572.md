The Town Clerk’s Resignation

This was discussed at the Council meeting on 20 November.  The Mayor said that as the Council did not have a superannuation scheme he would suggest the Town Clerk be given three months’ full pay in token of his work for the Council.  A similar thing had been done when Mr Rosewall resigned as Overseer after many years with the Council.

Cr Kellaway asked if the Town Clerk could carry on till the end of the financial year, as it would save the Council about 15 guineas in auditors’ fees, as they would have to come when he resigned as well as at the end of the financial year.  Mr Davey said he would try to do so.

The Town Clerk’s resignation was accepted with regret from the end of June 1945.
