Burra-Morgan Motor Rally.  Dozens of veteran, vintage and classic vehicles made the trip from Burra to Morgan last Sunday in a re-enactment of the 1906 event.  Goyder Council CEO John Brak flagged off the drivers from Paxton Square.  This was the third re-enactment, which has become a two-yearly event.
