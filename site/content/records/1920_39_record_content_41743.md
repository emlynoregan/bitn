Obituary.  William Jones Thomas aged 86 died 23 April at his residence in Railway Terrace Aberdeen.  He was born in Liscard Cornwall 26 October 1845 and migrated with his parents Mr & Mrs John Thomas and three brothers and three sister in the Storm Cloud in 1859*.  His father was engaged by the English Copper Co.  Their first home was in a dugout in the Burra Creek.  The father was accidentally killed in 1857* and the family moved to Copperhouse where the eldest son tried to take his place.  William worked at the Burra Mine for 1/- a day – double what he had received in Cornwall and it rose later to 3/- a day.  When the mine closed Mr Thomas took up bullock-driving and carting before buying land in the Mt Bryan District and becoming a farmer and grazier.  The property known as ‘Hildrop’ is still owned by a son, Mr Edlie Thomas.  The deceased was for many years a Councillor for the Mt Bryan DC.  He was interested in politics and a supporter of football and cricket.  He was a staunch supporter of the Rechabite Lodge for 63 years.  He was a good story-teller of the early days and had a keen sense of humour.  He was fit and alert until the final short illness.  He married Miss Joanna Thomas, sister of the late Josiah Thomas of ‘Three Trees’ who died some time ago.  He is survived by three sons and a daughter: William Jones Thomas (Aberdeen), Joseph Thomas (Willalo), E. [Edlie] Thomas of Mt Bryan & Miss M.A. Thomas (Aberdeen).  There are 9 grandchildren & 2 great-grandchildren.

[* Obviously a man who migrated in 1859 cannot have died accidentally or otherwise in 1857.  Of the many men called John Thomas the most promising candidate seems to be one who died at Copperhouse 10 September 1862 aged 43.  BISA says 22 July 1862, but this is not on the deaths CD.  BISA also suggests an 1858 arrival.]
