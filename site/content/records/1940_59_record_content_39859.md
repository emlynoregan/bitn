Miss Daisy Kennedy, one of the world’s leading violinists, was interviewed last week on radio and when asked where she was born, Miss Kennedy replied that she had been born in Burra Burra in SA.  Miss Kennedy, whose father was Headmaster of Burra School was born in the house now occupied by Mr & Mrs F.T. Marston.

[Note.  This information is incorrect.  The house in Kangaroo Street was not ready for the family when they arrived early in 1893 and Daisy Fowler Kennedy was actually born at the Commercial Hotel on 16 January 1893.]
