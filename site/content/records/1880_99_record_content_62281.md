Court.

Five women were charged with riotous behaviour in Kingston St 2 May: Agnes Gully, Mabel Bradley, Annie Ah Chin (Married), Crissie Smith and Selina Smith.  (Smith and Gully are local, Bradley has been recently released from Adelaide Reformatory School and has since conducted herself satisfactorily – nothing is known of Ah Chin.)  Ah Chin and Gully pleaded guilty and the others not.

Witness Richard Moore saw the fracas – saw Bradley hit Gully and heard Gully use disgusting language.  About 30 people were present.  Did not see the Smiths take an active part.  The bench ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict.  Gully and Chin were fined £1-1-0 including costs.

Agnes Gully was also charged with using abusive language.  The language was written down and handed to Gully who admitted ‘without a blush’ to having used it.  The document was handed to the Bench.  The constable demanded a gaol sentence rather than a fine.  Defendant said the others had used equally bad language.  The Bench replied that that did not make her case any better.  Fined £2-10-0.  Gully (aged 18) was given a week to pay.
