Burra Town Council, 3 April

The Local Government Department reports the reconstruction of Cave’s Bridge [i.e. the bridge on the eastern approaches to Redruth at Snake Gully.]

The request of K.F. Hall for a prohibited parking area outside his shop was rejected.

The SA Housing Trust requests a reply to certain housing questions as soon as possible.

Crs Harvey, Bevan & Fisher were nominated for the Burra High School Council.

It was noted that nothing had been done to make the old mill safe.

Rev. S.J. Martin will continue in the Kooringa Methodist Circuit for another year.

Weather. Some patchy light falls were recorded over Easter.  The best falls were in a strip from World’s End to ‘The Gums’.  Studholme registered 80 points and there were good falls at Chalk Cliffs and Thistlebeds.  Other falls were generally below 25 points.  Burra received 29.

Rev. Brook was farewelled from Mt Bryan East on Saturday 1 April.
