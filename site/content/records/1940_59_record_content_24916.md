Electricity.  Eudunda Dc has been at loggerheads with the Mid North Electricity Co. of Clare over costs and tried to get the Adelaide Electric Supply Co. to take over, but it could not do so.  The Government has forced the parties to agree on a twelve month contract under National Security regulations.

The Government said it expected to take over the supply of electricity throughout the state within twelve months and it is expected a big generating plant will be erected at Pt Pirie using Leigh Creek coal.  It is expected power prices would then fall.
