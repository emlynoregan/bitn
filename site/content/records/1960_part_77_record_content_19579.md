Burra High School Parents & Friends’ Association AGM elected: President, Mrs A. Benger; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames D. Thomas & A. Williams; Secretary, Mrs G. Lomman; Assistant Secretary, Mrs D. Field and Treasurer, Mrs W. Brook.  About 50 people attended.

The main project for this year is a dressing shed for the girls.

Attendance at meetings for 1963 averaged 33 from 52 members.  [These are from the President’s report.  The Secretary’s comments suggest an average attendance of 25.]

In the year £335 was given to improve the old tennis courts and surroundings.  The Ball raised £87-11-4.  With the increasing number of High School students it has been necessary to limit the Christmas Banquet to staff, students and the President of the High School Council and it was decided to dispense with the services of a guest speaker, so making the event somewhat less formal.  Sporting equipment was purchased throughout the year for the school.
