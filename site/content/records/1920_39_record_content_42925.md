To the east the falls have been disappointing with a few places around 1 inch, but others in the 20-50 points range.  Last Sunday morning some snow fell very early and there was a nice fall about 7 a.m.  There were heavier falls at ‘Blink Bonnie’ and at Mt Bryan with light falls at Leighton and Hanson.
