The Sod Hut Hotel.

The story of how it got its name may be apocryphal, but it is outlined.  In the early days teamsters heading south would fill up with grog at the Old Burra Hotel and then with difficulty navigate the 8 miles south along the road.  The builder of the Sod Hut Hotel thought 8 miles about as far as they could go without a refresher.  On arriving the teamster had one drink and then another ‘until he became very wet inside then got soddened’, so came the name came from this.

The description of the ruins in 1905 is of a building then still almost intact.  The lamppost and frame of the lamp itself with its hanging door rusty and rotten.  Nearly all the windows were broken except for a few panes in the front window.  Floors and ceilings were gone ‘but the roof is entact [sic] and keeps the interior of the building dry, which is a great inconvenience for travellers who are in need of a rest from the weather.’  [This presumably should have been a great ‘convenience’.]  There were several good flags on the verandah floor and half the verandah was still standing, though in an extremely shattered condition.  The bridle post with its ring was intact.  The front doors resembled those of a large barn and were closed.  ‘The size and make of them gives one the impression that those who patronised the hotel needed plenty of room to get in and out.  ‘Many of the rooms have been turned into something different to that which they were used for in the olden times.'
