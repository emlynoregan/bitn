Ernest W. Crewes writes re early closing day.  Some people favour Wednesday, as at present, others want the businesses to close at 1 p.m. Saturday and remain open till 9 p.m. on Fridays in lieu.  He personally is of this view.  Since other towns do this most sport is now played on Saturdays.  He calls a meeting of storekeepers for Thursday at 7.30 p.m. and asks all businessmen from Aberdeen and Redruth to attend as well, to make the Saturday half-holiday general.
