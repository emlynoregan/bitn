Mongolata

Rev. Donald Redding went out on Wednesday last with c. 20 members of St Mary’s Choir and held a full choral service in which Christmas carols replaced the usual hymns.

Bowls.  Despite grasshoppers being thick enough to shovel from the greens on some days last week, their numbers were low enough on Thursday night to allow play.  On Saturday too play was possible, but grasshoppers had to be frequently wiped from bowls.  The greens are now brown.

Aberdeen Croquet Club had visitors from Mintaro on 11 December and the home team won by 26.

On 12 December a Burra team visited and this time the home team won by 10 points.
