Football.  The Association met on Thursday to take up the Farrell’s Flat protest again.  Farrell’s Flat contended it should have won as rule 27 says no player shall play for more than one club in the association.  Aberdeen contended that clause 6 defined Associated Clubs as clubs for the time being that were members of the Association and Williams had played for the Yakilowie Association.  Mr Sampson of Farrell’s Flat then countered with clause 4: that a Burra Association member could not play with an outside Association and then with his own club without a clearance.  Then as Mr Sampson raised procedural matters, Mr Willshire for Aberdeen challenged the credentials of the Mt Bryan delegates and the meeting adjourned without a resolution.  The meeting resumed on Friday.  Mr Willshire produced legal opinion supporting Aberdeen, but the meeting awarded the match to Farrell’s Flat by 5 votes to 3.  Mr Willshire threatened legal action.
