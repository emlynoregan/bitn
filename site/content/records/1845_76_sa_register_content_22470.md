Obituary.  It will be recalled that not long ago the unidentified body of a man was found at the bottom of an abandoned Bon Accord Mine Shaft.  Mr Burns of North Adelaide has now identified the pocket-knife found with the deceased as being his son’s.  Mr Burns had a son in the neighbourhood and has heard nothing of him.  A person named Burns was at Burra Hotel just before shearing time and sent his swag on ahead with mates, saying he would follow in the evening.  He has not been seen since – though his mates seem to have made no effort to discover his whereabouts.  [See reports 11 September 1868, page 2 & 18 September 1868, page 2.]
