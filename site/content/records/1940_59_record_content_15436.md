The Red Cross Drive ended last Wednesday.

A final great sports day had been organised at Burra Showground with a list of Children’s Events, Novelty Events, Adult Events, Horses in Action and an Auction Sale.  The weather was unfortunate with a howling gale and occasional showers.  Despite this attendance was excellent, but many more would have come from the district in good weather.  Entries were also reduced as a result.  There was also a flower show and cookery exhibits.  The report extends to page 4, running to 4¾ columns.  Results of the events and exhibits are printed.  The total raised by the five sections was £1,250 with some amounts still to come.
