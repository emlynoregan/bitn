Messrs Milton Tiddy & T.W. Charlesworth were farewelled by the Kooringa Methodist Choir last Sunday.  Mr Tiddy had been a member for 17 years.  He was presented with a wallet of notes, contributions to which had also come from Redruth Church members, as Mr Tiddy had been a member of the Redruth Choir for a number of years.  Mr Charlesworth was presented with a copy of the new Methodist hymn and tune book.

Master Ian Charlesworth was given a book as a farewell gift from the Sunday school.
