Mrs M. Woodgate, late of Terowie and now residing at Prospect, celebrated her 92nd birthday on January 24. She is the mother of Mr B.H. & Ashley Woodgate of Booborowie and was born at Copperhouse in 1850.

[Birth registrations show she was born Maria Duneman (sometimes Dunemann) 24 January 1851 and so should have celebrated her 91st birthday.  See also 63, 8, 24 February 1942, page 3 for her obituary.]
