W.H. Hardy, who has represented the ratepayers as Councillor in both the East and North Wards for nearly ten years, has been approached to fill a vacancy in East Ward caused by the resignation of Mr Henry Walker who has left the district.  He has had to decline as he expects to be absent from the town for some time.
