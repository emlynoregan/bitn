Accident.  Mr Jaffrey was thrown from a trap near the railway crossing and dislocated a thigh.  The horses bolted.  Someone tried to stop them near the Bon Accord, but they ran onto a bank and threw all the occupants out:  Mrs Jaffrey, another lady and two children - all of whom fortunately escaped with a shaking.
