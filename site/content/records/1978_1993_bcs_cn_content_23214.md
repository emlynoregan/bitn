National Bank changes in personnel.

Gary & Julie Phillips and their two children moved to Murray Bridge recently and the present manager, Brian Kupke, with his wife and daughter Paula will soon move to Port Pirie.

The new manager will be John Teague, who began his working life at the Burra branch after leaving school.

John Brak is the Acting District Clerk pending the arrival of Stephen Kerrigan early in November.
