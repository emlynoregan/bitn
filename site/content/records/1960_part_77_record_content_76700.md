Burra Tourist Promotion Committee Annual Meeting

The meeting failed either to elect a new Chairman or to find a new Secretary.  Messrs Jennison and Scott have retired after fine service.  A further effort to replace them will be made on 18 November.

R. Jennison reported on the year.

The Copper festival in 1974 contributed about $2,500 to the committeeâ€™s finances.  We contributed $500 to the Welcome to Burra sign at the southern entrance to Burra and I hope you are gratified with the result.  Areas needing future attention are to increase the caravan accommodation and facilities and the development of the area around the Burra Creek Lake.  The finances of the committee are a healthy $4,988.85.  Other projects considered were the floodlighting of Johnny Green and additional facilities at the War Memorial Oval.

[The report included the usual thanks to those who had contributed.]
