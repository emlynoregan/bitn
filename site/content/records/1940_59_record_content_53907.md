Burra Town Council, 18 February

Advice was received that the PMG will acquire a portion of Howard St with settlement in approximately two months.

ETSA advises it cannot take over the Burra Electric Supply Co. for some time and suggests that the latter’s franchise be extended for five to seven years.

A letter will be written to G.S. Hawker MP to see if ETSA’s takeover of the town’s electricity supply can be expedited.

A letter will be sent to the Education Department about the unsafe playing surface at the Burra School.
