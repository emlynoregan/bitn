Burra Town Council, 16 November

Burra Progress Assoc. sought better lighting in Market Square â€“ fluid or gas light.

The light on the Keep Left Sign was frequently not switched on at night.

It was decided that present finances did not allow improvements.

Burra Progress Assoc. sought the co-operation to:

Enlarge the playground area to the swing bridge.

Erect signs at the playground to keep out cars and caravans.

Erect signs and pass a by-law limiting users to children under the age of 14.

Effect road closures in Market Square and have extra lighting for the Christmas Pageant.

Council will inspect the site before deciding on any enlargement of the playground.

Council agreed to the closure of the Square for the Pageant.

The Town Clerk will table the necessary information about a by-law to limit the use of the playground to those under 14.

E. Wall was permitted to erect a four-roomed house in West St.

With respect to the resignation received from Cr Fisher the move was not accepted.

[Cr Fisher attended this meeting of Council.]
