To Clare & Back (Concluded)

[The writer spends some time outlining the site of Clare, explaining how it is hemmed in by hills and so has one long main street that is flat and then side streets ingeniously arranged in a pattern dictated by the topography.]

Clare has a population of over 1,000 souls.

[The writer then takes many centimetres of column to say that the ‘Town Hall’ is an ugly monstrosity.  Before making passing references to the English, Scottish & Australian Bank, a large hotel, a court house, a police station, a post office and an assortment of drapers, grocers and saddlers.  He then got to the entrance to the domain of ‘the father, founder and universal friend of all and every in this his neighbourhood, and who was scarcely less well known and as much respected even in the busier scenes of Adelaide’.  This convoluted style, studiously avoiding naming George Charles Hawker, is typical of the whole piece.  The next section lists the local churches.]

There is a pretty little Episcopal Church, a Presbyterian Church anything but pretty, creditable Wesleyan and Roman Catholic Churches.  An Institute building is nearly completed providing a library, reading rooms, lecture hall and lodge room of fair size.  A school house was designed some ten years ago and begun two years ago.  It awaits a sum of about £150 to clear it of debt so it can be handed over to the Corporation for use.  At the southern end of the town and half way up a gully or indentation in the range there is a mansion with a glorious view and around which are orangeries and vineyards.  Its owner is one of SA’s self-made sons who has made a handsome competence in pastoral pursuits and chooses not to leave the colony, but to live and spend his wealth in it.

[The writer continues for many column centimetres on his homeward journey without saying anything of interest.]
