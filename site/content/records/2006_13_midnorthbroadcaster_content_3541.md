Burra RSL has been granted nearly $4,000 to clean up the Burra War Memorial.  It will be sprayed with a granite cleaning acid and then washed with high pressure water and have its joints re-pointed.   The bronze work will not be re-polished because it would soon revert to its former state, said Mr Kotz of Burra.  The work will be done by a Mr Wilson from Geelong.
