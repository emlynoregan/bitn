Accident.  A truck rolled over on the notorious and unnecessary S-bend just north of Mt Bryan on Thursday 22 March.  The driver suffered serious injury to one ear.  This follows a roll-over at the same spot on 27 February.  The S-bend was created for the railway, which was removed in about 1992.  There are no plans to remove it.  The straightening of this section of road is estimated to cost up to $1 million.  [Photo.]
