Burraite writes on Paxton Square.  Following your recent article on Paxton Square a visit to two of the modernised renovated cottages was certainly an eye-opener.  Each has a new bathroom with electric hot water system, shower, new toilet connected to a new septic system and the quite large rooms are in excellent condition.  These flats will enable an aged pensioner couple to enjoy good living conditions as a low rental in a solid, well insulated building, cool in summer and warm in winter.  Much credit goes to Mr Stan Woollacott for getting maximum results at minimum cost.  As Paxton Square is now an Historic Reserve, the buildings cannot be pulled down, so unless an effort is made to restore them to habitable conditions, they will deteriorate into unsightly ruins.  â€˜Please Burraites show your pride in your town as it is today, and also in its unique history as an early mining town, as evidenced by its many fine old buildings.
