Mice.  Present indications are for a repetition of last yearâ€™s plague numbers of mice.  They have already appeared in large numbers.  One farmer spread out half a bushel of poisoned grain and killed 350 in a few hours. They are eating the wheat that has been sown and are destroying stacked bags so that some stacks are having to be re-bagged.   Haystacks are being made unfit for stock.
