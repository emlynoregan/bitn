John Collins & Sons, Collinsville, held an Inspection Day at Stud Park on 9 April.  Last yearâ€™s inspection was cancelled due to the ill health of Mr A.L. Collins, Stud Master.  This year c. 80 men assembled to see the rams.  There were 86 rams altogether and the whole quality was more even and of a higher standard than ever before.
