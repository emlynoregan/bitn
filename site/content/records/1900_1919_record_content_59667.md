John Paull, former Burra Mine captain celebrated his 90th birthday on 3 April.  He was born at Copperhouse, Cornwall in 1829 and came to SA in the Calabar in 1853.  He worked at the Kapunda Mine and then the Burra Mine before taking land at Mongolata, but this failed through the drought and he became a Home Missionary for the Methodist Church in the circuits of Hanson, Strathalbyn and Callington, having long been a local preacher, class leader, office bearer and Sunday school superintendent.  Unable to make long journeys at last he settled at Wallaroo Mines in 1888 and continued there till he retired.  He has been blind for the last ten years, but is otherwise in good health.  Of his children the survivors are: Mrs James Wilson (Peterborough), Mrs J. Lomman (Unley), Miss C.L. Paull (Broken Hill) & Mrs F. Potter (Kadina).  There are 11 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild.
