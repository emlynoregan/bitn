Robberies in Burra

On Sunday night three Burra businesses were broken into and goods to total values of £800 were stolen.

Mr Ken Murphy’s Burra Gift Shop, J. Hill’s Burra Menswear Store and the Burra Motor Co. were all robbed.  From Mr Murphy’s the thieves took 20 wrist watches, 40 rings, brooches, necklets, pens and other items as well as razors and electric hair clippers and Pall Mall cigarettes.  About £200 worth of clothing was taken from Mr Hill’s shop and Burra motor Co. lost a small amount of change from the till.  The breakings were noticed by Mr R. Webb who was going for a daily paper at about 7.30 a.m. and by Mr M. Beinke.
