CoHousing

A model of Kooringaâ€™s proposed ecologically designed houses will be on display at the Civic Centre this Saturday 5 August.  Ian Millington of Kooringa CoHousing Co-op said this development is planned for five acres on Allen Street on the southern fringe of Burra.

Application for approval will go to Council within five weeks.  The proposal will put four houses on one acre, but instead of one per quarter acre block, they will cluster round a safe and pleasant central place with cars confined to the edge.  Each house is private and fully equipped except for a laundry.  A central building will provide a community dining room, laundry, office, library and playroom.  The idea is popular in Scandinavia, parts of Europe and USA.  The houses are to be ecologically designed and though members cannot own a house, they can invest in equity and have a lifetime security of tenure.
