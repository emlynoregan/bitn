A History of the Burra Record by Ian Auhl

The paper began on 30 June 1876 as the Northern Mail

Six months later it changed its name to the Burra News and Northern Mail.

In July 1878 its new editor, Frederick William Holder announced its new title would be the Record.

On 4 October 1878 the name changed again to the Burra Record.

It had taken a long time for Burra to get a local paper.  Compare its starting date with the Kapunda Herald (1864), the Kadina & Wallaroo Times (1865) and the Northern Argus (Clare, 1869).

Burra had to make do with printed handbills for advertising and a town crier.  Other local news was occasionally to be found in the Adelaide papers the Advertiser or the Register or the weekly Observer.

The first editor, Henry Pether, ascribed this lack to opposition to a paper from the SA Mining Association, which had also been against local government.

The first editor of the Burra Record was Frederick William Holder.  He had come to the town in 1875 as a bachelor to take charge of the Burra Public School.  He became an active member of the Burra Parliamentary Club and discussion in this club led to the proposal for a local paper.  A committee was formed to establish one.  The cost originally of 3d made it too expensive for many and kept its circulation low; 600 by the end of 1876.  Pether left in June 1878, soon after Jarman’s departure.  The Government school opened in January 1878, leaving Holder without a job.  When the editorship became available the committee of eight co-proprietors appointed Holder in his place.

In October 1878 Holder became the sole proprietor.

Under Holder the paper flourished.  He became Mayor of Burra in 1886 and again in 1888, having been elected to Parliament in 1887.  He was later Premier of SA on two occasions.

The paper has had three homes.  The first seems to have been on what is now the eastern corner of Bence’s store.

In September 1880 Holder announced they would move next door because the original office was about to be demolished to make room for two new shops to be built for Messrs Drew & Co.

Three years later on 6 January 1883 four shops on Market Square were destroyed by fire: Lane’s Saddlery, Geake’s store, Packard’s Solicitor’s Office, Doe’s Hairdressing Salon and the Burra Record Office.

Despite the complete destruction the Burra Record appeared later that week, having been printed in Adelaide.  The shops were rapidly rebuilt.

Late in 1883 the paper was issued twice a week and the price fell to 2d.

In 1890 Holder sold the paper to Mr P. Murrie Jnr.

In January 1891 the paper reverted to being a weekly.

In September 1891 W.J. Davey took over as editor.  [And later became the proprietor.]

Davey reduced the size of the paper and in 1904 increased the pages to 8.

Davey sold out to Ernest Frederick Marston in March 1913.

In 1945 E.F. Marston sold the paper to his son Frank Teare Marston.

In 1942 the paper was reduced to four pages, but increased again to 8 from 1945.

E.E. & R.E. Angel acquired the paper in June 1954.  The Marstons had printed the paper for 41 years.

Eric Angel must be the person with the longest association with the paper.  He came to Burra from Eudunda in 1929 and was employed by Mr Marston Sen. and then by his son before taking it over in 1954 with his son, Bob, the present editor.

[Auhl fails to mention the move from Market Square to Commercial Street and its date.  I have not ascertained when it moved to Commercial Street, but the Market Square premises were destroyed by fire again in April 1910, but were rebuilt on the same site.  In January 1935 they were in Commercial Street when a fire that began in an adjoining shop again burnt out the office, but this time the press was saved.  See also 98, 21, 29 June 1976, page 7 for corrections to this history.]
