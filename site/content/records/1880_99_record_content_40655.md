Poison!  Two young wood carters called Ledwith, who reside at Redruth, were brought home from Thistlebeds suffering from a serious illness.  It is now thought they were suffering from rabbit poison having contaminated the well at Thistlebeds.  Others have complained of feeling unwell after using it.  They are improving.
