Burra Town Council, 7 July

In view of an unfortunate incident at the Burra Cemetery it was resolved that Mr D. O’Brien replace Mr W. Broad as curator.

A pedestrian crossing is to be formed opposite the new footbridge across the creek.

ETSA advises that the 25% surcharge on Burra’s electricity has been reduced to nil.

An application was made for Sister S.G. Barnes to use Heathmont as a Private Hospital for the aged.  The party concerned has a private hospital in Adelaide and would use Heathmont to relieve pressure of patients from the City Hospital.  The application was tabled.

The War Memorial Committee requests the supply of material for the repair of the wall on the north side of the oval.
