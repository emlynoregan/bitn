Fires.  At about 3 p.m. on Thursday 4 November a young child started a grass fire in the back of Paxton Square, which was soon put out by the Fire Service.  At about 5.45 p.m. the same day fire in the roofs of unoccupied homes in Paxton Square had to be put out.  It is thought this fire started from sparks from the first fire.
