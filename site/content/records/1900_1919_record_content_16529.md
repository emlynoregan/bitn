Fanny Carbis, who was an inhabitant of the Redruth Reformatory about 12 months ago, took ill while there and was sent to the Burra Hospital. There she met Mr Fred Camp, who was also a patient.  As a result the two were married and left the hospital, but a few days later she was arrested to complete her sentence.  After some time she left Fred, having rifled the boxes of his deceased wife.  She then lived quite reputably in the town for some time before going to Adelaide under the name Mrs Douglas, accompanied by a man.  Last week she was sentenced to three months for having left her four month old child on the steps of the house of Mr R. McGee of Mercy St.
