Recent Burra Deaths.  SAMA writes to challenge the causes recently published.  [SAMA was the landlord for many of the poorest houses in Kooringa including those referred to in the reports.]  Only three of the twenty-six deaths were in the brick rows, yet they are condemned as unfit for habitation.  Are they the only places with ceilings of rotten calico and with damp floors?  If the surroundings are dirty with butcher’s premises constantly complained of, why was nothing done?  More dust and filth can be found in scores of places in Burra than in and around brick row.  By all means let the brick row have its share of blame, but not more blame than it deserves.  Let the inspector take a run around the upper part of The Paddock or a place or two not far from the Redruth Bridge.
