Mongolata Goldfield

A deputation of local MPs introduced by the Leader of the Opposition met the Chief Secretary Mr Ritchie last week and asked for further assistance for Mongolata.  They asked for similar help to that given in WA: railway passes, loan of prospecting tools, sustenance orders of 13/- per week per man and help with the cost of explosives at Â£1 per man per quarter.  Also there the state batteries deducted (after crushing and cartage charges were paid) 25% of each crushing as an offset against the assistance.  Mr Ritchie said he would consider it after getting full details of the WA scheme.
