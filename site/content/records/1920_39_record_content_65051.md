Quite a long discussion was held on whether to give the Aberdeen Croquet Club £2 towards excess water costs.  The Club was beautifying an area of Council owned land and this question came up annually.  Eventually it was resolved that the club would be paid £2 annually towards excess water (as long as they incurred such charges.)

Queen Street had been tarred in 1935 and it was resolved now to tar Kangaroo Street.

The occupiers of all houses with steps protruding into the footpath will be required to remove them, as they constitute a danger to pedestrians.  This was specifically sparked by concerns over the steps at Mr Woodman’s house on the path leading to the hospital.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Sampson on his recent bereavement.
