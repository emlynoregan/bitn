David Clarke of Armagh writes in reply to Felicity Martin disputing her conclusions about the performance of Hallett 1 & 2 Wind farms.  ‘In fact the performance of these two wind farms has been exceptionally high by both Australian and world standards.’  Hallett 1 is achieving a capacity factor of 40% and Hallett 2 of 39%.  (That is about 40% of the power they would achieve if they were at maximum power all the time.)  Anything above 30% is generally considered good and better than 35%, excellent.
