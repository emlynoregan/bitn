Obituary.  Signaller Charles Gillett, nephew of Mrs E.J. Harris of Kooringa, was k.i.a. in France [10 August].  He was the son of Mr A. Gillett and grandson of the late Mrs Gillett of Gum Creek.  He was born at Gum Creek in 1889 and educated at Burra and Hanson schools.  For some time his parents lived at Hampton.  After school he took up grazing with his father on Buckalow Station via Cockburn, from where he enlisted in 1916, leaving Australia with reinforcements for the 27th Battalion.

[Alfred Charles Gillett born 19 October 1888 Cuddla Muddla.]
