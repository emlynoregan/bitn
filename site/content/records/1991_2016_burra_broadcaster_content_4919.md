Remnant Vegetation in the Burra Hills region will be the subject of a survey 23-30 October.  The survey will cover remnant vegetation on private bushland outside national parks.  This information is needed in determining which plant species are best suited for revegetation work and will be useful to Landcare and Greening Australia and will also aid in assessing fire hazards and fuel loads for bushfire management.  Owners of land will receive a letter seeking permission for survey teams (a botanist and assistant) to enter land to collect data.  The area to be surveyed ranges from Saddleworth to Booborowie in the east, the plains in the west, Eudunda in the south and Peterborough in the north.  [East & west would seem to be the wrong way round.]
