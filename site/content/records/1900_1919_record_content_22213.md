St Mary’s Diamond Jubilee gets a further 2 column report.

Rev. H.L. Ebbs presided at the meeting on 9 July at the Institute.

Rev. W.H. Winter of Balaklava spoke on ‘sweating’ and is reported in ½ column.

Rev. W.G.M. Murphy spoke on The church and the Aborigines, though he drifted somewhat into employment for the poor, following the lead of the previous speaker.  He wondered why sweatshop workers didn’t go into domestic service where they would be paid more and get better status.  [The report reveals very little about what he may have had to say about Aborigines.]

Canon Webb thanked all in Burra for the hospitality extended to the visiting clergy.

Dr Sangster jun. then spoke on The Church & the Children, discussing the role and benefits of the Sunday school.

Archdeacon Bussell also thanked Burra for its hospitality.

The speeches were separated by musical items.
