Football

Mid North League matches were played in shocking wet and muddy conditions.  The ‘A’ Grade match at Robertstown was halted at half time when Riverton players refused to continue on the waterlogged and muddy oval.  The game was forfeited to Robertstown.  Riverton remains safely at the top of the table.

[95, 29 (2), 30 July 1974, page 2.  The above statement is corrected; it was not the Riverton players who refused to continue, but the Riverton Committee who decided to forfeit the game.]

‘A’ Grade	Robertstown 3.2 defeated Riverton 1.1 when Riverton forfeited at half time.

Min-Man 22.8 defeated Aberdeen 8.7 when Aberdeen was weakened by an influenza epidemic.

United 7.11 defeated Auburn 3.2

‘B’ Grade	Min-Man 6.6 defeated Aberdeen 2.7

Robertstown 2.6 defeated Riverton 2.5

Colts	Min-Man 13.13 defeated Aberdeen 0.0

Riverton 6.7 defeated Robertstown 0.0

Junior Colts	Robertstown 7.4 defeated Riverton 0.0
