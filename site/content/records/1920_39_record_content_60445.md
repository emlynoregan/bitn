The Royal Commission on Lotteries

The evidence of I.J. Warnes Esq. JP to the Royal Commission is reported at length in five columns filling one side of the supplement and flowing over to the other side for about 1Â½ columns.  I.J. Warnes saw the Lotteries as a way of funding hospitals and removing the existing burden from Local Government.
