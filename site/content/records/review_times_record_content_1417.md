Burra Show

The gate takings were a record $2,100 and the show was extremely successful, as was the licensed ball at the Town Hall in the evening, which had door takings of $2,700, of which the Show Society gets the first $300 profit.  Mr Shipard welcomed visitors and recommended the booklet on the show’s 100 years (at $1 each), which had been launched by Mr Roy Jeffery at Monday night’s Centenary Dinner.

Special features this year were a Grand Parade and sheep dog demonstration.  Three new life members: Mr Rex Warnes, Mr Brian Riggs and Mr Murray Stockman were congratulated.  Rex had served as President for two terms totalling nine years and Murray for three years.  Mr Neil Humphrys of Radio 5AD then opened the show.  He was a grandson of Mr Ray Humphrys [sic: for Roy] whose work for the Burra Show meant a lot to him over many years.  Miss Susan Holly of Adelaide was judged Miss Show Girl.  Jane Kellock won the junior section and Leanne Dunstan the sub-junior.  The Grand Parade was led by the Austin Car Club followed by tractors, implements, vehicles and horses.  The open shearing contest was won by Steve Pittaway and Donald Griffen won the Novice Section.
