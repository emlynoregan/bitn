Mt Bryan Methodist Church was opened last Saturday.  This replaces the wood and iron building used for many years.  The new building is of red brick and the old building will now become the Sunday school.  The church is 35ft x 23ft x 18ft high.  The walls are rough cast.  Furnishings are in Australian Oak.  The linoleum was the gift of E. Cyril Collins and the aisle carpet the gift of T.P. Griffen & Cyril Collins.  Hymnals were gifts of A. Jefferies and J.R. Simpson.  At the rear is a vestry 23ft x 14ft.  The lighting is by Aladdin lamps.  Present were: Rev. D.C. Harris (Riverton), Rev. O.L. Noske (Hallett Circuit minister), Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook (Kooringa), Rev. A. Dyer (Redruth), L.G. Golding (Architect from Adelaide) and F.M. Pearce (Contractor from Aberdeen).

Mr A.A. Jefferies declared the building open.  Some £700 has been raised, but a debt remains to be paid off of some £400.  Miss M.A. Thomas unveiled a window in the porch to the memory of Methodist Pioneers.  The service by the four ministers is then reported.  The sermon was by Rev. Noske.  A concert followed in the evening.  Takings for the Saturday and Sunday were £50.
