Mt Bryan Grievances.  At a recent meeting at the Mt Bryan Hotel the dangerous state of the road between the inn and Hanford’s was said to require immediate attention.  Mr Tregellan thought a District Council for the Hundreds of Kingston and Hallett was needed.  Mr Marchant thought they should raise the sum needed among themselves and not be subject to the mercies of a council.  There was only one really bad spot.  Mr C. Dawson said the other day his horse would not face that spot and he had had great difficulty in getting home.  Mr R. Collins thought that £20 would meet the needs and that residents would be prepared to contribute.  Mr J.B. Bull thought any sum collected should be memorialised for subsidy.  Mr Ind wanted a decision delayed so that wood carters could be involved as they were great users of the road.  Mr Collins thought delay would double the cost.  He did not think a Council needed at present.  A committee was formed and a subscription list opened.  It was also resolved to petition for a post office and a polling place.
