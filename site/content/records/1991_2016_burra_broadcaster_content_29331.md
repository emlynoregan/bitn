Council is going through the process of declassifying community land associated with this site.  In 1999 all Council owned land was deemed community land by an Act of Parliament.  The State Ombudsman has advised that the land associated with the sale of O’Connor’s Shed must be re-classified before and sale could be considered.  At its meeting on 19 February Council moved that it accept from A.P. & K.L. McBride vacant land at Cooper Street and Taylor Street Burra North, along with land at Jaffrey St Burra and that it sell to A.P. & K.L. McBride the property of O’Connor’s Shed and truck parking area at West Street and Hardy Street.  Mc Brides were to be given a permit for the exclusive use of Hardy Street, Burra for five years.  A number of allotments in Jaffrey Street were to be given to A.P. & K.L. McBride on an annual rental basis.  A community Consultation is in process regarding the declassification of this community land with submissions to be received up to 14 November.  A purchase offer for this shed was made from the Ngadjuri group of people earlier, but this fell through due to lack of funds.  Other offers have been made, but none were pursued.
