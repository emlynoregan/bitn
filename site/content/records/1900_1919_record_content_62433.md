Burra Town Council

Permission to employ others than soldiers on projects using Commonwealth Gift Money is not allowed under any circumstances.  The project will thus be delayed by the unavailability of masons.

Hawke & Co. offer girders at £57.

The Fire Brigade reports only 300 feet of hose not 500 and modifications to the cart are needed.  Hose is presently unavailable in Adelaide.

The assessment shows an increase of £500 on 1918.

The mayor announced he would not seek re-election for 1920.

Cr Radford moved a vote of appreciation for the Mayor’s service over the past six years.  Cr Dane 2nd.

Carried unanimously.

Cr Dane and Cr Greenwood indicated they would not seek another term, while Cr Radford had not yet decided.

W.E. Truscott of Koomooloo writes urging the Show Society to provide some seats around the ring at the Show.
