August

A local team took part in the Variety Club Bash

January rains were followed by good seasonal rains from May to August, resulting in good crops, many mice and cave-ins at Morphett’s Shaft.

Burra primary students went ‘undercover’ for stories, poems and music at the old Unicorn brewery Cellars.

SA Health Commission posed a dilemma for Burra Hospital with ‘revenue targets’.  Hospitals like Burra cannot juggle private and public patients to suit the requirements of the Commission’s numbers men.

Burra received $20,000 to assist with the Main Street Program.

Two wool meetings took place.  One was organised by a political party, was not advertised and was poorly attended.  The other organised by Dalgety’s was advertised in the ‘Broadcaster’ and had satisfactory attendance.

Burra Mine Museum recorded 6,176 visitors for 1992-93.
