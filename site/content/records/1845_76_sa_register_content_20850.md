A run up to the dry country

Beyond the rainfall country everything is new and strange except to very few persons.

Squatting on the inside of the line is easy and profitable.  Settlers live like gentlemen and see a yearly accumulating balance at their bankers.  On the other side it is all hard work, unceasing toil, meagre fare and disappointed hopes with pecuniary losses.  Between the ‘up’ squatters and the ‘down’ squatters there is a great gulf.  Beyond the line when rain comes they come from the northeast, but south of it they come from the southwest.

On Saturday 22 June I was deputed by the proprietors of the Register and the Observer to attend a meeting of settlers at Tetulpa [sic: Teetulpa], a station belonging to Mr Chewings about 211 miles from Adelaide.  I took the train to Kapunda and then the North-eastern Mail.  It had rained in the north and the mail from the country beyond Mt Remarkable was two days late in reaching Burra and many hair-raising stories were told of its journey, including the abandonment of the coach and the mail guard having to swim with the bags.

At about 10 o’clock the coach left Kapunda for Burra.  The road, though being improved, was sloppy and sticky.  We passed through the ‘towns’ of Hamilton, Marrabel, Steelton, Waterloo and Black Springs.  Burra was reached in good time and I was comfortably lodged at Lamb’s Hotel [Burra Hotel].

Because of the bad roads beyond we had to start at 5 a.m.  ‘Tom Colley’ was on the box and we set off.  We stopped for breakfast at Mt Bryan Inn for 15 minutes.  The Cobb & Co. vehicle was comfortable and travelled easily – a great improvement on the square box with heavy springs formerly in use.  We made it to the end of the stage at a gallop.  Not twenty yards beyond the changeover we were buried to the axletree in mud and only with great difficulty extracted.  Once on firm land again we travelled at ten miles per hour to Gottlieb’s Wells, Mr A. McCulloch’s Station, right on the boundary of the rainy and dry country.  There was half an hour to change horses.  The country was becoming generally poorer, with less feed and more bare patches showing themselves.

We were told here that in June 1866 McCulloch’s run was as red as a brick, but now there is a green and cheerful look to it.  The next stop was at G. Williams’s run of Parnaroo.  Here there was a delay to effect repairs to the coach.  The last stage for the day was a long run of 30 miles to Paratoo.  This was through saltbush country – much of it dead after the long drought.  Though the new growth was patchy, I was assured that the change from last year was marvellous.  To speak of agriculture here would be fanciful.  Surface water was temporarily plentiful, but survival relies entirely on water from wells and here they are deep and expensive; 100 or 250 feet or even 300 feet and the water drawn by horse power.  Paratoo is the head station for the Pandappa and Paratoo runs of Mr Peter Waite and where he lives.  I was greeted by Mr Waite and taken for a ride across his run the next morning.  To me the country seemed miserable beyond description, but he spoke enthusiastically of the improved state of the run since 1866.

We had a ride of 18 miles to Tetulpa where the meeting of squatters that I had been sent to cover was to be held.  After the meeting we returned to Paratoo shortly after dark.

At 5 a.m. on Wednesday I took the mail coach to head back to Adelaide.  The bush roads in this dry country are generally excellent, though the speed required by the mail service means the coach provides painful thumps and bumps which the traveller will feel for days.  I arrived back in the city by 3 p.m. Thursday.
