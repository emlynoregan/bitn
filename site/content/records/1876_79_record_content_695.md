Letter

I scarcely know whether to be vexed or amused at Dr Nesbitt’s presumption in attacking me so unjustly.  I simply quoted my experience of the sanitary condition of the Kooringa District without alluding to him in any way.  I do not as a general rule indulge in personalities of any description, nor is it my desire to make an attack on a young man just starting in life.  My letter was addressed to the gentlemen forming the Central Board of Health and not to any outside individual.  I have only to add that the mistakes made by the writer ‘Wm Peel Nesbitt’ are too numerous for me to mention and if he challenges me again I will expose him to the fullest extent.

W.H. Dashwood

P.S. I have no intention of leaving the district as reported.

[Note that Dr Dashwood’s competence came into question on the matter of typhoid in an inquest into the death of Sarah Ann Fogarty reported in the paper of 2 August 1878 and within a few months he had been replaced by Dr Sangster.]
