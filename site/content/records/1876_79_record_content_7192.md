Burra Town Council. Various streets are opened and closed as gazetted for some weeks past.

Mr Hutson protested to the closing of an old road past his place but the objection was overruled.

The Town Clerk pointed out that there was a balance remaining in the hands of the Govt. out of the vote for the Kingston Street Bridge and that Mr Morris, the surveyor, had said the Corporation must pay for the wing walls as all had been spent. The Town Clerk is to apply for the amount of the money expended by Council less the Govt. grant. There have been complaints about overcrowding in the town's cabs.
