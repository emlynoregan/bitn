Letters to the Editor

Re the recent match against Clare mentions among other comments that the Kooringa Club has only been in existence about four months.

An interesting letter from a ratepayer on the dispute between the Town and District Councils. Apparently the Corporation inspector looked at a slaughterhouse in the DC area and then complained to the DC to take action. The editor thought that co-operation in such a matter was sensible, but the writer had a different view.

The Corporation inspector should never have inspected a site outside his jurisdiction.

His complaint should have been ignored.

His complaint was made in order to reflect badly on Mr O'Brien, the DC inspector at a time when O'Brien had tendered for the Town Council job at £45 and Mr Gray was scared of losing his position for which he had tendered £75.

The ruse seems to have worked and now ratepayers have an inspector at £30 higher cost than necessary.
