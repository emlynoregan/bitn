Burra High School has been placed on the planning and design list for this year.  Mr E.C. Allen, Member for Frome, said he was disappointed as it was on the list last year, but the Public Works Committee disapproved of the site and another had to be found, delaying construction by twelve months.  The new Peterborough Primary School has been allocated $480.000.
