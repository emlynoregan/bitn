Accident.  A car driven by Harold Bagg accompanied by T. (Bonny) Rosewall rolled over at the foot of Breakneck Hill while turning onto the Baldina Road on Friday.  The cause was sand and loose earth rather than excessive speed.  Mr Bagg and Mr Rosewall were badly shaken and bruised and suffered abrasions.  A young lady with them was not injured.  The two men are still in hospital, but are improving.
