The Memorial to Stillborn Babies at the Burra Cemetery was dedicated on Mother’s Day.  The short ceremony was led by local ministers and centred upon the symbol of a rosebud as reminder of those young lives that never had a chance to bloom.  The memorial is located in the Burra Cemetery Rotunda [Mortuary Chapel] and as the inscription says it provides ‘A Place to Remember’ for members of the community whose children were stillborn or died soon after birth and many of whom lie in the cemetery in unmarked graves.
