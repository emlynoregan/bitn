Burra Town Council, 7 March

Tenders are to be called for the erection of a convenience.  [Probably at the Town Hall cottage.]

The Secretary of the Institute Library wrote pointing out the difficulties of maintaining the library and suggesting a mid-week picture show.

The bridge near the bowling green is to be repaired.

A letter is to be sent to Sir A.L. McEwin asking if advice could be given of the progress of plans to connect Burra with electric power from ETSA mains.
