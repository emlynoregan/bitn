Billie-Jai Cooper of BCS has been granted a 1998 Pierre de Coubertin Award – one of 40 students across SA.  This is the award’s first year and rewards students who have represented their school exceptionally well in sporting activity and have shown leadership.  Each nominee was also expected to produce a literary/ artistic work celebrating the ideals of the Olympic Movement.  The award was presented by Olympic Gold Medalist Juliet Haslam at a ceremony in Adelaide in October.  [Photo.]
