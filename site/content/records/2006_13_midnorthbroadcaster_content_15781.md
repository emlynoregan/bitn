Burra Creek saw the beginning of a clean-up program last Monday.  CMC Chairman Bruce Stockman organised a small band of volunteers to start the ball rolling.  The removal of sticks and other debris would allow mowers to come in and clean the area, eliminating the need for poison spray units, which would also be better for young trees.
