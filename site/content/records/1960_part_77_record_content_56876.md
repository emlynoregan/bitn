Burra Mine.  Peacock’s Pump House was demolished on 4 June.  It had stood for over a century before being blown up.  The adjacent chimney has already been removed for resiting at the Mine entrance on the main road.  The explosives were arranged to do as little damage to the actual stones as possible.  There is still time to save Graves’ Pump House.  It can be re-erected on the site by the main road where the chimney is to stand.  The lack of support from local people is staggering and the apparent indifference is saddening.

‘It is imperative that we save what we can and see that the skill of those Cornish stone masons doesn’t become just a memory and a legend.’

[Three photos of the event are printed.]
