The figure was modelled by Mr Willmott of Messrs Pitt Ltd and was cast in five pieces by W. Dobbie & Co.  It weighs 10½cwt and is the largest piece of statuary attempted in SA.  Mr Tillett designed the memorial and carried out the construction and Mr Guy Makin was the honorary supervising architect.  The committee overseeing the effort had Mr E.W. Crewes as President and Mr G.E. Dane as Secretary.  The Salvation Army under Captain Heathwood provided luncheon.

The Unveiling

At 2.30 the Prime Minister, Mr Hughes, the Parliamentary Party, the Mayor, Town Council and Councillors of the District Councils took their seats.  Returned soldiers and nurses (80 & 3) assembled at the RSL Rooms under Surgeon Major Steele and Lieut. W. Carter and marched to the square where they formed up on three sides of a square around the monument.  Relatives of the fallen were accommodated in front of the monument.  The ministers of the town then conducted an impressive Church Parade assisted by Brigadier Hill of the Salvation Army.  A band comprising eight members of the now defunct Cheer-up Ladies Band and four returned soldiers supplied the music.

The Prime Minister then presented the soldiers with their War Service Medals.  The Mayor said the principal reason for asking the Prime Minister to unveil the monument was because he was known as the friend of the ‘digger’ both during the conflict and after the return from service.
