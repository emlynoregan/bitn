The 40-piece orchestra will play extracts from Mendelssohn’s Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Peep Show, currently running in Sydney.  There will then be vocal items followed by the farce Packing Up.  The third part will be moving pictures including the wedding of Princess Mary and the comedies Fresh from the Farm and Law and Order and then the main feature The Matrimonial Web.  Proceeds will aid the Institute.
