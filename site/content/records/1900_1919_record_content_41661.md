Flood Damage

It was necessary to decide on replacing the bridge that was swept away from behind the Burra Hotel.  The Inspector suggested it be relocated opposite the Institute.  So moved by Cr Radford, 2nd Cr Killicoat and passed.

An officer from the Public Works Dept. will inspect flood damage and report to the Dept.  upon which the application for a grant will be considered.
