Entertainment at Kooringa.  The third of a series of entertainments to raise money for firewood for the poor was held at the Burra [Hotel] Assembly Room on Tuesday.  It was largely attended despite the bitterly cold weather.  [The program is outlined.]  The collection amounted to £5 and the previous two entertainments raised £12.  Mr Stanton said six tons of wood had been given out in the last month.
