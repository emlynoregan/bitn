Ulooloo.  The first Sunday School Anniversary was preached at Ulooloo by Rev. Wilson.  On Monday the students were conveyed by wagons to a site near Messrs Stephens and Brayley’s station for sports and a luncheon.  About 200 children attended.  Tea followed the sports and Mr Wilson gave a talk reminiscing about missionary life.  Other recitations, addresses and songs followed and £12-11-0 was raised.  The school has been established for ten months only.
