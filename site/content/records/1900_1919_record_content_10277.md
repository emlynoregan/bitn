Ulooloo.  The destitute poor officer Mr R.L. Gibbs went to Ulooloo to investigate reports that there were people there drawing rations while not entitled to them.  He found instead eight persons unable to get sufficient clothes to keep warm in winter and a severe lack of blankets.  Unable to help officially, he was able through the generosity of a kind member of the Board to supply some blankets.  Rations are delivered once a month.
