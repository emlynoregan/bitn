Miss Mabel Cottage is an entrant for a Mid North Region Tourism Award.  It stands near Redruth Gaol in the area formerly known as Llwychr [sic].  It was built at least 125 years ago.  By 1851 more than 5,000 people were living in the towns around the mine and Burra was then the largest [inland] provincial centre in Australia.  Miss Mabel was born in the cottage in 1883, the 12th of 13 children of Samuel and Ann Baker (nee Edwards).  Samuel had married Ann, the daughter of a Welsh smelter, in 1862 and they moved to the Penglawdd Street cottage soon after.  Samuel outlived Ann by three years, dying in 1938 aged 98.  Miss Mabel lived there until just before her death in 1983 in her 100th year.  The cottage has changed little since her death.  It retains the charm of country life as she would have known it.  Miss Mabel loved fruit and flowers and the garden has been replanted with heritage roses, fruit trees and herbs and the old pines and pepper trees remain.  Accommodation is available for up to six people in three double bedrooms and the pantry is well stocked.  There is a well-appointed kitchen, a spacious dining area and sitting room and visitors are greeted with freshly cut flowers and a bottle of Clare Valley wine.
