Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM in the Eastern Telephone Building with President I.J. Warnes in the chair.  In the past year with a turnover of £1,467-1-3 there was a profit of £27.  The President reported the death of two of their oldest members: Messrs T. Turner & J. Flower.

All officers were re-elected unopposed.

The Dog Trials held on 17 & 18 April drew only a small number of entries, but resulted in some good performances.

A.B. Riggs was elected President of the Northern Agricultural Societies Association.

The annual show was held on 3 October in good weather and drew more people than for some years and gate receipts were higher than for some time.  Entries were well up to previous years.

A new hall has been built at the showgrounds: Centenary Hall, costing £787-3-5.  The foundation stone was laid 17 July 1937 by I.J. Warnes and money collected at the ceremony was £105-4-0.  The hall was opened on Show Day by I.J. Warnes and up to Show Day £718-0-5 had been collected towards the cost, leaving £69-3-0 to be collected.  I.J. Warnes undertook to pay half of this if the society collected the other half.

Members and others took a trip to Sturt Vale during shearing again this year and all are invited back for 1937.  The road has been straightened and ramps installed, leaving only about six gates to open.

C. Bartholomaeus was re-elected patron.

Next Show date allotted by the Northern Agricultural Societies Assoc. was 27 or 30 October.  30 October was favoured.  There was a request for the shearing visit to be to Koomooloo so they could see the expert Mr Codrington handle dirty wool.  Mr Warnes said that could be arranged at Sturt Vale and that was then agreed to.  Mr Warnes thanked all for his re-election.

[He had been first elected such in 1913 according to a note on page 2.]
