BBH Netball Club made three people life members at a special dinner at Burra Hotel on 19 August.

1. Hazel Stockman.  She began playing in 1962 and was an A Grade player for many years and represented the club in Association matches and the Country Carnival.  She coached the J1 & J2 teams for two years and assisted as coach in the junior grades including J3 for several years.  She has, over the years, been Vice-President, President, Treasurer, Chief Reporter, Association Delegate, Assistant Reporter and committee member, continually since 1971 and one of the three-member committee that wound up the Burra Club prior to the formation of the BBH Club.  She has also helped considerably in fundraising, time-keeping and scoring.

2. Jenny Hirschausen began as a junior player and moved through the grades to A Grade, where she did most of her playing.  She has been very active in coaching at all levels, especially in junior grades.  She has been coaching since 1985.  She has been interested in umpiring and has been actively involved most weeks for many years.  She has been President, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary and in 1989 was Secretary-Treasurer of the Association. And has also been Club Reporter and Association Delegate.

3.  Robyn Baker came to the Burra Club in 1974 and has been involved ever since.  She played for several seasons and in 1984 was involved (with Hazel Stockman) in organising the married ladies’ team and playing in it – a venture that only lasted one year.  She has been actively engaged in coaching all grades from J3 to B1 over the years.  She has been an umpire for many years at all levels and is still umpiring.  She has been President, Secretary, Treasurer, Association Delegate and a committee member.
