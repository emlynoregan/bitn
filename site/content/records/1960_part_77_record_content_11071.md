Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1927

The staff was unchanged from 1926.  Enrolments were 37.  On 4 February Premier Hon. L. Hill and the Minister of Education visited.  The building was severely commented upon and renovations and alterations worth £800 were promised.  [The building was condemned as being too dark and poorly ventilated.  The £800 was to enlarge windows and install new floors.]  The May vacation was extended one week at the request of the Duke of York.  On 21 September the Governor General Lord Stonehaven and Lady Stonehaven visited the school.

1928

Ruth Batchelor joined the staff and Elsie Tiver was transferred.  Mabel Nield replaced her as part-time Domestic Arts Teacher.  When enrolments increased to 60 an additional teacher, Miss Batchelor was appointed.  High School Council funds provided many teaching aids.  On 9 July the Aurora Australis was visible from 7 to 8.30 p.m.  For four months the school routine was upset by the alterations to improve lighting and ventilation.  Dr Steele was a driving force behind many of the changes.
