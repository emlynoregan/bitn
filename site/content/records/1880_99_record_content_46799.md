James H. Moore was sentenced at Salisbury on Thursday to one month in gaol.  He had been arrested on Wednesday in Market Square, Burra, on a warrant for imposing on Charles Alfred Campbell at Salisbury last May.  He fraudulently posed as an agent for the Shearers’ Union and got advances from several shearers.
