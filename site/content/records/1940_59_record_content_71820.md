Burra Swimming Pool Public Meeting

The meeting on Friday night was well attended.  It was resolved to go ahead with pool construction, with the management to be in the hands of a committee.  About 170 people attended and the Mayor presided.  Mr Baulderstone said he was in favour of a pool, which would be greatly to the advantage of the town.  He felt that a lack of community spirit in the town was a problem he had noticed over many years.  The War Memorial Park and the Town Hall Library both provided examples of this apathy.  The swimming pool committee would have to provide evidence that it would not become a liability to Council.

Mr Topsfield, from the Burra Progress Assoc. also said the matter had been brought up many years ago, money had been raised and plans drawn up, but the matter then lapsed.  The Progress Assoc. thought it was too big a project for its members and needed the support of the whole district.  He supported the venture and said a Government subsidy could be obtained up to £1,500 for an approved plan.  The Council had £175-5-0 vested with it for swimming pool purposes and also had the plans previously prepared.  It was thought the Mt Barker Pool was the best model.  It was 100 ft x 30 ft and cost £2,900 including £750 for a bore, pump and switchgear.  It also included £1,500 subsidy and 9% voluntary labour.

The national Fitness Council advised that not more than £50 could be given in any one year.  Mr C.A. Brooks, Acting Supervisor of Physical Education was strongly in favour and showed a film Learning to Swim.  Mr R. Jeffery, Headmaster of Burra High School, also supported the idea, saying no education was complete without being able to swim.  He felt if half the town’s money raising efforts went to it £600 would be raised for a pool in a year.  Mr I. Trigwell, local manager of the ANZ Bank said that though he was just a ‘blow-in’ he would give it his every support.  Mr H.J.B. Jennison, who was President of the old Swimming Pool Committee, said that body did get a start, but the depression and limited Government input meant it did not get far.  In answer to questions Mr Cummins said the idea was for a community pool, not just a children’s pool.  A committee was formed of nine members with Mr H. Topsfield as Chairman.
