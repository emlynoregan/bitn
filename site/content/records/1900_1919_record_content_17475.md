Henry Charles Rainsford Batchelor, eldest son of the late W.H. Batchelor of Kooringa, has been appointed Deputy Examiner of Trademarks in the Commonwealth Patent Office in Melbourne.  He was educated at his uncle F.R. Whiteâ€™s Commercial College in Kooringa and then at Glenelg Grammar School before joining the SA civil service as a cadet with the Marine Board in 1880.  In 1884 he married Amy Dempster the daughter of a Pt Adelaide solicitor J.E. Dempster.  Their eldest daughter is at Adelaide University and their second has an appointment at the School of Mines as a cadet.

[The article gives details of his rise through the civil service and through the militia infantry where he rose to be the senior captain in the SA Infantry.]
