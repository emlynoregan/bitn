Fire.  A fire started in E.H. Weich’s wheat crop on Tuesday.  The fire seems to have started from his tractor and was soon into his haystacks, just through the fence, but after two acres of crop were burnt the fire came to a wide break, where it was stopped.  Mr Weich lost about 26 tons of oaten hay in the stacks.
