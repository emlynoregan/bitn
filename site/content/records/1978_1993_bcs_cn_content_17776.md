Burra Burra Hospital is planning a $2 million redevelopment, which will incorporate a 15 bed Acute Hospital section, including a new theatre, casualty, outpatients and specialist consulting rooms and the conversion of existing buildings to provide a new Day Care Centre, 20 bed Nursing Home and 10 Hostel places.

Planning has been encouraged by a commitment given by the SA Health Commission to part fund the architectâ€™s fees for preliminary planning and costing.  The upgrade is envisaged to proceed in three stages with the first being the upgrading of the acute hospital section.  It is expected that a proportion of costs will be provided by the Burra District and Community.
