Burra Waterworks.  The Town Council on 26 February received a letter in response to the Waterworks Deputation on 17 January.  The Conservator of Water says the works are in a fair condition and it has been decided that no reduction can be made in the capital cost as interest has already been reduced from 5% to 4%.  The Government is quite prepared to take over the works and have the district rated in accordance with the Waterworks Act.  It was resolved that the Commissioner be asked via W.B. Rounsevell by whom and when the valuation and inspection was made.
