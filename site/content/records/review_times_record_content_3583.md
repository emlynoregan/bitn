Burra Community Library will hold an open day to show off its new local history floor next month.  Built to house historical records, the mezzanine floor cost about $21,000.  This cost was shared by the Education Department, the Library Board of SA and the Burra Burra DC.  A complete set of volumes of the SA Register and any other records which mention Burra are included in the collection, Principal Mr Henderson said.

[The SA Register volumes cover most of the period of the Burra Mineâ€™s operation; they are not a complete set of the paper.]  The collection includes the Ian Auhl index.
