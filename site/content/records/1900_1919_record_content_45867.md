Burra Show Soc.  AGM last Friday.  President’s Report.

He makes reference to the war and the splendid season, in marked contrast with the previous one.

The Sheep Dog Trial on 30 & 31 July had record entries and for the first time the Championship Cup of SA was sent on from Strathalbyn and won by Mr A. Collins with his dog Rap.

Unfortunately the trials were not a financial success.

The show was held on 27 October, mainly due to the lateness of the season – it was an unqualified success.  There were record entries almost everywhere except in sheep (due to the lateness of the date.)  There was a record attendance and the return of considerable prize money yielded c. £130 for the patriotic funds.

The balance sheet showed a profit of £130 of which prize money returned was £39.  Sale of a ram presented by H. Collins & Co. yielded £63 and there was a £5 donation from E.F. Marston.

The President said a luncheon room was required at the grounds.  A tent was hardly suitable for entertaining such visitors as the Governor.  An iron building 60’ x 30’ would do.  Perhaps they could issue debentures to finance it.

R. Fairchild suggested that the profit was more or less fictitious, as over £100 of it had been returned for patriotic purposes.

Elections for 1916-17: Patron, Hon. John Lewis; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, T. McWaters & A.D. McDonald.

There was considerable discussion re the meaning of the original motion to donate to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund, because there was a Central Fund and a Local Fund.  Mr McLaren thought that when it was passed the Central Fund was meant and he strongly opposed any other course. [SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund]  Mr A.D. McDonald thought it was not specified originally which patriotic fund and H.H. Thomas favoured giving some to local bodies.  Mr Winnall was sure that when Mr Crewes moved the original motion the local fund would have been in his mind – he is after all President of the Burra Cheer-up Society, which initiated it.  The motion to rescind the original motion was lost 20 to 11 and the whole £130 was voted to go to the SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.
