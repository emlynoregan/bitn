CWA.  At a Burra Town Council meeting recently Cr Woollacott suggested that two seldom used adjoining rooms at the Town Hall be offered to the CWA as a Rest Room.  Council after discussion agreed.  [The two rooms are not clearly identified in the report, but given that the library occupied the rooms on the north side of the hall they would seem to be the old lodge room and the room next to it.]
