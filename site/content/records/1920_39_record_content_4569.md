Railway Accident.  The East-West express struck a cow two miles south of Farrell’s Flat Station on Saturday.  The locomotive’s leading wheels were derailed when the animal was caught under them.  A break-down train left Adelaide, but by the time it had reached Hamley Bridge the engine driver and local gangers had re-railed the engine and the journey continued after a delay of 3½ hours.  Adelaide was reached 4 hours late.
