Editorial on the change in Government with the fall of the Playford administration and the installation of Dr Cockburn as Premier.

Trees destroyed.  On Wednesday night no less than six sugar gums about 6’ high were destroyed by cattle and horses turned out to roam the streets.

Temperance Carnival.  Last Thursday (Accession Day) was a public holiday and the IO Rechabites held a festival to promote temperance.  Miss Jessie A. Ackermann from America gave addresses.  There was a procession of about 150 members led by Wheatley’s Brass Band.  A ‘Monster Temperance Meeting’ in the Institute followed a late ‘luncheon’ at 4 p.m.  With the speaker on the platform were Revs H.P. Burgess (Wesleyan), S. Gray (Primitive Methodist), J.H. Ashton (Bible Christian), T.M. Rowe (Wesleyan), Mr F.W. Holder MP Mayor, T. Kitchen (Secretary of the Lily of the Valley Tent IOR), C.J. Pearce (Secretary of the Rose of Sharon Tent IOR), Mr J. Harry & Mr J. Jones.  The hall was packed to capacity.  Rev. J.A. Burns (Mt Barker) took the chair.

The Rose of Sharon Tent reported 150 members and 70 juveniles while the Lily of the Valley Tent reported 86 members.  Miss Ackermann’s addresses on Thursday, Friday and Saturday are reported in 1 column.
