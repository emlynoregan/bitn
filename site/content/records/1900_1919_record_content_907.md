Fire.  On Friday night about 10.15 p.m. the shop between the Bank of Australasia on the east and Messrs C.H. Ewins and Son on the west, owned by SAMA and occupied by Mr W. Lasscock as a saddler’s shop and book emporium was seen to be on fire.  Mr Vivian of the Commercial Hotel raised the alarm.  Only a few pairs of boots were saved as the building burned.  Water could only be brought by bucket and people strove hard to save the adjoining buildings, both of which were saved.  As usual the facilities for procuring water were disgraceful – with a water main running past the building.  An inquest on Tuesday found no explanation for the fire.
