He says: -

I have never admitted the engine ordered was unequal to the work

The steps taken to ascertain whether any substitution could be effected were taken at the instance of the present Mayor.

I visited Burra on 12 February and the Mayor urged me to order a larger engine.  I said the one on order was large enough and would drive a second pump if required and as the machinery had been ordered some months ago it was too late to change.

The Mayor insisted I try, so I agreed to wait on F. Clark & Sons, but on reaching Adelaide I found the machinery was daily expected, and took no further action.

Meeting Mr Clark one day I mentioned the matter and then informed the Burra Corporation that the arrangement could not be effected.

I did not admit the engine ordered was insufficient.

A larger pump may be needed and there is no objection to one being made now if the Corporation are willing to pay interest on the cost of having reserve pumping power.

‘. . .the opinion expressed as to the relative economy of large and small engines are of such an extraordinary nature and so diametrically opposed to the results of experience as to occasion me the most serious misgivings in the propriety of placing the control of the works in the hands of the present Council.’ (R.L. Mestayer)
