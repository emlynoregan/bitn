Obituary.  Mrs John Lewis died at her residence in Kooringa after a long illness, aged 47. She was born in London in 1847, the youngest daughter of Mr Thomas Brook, Supervisor of Excise, Bristol.  She was a sister of the late James Brook of Way & Brook, Solicitors of Adelaide.  She sailed for SA when aged 6 and landed at Pt Adelaide in December 1853 from the ship Cotfield.  In 1877 she married John Lewis and came to live in Burra.  As a mark of respect shutters were put up on shop windows of every store in town when the news became known.  She was a generous and tireless worker for those in need.  On 12 July 1893 she laid the foundation stone for St Mary’s schoolroom.  She leaves a husband, four sons and two daughters.  There is a special service at 2 p.m. today and a procession to the cemetery.  [Martha Ann Lewis died 3 July.]
