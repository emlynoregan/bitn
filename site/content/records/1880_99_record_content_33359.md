2nd Leader on a correspondent, who has attacked the arguments of the Rev. Hugh Gilmore, but in an abusive fashion, which we cannot therefore publish, but one point raised, we will consider.  That is he complains about preaching interfering in politics.  We believe a preacher is doing his duty when speaking and working for the peopleâ€™s good.  Jeremiah did it and John the Baptist.  Is a preacher to stand silent whilst scoundrels and thieves fall upon his fellow creatures?
