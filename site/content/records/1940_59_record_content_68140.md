Weather.  In the last week the best general rain for years fell over both the agricultural and pastoral areas.  It totalled four inches in some areas.  After some good falls in February there had been three very dry months before rain began falling on Monday night last week and continued to the early hours of Thursday.  Baldina recorded 329 points, Mongolata 373 and World’s End 317.

The rain seems to have ended a threat from grasshoppers as well.

Burra has recorded 423 points for the month and the average for May is 162.  Collinsville area received 320 points and the mail contractor couldn’t get through on Thursday.  Booborowie has had 322 points for the month and mushrooms are widely reported.

Figures from many stations are listed and range from 142 to 353, with most in excess of 250 points: Koomooloo 273, Mallett 300, Faraway 346 and Woolgangi 265.  Quondong, though, got only 190.

The State-Wide Economy Trial, conducted by the Waymouth Group of Companies, announced that the average mileage for 14 cars in the trial was 46.9 m.p.g.  The car driven by Mr Guy Dollman of Burra Motor Co. averaged 41 m.p.g. despite heavy rain, squally winds and slippery roads.
