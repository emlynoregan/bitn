Burra Mine: Burra Burra Copper Co.

There have been no great changes this week.  A shaft in the cutting to enable the open cut to be drained to a greater depth is being arranged, though great care will be needed in this unstable ground.

Work at Allen’s Shaft proceeds, but so far nothing very sensational has been found.

Tributers on the embankment are kept busy as long as pumping continues.
