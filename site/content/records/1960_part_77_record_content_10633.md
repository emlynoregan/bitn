1915

Mr Statton enlisted and was replaced by the head teacher John T. Johnson, with Frank Thomas Assistant in Charge.  A note records: ‘As a Junior Commercial Class has been formed, a typewriter is needed, but we have had no success in obtaining one.’

Cliff Flower topped the Primary division with 92%.  He later died whilst Headmaster of Mt Gambier High School and his memory was much revered by Inspector A.O. McPherson.  On 5 August there was a short address on the Anniversary of the Declaration of War.  H. Collins won the Scholarship to Roseworthy and Fred Scholz entered the Junior Commercial Exam.  The year ended with an enrolment of 14 – many having left due to hardship.
