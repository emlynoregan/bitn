Deputation on Main Road 45

Burra and Hallett DCs and Burra Town Council presented a deputation to the Minister of Roads on 19 June.  The Minister replied in writing.  The impression in the district that the work on sealing the main road to Manoora was going to cease was incorrect.  Work ceased temporarily as there was a long dry spell and much money would have been wasted.  The next stage required much fine crushed rock to be added and when this had been done the road right into Burra will be sealed.  Funds will not permit the sealing of both the Burra-Terowie Road and the Jamestown-Peterborough Road to be sealed at the same time and as the latter section is the only unsealed strip on that road, it will be done first.  Funds will be provided to improve the road from Burra to Hallett and also the Burra-Booborowie road will be improved.
