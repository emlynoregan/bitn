The Anglican Diocese of Willochra is celebrating its centenary this year.  It will begin with a special service in the cathedral church of St Peter & St Paul in Pt Pirie.  There will be the blessing of a new Willochra Cross, the presentation of the Willochra Bursuries to assist in the education of two students and the launch of the centenary book In a Dry and Thirsty Land.  This has been the work of Mary Woollacottt of Burra and Dorothy Thorpe of Auburn.  There were many contributors to this 196 page book.  [Photo.]
