Burra antique Fair & Cultural Weekend saw some 1,400 people attend over the weekend of 2-3 May.  Market Square was festive with balloons and bunting.  The weather was perfect and there was music, art, food and wine.  Sixteen antique dealers travelled to Burra from all over SA to set up stalls in the Burra Town Hall.  The Main Street Committee organised music and singing and the popular Irish Dancers as well as a gigantic game of draughts in the rotunda.  The gallery had a continuous stream of visitors and the whole weekend was a great success.
