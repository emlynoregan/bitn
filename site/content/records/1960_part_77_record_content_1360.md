Obituary.  Rev. David George Longbottom of Burra was born at Jamestown in 1904 [30 November] and died on 22 February after a short illness.  He was a member of the Ironmine Church before joining the Methodist ministry 34 years ago.  He began as a home missionary at Darke Peake Home Mission Station.  He studied at Wesley College and obtained highest results in the Commonwealth in Hebrew and Greek.  He was a humble and conscientious person, possessed of quiet persuasiveness and he won the confidence and support and affection of young people.  He loved astronomy and only recently vacated the chair as Master of Epworth Masonic Lodge.  He is survived by his widow and daughter Joan.  [The death is registered as 27 February at Prospect, residence Manningham.  He is apparently ‘of Burra’ because his parents had a property at Braefoot when he was young.]
