Mr M.W. Bednall was given a farewell at the Institute on Thursday afternoon.  He is leaving to live in Adelaide after 16 years in Burra.  The Mayor said Mr Bednall would be missed in many areas of the town’s life.  He had been a Town Councillor, had been a member of the Institute Committee for 15 years, twice being President and had also been Secretary.  He was active in the Burra Progress Assoc. and had taken a keen interest in both the Primary and High Schools.  St Mary’s was losing a strong supporter and he had been a warden and trustee for 14 years.  He was also an active member of the Masonic Lodge.  He had been an enthusiastic member of the Show Committee and would be missed in golf, tennis, bowls and cricket circles and as Chairman of the Racing Club.  Recently he became Chairman of the Local Defence Committee.  He had been a tower of strength for the Mayor, especially when Vice-Regal or other visitors were in the town.

Supporting speeches were made by A.B. Riggs, Cr Jeffery, F.T. Sara, S.H. Robinson, Sgt J. Edington, Mr Jennison, A.L. Bence, P.L. Rosman, C.J. Butler, C.G. Phillips and S.G. Genders.
