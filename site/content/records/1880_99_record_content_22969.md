Obituary & Inquest.  T. Ward, the City Coroner, held an inquest on 3 August on the body of E. M. Bagot.  [Edward Bagot, died 24 July, aged 63.]

Ernest August Topperwein, guard at Yatala Labour Prison, said he was on duty on Saturday 24 July and on 2 August, when at c. 10 to 5 he went from his beat on No. 3 Quarry South and passed about eight feet from the end the better to see men breaking rocks.  Glancing up he saw a pair of boots projecting from a stone ledge.  Upon investigation he could also see trousers and a coat.  Superintendent Scott came and recognised the body as that of Mr Bagot.  He thought that such a fall would result in death - the body would probably not strike the sides, but fall straight to the ledge.  No similar accident had occurred at this place in his time there, but a prisoner named Symons fell over the edge and was killed in No. 2 Quarry.

It is surprising that the body was not noticed sooner, but the ledge slopes inwards and at first only the boots were visible and they were some 18” higher than the body.  He had not previously stood at that spot.

Dr B. Poulton gave evidence of the injuries and state of decomposition.  The injuries included a fracture of the skull, which must have produced instant unconsciousness if not death.  The appearance of the body was consistent with death on the night of the 24 June.  The fall was 31” 6”.
