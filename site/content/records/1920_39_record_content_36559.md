The depression has caused many of the children to be insufficiently nourished and poorly clothed.  In winter several children were crying with the cold.  Since 3 September needy children have been supplied with hot soup or cocoa at noon â€“ an average of 25 children a day.

If more people can come forward with assistance this will be continued next year.
