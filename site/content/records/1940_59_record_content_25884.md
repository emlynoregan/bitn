Burra Brass Band.  A small but very enthusiastic group met in the Lodge Room at Burra Town Hall on Friday to consider reforming a Town Band.  Mr Lisle Pearce chaired the meeting.  Mr G. Terry said there were a number of instruments held in trust by the Town Council from the old Burra Brass Band.  It was resolved to form a band and a committee was appointed: Patron, Mayor T.H. Woollacott; President, J.T. Pascoe; Vice-President, H.J.B. Jennison and Secretary, C. Radford.

A learnersâ€™ class will be formed immediately and an application will be made to use the Drill Hall for practice.  The band will be called the Burra & District Brass Band.  Inquiries will be made concerning obtaining instruments through Army Disposals.  There is quite a library of music from the old band.
