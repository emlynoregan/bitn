Kooringa Wesleyan Church quarterly meeting on 31 Dec. was presided over by Rev. H.T. Burgess.  Dr Brummitt and the Hon. F.W. Holder (circuit stewards) and eight others attended.  The income exceeded expenditure.  The church trust has taken over liability for the parsonage with £100 due to the Loan Fund and a £50 overdraft.  F.W. Holder & T. Drew are stewards for the coming year and Holder was appointed lay representative to the Conference.
