BCS.  The school is increasing the number of internally examined subjects and reducing the range of externally examined ones.    Principal Mr Roger Henderson said this would better suit students’ needs.  Internally examined Geography, Drama and two units of English will be offered and externally examined Geography and History will be dropped.  About 20 students were expected to take Year 12 this year; a slight fall in numbers.  95% of last year’s Year 12 students had either found employment or were doing tertiary study.  Internally examined History would have family history as a focus.

Staff changes:

In the Primary School Ms Helen Davis from Napperby Primary and Ms Karen Lockert from Teachers College will replace Mrs Wendy Burge and Ms Carolyn Bartlett.  The former has been in Burra for six years and is on accouchement leave, while the latter has moved to Pilgrim School at Aberfoyle Park.

In the Secondary School Mr James Harris is a new Adelaide University graduate to teach Physics and Drama teacher Mr John Keel has transferred from Eudunda Area School.  Ms Anna Kasoulus from Clare HS replaces Mr Colin Baker who goes to the position of Senior Master at East Murray Area School.  Ms Kasoulus will teach History and Geography.  After three years here teaching Physics and Computing Mr Garry Williams has transferred to Aberfoyle Park HS.
