Fire.  A quick thinking and active driver was able to use extinguishers in his truck to put out a burning tyre on Sunday morning.  The fire seems to have started from an overheated brake.  The truck carried bananas in an ethylene gas environment, which had the potential to incinerate the load in a few minutes.
