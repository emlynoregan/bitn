At Best Place the main changes wanted were:

Better lighting

Better signage

Lower speed for through traffic (presently 60 km/hr)

Most favoured changes were:

Clearing of vegetation from around the old Redruth Bridge

Landscaping the area behind the Royal Exchange Hotel

A realignment of the bike track to loop over and around the Redruth Bridge

Detailed plans will now be developed.
