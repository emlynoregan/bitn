Burra Show on 6 October will be greatly indebted to the work of voluntary helpers.  The ring grass will be mown and the grass elsewhere cut where necessary.  Pavilions are in order.  Mr Fuss has the cleaning and organisation well in hand and Mr & Mrs Scroop have fitted curtains to the tables, making a pleasing setting.  Burra Rural Youth has repainted the kitchen and copper room and installed a cement floor in the casualty room.
