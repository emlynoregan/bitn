Burra Town Council, Monday last.

The minister of Crown Lands asks for the electric supply proposal to be in writing rather than as a deputation.

The Mayor reported that the Hon. John Lewis had bought the Burra Creek from the Black Bridge to Redruth Boundary.  [Presumably from Kingston St Bridge to the southern boundary of Redruth at St Just St.]

He has asked the Council to wait on him to tell him what they want to do in the matter.  It was resolved to wait on him Wednesday morning.

The Rotunda lamp has failed.  It is assumed that the operation of this type of lamp is not understood.  It was resolved to repair the two similar lamps.
