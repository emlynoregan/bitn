Deputy Premier Des Corcoran spoke in Parliament to allay the fears of turning the EFS into a single fire fighting body.  The present Government had full confidence in the present voluntary system.  The present committee may well lead to changes that will make the fire service the responsibility of one Minister rather than three as at present.
