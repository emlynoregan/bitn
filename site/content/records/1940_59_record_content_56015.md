Burra Town Council, 18 August

SAR advises after inspecting the Bon Accord crossing that it proposed replacing ‘Look Out For Train’ signs with a new reflective type and placing a ‘Stop’ sign on the eastern approach.  Council approved the proposal and also a proposal for approach signs.

Highways & Local Government Department will be contacted concerning approach signs.

Highways & Local Government Department requested the Council acquire a portion of land through the western part of section 34 for the continuation of Main Road 45.  Council agreed.

Burra Burra Lodge No. 220 forwarded £68-4-0 from a Ball to aid the Burra Town Hall Improvement Fund.

The footbridge near the Court House will be removed and pipes placed across the road.

J.R. Barker offered £25 towards the maintenance of the cemetery.

A letter will be sent to the Burra electric Supply Co. to arrange a meeting about the extension of the franchise agreement.
