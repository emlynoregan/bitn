Visit of the Rt Hon. S.M. Bruse PM of Australia, 25 March

The PM and Mrs Bruce motored from Clare to Koonoona, arriving somewhat late, as they missed the road.  They came into Burra about 6 p.m. where they were guests of the Liberal Federation for dinner and then there was a Civic Reception at the Institute at 8 p.m.  The PM’s address is given in about 2½ columns.  A further ¾ column of other speeches is included.
