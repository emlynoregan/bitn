Burra Coach for Adelaide

George Hiles of ‘Petherton’ had a very handsome family horse conveyance built about sixty years ago by Messrs Barlow & Sons for c. £135.  Some time ago it was bought by the family of Mr R. Fuss for use as a mourning coach.  [That is to say, by the firm of C. & A. Fuss, Carpenters, Builders and Undertakers, the father and uncle of the R. Fuss mentioned above.]  When the Fuss family gave up their undertaking business [in 1922] the coach was placed in the shed and pensioned off.

Recently an Adelaide firm of buyers inspected the coach and informed Mr R. Fuss they were anxious to buy it, having found it to be in good order, except for the hood.  Mr Fuss sold the vehicle for £35 and it has subsequently been sent to Adelaide by train, to do service there as a cab.

[Note: information from R. Fuss was that it served in particular to convey people from the Adelaide Railway Station to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.  This was obviously a response to wartime petrol rationing.]
