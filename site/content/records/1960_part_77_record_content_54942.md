Burra Hospital has since 1929 been a part-time training centre for girls wishing to become nurses and has over the years prepared many for this career.  Under a scheme introduced in 1970 the Burra Burra Hospital was classified as a training school only for Enrolled Nurses – previously called Nurses Aids.  The matter has now been reviewed and the hospital can now accept student nurses – aiming to become Sisters as well as Enrolled Nurse Trainees.  From January 1972 student nurses will do one year at BBH and then transfer to RAH.  In her first year the student nurse will attend the RAH for three period (of 3, 4 and 5 weeks) to undertake instruction in Theory of Nursing.  From January 1972 entry level will be a pass in four subjects at Leaving level.  Enrolled Nurses do a one-year course, which includes two periods (4 weeks and 2 weeks) at Glenedon School of Nursing in Adelaide.  By 1972 it is expected entry requirements will be third year of High School.
