Market Square.

The buildings which served so long as dwellings are undergoing change.  Not long ago the corner block was bought by Dalgety & Co. on which they erected a nice office.  Then Martin Pederson purchased two houses for use as a boot and shoe emporium.  He now proposes to erect an up-to-date store on the site, while Walker & Sons have bought the houses to the east and intend to make improvements shortly.
