Burra Mine.  Matt Reilly says that there is very likely a large ore deposit under the Burra Heritage Area.  Mr Reilly was granted the right to explore for several weeks in 2007 in an area adjacent to the dump access road.  He claims that his small operation revealed large deposits, which could drive the town’s economy and real estate sector.  ‘We could well see a housing jump by 200%.’ He claimed.  After this discovery he bought into Phoenix.  In 2007 the Regional Council, PIRSA and the Heritage Advisor granted the permission for the exploration.  This brings into question why Phoenix has been forced to wait more than 15 months for a decision on its proposal.  Mr Reilly blames well publicised opposition to the exploration, which he says is not beneficial to the town’s future.  He says he is concerned for the younger generation and the future of the town.  He says for the first time in 200 years three hotels in Burra have closed within 18 months.  ‘If someone doesn’t do something, this town’s going to disappear.  Exploration of the site would provide ‘the potential for Burra to move forward’.
