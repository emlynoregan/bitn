[The story is quite difficult to piece together from the evidence, but it appears to be something like what follows.]

Lock Sing seized a horse, cart and harness from Charlie Fie.

[Lock Sing had recently been awarded £48-12-0 from Fie in a court case.]

Then Billy Short claimed that the horse was not Charlie’s, but his, because he had bought it from him when Charlie had needed money to send to China.

Though his evidence was far from clear he said he gave £6-10-0 for the horse.

(Although Fie had owed him £2 for rent of his garden it was not deducted from the sum for the horse.)

It appears that Sampson had seized the horse. (Presumably acting as agent for Lock Sing.)

Short then bought it and returned it whence it had come.

Last month when Fie lost his court case against Sing he lost everything and gave up renting the garden from Short, who then let it to Ah Gow who had previously been employed by Fie.

Jimmy Gully was then sworn as a witness to the sale of the horse from Fie to Short.

August Fuss also gave evidence he had signed the receipt as a witness, but had not actually seen money change hands.

Charlie Fie was then sworn and admitted selling the horse to Short, but also admitted using it for his own purposes afterwards.

Ah Gow said he used to work for Fie for £1 a week, but now he was employing Fie for 15/- a week.

Mr Downer, for Lock Sing said the whole story was a sham to cheat his client out of the fruits of his claim.  No one could believe either Short or the Chinaman [Fie].

Mr Packard for the complainant did not speak.

Mr Stow SM endorsed Mr Downer’s views and gave a verdict in favour of Lock Sing with costs for Joe Tie, the interpreter from Adelaide.

Lock Sing v. Charlie Fie.  (Downer for Sing & Foster for defendant.)

This was an interpleader case where L. Day was the principal.  L. Day sought to recover £14 from Charlie Fie.  The sum was realised when Mr Sampson sold a horse, cart and harness at auction to Sam Sing.  Sam Sing , when he appeared, said he was now Ah Gow.  After Fie had the judgement against him a month ago, Day took away Fie’s horse, cart and harness, claiming they were his property.  The ownership of the property of the Chinamen seems hard to establish.  Day acted on advice to sell the horse and harness as soon as possible, but the bill of sale was never registered.  Sampson sold the things, but as no bill of sale was presented he objected to hand over the proceeds.  The bailiff soon after received instructions to seize the items, but having sold them Sampson kept the money and paid it into court.  The point being debated was whether he should have done that or paid the money to Day.  The SM gave the verdict to the executor creditor.  Mr Foster advised he intended to appeal to the Supreme Court.  SM Stowe said he would require him to find a security for £25 for expenses – to be paid to the clerk of the local court within 2 days of hearing of the case and the case to be filed 14 days later.  (Ah Gow is said to talk very fair English.)

[An interpleader case is one between two parties to determine the matter of a claim or right on which the action of a third party depends, especially to determine to which of them payment ought to be made.]

Luke Day v. J. Sampson for £14, being the proceeds of the sale of a horse and harness.  This was non suited after much evidence had been taken.
