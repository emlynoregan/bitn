Burra Rural Youth held its AGM.  22 members and 3 advisory members attended.  The President Roger Humphreys delivered the annual report.  Numbers were slightly down.  David Kellock had replaced Josie Orchard as Secretary.  Valmai Williams, one of the most active members, had left the district during the year.  Several foundation members had left the club on reaching the age limit.  (Kevin Williams, Rex, Peter & John Stockman.)  The club had a stand showing noxious weeds at the 1963 Burra Show.  It also hosted 36 members for the Merino Tour in the Burra District this year.  A Mock Debutante Ball was held on 24 July and raised c. Â£50 for the Burra Hospital.  Public speaking competitions proved the club had some promising public speakers.
