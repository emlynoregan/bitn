Obituary.  W.H. Pearce died on Friday at the residence of his daughter Mrs John Turner of Copperhouse.  He was 76.  He was born at Tuckingwell [Tuckingmill] in Cornwall and came to SA in 1885 [sic] with his wife and brother John in the South Seas.  He found employment in the Burra Mine for three years before trying the Victorian goldfields.  He bought a farm at Chiltern and lived there for 21 years before returning to SA with his wife and family.  He carried on farming at Ironmine where his wife died three years ago.  He then went to live with his daughter at Copperhouse.  He leaves a brother, John Pearce of Mt Bryan, and two sisters in England [and children:] Mrs R. Oats, H.A. Pearce (Chiltern Victoria), Mrs J. Carr (Balmain, Sydney), James Pearce & Mrs J. Turner.  There are 25 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.  [William Henry Pearce died 17 November.]

[The year of arrival cited is clearly wrong and 1855 would be closer.  There is a child born in Kooringa in 1857.]
