Burra Election – Meeting of Mr Mildred’s Friends

A meeting of Mr Mildred’s supporters was held at the Miners’ Arms on 2 October.  Mr A. Johnston took the chair.

The meeting was called to consider the address of Mr Kingston.  The chairman read the address and said he thought they should do all in their power to vindicate Mr Mildred.

Mr Gubbings [sic: Gubbins?] suggested it would certainly have been advisable for Mr Kingston to have shown his face before Mr Mildred.

The Chairman then read Mr Mildred’s reply, which he said conformed to the laws of truth and justice.  The expression that Mr Mildred had been brought forward as a lark could not have emanated from a gentleman.

The resolutions printed in the paper of 6 October were then passed.
