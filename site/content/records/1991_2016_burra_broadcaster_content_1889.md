A Women’s Group with a spiritual interest spawned a group of campers at Redruth last week to ‘tap into the land and the real you’.  With the theme ‘Earth Spirit Union’, they were attempting to rekindle pagan rituals.  Apparently due to lack of financial and other support, activities they had planned for this weekend will not eventuate.
