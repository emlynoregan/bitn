Burra Creek Pumping

Stream gauging in the creek has revealed a water loss of 18% between the bore No. 1 opposite Peacock’s Chimney and bore No. 2 adjacent to the BCS Agricultural Block.  Due to this leakage and the costs of pumping, bore No. 1 will be closed for the rest of this financial year.  The intention is to clear the channel and identify and then plug areas of leakage.  The rest of the waterway may develop algal growth due to reduced flow, but this is relatively harmless to creek fauna.
