Burra Creek Wines has won two awards recently.  They picked up a silver medal at the 2012 Royal Adelaide Wine Show for their 2006 Princess Royal Late Harvest Shiraz and a bronze medal in Sydney’s 2013 Organic Wine show for their 2010 Princess Royal Station Premium Shiraz.  It has also recently been involved in Australia’s Wine Trail, which involved five businesses from China coming to Australia specifically to purchase wines from regions in South Australia.
