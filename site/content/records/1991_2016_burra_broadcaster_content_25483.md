Burra Motor Inn is celebrating ten years of operation.  Peterborough businessman Tim Carter approached the Burra Council for options on where to build a motel.  Council came up with the western side of the Burra creek, formerly a camping area opposite the Anglican Church.  The caravan park across the creek then incorporated the camping area and Council accepted the design for the motel.  A couple of years on a further five units were added along with a dining room.
