Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  The SA Government is considering laying a 12 mile portion of the pipeline on the bed of Spencer Gulf.  If feasible this would cut the length by 56 miles of the 223 miles.  The suggestion would be to run from Pt Germein to Point Lowly at a maximum depth of 75 ft.  Three-quarters of this length is exposed at low tide.  The new pipe will be of 42 inches diameter for more than half its length and is expected to have a capacity of five times that of the original pipeline opened in 1944 at a cost of Â£2,750,000.  A work camp has been established at Spalding for the Hanson to Bundaleer section, on which work will start this month.  Duplication will take several years.
