Obituary.  Louis Grow died on Tuesday night [11 September] after an association with the town of 86 years.  He was born in Hanover, Germany on 2 December 1845 and came to Australia with his parents as an infant.  He could recall very interesting parts of the history of the town and state and retained his mentality to his death.  He had been a carrier and was renowned for the integrity of his dealings.  He was active until the last few months when his heart failed and he was eventually confined to his bed.  He was a member of the Kooringa Methodist Church and a fine Christian character.  He was twice married.  The surviving members of his first family being: Charles Grow (Perth), Will Grow (Melbourne), Chris Grow (Boulder WA), Fred Grow (Pt Pirie), Hannah Mrs Tom Nicholls (Croydon) & Alice [Mrs A.J. Hann] (Payneham).  In 1889 he remarried and is survived by his widow and from the second family: Alfred Lewis Grow (Balhannah), Hilton Grow (Detective Force Adelaide) & Philip Grow (Mounted Police at Farina).  There are 28 grandchildren and a number of great-grandchildren.

At the funeral on Friday bearers were members of the Oddfellows Lodge of which Mr Grow was a very old member.  They were: S. Kellaway Sen. Lance Tiver, W.H. March, A. Lomman, Robert Fuss & Alwin T. Pearce.  [Marriage records suggest three marriages.  He first married Martha Keam or Kearn in 1866; who died in 1885.  Then he seems to have married Mary Jane Tilling in 1886, and although there is no registration of her death in SA, he married Rose Margaret Sanders or Saunders in 1890.  She survived, dying in 1939.  The children came from the first and third of these marriages.]
