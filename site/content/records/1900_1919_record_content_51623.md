Obituary.  A.H. Forder died at his daughterâ€™s at Laura.  He was the first organist at Kooringa Methodist Church, being succeeded by John Pearce.  When he moved to Redruth he took a prominent role in the church there as choirmaster and organist.  Some years ago he took up dairying at Thackaringa.  He was prominent here in musical circles and was clerk of the local court for many years.  He was twice married, but both wives predeceased him.  An adult family of sons and daughters survives.
