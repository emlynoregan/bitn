After meeting the Governor and Lady Bridges at the station the Mayor handed the Vice-Regal party over to the care of the President of the Show Society for a tour of the show and luncheon, after which the Mayor and Mayoress took them to points of interest.  The show was widely regarded as the best on record.

Finance

We began the year in credit £26-7-3 and end in credit £300, though substantial bills are outstanding.  Some thousands of yards of metal are needed to put the streets in good order and tar dressing of footpaths is needed in many places.

A new footbridge has been erected in Queen St and one is under construction at Gully’s Wharf.

A new assessment this year has increased the value by £6,000 to £16,300.

The income for 1923:

General Rate (1/6)	803

Health Rate (9d)	401

Park Lands Rate (2d)	89

Lighting Rate (4d)	178
