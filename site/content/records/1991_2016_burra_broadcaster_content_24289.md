Terowie Water Supply

Following complaints from Terowie residents about the quality of their water supply, SA Water has advised that like all northern railway towns, they are supplied with water drawn from local earthen storages that rely on run-off from rainfall events.  The water is coloured and of variable microbiological quality.  When it is dry water is carted in.  It is not economically viable to disinfect such water supplies and customers are advised it is non potable and should be boiled for several minutes before drinking.
