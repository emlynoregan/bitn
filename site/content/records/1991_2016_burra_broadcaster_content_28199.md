Terry Wilson: Editorial

[In this article the editor wonders about the dangers inherent in the Council Ward system in promoting parochialism and division.  This can cloud issues affecting the whole Goyder region and also diminish attention given to local issues.  He speculates that it might be better to do away with ward boundaries and perhaps also reduce the number of Councillors from the present 13 to perhaps 9 â€“ a change that might possibly also include some better reimbursement for their labours.

Burra Pony Club remains a very dynamic organisation.  On 17 August, almost a dozen members head to Keith for the State Championships.  [Considerably further detail is printed.

Gaslight Antiques & Collectibles has shown sceptics that a niche coffee shop can become a viable business in Burra and indeed be very successful.  Congratulations to Dee and Brenton Greenslade on their two-year-old success story.

Burra Senior Citizens Club held its AGM and elected: President, Shirley Broad; Secretary, Laurel Neill and Treasurer, Ben Kotz.
