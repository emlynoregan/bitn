Burra Red Cross held its AGM 13 July.  President Mrs D.M. Steele presided.  In August the Government prohibited the Red Cross from making socks and scarves.  In September the branch nominated Rosemary Reed, Betty Launer, & John Tamblyn for the Red Cross Baby Competition and £440-2-9 was raised.  Rosemary Reed was the successful candidate for this branch and also the winning baby for the Burra Red Cross Executive when £1,000 was raised.  The takings from the shop for six weeks were donated to the latter cause.  The Red Cross Fighting Forces Tea Shop is well established and has contributed handsomely to funds.  Capt. C.L. Phillips has lent his premises rent free for 12 months.  We record with profound sorrow the death of one of our most valuable members, Mrs S.C. Genders.  Elected were Patrons, Mesdames John Tennant & E.F. Marston; President, Mrs D.M. Steele; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames J. Barker & W.H. Sandland; Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery & Treasurer, Mrs C.J. Butler.
