Royal Adelaide Show Society & SAJC Officials examined the Burra Racecourse and Showgrounds to see whether the Show Society & Burra Racing Club could both use the Syndicate’s grounds at Burra North without interfering with each other.  A number of committeemen from the three bodies concerned attended.  Mr Rowell, Stipendiary Steward of the SAJC and Mr Thurston, Curator of Morphettville Racecourse made suggestions that would improve the racetrack with little effort.  There was no definitive recommendation, though it seemed to be a general opinion that a move to the Syndicate’s ground could be advantageously carried out.

Mr Finniss, Secretary of the Royal Adelaide Show said the present showground could continue to be used, but it would never be possible to hold trotting races on the present ring.  The ring was not in good shape and the jumps were incorrectly placed.  He also said the practice of parking on the hillside was dangerous, though this could be rectified by terracing the slope.
