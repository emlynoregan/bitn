Kooringa News, 3 July

Last Monday a shoemaker named Thomas Murphy was brought before the SM charged with being concerned in the late burglaries in Kooringa.  When apprehended he was carrying a skeleton key and at his lodgings were found other tools used in burglaries.  The tools match the marks found on Mr Lloyd’s drawer and Mr Hoskin’s cashbox.  When Murphy’s alibi for the time of the burglaries was deemed inadequate he was committed for trial in Adelaide.

Despite the number of drays laden with hay and firewood in the town, the hard working settlers find few buyers and tradesmen continue to report that business is dull.

The weather has been cold, wet and disagreeable, but scarcely any rain has fallen to the east.
