Obituary.  Mrs N.J. Tiddy died at a private hospital in Prospect on 9 August.  She was born Alice Hill, the daughter of Mr & Mrs John Hill of Dry Creek and was born in October 1859 as one of thirteen children of whom four survive.  Her father owned a large property at Dry Creek and at one time also owned the land on which stands the Beehive Corner at the intersection of Rundle and King William Streets in Adelaide.  Prior to her marriage to Mr Tiddy in 1890, she was a teacher with the Education Department.  After her marriage she attached herself to the Redruth Methodist Church and was an untiring member of the Womenâ€™s Christian Temperance Union of Aberdeen.  She was a foundation member of the IOO Rechabite Lodge in SA.  Mr Lionel Hill, the late Premier and Agent General for SA, was her nephew.  Her health has been failing for the last five years, during which time she was a patient sufferer.  She is survived by a husband, two sons and an adopted daughter: Mr Guy Tiddy (Woodville), Mr J. Milton Tiddy (Aberdeen) and Mrs Lloyd Pearce of Renmark, born Muriel Tiddy (a niece.)  She was buried in Dudley Park Cemetery.
