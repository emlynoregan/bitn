Burra Institute

A member writes complaining that this is a miserable excuse for an Institute:

There are few books and those there are of a cheap and inferior kind.  I believe there is now twice the number of books as there are members.

The want of accommodation for persons wishing to pass a quiet evening reading is shocking.  The seats are unplanned planks and the tables unplanned boards.  The fire is often out and the light always poor and often out when a solitary person wishes to enter and read.

There have been but three or four lectures in the past year instead of one a month, as there ought to be.  Some of the lectures have been more like missionary meetings than popular lectures to miners and mechanics.  Few honour religion more than the writer, but still, he does not like to see it dragged into what professes to be an entirely secular institute.

What the cause may be the writer does not know, but he hopes they may soon be addressed by a meeting of members.
