Farrell Flat Centenary of Federation Celebrations took place on Sunday last.  The main street has been transformed by the erection of a shelter containing panels depicting the town’s history and a mural depicting local historical links.  The nature strip of the divided road has become a flower garden with landscaping and Goyder Council has kerbed the island and undertaken roadworks.  Graham Harvey as Chairman of the Farrell Flat Community Management Committee was master of ceremonies at the official opening.  Speakers were:

Council CEO Stephen Kerrigan

John Hannaford of the SA Centenary of Federation Committee

Graham Gunn MP

Council Chairman, Dennis Keller

Other participants in the formalities included Ian Denton, Clyde Atkins and Laurel Neill.

Marilyn Kuchel of Australia’s Open Gardens Scheme opened the garden section.
