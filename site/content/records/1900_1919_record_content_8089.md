Three Kangaroo Dogs savaged sheep at Mr Bagot’s recently and though four weaners and some lambs were killed, Mr Crosbie the manager was able to follow the dogs home to Kooringa and identify them and their owners.  They paid £8 damages.  The owner of two dogs promised to send them away and the third belonging to another person was destroyed.
