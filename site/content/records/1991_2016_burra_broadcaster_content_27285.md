Burra Show is facing difficulties with rising costs.  Show President Ron Shipard said the insurance costs, including Public Liability, will double from 2001 levels and these places in doubt the societyâ€™s ability to continue.  He hopes a solution can be found.  A recent survey showed public liability claims have increased from 55,000 to 88,000 a year.  Premiums have risen by up to 500%.  The problem is especially serious for many small businesses and adventure tourism in particular.  Fetes and fairs are also severely threatened.
