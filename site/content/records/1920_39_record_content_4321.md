Floods.  Last Saturday steady rain set in with an east wind and on Sunday the wind changed to southwest about noon and very heavy rain followed.  The rain was particularly heavy to the west and the creek in West Ward rose rapidly.  As in 1915 it broke out near Mrs Howell’s residence and rushed down Commercial St flooding shops and dwellings.  C.J. Pearce’s was flooded from the back.  In Commercial St the premises of A.J. McBride, Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, C. Parks, Glenister & Sams, George Lawn and Bennett & Fisher were flooded to varying degrees.  Mr Lawn fared worse with a cellar full of water and damage estimated at £40.  On the other side of the street only Eyes & Crowle were affected.  The water then rushed down Chapel and Thames Streets.  The flood in Thames St was particularly high.  Spray rose feet into the air where the West Ward Creek meets the Burra Creek.  The only bridge carried away was near Mr Bowen’s residence.  Debris including large logs and a 100 gallon tank of Mr Howell’s was found when the water receded.  Damage was also done at crossings on the road south.  At Koonoona 4.40” was registered for the week with similar falls at Leighton.  There were also good falls to the east. Varying from 75 points to 210 points.  Henry Hopkins, youngest son of Mrs C. Rogers of Bewley’s [The Cactus Farm], was almost drowned when his horse was swept onto its side pinning him and kicking him in the head.  He was rescued by his brother and stepfather
