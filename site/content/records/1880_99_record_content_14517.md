‘Non Nobis Solum’ writes considering the Council is full of ‘party humbug’.  He is sorry that the present Mayor has had to put up with ‘such a lot of old dames’.  They refuse a few pounds for trees, but these are the same men who voted the inspector an extra £10 a year for doing what he was engaged to do and also added on a few pounds for his getting signatures to memorials in the hours he is already paid for and a few pounds to collect rates and a few pounds to impound goats.  His salary almost becomes double what the Council led ratepayers to believe the Inspectorship would be done for.  They also go spending money to fence the Aberdeen Reserve, which they don’t own.  [He also lists other ‘follies’.]  It is time things were done in the town to best advantage and voted for without fear or favour.
