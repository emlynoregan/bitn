‘Festina Lente’ writes a 1-column letter responding to ‘Steel Beak’ doubting there can be any sudden change for the better, doubting that selling the railways to private enterprise would improve things, but finding farmers have indeed been sold to city interests by the tariffs and embargos on their farm inputs.  We cannot smash the cities, but we can lower tariff walls and we can foster international trade.  Perhaps those in control of religious affairs have ‘slipped a cog as well as the lay people and have fallen down on their jobs.  As least I think so.’ [Sic: for ‘At least I think so’?]

‘Steel Beak’ again writes.  The unions have assets which should be helping the unemployed more than they are.  We must get away from class hatred.  We should have done more to support immigrants, many fine examples of which are now wandering the country with nothing.
