Annual Meeting of Ratepayers, Monday 29 Nov. at the Institute.

J.E.H. Winnall took the chair.

A motion approving of the way Mr Crewes had discharged his mayoral duties was passed by acclamation.

Cr Lane thanked all for returning him unopposed.

Cr Radford did the same.  Cr Killicoat’s enforced absence on military duties, even to the neglect of his own business, had placed more work on his (Mr Radford’s) shoulders and he thanked the other councillors for their assistance.  It was nice now to have Cr Killicoat back to share the load in North Ward.

Cr Dane, who had been elected unopposed was surprised as two candidates had withdrawn whom he thought would have filled the position much better, in W. Hodge and J. Drew and he thanked them both for their courtesy.

The Mayor felt he had neither sins of commission or omission to confess.  The parklands account practically being the only one in arrears.  When he took office two years before £150 was owing on the creek and £40 for a block of land purchased by the Council.  Of that £150 had been wiped off.  He felt the town was spending too much on lighting.  He intended to make further enquiries about electric lighting, but it would cost £5,000 to £6,000 which would be hard to raise at a reasonable rate of interest.  With reference to the bridges washed away, the Government was paying for one to be erected opposite the Institute and the other two would be erected when the department had funds.  The tar paving would be more effective with a £20 or £30 heater.

Cr Lane said he was in favour of tree planting, tar paving and electric lighting, provided a scheme reasonably sure to pay was submitted.

Cr Radford thought one of the three permanent billets on council should have gone to Aberdeen [i.e. one of the three employees]  He thought they needed a heater to make tar paving satisfactory and he favoured an electricity scheme as soon as the Burra Mine reopened.

Mr Crewes thought the only use of the creek was for a plantation and spending £150 to buy it had been a waste of money.

Cr Lane thought it one of the wisest things Council ever did.

Mr McLaren said that the Hon. John Lewis had offered the Council £100 if it would stand aside and not purchase the creek – Would Councillors accept £250 for it now?
