Burra Town Council 4 August.

Messrs Pearce Sen., Ward & Bruce asked the Council to enlarge the waterway of the bridge in Queen St as the man road bridge upstream has been enlarged. Council thought the whole bridge would soon have to be replaced, but they had no money at present. The deputation offered to lower the bed at their own cost and was allowed to do so under the supervision of the surveyor.

Discussion re a cheque for £12 misappropriated by the late Town Clerk (Mr J. Fogg) - some steps had been taken and Council would have to decide on what to do next - deferred to next meeting.

The Overseer's report was that Market Square needed to be much raised and the hollows filled in before it can be thoroughly drained. Already over 70 yards [3] of quarry rubble have been carted there.

Two approaches to the bridge in Aberdeen are to be made.

Expenditure on public works has been just over £1,000 for the year and the cemetery fund has been repaid £156. Indebtedness is now a little less than on 1 January, but no further works are to take place except those already ordered.
