Booborowie Empire Fair

This was the joint effort of the local branches of the Red Cross, FFCF and the Methodist Ladies’ Guild.  Mrs G.S. Hawker declared the fair open in Booborowie Hall.

[Results of the Baby Contest are printed along with convenors of the stalls.]

In the evening there was a concert, followed by supper.  [The concert program is printed.]

The gross takings for the day were c. £72.
