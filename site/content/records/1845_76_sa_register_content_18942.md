Kooringa News, 7 September

Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on 7 September before W.H. Challoner JP on the body of Carl Wimmer, found drowned in the Burra Mine on 6 September.  James Pearce was foreman of the jury.

Henry Renton, miner:

Left the deceased at quarter past 12 a.m. on 6 September at the strakes [a sluice for washing ore] at his work and went to dinner.  Came back at 1 o’clock and saw the deceased in the mud and water.  Got him up and called Bodminer, as I thought him to be dead.  Had worked near him for two years.  Deceased was subject to fits many times.  He fell into the water 15 months earlier in the same manner.  Had not seen him have a fit in the last six or seven weeks.  There was 8 to 9 inches of water and sand in the place.

John Bodminer, miner, corroborated this evidence and said the doctor was sent for and tried to revive deceased.

Thomas Wilson Corlyn, medical practitioner:

Was sent for and found deceased lying on the floor of the blacksmith’s shop, apparently dead.  Administered artificial respiration for about 50 minutes.  Supposed he died from drowning (asphyxia).  Note a mark on his chest, perhaps from falling on a plank.

The jury concluded the deceased was found drowned while in an apoplectic fit, to which he had been subject.
