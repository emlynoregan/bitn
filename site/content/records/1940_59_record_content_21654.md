Football Revival in Burra.  A meeting in St Mary’s Hall on Friday 18 May decided to re-form the Kooringa Football Club.  The club had been in recess since 1940, but had a substantial credit in the bank, which would give the re-formed club a good kick-off.

Elected: Patron, F. Reed; Vice-Presidents, M.T. Fuller, W. Carpenter, W. Kellaway and R.A. Bevan; Chairman, S. Kellaway Sen.; Secretary, M. Pascoe; Assistant Secretary, R. Pascoe; Coach, S. Scroop; Trainer, C. Radford. A match for Married v. Single to be arranged for Saturday 26 May if possible.
