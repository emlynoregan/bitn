Burra and District Patriotic Committee.

Procession and Sports, 14 October.  [C.A. Fuss was on the Programme Committee.]

There was an elaborate fancy dress parade with an ingeniously designed armoured motor car, Kaiser Bill, ‘Fillydelfean Troop of Akrobats’ and a host of others in fancy dress.  Some of the fun was war-related, but much was more traditional fancy dress.  [W. Vivian and R. Fuss were sailors accompanied by a bulldog – though which R. Fuss is not clear.]  The Burra Coronation Band played.  L. Kellaway was Satan, who had charge of an effigy of the Kaiser.  After the parade to Victoria Park via the Hospital, a sports day was held, the results of which are printed.  Unusually ‘catching the greasy pig re-appeared as a contest and was won by J. Ewins.  No entries were received for climbing the greasy pole.  Nett proceeds were £61-14-7.

The Patriotic Concert which followed in the Institute in the evening was packed and the admission raised £11 with 6d admission and 3d for children.
