Eli Jones died at Burra Hospital on 7 June.  He was born at Canowie on 11 November 1856, the eldest son of Mr & Mrs Jacob Jones, early colonists.  His early life was spent around Point Pass and later he was a carter between Burra & Broken Hill before the railway reached there.  In 1882 he married Miss Eliza Midwinter at Point Pass.  They settled at Baldina where he farmed for c. 35 years.  He recently retired to Kooringa.  He leaves a wife, four sons and three daughters: W.E. & E. Jones (Meribah), B. & C. Jones (Bambill Victoria), Mrs J.R. Rooke (World’s End), Mrs W.S. Delamere (Wanbi) & Mrs H. Schmidt (Kooringa).  There are 9 grandchildren.  Four sisters survive: Mrs E. Rowe (Kooringa), Mrs G. Bevan (Yunta) and Mrs D. Wilks & Mrs Evans (Broken Hill).  A brother is Mr Isaac Jones (Broken Hill).  [The paper of 19 June adds another sister: Mrs W. Erikson of Broken Hill.]
