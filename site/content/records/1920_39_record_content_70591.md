Burra Races on 13 April drew a fair attendance and the track was in good condition if a little dusty.  The revival of the club in 1936 has been more successful than anticipated by many.  The special horse train from Adelaide was one of the largest for some time for a country meeting and fields were excellent and the racing good.  Results are printed.  The main race was the Burra Handicap (£38 for 1st, £8 for 2nd & £4 for 3rd) was run over 1¼ miles and was won by R. Bradley’s br. M. Glen Anne, 6ys & carrying 7st 9lb and ridden by R. Carling.
