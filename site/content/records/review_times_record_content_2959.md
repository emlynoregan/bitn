Council Amalgamations.  There will be discussions between representatives of the Burra Burra DC and Wakefield Plains DC on 1 April to consider advantages and disadvantages of council amalgamations.  District Clerk R. Walsh said that although there were no plans to amalgamate with Wakefield Plains, future amalgamation with Hallett, Spalding or Robertstown was a possibility.  The meeting was to see how the amalgamation between Port Wakefield, Balaklava and Owen, which occurred some three years ago, had succeeded.
