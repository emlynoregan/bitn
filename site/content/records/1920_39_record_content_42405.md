Mongolata Goldfield

A meeting of the Mongolata Prospectorsâ€™ Assoc. discussed one of the companies that is alleged to be endeavouring to break down the conditions applying to miners throughout the Commonwealth.

J. Hogan has resigned as Chairman of the Association, as his duties call him elsewhere.

Mongolata Block 8 reports driving 10ft for the week and erecting an iron tank on a foundation.  The reef is still carrying fair values.  Further driving of c. 30ft is needed to strike the rich chute of ore from the open cut.
