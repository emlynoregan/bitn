Burra Off-Shears Sales last Friday were one of the largest ever.  Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd offered nearly 16,000 sheep in their second off-shears sale for this season.  Prices for wether lambs were high.  Of the 15,875 yarded 13,584 changed hands at an average of £4-9-7 per head.  [More detail is printed.]

An appeal at the sale by Mr G. Stanley Hawker for funds to aid Legacy, resulted in the donation of no less than 43 sheep by 32 owners and Legacy will benefit by £209-2-0 as a result.  When the sums to Legacy from sales by Messrs Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. are added, the charity will benefit by a total of approcimately £400.

St Mary’s Church Service next Sunday will be broadcast over 5AN.  This is Annual Temple Day when parishioners offer direct gifts to the church.    Clem Davey will be organist and Rev. R.S.T. Pettet will preach  at this sung service to ‘Merbecke’ setting of the Holy Communion.  This is the second occasion on which a service from St Mary’s has been broadcast.  The first was on 5 November 1939, when Rev. C. Gray was the Rector in Charge.
