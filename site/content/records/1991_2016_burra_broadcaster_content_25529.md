Graham Radford has had to close his Burra Trail Rides on the outskirts of the town because his public liability insurance has risen from $150 to $9000 in just two years.  Once gone, it will be hard to reinstate the business, as it takes years to get a good team of horses together.  Rising public liability insurance premiums have also seen the shelving of plans for Burra Picnic Races at Thistlebeds in 2002.
