The Burra Racing Club’s meeting on Wednesday last was conducted in perfect weather and proved to be the best in the history of the club.  Starting stalls were used for the first time in Burra and proved most successful.

Quinella betting was introduced and proved quite popular as £465 was invested and in the tote investments were £997, an increase of £750 on the previous meeting.  Bookmakers’ holdings of £39,000 were up £20,000 on 1959, showing that better types of horses brought a greater following of punters.

[The races are reviewed and the results printed.]
