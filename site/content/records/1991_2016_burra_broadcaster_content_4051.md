Redruth Gaol is to be painted, beginning in September.  It is acknowledged as the Trustâ€™s most visited site in this state, with an average of 30,000 visitors each year.  It is well known from its association with the filming of Breaker Morant.  The security system will be upgraded and the two projects will cost c. $20,000.
