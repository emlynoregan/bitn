Youth Occupation Committee

A meeting at the Council Chamber last Thursday formed a committee to deal with the question of providing some sort of occupation for unemployed youths.  The Governor had acted to get a conference in Adelaide on the issue.  The Adelaide Conference discussed the setting up of local committees.  The Government has agreed to contribute £ for £ for money raised locally to a total of £5,000.  Sir Langdon Bonython has contributed £1,000 to the Central Committee.  The original name was Youth Welfare League, but later correspondence bears the name Youth Occupational League.  It was suggested instruction might be given in swimming, boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, running, jumping, cricket, football, tennis, etc.  The idea was to keep unemployed youth morally and physically fit until employment opportunities opened up.  Unfortunately Burra had no night school or the like.  The Mayor said he was not there to attack Government policy, but he clearly felt there was an inconsistency with the above and the Government’s decision to cut High School expenditure.  Mr Bednall also saw this inconsistency, but there was no harm in forming a committee and so one was formed comprising: Dr Steele, Rev. Hutchinson, Rev. Redding, Messrs A.B. Riggs, A.L. Walker, R.V. Warnes, H.J.B. Jennison & F.L. Worth.  There was some discussion suggesting the committee needed more practical men as opposed to professional and sporting representatives, but the committee felt it would requisition such when plans were evolved.  A call will be made for unemployed youths to enrol.
