Redruth Correspondent wonders why there has been no move to get workingmenâ€™s blocks set out near Burra.  Many of those engaged in droving are not employed full-time and are living from hand to mouth.  A series of blocks on good land with good soil and water near the station would give them a good income and benefit the town.
