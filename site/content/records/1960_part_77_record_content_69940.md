Burra Burra DC

Recent flood damage has forced a re-ordering of priorities on roadwork.  Priority will have to be given to repairing school bus routes for instance.

Advice has been received that no subsidy for a Gold Clubhouse can be allocated in this financial year. Plans must first be drawn up and then the matter will receive further consideration.

The Council is aiming to improve the standard of some of the low rental homes in the town and an inspection of some of them was ? made on 19 February by representatives of SA Housing Trust, Department of Health & Welfare, MPs, Curator of Relics, National Trust and the Council.

Details of the townâ€™s planned common effluent system will be released soon.

Council has received the title to the Farrell Flat Institute and a committee of management is being appointed.
