Health Advisory Council

Presiding member of the LNHAC Tony Gwynn-Jones said the reforms have changed significantly from those first proposed.  The State Government had originally proposed one Board for all rural SA, but this was incompatible with the Commonwealth idea that there be local control.  The State has yet to respond.  There are two vacancies on LNHAC and there is an advertisement about them in the paper this week.  Mr Gwynn-Jones encouraged people to think about becoming involved.
