Burra Town Council

At the last meeting of Council the Mayor read a clause from Standing Orders that he termed the ‘new ones’.  But the Standing Orders, Rules and Regulations of the Corporation date from Monday August 21 1882 and to be changed they need to be altered in accordance with the Municipal Corporations Act 1890 and to be published in the Government Gazette.  There are no new Standing Orders.

Queensland Relief Fund.  A meeting will be held on 17 February in the Institute to establish a fund to aid those affected by the recent floods.

Burra Institute Committee.  Mr Holder will be in Melbourne on 15 February so will be unable to chair Miss Spence’s lecture.  Dr Brummitt will preside.  The attention of police will be drawn to the behaviour of larrikins at concerts.

Burra Mine.

The Mount Barker paper reporter considers that the purchasers of the Burra Mine got a bargain as it has only been worked to 450 feet in a confined area of 18 acres.  More should lie beyond the length and breadth worked.  The Kangarilla mine was sold in England for £60,000.

Burra Town Council.

On 6 February Cr Kitchen asked if it was all right for the Waterworks engineer, Mr Littlejohn, to go across to the Bon Accord Hotel while the engine was in motion.

Cr Parks said if a charge was made it should be substantiated instead of asking such a question.
