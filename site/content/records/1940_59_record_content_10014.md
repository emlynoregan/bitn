The Anzac Commemorative Service was held on Sunday afternoon in Market Square.

In places the cars were four deep.  The Caledonian Pipe Band led the march from the RSL Club to the Hospital and then back to the War Memorial.  Leading the returned men were the President of the local RSL Mr S.C. Genders and Warrant Officer Warren of Terowie.  Sister Keynes nee Armstrong was also present.

Mr Eric Murray led the Home Guard and Mrs A. Tennant the Red Cross Aids and Transport Drivers.  Girl Guides followed with Divisional Commander Mrs R.C. Lott.

Rev. C. Gray (Anglican) led the service assisted by Rev. H.K. Bartlett (Methodist) and Captain Gannoway (Salvation Army).  The threatening rain held of until the minute of closing when it came in a deluge and scattered the crowd to cars and nearby verandahs.
