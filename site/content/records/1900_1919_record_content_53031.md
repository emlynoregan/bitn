For my comments on the foregoing and the Board’s letter to me of 11 August 1917 appointing me Honorary Surgeon Mr Winnall has launched an action for libel against me.  The writ was served after I left the meeting, which I attended on the invitation of the Chief Secretary.

He then goes on to discuss mention of ‘cupidity’ against ‘one of the Medical Officers’ and the case mentioned before where it was alleged he unreasonably sought payment from a servant.  He denies any improper or inappropriate actions.

‘I regret that until the subsequent development of the libel action is disposed of, bygones cannot be bygones nor do I think that matters offensive to me, where they touch the feeling of a gentleman, should be treated as bygones until the Board show by their readiness to extinguish all offensive significance (if any) about such matters, that they are also prepared to treat them as bygones.’
