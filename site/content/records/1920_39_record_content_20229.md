Boys Wireless Club was formed when 17 boys gathered at the RSL rooms on 28 July.  The idea is to teach boys to build their own sets and later a transmitter and to give talks on wireless and its role in society.  The management committee comprises: Rev. R.H. Lee, W.R. Lee, H. Jennison, G.H. Dow, J. Arthur, M.S. Edwards, and Master Wilfred Hann as Secretary/Treasurer.
