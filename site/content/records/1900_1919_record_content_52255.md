Burra Town Council.

Members of Council expressed their general view that they did not really approve of long terms of office for the mayoralty, but under the circumstances of war and with Mr Crewes’ tremendous energy and self-sacrifice they thought he should be supported for another year.  [At least thus for Crs Dane, McWaters & Radford.  Cr Harris hoped Mr Crewes would be returned and the views of Crs McBride and J.C. Killicoat are not reported – the latter being absent.]

Mr Crewes said he would willingly stand aside if another candidate would come forward, but one man approached had declined.
