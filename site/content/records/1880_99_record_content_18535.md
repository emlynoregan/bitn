2nd Leader on the ‘Causes and Cure of the Commercial Depression’. 

‘It is an age of lightning speed this nineteenth century of ours, and an age too of outside show and haste to be as rich as seems, while always seeming a little more than is real.’

Waste is all around in Government buildings.  In many places a single building could house the railway station, police station and the post and telegraph office, etc.
