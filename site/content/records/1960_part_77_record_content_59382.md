Councillors and the ladies in the Parents & Friends’ Association have given the school great support and are thanked for it.  Parents & Friends’ Assoc. will conduct a sale of second-hand school uniforms during the Learn-to-Swim Campaign in January.  The four pie, pasty and soup days raised considerable money and a record amount was taken at the school ball.  I would enter a plea for more mothers to attend the regular meetings and to spread the work load.

Purchases this year were fewer due to some uncertainties about subsidies, which have only just been resolved.  Nevertheless the year saw over $200 spent on library books, two Maths Laboratory Kits, a kit to aid spelling and nine sets of headphones for a listening post.  The Parents & Friends’ Association’s healthy bank balance will be needed when the school moves to its new position and some items will no longer be shared with the Primary School.

The plans for the new school have been sighted and were forwarded to the Public Works Standing Committee in September.  The new school envisages open unit class areas, an activity room, facilities for typing, home science, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, and art as well as a library and assembly hall and change room facilities for physical education.  Meanwhile an annex to the Science Laboratory and installation of ceiling fans in wooden buildings has improved the existing school.

Excursions this year included Adelaide, Flinders Ranges, World’s End creek, River Murray irrigation and packing systems and Wirrabara Forest, as well as several local visits, including to the Mine.  The usual sporting activities were held through the year, including a Swimming Carnival and a Sports Day.  The Interschool Athletics were successfully held on the second attempt after being washed out on the first.  Burra came second in the Handicap Shield for the third year in succession.  There was also a lightning carnival for winter sports.

I pay tribute to all those teachers and parents who put in so much extra time to make the school’s sporting activities successful and thank the Burra Burra DC for use of the town oval and the Aberdeen Tennis Club and the Convent for the use of their courts and the Burra Primary School for use of their facilities.

The Leaving PEB results last year were good and the 88% Grade IV or better subject results compere with 75% state-wide.  Two third year students have recently been awarded Commonwealth Scholarships: Monica Hillman and Michael Carmody.  Two Leaving students won Commonwealth Technical Scholarships: Ann Hillman & Russell Disher.  Next year French will flow to third year after a successful start in the first two years.  A scheme to enable ‘2’ track students to do a limited Leaving in Burra from 1973 will be continued.  (Limited in the sense that their subject choice will be limited to subjects chosen for them.)  Staff transfers known at present are:

Mr West to Blackwood

Mr Salt to Christies Beach

Miss Pfitzner to Northfield

Mrs Allen is resigning from teaching
