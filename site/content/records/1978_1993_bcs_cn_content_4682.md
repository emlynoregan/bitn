Burra District Advisory Committee

The draft of the directional plate for the lookout was approved by the committee and now goes to Council for approval.  (Drawn up by Des Woolley and John Brak.)

The future of the Mine Pool was discussed â€“ recreational possibilities and perhaps stocking it with fish and weed.

The possible use of the slime dump as a rubbish depot was also considered.

The recently restored Market Square pump was heartily approved, but it was thought the concrete trough ought to be set in original Burra stone, rather than lie on the lawn as it is.

Burra National Trust plans a second tour of historic homesteads.  This year will include Princess Royal, Martindale Hall, Wolta Wolta and Inchiquin on Sunday 27 September by bus from the Civic Centre at 9.30 a.m.
