Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting

The meeting at the Council Chambers last Tuesday was poorly attended.

The Mayor, Mr H.J. B. Jennison gave a 50 minute address on the work of the Council during the year.

He said they had to make the unpopular move of raising the rates to 3/8, but this had been necessary due to rising costs.    The revenue had totalled £3,167-15-11 and although much work had been done, the overdraft had been reduced by approximately £300.  The debit balance at 10 June 1947 had been £621-13-10.

Receipts for the Town Hall for the year had been £583-5-5, but the debit for the year amounted to an increase of £26-15-3.  To offset this the cottage at the rear had been renovated and with repairs to the hall had cost £225, plus £23 for new stoves.  The Lodge Room had been renovated and leased to the CWA.  The exterior to the Town Hall still needed painting.

Council had made best use of the funds available for both local and district roads and had managed to get the SAR to pay for reconditioning the road from the station to Morehead Street.

Other improvements in the town included a new residence for the Head Teacher of the High School.  Mr A.D. Aldam had erected a garage and the parklands had been cleaned up.  Assistance had been given to the Aberdeen and Kooringa Tennis Clubs.

The Cemetery was in good order and the Council was paying the Curator £52 per annum.

On the health front 35 children had been immunized against diphtheria, with 160 applying for treatment on 26 June.  Steps have been taken to get a modern septic sewage system at the Burra Hospital and at the school.  Discussions with the Lewis Trust will see better facilities for residents in Paxton Square as materials become available.

The Council’s contribution to the Fire Brigade had risen from £88 in 1946 to £112 this year.

Ratepayers had decided to make the conversion of Victoria Park into a first class recreation area their War Memorial Project, but regrettably the response to the Committee’s appeal for funds has been very slow.  The plaques bearing the names of the WWII fallen were nearly ready for re-erection on the memorial.

A bushfire siren is being installed jointly by the Corporation and the District Council and Council was installing two hydrants for the quick filling of fire-fighting tanks at convenient centres.

Difficulty in obtaining labour has restricted tree planting this year.

The Mayor thanked the Buffalo Lodge for putting up the Christmas Tree for the town’s children.

He also thanked Mr Sid Johnson for the job of getting some of the boys physically fit at his small gymnasium and teaching them the noble art of self-defence.

The Mayor congratulated the incoming Mayor and Councillors.

Cr S.J. Woollacott, who is retiring from Council, was the only Councillor present.  He congratulated the Mayor on his term in office.  He said Burra was a costly town to work because it was so scattered.  He favoured combining the Town and District Councils in order to have sufficient funds to buy necessary equipment.  He had hoped by now to see the Town Hall debt liquidated.

In coming Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston also congratulated the Mayor on his work.  It had been a difficult two year term, when many people had thought the end of the war would see an easy return to pre-war days, but prices for materials and wages had risen sharply, making it necessary to keep a firm check on Council expenditure.  The Council bank overdraft had risen to £630, but should be back to about £300 by the end of June 1948.  The largest amount on overdraft was £1,000.

He said a major difficulty was that a fresh assessment of the Corporation area had not been made for many years.  The Act required a new assessment every seven years.  The Burra Council was operating on an assessment which had been made in about 1930 – the depression years.  Since then property values had increased considerably and this meant a huge rate had to be imposed.

Last year the Council had tried to get the services of a valuator, but without result.  He would try his best to get a new assessment during his term in office and that would see the rate burden more evenly distributed and provide a more solid base for Council finances.

He believed Council needed to buy some road making machinery, especially to work on back streets, which were in a deplorable condition.  [He developed this point at some length, referring to Government assistance currently available.]

He believed poisoning the weeds was a more cost effective way of eliminating growth in watertables than the current skimming process.

He was anxious to see the War Memorial plans realised and would work for their completion.

He was also anxious to see the Town Hall mortgage paid off.

He and Mrs Marston would also do whatever they could to further the Civic and Social life of the town.

Mr Carpenter as candidate for West Ward congratulated the Mayor on his term in office.  He would like to see all dead trees replaced.  He did not favour borrowing money for road-making machinery.  Someone should start an industry in Burra.  He had renovated several houses in Burra and five of them were occupied by returned soldiers.  He was behind the town’s children, but believed they sometimes got into mischief in the holidays.  They should be provided some organised religious instruction in that period and opportunities for some sport.  He criticised the cleanliness of parts of the town and was wholeheartedly behind the recreational facilities of Burra.

D.H. Field, the other candidate for West Ward, also congratulated the Mayor and said if elected he would carry out his duties to the best of his abilities and had the welfare of the town at heart.

J. Fisher, the incoming Councillor for North Ward congratulated the Mayor and Mayoress on their achievements and also congratulated Cr S.J. Woollacott as retiring Chairman of Public Works.
