Thomas Pickett plaque restored.

After being missing for more than two years the plaque on Thomas Pickett’s Memorial Stone was replaced last Thursday.  Members of the National Trust and the Regional Council of Goyder gathered for the occasion.  [National Trust Chairman,] Paul Marsson arrived with the plaque and the material to make it adhere to the stone.  The stone was first erected in 1977 by the National Trust and the site was chosen for its proximity to the place where Thomas Pickett’s shepherd’s hut stood on Diprose Creek, Basin Farm. Pickett’s discovery of copper ore led to the establishment of the Burra Mine in 1845.  Little is known of him except that he was a shepherd and bullock driver and by 1842 was working for William Robinson of Gum Creek Station.  He was barely rewarded for his discovery and it was only after an appeal from the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel that the Mining Association agreed to fund his funeral expenses.
