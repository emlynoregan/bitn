Boer War.  There was a welcome home social for Trooper Clem Treloar, to which Trooper Martin was also invited.  E.W. Crewes presided at the Institute which was nicely decorated with flags etc.  Present also were Troopers C. Packard (of Burra) and P. Richardson (of Saddleworth).  There were speeches from the Mayor, Rev. W.G.M. Murphy, Rev. Father Reddan, Dr Sangster, W.G. Hawkes, and Rev. W.G. Clarke.  Trooper Treloar responded and so did Mr H. Martin.
