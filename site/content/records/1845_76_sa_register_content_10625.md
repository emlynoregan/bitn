Flood at Burra

On Saturday afternoon 25 April a number of persons were standing outside Barker’s Hotel [The Burra Burra Hotel] when they saw a large volume of water rushing from the west towards the hotel.  Within a few moments half of Mr Barker’s garden was under water.  People were dashing about, getting children and anything that might be swept away out of the dry bed of the creek.  In less than a quarter of an hour the water level had risen so that the main street was one continuous torrent.  One or two houses were flooded to a depth of about one foot.  The bridge between Commercial Street and the Post Office, comprising three large and heavy logs, was completely swept away, together with some fencing and stonework.  It was fortunate that the event occurred in daylight, or more damage would have been done.  As it was prompt action was taken to keep water out of cellars etc.  Interestingly Burra had been quite dry and although it had rained heavily within a mile or two, the town had experienced only one very slight shower.
