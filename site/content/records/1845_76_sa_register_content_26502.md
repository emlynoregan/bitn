  Rain, hail and snow are the order of the day.  A two-hour snow storm swept in from the southwest last Saturday.  The snow lasted till Sunday night, making the hills very picturesque.  Farmers are busy fallowing, fencing and clearing, but crops are backward due to the cold.  Fortunately almost all last year’s grain has been despatched, because the roads are now in a wretched state.  A District Council is needed – a shilling rate could at least make creek crossings passable.
