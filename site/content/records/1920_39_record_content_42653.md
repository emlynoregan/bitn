Obituary.  John Collins.  As a boy he was bright, cheerful and full of pranks.  He worked on his father’s farm.  He drove a team of horses at an early age.  He finished his education with Mr Cole, head teacher at Watervale Grammar School.  In the ministry of the late Rev. James Pearce he became a member of the old Mt Bryan Church.  He later married Miss Catherine Simpson of Burra railway station and they lived for some time on his father’s property at Mt Bryan East.  Later still he secured 14,000 acres near Ketchowla and a portion of Dare’s Swamp and lived there in a pine hut with his wife and two or three children.  A great season in 1889 put him on his feet.  Dingoes were bad then and had to be controlled by trapping and the employment at times of an expert dogger.  Rabbits were also a problem and netting fences were extensively employed.  The little pine hut was replaced by one of the best stations for miles around with comfortable living places on out-stations and fruit and flower gardens.  For many years cheques to aid the poor of Burra have come in at Christmas time from John Collins and the Dearloves.
