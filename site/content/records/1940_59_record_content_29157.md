The writer believes that unless 25% of the floodwaters pass through the floodgates the pond would silt up in two or three floods.  The proposed 300 ton weir would not retain the impounded 31,250 tons of water.  He then goes on to speculate on a 50 ft high weir opposite St Joseph’s that could generate HEP and allow the town to prosper as a result.  [Details in ⅔ column.]
