Burra Town Council, 1 November

Mr Blunt applied to purchase a piece of land adjacent to his residence in St Just St.  It was thought that this was not within their power.  The Town Clerk is to interview Mr Blunt.

The Minister for Public works invites applications for post war projects between £5,000 and £10,000.

Cr Fisher wanted a light placed in the street leading to the Burra North Oddfellows’ Hall.
