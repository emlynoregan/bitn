Burra Fighting Forces Comfort Fund Unit 109

The annual meeting of Unit 109 was held on 16 December.  Appointed for the next year were: President, Mrs A. Tennant; Vice-Presidents, Mrs S. Genders & Mrs J. Barker; Secretary, Mrs F. Sims; Assistant Secretary, Mrs F.T. Marston and Treasurer, Mrs C.J. Butler.

The FFCF has the aim of providing active members of the fighting forces with a few of the comforts they forego while on active service.  As well as comforts and knitted garments it provides hostels and recreation rooms, arranges for leave and when necessary provides board and travelling for men on leave.

Each man is given an embarkation kit comprising a calico bag, 3 handkerchiefs, 2 singlets, 2 pairs of socks, 2 cakes of salt water soap, washing soap, barley sugar, razor blades, tooth brush and paste, a soldierâ€™s note book and writing material.

A Christmas Hamper is sent to each man comprising, cake, pudding, tobacco and papers, tooth brush and paste, razor blades, condensed cream, preserved fruits and a handkerchief.

The cost of each is only 7/6.

The Burra North Unit, which was combined with Burra under one registration, has now (from September) registered as a separate unit, but the Advisory Committee of Burra, Burra North and RSA Wives Units will enable the three to keep in touch and will prove invaluable for the Anzac Sports.

The unit has presently 57 names on the roll (reduced somewhat following removals from the town).

Average attendance at meetings has been 30.
