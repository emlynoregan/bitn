Bon Accord Museum

The Director of the SA Museum Dr W. Gran Inglis visited Burra yesterday to meet the Burra Branch of the National Trust and to inspect the proposed site for the museum at the Bon Accord Mine buildings.  He thought the buildings could become one of the biggest drawcards in the future of tourism in Burra.  He inspected the site with Mr L. Moore President of the Burra Branch and Mr R.K .Pearse President of the Merino Stud Breeders Association.  He said the exhibition relating to the Merino Studs of the district could well be of more importance than the mining relics; located at the centre of the SA Merino Stud area, it could assume national importance.
