Obituary.  Mrs Catherine Bock died 29 June after a few days serious illness, though she had been ailing for the last three years.  A week before her death she had a paralytic stroke.  She came to Burra in 1855 and married the late Theodore Bock in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill.  Her husband, who preceded her to Burra, worked at the old brewery next to the original Burra Hotel now the Hospital and later at the Unicorn Brewery.  Mrs Bock died under the same roof where she had her first engagement as a domestic servant.  She leaves three daughters and two sons: Mrs Cousins (Adelaide), Mrs W.I. Ker (Burra), Mrs F. Ker (Bundaleer), John (Broken Hill) and Theodore (WA).
