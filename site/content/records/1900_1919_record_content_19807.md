Copper Find.  Messrs Geach, Cartwright & W. West Sen. have found a well-defined copper lode of high grade ore (samples 25%) about half a mile south of the Princess Royal.  It runs north-south and is some eight feet wide.  Copper is present in green carbonate, blue [word missing] and black oxide and yellow ore.  It is eight miles south of Burra with a good road.  A long lease has been secured and a syndicate will be formed directly.
