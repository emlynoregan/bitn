The MFS has been asked by Council to restrict its activities to the occupied area of the Burra Township, rather than the old Burra Corporation boundary.  This includes the Princess Royal and some adjoining farmland.

[This is an odd statement as while the Princess Royal may have been within the area being served by the MFS in 1994, it was not within the old Burra Corporation boundary.]
