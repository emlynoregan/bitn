Bowling Season Opens.  About 100 people including some 60 bowlers attended the opening of the new season by Mr J.M. Gebhardt near the Marston Memorial Entrance.  The opening marks the 40th anniversary of the Burra Bowling Club and it was thus appropriate that the son of the Club’s first President (Mr Albert Gebhardt) should have accepted the invitation to open the new season.

The Associate’s President Mrs Syd Pearce rolled the first kitty and Club Patron Mr Eddie Finch delivered the first bowl and Mrs Baulderstone raised the Club Pennant.
