‘Short & Sharp’

Works at the Smelts are being pushed on and in due course the smelter will be ready for use.

Burra Automobile Club is going ahead very nicely and the first trip is being looked forward to with great interest.

Burra Town Council, 21 January.

Tar dressing was approved for Sudgman St [sic: for Ludgvan St] from the Wesleyan Church to Tancreed St [sic: for Sancreed St] on the north side and from Farrell’s to Tancreed St on the south side.

Also for Bridge Terrace from Kingston St to Bridge St and Thames St from Commercial St to the Bridge on the western side.  [This description appears to refer to the footpaths.]

Other routine matters were dealt with.
