Obituary.  Mr S. Drew of the firm of S. Drew & Co. of Kooringa has died at the early age of 42.  He arrived in SA on the Lalla Rookh in 1840 when aged about 13.  He came here in charge of an uncle, Mr Edward Drew who died at Glen Osmond a few years ago.  He was first employed in Adelaide by Mr W. Paxton.  A few years later he moved to Kooringa, where he was employed by Mr John James, a Burra storekeeper.  Over 20 years ago he began in partnership with Mr Young under the style S. Drew & Co. and the company had been very fortunate.  His partner left for England in the Duke of Sutherland six months ago and is expected to return by the St Vincent.  The business is being managed by a younger brother of Mr Drew.  The deceased had been in failing health for the past year and some time ago moved to North Adelaide.  He is survived by a widow and nine children and had several brothers and other relatives.  [Samuel Drew born 28 August 1827 Somerset: died 23 September 1869 North Adelaide.]
