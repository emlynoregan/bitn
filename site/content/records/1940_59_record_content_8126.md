Burra Town Council, 7 November

The Highways Department advised that the contract for the tanks at Hanson [for the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline] had been let to C.H. Martin Ltd and 14,000 yards of stone would be required.

His Worship said this did not mean that the stone would come from the Aberdeen Quarry.

The Council discussed the letter from A.B. Riggs: advising that the subscribers to the Burra Institute had held two meetings as required and voted to offer the Institute to the Corporation for the amount of the liability to the State Bank on the day the Corporation took over, provided the Corporation would give free use to the Library Committee of the two rooms now in use and also honour the Picture Show agreement.

The majority took the view that when they had agreed to purchase the building they did so without any stipulations or provisos being attached.

It was resolved that the matter stand in abeyance pending further information.
