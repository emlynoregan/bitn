Burra Town Council, 3 April

Dog poisoning was discussed.

The Inspector said 26 blocks in the town were unclaimed and the question was what to do.  The problem was that many had been unclaimed for up to 20 years and had been accumulating Council Rates, Water Rates and Land Tax.  This would make them unsaleable because the buyer would become responsible.

The Town Clerk will write to the Tax Commissioner to have the matter defined.  It was suggested that the Council rates be written off.

Cr Sampson moved that the motion making Mr Voumard a casual hand be rescinded.  He had not realised that the motion deprived him of holidays at a loss of £6-6-0 and that he had to continue to feed the horse involving some 100 hours of work.

Cr Bevan strongly opposed rescinding and after considerable discussion the motion was lost.

There was discussion about the culvert near the railway.  [To the saleyards.]

Burra Rifle Club shot the 16th stage of the Jennison Trophy and best scores were from H.H. Byles & R. Nutt.

Hanson Soldiers Memorial Institute held its first AGM 29 March.

The President reported that though the committee had been at work 12 months there was not much to show on the ground, but matters had been put on a firm footing.  The Hanson Institute was now a member of the Institutes Assoc. of SA.  The lowest price obtained was £275 fully lined, ceiled and with a jarrah floor.  At present they were in credit £175.  Re-elected were President M.J. Marchant and Secretary G. Pattullo.
