Guy Fawkes Day has not yet arrived, but already ‘young cannon’ are being exploded in the streets and in some cases accidents only narrowly averted.  One bomb exploding under a car on the Black Bridge caused the driver to swerve, only barely missing the side of the bridge.  Letting off fireworks in the street is an offence.
