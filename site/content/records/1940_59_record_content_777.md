Motor Accident.  Sunday night returning from Chalk Cliffs, a motor truck descending the grade near Baldina Creek seems to have suffered a locked steering gear and dropped over the bank 20â€™ into Baldina Creek.  The driver was Cyril Moore and the passengers Messrs Stanley Moore, Ron Bowen & Mrs Althorp.  Stanley had a gruelling walk in the dark to get help, but while he was gone a passing car brought the injured into the hospital.
