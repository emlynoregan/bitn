Burra Golf Club is upgrading its course.  A dam is being built to be fed via causeways [sic] and the length and difficulty of the course is being increased.  The club is also looking at the possibility of an underground sprinkler system for the entire course.  This would allow for an extended season with stable green fairways and perhaps greens rather than sand scrapes in the future.
