Burra Town Council, 21 August

SA Farmers’ Union have renovated their offices and ask for a tree in front to be removed.  Granted.

The road in front of the hospital has been widened.

Cr Jeffery said the decision to move one light from near Leunig’s Bakery to Railway Terrace was wrong because all lights at the spot were needed, as it was a rough place frequently used by old people.

The Mayor admitted a mistake, but nevertheless there were seven lights at that end of town and only two at the railway end and it was a matter of distribution.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Mrs McLaren.
