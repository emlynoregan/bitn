Football.  Mid North League

‘A’ Grade	Auburn v. Robertstown [To be decided by delegates.]

Aberdeen 13.15 defeated SM United 2.7

Riverton 11.17 defeated Min-Man 0.1*

Riverton 11.14 defeated Min-Man 9.5*

‘B’ Grade	Aberdeen 6.6 defeated SM United 4.1*

SM United 7.9 defeated Aberdeen 0.1*

Riverton 5.9 defeated Min-Man 0.2

Auburn v. Robertstown [To be decided by delegates.]

Junior Colts	Aberdeen 4.5 defeated SM United 2.2

Riverton 7.10 defeated Min-Man 1.2

*These results do not make sense.  The absence of Colts results would suggest they are mixed with the above.  In the ‘A’ Grade the description says Riverton won by 31 points and this fits neither of the results, but perhaps the second of them is the ‘A’ Grade and the first the Colts.  In the ‘B’ Grade the match was described as evenly contested with Aberdeen winning, so perhaps the first is the ‘B’ Grade and the second the Colts, but that can only be speculation.
