Redruth Court 9 March.

Firth sued Knevett for slander, alleging that Knevett had said that Firth could well afford to undercut Knevett’s charges for carting wheat as he took some of the load to feed his horses.  Knevett denied the charge, but the verdict was for the plaintiff for £10 + costs.

John Sampson Jun., who had bought the Spalding mail run from Opie said that the price included four horses of which only two had been delivered in a reasonable time and when they were ultimately offered they were in such a bad condition that he would not take delivery of them.  Verdict for plaintiff £10 + costs.

Warrick sued the Commissioner of Railways to do certain work to restore a water supply to his land on either side of the railway line, such supply having been disrupted by its construction. Such work was ordered to be done and the defendant to pay £15-15-0 costs.
