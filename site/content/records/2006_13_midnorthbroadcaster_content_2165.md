Burra Effluent Ponds

Goyder Council is considering establishing a wetlands as a further stage of the effluent treatment system in Burra.  Some residents are concerned about nutrients entering the Burra Creek and about smells after rain and a southeast wind.  The construction of a further effluent dam has been a hot topic of late.  Asset manager, Trevor Wood, says the new dam is part of the total project Council has been working on for years.  Water leaving the ponds is tested regularly to ensure it is of a quality suitable for specific agricultural irrigation purposes.  The Burra lagoons were constructed in 2003 and recently Council became aware that treated water entering Burra Creek may have led to an algal bloom.  Testing proved this not to be the cause.  To ensure strict compliance with the health and environment guidelines, the new dam was being constructed. A re-use irrigation system is being considered and possibly a wetland area on the cemetery extension allotment.
