Burra High School.  A group of students went to Kangaroo Island during the September holidays.  They flew to and from the island.  On day 1 they went on a fishing trip and in the afternoon visited Stokes Bay & Emu; two of the beaches.  On day 2 they visited Kelly Hill Caves on the South Coast and in the afternoon Vivonne Bay and Baile’s Beach.  Other places visited were Flinders Chase, Rocky River, Cape de Couedic, American River, Penneshaw and Cape Willoughby.

At the beginning of this term Miss P. Wilkinson came from Pt Adelaide Girls’ Technical HS to replace Mrs Wilson, who resigned as teacher of Girls’ Craft.

The Parents & Friends’ Association will meet on Thursday to try to get fathers more involved and to discuss the project of erecting a recreation room for students.

The annual Junior School Camp this year will be at the Diocesan Centre at Melrose 8-10 November.
