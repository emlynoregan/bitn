Milton Tiddy left Burra some years ago, but many will remember him as a singer of merit.  He will be singing over 5CL’s Eisteddfod Hour between 7.30 and 8.00 p.m. on Tuesday 17 February.  He left Burra in 1936 and became a founding member of the Adelaide Philharmonic Choir.  Another Burraite in that choir is Mrs Arthur Harris (Miss Bessie Woollacott).  Mr George Hann belongs to the Adelaide symphony Orchestra.
