The 5th annual meeting of the branch was held on 14 September in the Wesleyan Chapel at Kooringa with excellent attendance.  Mr R.B. Robinson, who founded the branch, was voted to the chair.  Rev. Flockart’s report showed the branch to be flourishing.  In the year 345 copies of the scripture had been issued and since its origin 2,189 [the 8 is speculative; being illegible in the text.] have been disposed of.  The past year had seen more subscriptions than any other as well as a £30 donation.  They had in hand £13-11-7.  Spirited addresses were given by Rev. Palmer and Rev. Keen, the deputation from Adelaide, and by Rev. Whittaker, Rev. Way, Mr Williams, Mr Stephens and Mr Dale.
