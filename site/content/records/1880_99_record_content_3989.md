Obituary and Inquest.  Thomas Roach, aged 32, died at Gum Creek in a fall from his horse on 24 April.  J.D. Cave was coroner and Mr E. Goodridge foreman of the jury.  George Edward Young gave evidence as an employer & manager of Gum Creek Station.  Much detail is given, but essentially John Walter Betts, a stonebreaker working on the Gum Ck-Hanson road, saw a riderless horse in the hands of Thomas Leonard, near his tent.  He sent the boy, John Leonard, to find the rider who was found lying near the road.  Evidence was then tendered of how the deceased was cared for.

Dr Brummitt examined the injured man and found no evidence of a skull fracture and no sign he had been dragged along the ground.  He appeared to be suffering from internal brain haemorrhage which resulted in his death on Saturday.

Other evidence came from Thomas Leonard, road labourer, and George Gould, boundary rider at Pascoe’s Hut, 5 miles from Gum Ck and 3 from Hanson.

Thomas James Barrett, licensed victualler of Hanson (i.e. Farrell’s Flat) said the deceased was not drunk when he left there, having had about four glasses of beer through the day.

Verdict was accidental death.  The jury gave their fees to the widow.  [Age registered as 52.]
