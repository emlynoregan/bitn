Rain.  Since Sunday 0.88” has fallen in the best rain for the season and the Burra Creek has begun to run.

At last it has rained at Baldina with over 1” in the last week.  The falls extend to Mongolata, Koomooloo and World’s End.

C. Duell brought in a sample of barley grown at Islington c. 80 miles from Burra.  It is 3’9” high and will grow another 18” before harvest.  It is from a crop of 30 acres.
