Rev. Wightwick managed to photograph the last two ex-tributers still at work on some ore bearing stuff at the mine - Tom Kellaway and his son Stan.  [Then c. 21 years old.]

Tom has worked there for many years and his five sons have all struggled for an existence on the property.  Tom ‘worked there when it stopped, and have worked there ever since, and have seen almost every movement of the ground’.  He will now be seen in England on the screen on a lanternslide.
