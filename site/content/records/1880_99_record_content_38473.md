Burra Town Council.

The Railway Commissioners have decided on interlocking the station yard and will arrange for a crossing gate at the same time.  [The previous advice had been for a gong so be cautious about what eventuated.]

Mr Geake’s tender for 23/- for mowing the oval was accepted.

The Waterworks report was unavailable due to the breakage at the works and the pumps not working well.  It was decided to ask for six new pumps to be obtained and added to the capital account.
