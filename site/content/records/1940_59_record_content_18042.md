Mr C.J. Butler, the retiring manager of the Bank of Australasia, was farewelled on Friday afternoon when he was presented with a roll of notes totalling £50 from the citizens of the town.  The Mayor presided over the function in Pearce’s Buildings.  He had lived in Burra for 14 years.  Through the depression he had been very fair with all his dealings and would be greatly missed in the sporting and social life of the town.  The new manager Mr Dobson was welcomed as an old Burraite.  Other speakers were Mr R. Smith, Mr S.C. Genders (Manager of the National Bank), Mr Bednall, Mr L.H. Thomas, Mr Ken Drew (Goldsbrough, Mort), Rev. Barrett, Mr Len Gordon, Mr Mickel (Farrell Flat) & E.C. Collins (Mt Bryan).
