Court.

William C. Matthews was charged with breaking panes of glass in the old Bible Christian Church.  Since the church has been abandoned no less than 100 panes have been broken by boys.  Matthews was fined £1 + costs to a total of £3-1-0, or 14 days, and had to do the latter as he could not pay.
