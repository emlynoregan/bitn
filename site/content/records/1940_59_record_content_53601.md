Mr Marston believed the Gebhardt Estate money could be used for that.  It was not available for building other than Nurses Quarters.  The Key point is that accommodation for patients is reasonably good, but for nurses is not good at all.  He thought Nurses’ accommodation should be attended to now and additions to the main hospital be deferred until wages and the cost of materials levelled out.  If agreed to, the question of fund-raising would then arise.

Mr Andrew Tennant then moved that the Fund-raising Committee’s offer be accepted and first priority be the provision of good backs and bathrooms for the Men’s and Women’s Wards and second priority be accommodation for nurses.  Mrs Ashton seconded the motion.  Mr W. Carpenter spoke in support as did Dr Heddle.  The motion was carried.

Mr Earle then outlined a proposal to raise money by getting landowners to give the hospital the use of an area of their land for cultivation of say 20-50 acres of barley to be sold for the benefit of the fund.  The owner would benefit from fodder grass sown with the grain and from the stubble for feed.  Similar schemes worked well elsewhere.  Another fund raiser was similar to the way Legacy raised funds from selling sheep at local markets.  Both schemes will be put to the Fund-raising Committee.
