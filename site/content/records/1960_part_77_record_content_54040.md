Carol Night.  The Annual ‘Burra Festival of Carols’ will be held on the Sunday before Christmas, 20 December.  Proceeds will go to the Save the Children Fund this year.  Rev. John Stephenson will act as compere.  As in the past years children of St Joseph’s Convent will present a mimed tableau of the Nativity of Christ.  This will be the last year the tableau will be presented by the Convent children and the Sisters themselves will be unable to see it, as they will have left Burra by that date.*  It is hoped this year that the carols will be held in Market Square subject to police approval concerning traffic control.

[* This brief reference, plus another equally short one in the next issue and an oblique reference earlier in Council notes appear to be the only recognition the Convent school gets after more than a century of operation in the town!
