Cr Parks moved that the town assessment for 1893 be adopted as the waterworks assessment for 1893 with such additions or alterations as may be required and that the water rate be the same as that of last year.  (i.e. 3/- per 1,000 gallons up to the amount paid in rates and consumption in excess of the rating power be at 2/6 per 1,000 gallons.)

With respect to the Waterworks Cr Hardy moved: ‘That the three days extra labour be not paid by the Council’. 

The Town Clerk pointed out that the last meeting of Council had passed payment to Mr Bartle.  After some heated exchanges Cr Hardy then moved: ‘That the account stand over till next meeting.’  The Mayor refused to take the motion.  Cr Kitchen tried to 2nd.

Cr Linkson then said that not being allowed to speak at the last meeting, he would do so now.  During the time of the accident the engineer worked 20 hours and then the next day worked 16 hours.  He always works 12, 14 and 16 hour days when a breakage occurs and to ask him to pay for extra labour is monstrous.  If the meters did not require reading at that particular time no extra labour would have been needed.

Cr Parks agreed, saying Bartle’s account is correct and the Council should pay it.  When the question was put it was supported by Hardy and Kitchen and against were Walsh, Linkson, West and Parks.

[It is hard to follow this given that the Mayor had not accepted the motion, which in any case would seem to require that an earlier motion be rescinded.]
