Aftermath of the riot.

Ursula Margaret Cruse & Ethel May Gregory were charged with damaging public property to the value of Â£40.  Cruse is nearly 21 and Gregory is 19.  Cruse was defiant and reckless.  Both pleaded guilty.  The prosecution said the pair were in no way mentally deficient and were responsible for their actions.  Under the section the charge was laid the maximum penalty was 2 months.  Charges could have been laid that carried a maximum penalty of 2 years.  [The Bench was clearly doubtful that this was the best option.]  The Bench also observed that incorrigibles should be placed in some other institution.  The sentence was two months in Adelaide Gaol.
