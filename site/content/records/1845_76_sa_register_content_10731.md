Kooringa Post Office

An anonymous correspondent writes calling the attention of authorities to the need for a new post office at Kooringa.  The present building is a wooden structure 12 ft x 16 ft and 7 ft high.  At a conservative estimate an amount greater than Â£100,000 is place there in one year by storekeepers for transmission to Adelaide.  Most of this has to be posted overnight and during the absence of the postmaster (a single man) ten minutes would suffice to enter the building and make a clearance, with little chance of detection.
