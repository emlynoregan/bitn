The National Bank’s Community Fund for 2002 has been allocated as follows:

Burra Kindergarten $156.50 to assist with PVC blinds.

Burra Show Committee $45 towards printing costs.

Burra Clare Snowtown Health Services $94.50 for a fountain pump at Burra Hospital.

Burra Leisure activity Group $399 for a Janome sewing machine.

Burra Pony Club $305 to provide a shade area.

‘Belcunda’ 19 km north of Burra has been sold by Jim Litchfield’s Hazeldean Company to neighbouring Collinsville for $3 million.

Hazeldean will continue to rub its East Bungaree & Hazeldean seedstock interests.  It is understood Collinsville will sell some other property, in order to purchase ‘Belcunda’ and so benefit from it as forming a contiguous parcel.

Saltbush Clothing is a finalist in the 2003 Retailer of the year Award, Regional Category.
