Northern Extension Railway.  The line was opened on Monday for traffic from Tarlee to Manoora.  A few people assemble for the occasion, but there was no influx of visitors from Adelaide and only a few passengers going up.  Riverton will benefit from the mail now arriving by train to then be sent on to Clare via Rhynie, Undalya and Auburn.
