Myxomatosis has been a mixed blessing at Millicent, where the masses of dead rabbits have created an unbearable stench.  Flies breeding in the bodies have contaminated sheep.  Up north of Peterborough the disease is beginning to take effect.  Locally Mr Humble will be around this week to inoculate more rabbits.
