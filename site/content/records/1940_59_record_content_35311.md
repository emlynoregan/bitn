Local Board of Health and Paxton Square

The Board inspected Paxton Square on Thursday, but has yet to make a decision on any action.

Probably the chief source of trouble is the lack of an adequate water supply.  Each has a small tank that is quite insufficient for a medium sized family.  Only one or two of the houses has a town water tap in the back yard.  Other housewives must fetch water from one of the few taps at long intervals at the rear of the rows.  Water often must be lugged 40 or so yards in buckets.  The privies are very substandard.  Floorboards are loose and rough, resulting in rapid wear on any covering.  Ceilings are bad and a haven for rats.

The question remains of what to do about it.

The rents are among the cheapest in Australia at one shilling per room per week.  The easiest and most important first step would seem to supply each residence with a town water tap.  Another thing would be to allow each resident the use of a part of the large central area to create a garden.  This area is currently unused.

Burra Racing Club has been allotted Wednesday 7 April for its race day.  It will try to get the date shifted to Thursday 8 April because the SAR will not run a steam train to Burra on a Wednesday, but would do so on a Thursday.  This would allow the transportation of horses.

Burra RSL has decided to hold the Annual Anzac Sports on Saturday 17 April.

Rev. R.S.T. Pettet has been appointed to the Parish of Burra.  The induction service will be held at St Mary’s at 8 p.m. on 11 March by Archdeacon Bulbeck.

The Gorge water reserve is reported to have been leased by the Robertstown DC to a sheep owner for grazing purposes.  This reserve has been an outstanding beauty spot and picnic ground for generations of Burra and district people.  There are a number of swimming holes in the creek and tennis courts have been built close by.  If the Council persists in its action to lease the area, The Gorge will be ruined as a picnic ground.  The lease could at any time prohibit the use of the picnic ground and stop people swimming in the pools.  He could probably close the tennis courts too.  If sheep roam over the area the earth will become powdered and the slightest wind will raise dust and the banks of the creek will become crisscrossed with sheep tracks and assume the appearance of the banks of a dam.  World’s End people have deputed Ern Phillips to wait on the Robertstown Council to object to the change.

The intention to lease has to be advertised in a local paper and the Government Gazette.  We can find no such advertisement.
