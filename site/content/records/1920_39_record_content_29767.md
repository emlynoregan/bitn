Fire.  On Thursday 7 February Frank Reed noticed fire near the woolshed on Hawker & Sons’ Mt Cone Station.  Firefighters were soon coming to help.  The ground was heavily grassed; in places over one foot high and the fire was not extinguished till 5-6 p.m., by which time some 1,500 to 1,600 acres of feed was lost.  The properties of E.C. Collins & Messrs Reed & Sons were also affected.  Mr Collins lost 300 acres of feed and fencing to the value of c. £400.  Reed & Son lost over 100 acres of feed.  Afterwards a swagman, George Brown was arrested for lighting a fire to boil a billy, which started the fire.  He was fined £10 plus 15/- costs or one month jail.  The feed burnt was valued at £1 per acre.  The fire proved the worth of the Mt Bryan Fire Fighting Committee and their equipment.
