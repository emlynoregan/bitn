Editorial on the Burra Waterworks.  New and increased accounts are going out for 1905, but we must not complain at the higher cost.  The Government has spent Â£1,500 in repairs and the purchase of a suitable engine.  The outlay was essential whoever was in charge.  The question now is what will happen when the mine is unwatered as when it was working last the well now used was dry.
