The Salvation Army celebrated 38 years in Burra on 18 February.  Its start here on 18 February 1884 was just three years after it reached Australia.  Very large meetings celebrated the event in the Hall on Saturday & Sunday last.  The Redruth [Methodist] Choir assisted on Saturday and a fine supper followed.

[Personal interest: the choir included R. Fuss.]
