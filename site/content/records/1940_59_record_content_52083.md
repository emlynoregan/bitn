Jubilee Sheep Dog Trials

These were well run in good weather, but takings only just covered costs.  They were regarded as one of the best trials for some time.   Thirty-three trials were run in the day.  The gate took only £17-3-0.

Open Class was won by Reg. Cosser’s Blondie.

Novice Class was won by W.J. Holding’s Suzi.

H.L. Burton owned the runner-up in both events.

These were the first sheep dog trials held in the town for some years.
