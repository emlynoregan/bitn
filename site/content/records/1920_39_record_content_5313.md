Hallett Soldiers’ Memorial

The unveiling of the memorial was performed by the Governor attended by Lady & Miss Priscilla Weigall on 7 September.  The Vice-Regal party arrived by the midday train and was greeted by T.E. Richards, Chairman of the DC and other Councillors.  There was a civic reception at the Institute.  A guard of Honour under Lieut. H.S. Blunt was formed and the Governor spoke to each man.  Mr Richards spoke and the Clerk.  Mr Collins read the illuminated address and His Excellency replied.  The party then motored to the memorial on a quarter acre block in the main street donated by John Melrose of Ulooloo.  Here Mr W.S. Murray as Chairman of the Memorial Committee addressed the gathering and asked the Governor to unveil the memorial.  The Governor responded and performed the unveiling.

The memorial is about 16 ft high of three large blocks of granite on which is a pedestal with a column about 5 ft high.  The cost was about £600.  On each side is a fine cast bronze plate.  On the front one is the inscription: ‘Erected by the residents in the district in memory of our boys who fought in the Great War 1914-1918’.  Beneath is a picture of infantry in action.  The names of the fallen are on the back plate and those who served are listed on the other two plates.

Lady Weigall than addressed the children and she received a bouquet of violets from Miss Ellie Billin and Miss Priscilla Weigall received a basket of violets and fern from Miss Louie Penglase.  Addresses were then given by S.W. Dickson and Rev. V. Goldney.   Lieut. Blund moved a vote of thanks to His Excellency and after mingling with the crowd and shaking hands with the guard of honour their Excellencies motored to the railway station for their departure by the afternoon train.
