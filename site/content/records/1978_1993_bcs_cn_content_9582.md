Burra Burra DC

The Jubilee 150 Board has advised the Council that it approved in principle proposals in a report by the Heritage Conservation Branch in respect to the Burra Heritage Town Project.

The Branch compiled the report following several meetings held by the working party appointed to consider proposals on the application by the Burra Burra DC for financial assistance under the Jubilee 150 Board Programs.

The Premier had announced some months previously that $470,000 would be provided by the Commonwealth Government in response to the Council’s application.  The report proposed the funds be expended as follows:

Restoration and adaptation of Paxton Square Cottages – Kingston St Row	150,000

Repairs to the existing Bon Accord Mine Buildings	30,000

Further restoration of Morphett’s Pump House		25,000

Establishment of a Copper Museum/Interpretive Centre incorporating

the Bon Accord Mine Site

Construction of a new building			180,000

Fitting out of displays in the new and existing buildings	50,000

Appointment of a Heritage Officer		       35,000

$470,000

Restoration and adaptation of the Paxton Square Cottages has been implemented, with the prior approval of the J150 Board and the funds allocated as designated.  Funds were also allocated to the proposal by Council and through the Government’s Wage Pause-Job Creation Scheme.

The J150 Board in its letter to the Chairman of the District Council indicated that repairs to the Bon Accord Mine Buildings, repairs and restoration of Morphett’s Pump House and the appointment of the Heritage Officer should all proceed as soon as possible – in liaison with the Heritage Conservation Branch and the History Trust.

The Board has imposed a condition on the establishment of the Copper Interpretive Centre that the whole of the Bon Accord Site must be transferred to the Burra Burra DC.

It is currently owned by the National Trust and negotiations for its transfer are proceeding with the Trust’s State Executive.  The Burra Branch of the National Trust has advised Council that it supports this transfer in the best interests of the heritage of Burra and the preservation of the site.

Council will call a public meeting at the Civic Centre on Tuesday 24 July at 8 p.m. to advise the public of all matters concerned with the project, the reasons for the minor variations to the Council’s original application and the delay in reaching the approval in principle stage.  It will seek the support of the community to ensure the entire project is completed in the SA Jubilee year 1986.

The Hon. Barry Cohen, Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment (the Minister responsible for the grant) has agreed to officially open the Burra Heritage Town Project during the October long weekend of 1986.
