Obituary.  Mrs John Stagg aged 77 was found dying in her home in Taylor St on 28 September.  Miss Mary Ann O’Brien who lives opposite found the house locked.  She called Mrs Allen [Probably Mrs Minna Allen.] and finding that the back door was also locked they sent for Messrs C. & A. Fuss who forced the back door.  Nurse [Greta] Fuss attended till Dr Williams arrived.  The deceased died soon after admission to hospital.  She seems to have fallen and cut her head on a broken door latch.  Death was from loss of blood.  [Celia Ann Stagg died Kooringa, residence Aberdeen.]
