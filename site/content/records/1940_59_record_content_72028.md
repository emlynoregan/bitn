Booborowie Methodist Church held a meeting last Wednesday to discuss the problem of Sunday school accommodation.  With 50 children divided into four classes, it is difficult to instruct the two junior classes in the small ex-storeroom used for the lessons.  R.E. Dewhirst outlined the teachers’ request for an additional room.  Some members considered a room at the back of the church that could also serve as a vestry and serve Guild purposes might serve better.  The estimated cost of a prefabricated room 27 ft x 12 ft adjoining the back of the church and extending out on the south side, would be £600, perhaps reduced to £500 by some voluntary labour.  The area will be canvassed for support and another meeting held on 28 March to make a decision.
