Burra Hospital Board, meeting last Thursday.

[It is clear from the report that there had been certain unspecified difficulties between Dr Ashton and the hospital staff.]

Mr Winnall reported that the Secretary had written to Dr Ashton asking him to put in writing his general instructions to staff.  Mr Winnall referred to a number of other incidents as well.  Dr Ashton had not responded and Mr Warnes then moved to terminate Dr Ashtonâ€™s appointment as a medical officer of the hospital at 31 July 1917.

Mr Crewes sought to have Dr Ashton given the opportunity to carry out the instructions before further action was taken, but the motion passed.
