Accidents

On Saturday at 8.30 p.m. about a mile the Burra side of Klaebe’s Creek near Studholme a fully laden semi-trailer bound for Queensland overturned.  It landed upright with the trailer straddling the creek.  The driver Kenneth Payne of NSW was transferred from Burra hospital to the Adelaide Hospital suffering from a broken arm, lacerations and concussion.  The load of aluminium chairs, personal goods, data processing paper, children’s school shoes, drums of grease and cow hides was scattered about.  Four trucks were used to convey the salvaged goods to the Burra Police Station.  About 95% of the load was saved.  The Council grader and front end loader salvaged the damaged vehicle.  Damage to the vehicle was estimated at $3,500.

A car driven by Alan Day of Burra overturned on the Spalding-Burra Road yesterday near North Bungaree.  The driver and passengers Ashley White, Philip Byles and Andrew Phillips escaped with a shaking and bruises.  They were returning from a cricket match.
