Burra Burra DC

Some $3,000 is owing to the Council, mainly for services like weed control and legal action will be taken if the amounts are not paid.

The base for the new netball court at Victoria Park has been completed.

The Councils of the Burra Schools are applying for a grant to assist in building a full-sized multi-purpose activity hall.  This plan was well supported in a recent survey.  District Councils in the area are prepared to contribute.  Plans to upgrade facilities for sports and at the Memorial Institute at Booborowie total $43,000.

At Burra there are moves to make five new tennis courts and a netball court on the site of the old lawn tennis courts, with a hocky ground nearby.  Commonwealth assistance is likely to be sought.
