Sgt Barrett’s Gallipoli Campfire Concert Party played to an overflowing house in Burra last Wednesday.  They provided really first class entertainment.  In the interval a flag was sold on the Bugler system.  Total proceeds of the evening were £45.  The money raised was to provide Sgt Molloy & Pte Hammond with cork legs.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ Band played selections in front of the hall.
