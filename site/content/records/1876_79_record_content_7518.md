[There was then further discussion on the missing money which had been gone for two months before being discovered.] The defalcations had occurred after the ordinary audit. The Mayors report was adopted.

Rev. W. Jenkin added a vote of thanks to the Mayor and Council. He admitted that he had last year been a political enemy of Dr Nesbitt, though in no other sense, but he had seen that Dr Nesbitt had attended most thoroughly to his duties and that the best course had been taken in the Fogg affair as further legal action would have just meant a loss for the town. He was grieved by the unemployment in the town in winter and did not know what many would have done but for the work provided by Council.

Dr Nesbitt thanked the meeting for the amicable way in which unpleasant aspects of the past year had been aired without rancour.

Mr Lane, candidate for Mayor was asked some questions: -

He would favour a footpath to Aberdeen when funds permitted. Was for a mortuary chapel at the cemetery.

Would favour cutting down the bank by the Institute, but it was not urgent and could wait till more pressing needs were attended to.

Other minor discussion with candidates for Council completed the evening along with the formal endorsements etc.
