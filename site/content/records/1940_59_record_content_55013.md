Mr James Brady of Mt Bryan East is 90 today.  He still looks after his flock of 400 sheep and tails his lambs and comes in each week with his oversized grey draught horse, for mail and provisions.  He lives alone, attending to his property, driving a buggy and sometimes riding a horse.  Until two years ago he shore his own sheep.
