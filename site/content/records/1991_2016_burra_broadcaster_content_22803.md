Recent Offences

Hoon Drivers are being targeted in Burra following recent incidents.

On Saturday morning police were called to Commercial St after numerous complaints of dangerous driving.  The driver fled the scene.  Further reports concerned $1,500 damage to the Community School Oval caused by ‘wheelies’.  On Tuesday 11 July the driver was charged with a range of offences including driving while disqualified and property damage.  Another driver was charged after doing ‘wheelies’ near the Bon Accord Hotel.  On Saturday 8 July a Ford Festiva sedan and a Holden Commodore utility collided at the junction of the Barrier Highway and the Bypass.  No injuries were sustained, but damage to vehicles amounted to c. $5,000.  A Burra youth was subsequently charged with failure to give way.

At about 7.30 a.m. on Saturday morning juveniles were reported for throwing rocks onto the road surface at the railway overpass near the saleyards.  This is a serious matter, which in the past has caused damage to vehicles and fatalities.

A green tandem trailer containing a 1,500 litre diesel tank was stolen from a Goyder Council site near the Burra Gorge between Thursday night and Saturday morning.  A further 3,000 litres of diesel fuel were siphoned from another tank at the site.    Total value of the fuel and trailer is inn excess of $5,000.
