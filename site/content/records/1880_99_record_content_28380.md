Farmers were warned often that the land was unsuitable.  They disbelieved the warnings partly because similar statements in the past in areas like Booyoolie and Belalie had proved incorrect.  As a consequence thousands took up blocks, many of up to 1,000 acres, and set about fencing, clearing and building dams etc.  For a while all seemed to be going well, but harvests failed and despite numerous concessions being made to them time after time, the whole settlement failed.  Those who had paid high prices were allowed to surrender land and take it back at a lower rate, but those who had paid £1 per acre for the least desirable land were not offered reductions.  In the northeast concessions would not keep farmers on the land unless the value was to be far below £1 per acre.  This the Government would not countenance.  As well as lack of rain the farmers were also afflicted with locusts and rabbits.

It was not uncommon in the Hundreds of Wonna, Parnaroo, Coglin, Erskine, Oladdie, Yanyarrie, Moockra, Boolcunda, Yarrah and others north and east of them for crops to average 104 bushels per acre.  With an average price of 3/- per bushel this meant nothing but a loss, allowing even the minimal production cost of 10/- per acre for seed and labour.  Settlers had either to hang on to their land in hope, or leave it without a penny to start again with only the life of an agricultural labourer before them.  Some took offers to exchange freehold purchase for leases at 3d and later at 2d per acre per year, but even these costs could not be met if the land produced nothing.

At present in about 50 hundreds totalling some 5,000 square miles the rougher land is lying waste, especially along the hills and is an excellent breeding ground for foxes and rabbits.  The assets of buildings etc. are of no value except for farmers and the land cannot now even support much stock, as having been ploughed it no longer yields the stock feed of the old bush.  Wheat returns are very low and the remaining farmers have lost all their capital and are in debt to tradespeople who have given long lines of credit and to the Government.  There are men who last year reaped 45 bags from 900 acres into which 225 bags had been sown and who yet hope for a miracle.

Surely this is a waste of power and industry misapplied.  The few who are doing fairly well are those who have ceased to fight against nature and have given up cultivation for grazing and have restricted crops to a small area that might in a good season provided a bonus.
