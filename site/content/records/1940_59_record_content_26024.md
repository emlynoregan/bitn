Burra Town Council, 16 April

The RSL advised that the Anzac Day observance would be on Sunday 18 April this year in Market Square.

The highways and Local Government Department advises that the Burra-Morgan Road has been placed on the schedule of main roads.

H.E. Prior writes advising that due to ill health he can no longer be a casual employee of the Council.

The Mayor advised that he would not be standing for re-election this year.

Cr Harvey advised he would not seek re-election because he expected to be soon leaving the town.

Cr Bevan seemed unsure of his position.

A deputation from the Burra & District brass Band will be received next meeting.

The Mayor T.H. Woollacott MBE is to retire from office.

He has held the position for 14 years and says the strain of office is now affecting his health.  The announcement came as a surprise to fellow councillors.  We say that no man has worked harder for the town than the retiring mayor, who has carried out his civic duties most seriously and with efficiency and enthusiasm.  He has guided the town through two very difficult periods; the Depression and World War II.  In the Depression he was a leader in finding work, food and clothing for the destitute.  When war was declared he threw himself wholeheartedly into the war effort.  No task was too small or too large for his attention as long as ‘the boys’ would benefit.  He spent night after night on the platform in the Town Hall and swore he would look after the interests of the soldiers going away and would also see to their rights when they returned and he is still in the vanguard of those fighting to see that returned men get their just dues.  The Mayoress has stood quietly and firmly behind him.  He has become known through the country for his ability to fight for Burra’s interests.

Burra Burra DC Chairman, E. Finch and District Clerk Mr A.J. Hill waited on the Town Council on Tuesday to see if that body would take action to control onion weed in the town.  The weed seems to have spread from the Ballast Quarry.  It seems to have been distributed in road metal from there - though some are blaming sheep from the sale yards for its introduction.  The Burra Burra DC does not know of any effective weed killer.  The Mayor said there were plenty of the plants in the Mine Paddock and attempts by A.J. & P.A. McBride to eliminate them had been largely unsuccessful.

Cr Harvey reported failure in trying to rid his block of the pest.

Town Clerk Mr E.R. Davey said ICI and the Waite Institute were experimenting with a weed killer.

Cr Harvey moved that notices be served on all persons having onion weed growing on their properties.

Cr Carpenter said that many were growing on Council property.
