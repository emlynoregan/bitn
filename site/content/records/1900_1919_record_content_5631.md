Court, 8 May.

Charles Noble was charged with stealing a pair of boots from John Thomas Walker, valued at 6/9.  He was sentenced to two months in jail.

George Thompson, Thomas Moore, John Riley, James McNamara were charged with stealing a bottle of sherry from the Bon Accord Hotel, valued at 3/-, but the case failed due to insufficient evidence.

The same group was charged with being idle and disorderly and all except McNamara got 14 days in jail.  McNamara had about Â£4 on him when he met the others and was not part of the push.  They did not leave him till the money was exhausted.
