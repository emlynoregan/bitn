A Tourism Forum was held by the Council last Thursday night at the Civic Centre and was attended by about 30 tourist related business operators.  Council Chairman, Graham Kellock, said the Council wanted to know where it could help in tourism development.  One problem raised was that the present passport was linked in only with Council and National Trust properties.  The idea of an independent body running the Tourism Office was mooted.
