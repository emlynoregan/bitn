Burra Tourism Association

Burra Traders’ Association presented the request it had received to become a tourist association to its members last Tuesday.  Plusses included reduced insurance costs by having one organisation, potential to increase membership, with resulting increased lobbying power.  The down side was that the enthusiasm of new members might wane, leaving existing members uncomfortable with their new identity and the possible loss of a forum for non-tourism related issues.  Members will be contacted to raise some specific constitutional changes to be considered at a meeting on 4 December.
