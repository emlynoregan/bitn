5th Annual Anzac Sports organised by the RSL was threatened by a week of drizzling rain, but the weather broke on Friday and Saturday was fine.  There was a large attendance.  The ground and tracks were in excellent condition.  Cyclists came from around the state, but the pedestrian events were confined to locals with only two exceptions.

The local troop of 9/23 Barossa Light Horse provided the military events.  H.S.T. Warnes was recovering from his recent accident, so Sgt Major R.J. Bernhardt was in charge.  Horse events were not well patronised with the same three horses in the two events.  In addition however, the Draught Horse Race over two furlongs was limited to jockeys of minimum weight of 14 stone who were not normally riders.  This was originally a popular event, but numbers have fallen over the years from about 20 to just 3 this year.  L.M. Gordon rode the Prior Bros.’ Fidget, L. Motherall rode Prior Bros.’ Last End, G.H. Dow rode T. Kallio’s Royal Challenge.  G.H. Dow won from L. Motherall with L.M. Gordon last.

Military events were well patronised.

A large team of professional riders came from Adelaide for the motor cycle events.

A dance was held in the evening in the Lodge Hall at Aberdeen.

The gate was c. £75.

The report extends for c. 3¼ columns and includes a full list of results.
