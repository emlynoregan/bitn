Burra Waterworks. Secondly, the same deputation sought a more efficient water supply for the town. A recent Govt. engineer found a well that yielded only 1,000 gallons an hour. The deputation asked for a standpipe in Market Square from which water carts might take water. The water supply was sadly deficient as the total loss of the Miners' Arms recently by fire indicated.
