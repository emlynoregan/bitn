Hi Chick Breeding Site to Go Ahead

Hi Chick Breeding Pty Ltd, a family owned business, is to establish a breeding facility in Burra.  Based on land bordered by the Barrier Highway and Springbank Road, it will eventually have five production sheds, a house and amenities block.  My next May it is anticipated the house, amenities block and one shed will be operating, with another shed under construction.  Pat Hallion of Burra will be the manager.  He is currently undergoing training at bethel, the other Hi Chick Breeding Farm.  It is anticipated that the operation will employ 10-12 people full-time and perhaps some casuals as well.  Mr Jan Meldrum of Hi Chick said locals will be employed wherever possible.  He was visiting the site on 21 December with Craig Wilson, CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board.  The area had the necessary facilities; water supply, 3 phase electricity, sufficient isolation from other poultry ventures.

Breeding material is imported from the UK in the form of fertile eggs.  They are quarantined on Torrens Island and hatched there.  After 12 weeks the chickens are moved.  These pedigree chickens will then be taken to Burra and Bethel to provide the genetic material for the production of 27% of the meat chickens in Australia (about 100 million) and for about 4 million layer chickens.  Very sophisticated genetic research is done on the breeding farms and the work requires highly specialised training.  The company employs its own veterinarian and has a full time animal nutritionist on staff.

The MNRDV will provide funds to subsidise the training of personnel.  It was wise for the company to have two sites in the event of an outbreak of an exotic disease.  The company had also had a lot of encouragement from the Council.  The company was very mindful of the environment.  All waste would be removed from the site.  Trees would be planted as part of the development.  Construction will start about February.
