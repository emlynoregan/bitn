Article from the Mining Journal of 19 December 1863.

Supplies of copper ores from Chile have declined and demand is increasing.  The development of copper mines in SA is therefore most opportune.  There is reason to believe copper prices will rise.  The SA mines are prolific in rich ores and it is therefore commercial sense at this time that they be brought to full and speedy production ‘by energetic management and labour and the careful application of capital.’

Burra Burra Mine yielded to the six months ending 31 March 1863 4,348 ton of ore at an average 23% pure metal.  The Moonta Mine, which is of only two years’ standing, has produced 5,611 tons of ore within six months at an average 18% with a cost of raising of only £4-15-7 per ton.

Blinman Mine, which started only in August 1862, already furnished almost 400 tons per month.

‘It is interesting to mention the fact that the gentleman who has recently been nominated to the proud position of Prime Minister [i.e. Premier] of that colony was, and we believe still is, the secretary of the Burra Burra Mine, and has throughout his residence in South Australia been identified, we believe exclusively, with mining enterprise.  He left this country as a mere emigrant; he embraced mining industry; and now rules the destiny of a colony which is unquestionably full of import to the mining word, and rising rapidly in every branch which establishes the importance of a nation.’

‘Espagna’ writes on the origin of the word ‘Merino’.

It is a Spanish word, corrupted from the Latin ‘merinas’ or Majorinus’ implying a superintendent of sheepwalks; hence the Spanish ‘merinos ovejas’ or sheep under the care of the merino or major.  There are two kinds of sheep in Spain.  The coarse-woolled do not travel and are housed inside in winter. The fine-woolled spend all their time in the open air and at the end of summer migrate from the cool northern mountains to the warm southern plains of Estramadura and Leon for winter.  Lately their number was estimated at 4,000,000.  These ‘merinos’ are also called ‘transhumentes’ because of their annual migration.

[Further details of this sheep migration are given with a suggestion that transhumance might improve the wool of sheep in Australia as well.]
