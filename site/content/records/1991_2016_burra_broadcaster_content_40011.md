BankSA’s ATM in Market Square has recently been giving unsatisfactory service, bearing the ‘out of service’ sign on many occasions.  BankSA will install a new Smart ATM.  The old machine had a faulty key component and the replacement had to be sourced from New Zealand.  The new ATM is expected to be up and running later this week.
