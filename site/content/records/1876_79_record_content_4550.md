Letters to Editor. 
William Dare of Piltimitiappa writes asserting that farmers should be able to keep as many dogs as they like, free, to enable them to keep down rabbits.

Dr John Cockburn writes defending his actions in treating Sarah Ann Fogarty and denying she was unfit for travel to Burra and condemning Dr Dashwood as severely as a polite professional colleague could. ‘With regard to Dr Dashwood’s evidence perhaps the less said the better.’

Letter from W.R. Ridgway re the Council loan. He questions the likelihood of the Govt. subsidy being discontinued and claims they would also be paid on the bridge approaches if raised by subscriptions or rates. He also fears that revelations that the north end of the town voted against the loan will not be conducive to town unity or goodwill. (He was away from town at the time of the meeting and did not learn of it in time to attend.)
