Central Board of Health Inspector visited Burra and recommended that to stop water draining into the creek and forming a breeding ground for mosquitoes it should be made compulsory for all premises to install semi-septic systems.  An Act exists that could enable the Council to implement this practice.  There were several sub-standard houses in the town and they should be condemned when the Housing Commission approved.
