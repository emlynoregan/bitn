Letters

From ‘Wun Hu Knows’ in response to E. Diplock and the Burra Mine (In Cornish dialect) disputing Diplock’s expertise and saying he spent most of his time elsewhere and had hardly been underground in the last 14 years and spent only a month or two on top in that time.  His supposed knowledge of an untapped lode at the 65 fathom level is ridiculed as there was no 65 level.

‘I am glad old Aiphraim esent a Coarnishman for ef a Coarnishman was goin to make a story he wud try to make en somefin like the trueth.’

From ‘Templar’ re shop hours.  Three or four years ago the shopkeepers agreed to close earlier in the evening, but the old ways have gradually re-emerged with the changed in proprietors.  The writer believes shops were more consistently busy when they closed at 8 p.m. than they are now when closing at 10 p.m.  Some say they would do better closing at 6 p.m. all the year.  Why don’t they try it then?  The change would seem to benefit all.  There would be a saving in lighting oil, fewer fires, and more fresh air for workers, with the same business done.
