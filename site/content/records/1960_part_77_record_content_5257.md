J.R. O’Sullivan, Director of Posts and Telegraphs writes in response to a letter by R. Fuss in the paper of 13 December 1960, in which Mr Fuss thanks the Fire Brigade and others who helped extinguish the fire on his property, ‘But no thanks to the Telephone Exchange.’  Mr Fuss has refused to supply any details which would assist the department investigations into the implied failure.  There is no record of a fire call from the service of Mr Fuss.  A query was received from Burra 233 at 12.10 p.m. on Saturday 10 December asking whether the exchange had heard about the fire over the hill and the caller was connected with the Fire Officer at Burra 183 and the officer then activated the fire siren.  The postmaster also received a letter from another subscriber explaining that a call in connection with the fire from the extension telephone of his service was not effective as he had not switched the extension switch at his house to the correct position.  The postmaster has no further knowledge of the case, but should Mr Fuss care to furnish any information of the alleged failure by staff I would be pleased to have further investigations made.  In the absence of such I can only assure Mr Fuss acted under a misapprehension which unfortunately has brought unwarranted discredit on the exchange staff.
