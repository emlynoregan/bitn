Obituary.  Mrs Voumard, wife of Mr James Voumard, died in Burra Hospital on Thursday.  The deceased died of fever after an illness of a few days.  She is survived by a husband and four little boys, the youngest only three years old.  [Death registration says Caroline Voumard died 19 April 1906 aged 34.  I can find no marriage of a James Voumard and a Caroline in SA, though there is a James Amos Voumard who married Catherine Nicholls, who would have been the right age, but she has four boys and a daughter.]
