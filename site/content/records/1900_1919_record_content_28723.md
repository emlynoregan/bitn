Fire.  As we went to press last week a big fire was burning to the southwest of the town.  It was at Hughes’ Park the property of Hon. J.J. Duncan of Gum Creek Station.  Some miles of country were swept by the flames and a number of landowners have sustained heavy losses of sheep and cattle and fencing.
