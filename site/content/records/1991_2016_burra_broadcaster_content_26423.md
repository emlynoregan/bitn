BRTBA has been holding regular film nights at the Town Hall for three years.  While patronage varies greatly according to film, weather and other attractions, there has been a steadily increasing attendance.  We are confident we are providing an alternative form of entertainment for members of our community, especially for the young.  The last film night for 2001 on 16 November will feature Atlantis The Lost Empire at 6 p.m. and A Knightâ€™s Tale at 8 p.m.

Carol and David Burford have said they will be going into 35 mm format in 2002, which will improve the quality of both sound and image.
