The Editor points out that he did not say the Government wanted to kill primary industry: the sentence began with ‘if’.  His aim was rather to show that on the one hand a monthly market would not aid the war effort while on the other it would harm Burra’s interests.  He then goes on to agree there are good men on both sides of politics and suggests a National Government would be better in this time of stress.
