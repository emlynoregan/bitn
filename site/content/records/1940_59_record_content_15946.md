Accident.  On Monday evening Mr R. Melrose was riding his motor cycle south on Paxton Terrace [sic, but clearly Bridge Terrace is meant] towards the Black Bridge [Kingston St] when Mr Bourman was driving east across the bridge.  They collided at the end of the bridge.  Mr Melrose is suffering head injuries and a fractured rib, not thought to be serious.
