Terowie Rural School will close permanently at the end of the term.  The enrolment has fallen from 16 at the start of the year to just 8 in the middle of the year and 11 now.  Principal, Des Deuter, said the decline in numbers had left a large gap in the social development and interaction with children of the same age and abilities.  The number is too low for students to benchmark themselves against students from the same age and educational level.  Sickness through the winter had meant that on some days attendance was as low as three or four.  The old schoolhouse was established in 1876 and at one time it was the heart of the community.  Students will attend either Jamestown (36 km away) or Peterborough (20 km away.)
