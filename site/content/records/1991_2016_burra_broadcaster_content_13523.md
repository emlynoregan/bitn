Local Chef Grace Delaney lives in Trembeth Street, Burra North where the house was formerly a bakery and retains a huge old wood-fired bakerâ€™s oven.  This will be the focus of the Bake-house Kitchen, which will be available for public dining on Saturday nights.  The old Excel Bakery was built in the 1860s.
