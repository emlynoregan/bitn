Burra Town Council, 1 October

The RAA wrote that straying stock was a problem and a danger in Burra North at night and asked for action.  Council resolved to do what it could to take action against the offenders.

A report by the District Engineer, Mr C.B. Sieber, on the Kangaroo St Bridge, was received.

It was resolved to carry out temporary repairs as suggested, pending advice on the best means of repairing or replacing it.

Action is to be taken to curb noisy motor cycles.

The Railway Commissioner is to be advised that Council considers the warning device at the Bon Accord Crossing to be inadequate.
