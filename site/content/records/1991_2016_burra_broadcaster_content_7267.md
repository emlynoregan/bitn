Letter.  Peggy Somers writes, wondering what prompted Christene Pycroft to write such a patronising letter six months after her visit.  Ms Pycroft claims to have seen no graffiti while in Burra and yet refers to the ‘Burra Car’. 

‘Frankly if I …sighted one of these graffitied monstrosities, I’d take off in the opposite direction, fearing that the town would prove to be as tactless and tacky as the vehicle.’

She concludes by hoping that when the tourist vehicles are replaced that ‘the same vulgar, visual pollution will not be repeated.’

[Make your own judgement of the graffitied monstrosity from the above photo.]
