Theft.  Three weeks ago the collection box at the RSL Club was smashed and £1 was stolen.

It was replaced, but last Saturday the contents were again stolen.

Last December between £1-10-0 & £2 was taken from the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School, since when that box has also been emptied once more.
