Burra Races were held last Wednesday.  The attendance was slightly down and the gate was £190.  Twenty-six horses ran, giving small fields, though still quite good.  The track was in good condition.  The non-bitumen road to Burra seems to be a major factor in attracting both horses and the public.  Bookmakers’ holdings were £26,543, which returned to the club £189-10-0 and the return on Melbourne betting was £86-10-0.  It is expected that the budget will at least balance.
