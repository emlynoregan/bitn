Burra Bowling Club improvements are coming on rapidly.  The old pines have gone and the new cyclone fence is in place [in Thames St.]

The Associatesâ€™ bowling green of four rinks (formerly the croquet lawn) has been moved further north to allow for the expansion of the Club House.  The concrete wall for the extension is in place and most of the floor and a new concrete floor has been laid for the front verandah.  The kitchen is being lined and equipped with a sink.  Shaded seats are being made.  Surveying the new extension on the north side should happen this week.  Working bees have been held each week for some time and will continue.
