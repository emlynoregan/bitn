Obituary.  John McLaren who died recently was a well-known resident of Burra for 30 years.  He was born in Adelaide in 1855 soon after his parents had arrived from Comrie in Scotland.  His father, Peter McLaren was a building contractor who started business in Kapunda.  John McLaren spent his early life there.  At the age of 29 in 1884 he began in the stock and auctioneering business with Sir Jenkin Coles and later was employed by Messrs Goodchild, Duff & Co.  In 1885 he started business in Burra, but returned to Kapunda in 1887.  In 1890 he took over the management of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis in Burra and continued there after their amalgamation with Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. until 1920 when he retired to Adelaide.*  In Burra he took a keen interest in civic matters and occupied a seat on the Town Council for a number of years and was Mayor for a long period.  [He was Councillor for East Ward from December 1897 to November 1901 and Mayor from December 1910 to November 1913.]  He was secretary of the Burra Show Society for some years and in his youth was a cricketer.  We understand he was a foundation member of the Burra Bowling Club.  He was renowned as a man of strict integrity.  [Born 13 October 1855 Adelaide: died 20 August 1939 Adelaide, residence North Unley.]
