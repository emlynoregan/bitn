At the Primitive Methodist chapel Rev. John Gibbon Wright was very popular and had a voice that on still summer evenings could be heard half a mile away.

The Bible Christians were then known as the Bryanites who had a chapel at the corner of Paxton Square and just before I left opened a large new church nearer the bridge.

A Mr Winship came and induced many miners to go to Newcastle on the promise of large wages, but the whole thing was a delusion and a snare.

In 1860-61 a host of men left for Moonta and Wallaroo and for a time Burra looked deserted, with many empty houses.  In Paxton Square and the block facing the Wesleyan Church and then diagonally to the Pig and Whistle nearly every house was vacant.  Gradually things improved and matters returned to normal.

Vandalism.   A lot of young trees have been destroyed in the street. [‘Sparks’ column.]
