Burra Corporation.  Mayor T.H. Woollacott presented his annual report.

The Town is in a clean and healthy state.

Hundreds of Burra boys and two nursing sisters have left Burra and each had been given a social and a wristwatch prior to departure as far as possible.  The Welfare Committee appreciated the support given in this regard.  Special patriotic efforts had been made successfully throughout the year.

The assessment for 1941-42 was £13,782.  Rates derivable were £1,837-12-0.

Rates collected were £1,797-8-5.  Arrears were £60-4-9 and fines collected £3-4-0.

Deputations sent to Adelaide had arranged finance for the Council to take over the Burra Institute and a meeting of ratepayers had given approval for the move.

Every effort had been made to get the Burra Mine working, but with no success to date.

Council had given the ARP £15 and guaranteed it for £100 worth of medical supplies in the event of an actual raid.  £7-10-0 had been given to the Air Observation Post.
