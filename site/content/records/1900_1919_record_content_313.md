Burra Races, in F. Dew’s Paddock last Wednesday.

This was the first race meeting since 1896, but the club is now registered and in good order.  Costs of establishing the event were quite high.  A room had to be built for the totalizator.  Excursion fares were available from Adelaide and Petersburg and Fitzgerald’s Band was an attraction.  Hon. J. Lewis MLC & W.B. Rounsevell MP, club patrons, were present.  400-500 would have been judged a satisfactory turnout, but in fact about 1,000 assembled.  The tote handled £357 in the day which netted £26 for the club in commission.  Larry O’Brien won the tender for liquor and E. Jordan that for eatables.  The prize money was not great, only £70, but a better total is hoped for the future.

The top prize money went to the Burra Handicap over 1½ miles when 1st prize was £20 and 2nd £5.  The winner was Mr J.T. Hill’s b. g. Scutum 5yrs, by Escutio – Lady Elizabeth, ridden by F. Hill.

Unfortunately in the Flying Handicap a young jockey, J.H. Doherty, aged 12, was killed.  In a cloud of dust at the finish Doherty collided with the finishing post, fracturing his skull and never regaining consciousness.  He died in hospital that night c. 11.30 p.m.
