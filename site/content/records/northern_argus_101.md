A new building where Morphett’s Pumphouse boiler house stood.

Designs were drawn up and the first completed were costed at about twice the available funds.  Amended designs cut the building virtually in half, gave minimal space to administration, but retained an adequate gallery area and the plateau site was chosen.  The working party approved this and Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch indicated verbally that the Branch would recommend approval.

Tenders were called and the lowest received was about 100% over the estimated cost.  The working party immediately moved to vary the proposal slightly and move it to the boiler house site with a building the same size and similar silhouette to the former boiler house.  Two architects have indicated their interest and belief that this building could be achieved within budget and could be completed by the target date of October 1986.

Rumours of the scuttling of the whole project and for the reallocation of the funds elsewhere have been circulating for two weeks.  The Burra Burra DC has sought urgent answers from the Premier.  The Department of Mines and Energy has been so supportive of the idea that it has already contributed $25,000 to be concentrated on Morphett’s Pumphouse and surrounds.  Burra’s Tourist Officer Jenny O’Connor has joined the Council in lobbying fiercely for the project and to counter the claim that Burra has been slow to react - though no meetings were held between January 1984 and November 1984 and then only at the insistence of the Burra Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker.  The allegation that there is now insufficient time to complete the project is denied by the architects.  Of concern id the allegation that the Heritage Conservation Branch, which has been closely associated with the project, will not now approve building on the boiler house site.  It has been alleged that the head of the Heritage Conservation Branch, Jon Womersley, when asked if his Department had any alternatives to offer, said, ‘No’.
