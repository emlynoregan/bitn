SA Mining Association

Some months ago we refrained from attending a meeting of the company, believing its proceedings were considered private.  The next day directors and shareholders said they were surprised at our absence, as their transactions were not secret.  On Wednesday, however, had our reporter not himself had a voting certificate, he would not have been admitted.  We protest against this secrecy, which is not followed by the old companies in England such as the Bank and the East India Company.  The mining interests in SA have absorbed so much capital that if they are unattended with returns it would constitute a dangerous leak in a very little ship.  The proceedings of the company are thus of legitimate general interest and not only to scrip-holders, but to those many who often hold scrip or inducements to defer claims.  Scrip-holders meetings should be public.  The meeting resolved that the qualification for a director should be reduced from 40 scrips to 20.  They did not push for voting according to scrip which gives a dangerous amount of power to the man with one scrip.
