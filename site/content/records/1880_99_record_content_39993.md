The time was, not many years ago, when over £1,000 was spent in one year on public works.  Now less than that is collected.

[In 1890 the rates brought in £561-10-3 and the Government subsidy was £125-12-5 and total income for the year was £933-3-2, of which £77-16-6 was in the bank on 31 December 1889.]

We are, of course, reaping the benefit still of the amount spent on trees, roads and footpaths in the past.  Past money has been well spent.  The recent public works expenditure has been:

1886	£1227-	9-	11

1887	624-	3-	1

1888	187-	15-	9

1889	221-	15-	5

1890	296-	0-	9

Income	Rates	Subsidy	Total

1886	771-	10-	5	331-	13-	3	1272-	8-	9

1887	718-	15-	8	146-	16-	2	1198-	15-	1

1888	563-	18-	7	Nil			716-	15-	7

1889	640-	4-	4	258-	7-	6	1131-	16-	0

1890	561-	10-	3	125-	12-	5	933-	3-	2

The rates bring in nearly half what they did a few years ago and total income has gone down to about half what it was.

In 1886 extra works were done and consequently an overdraft of over £300 was brought about, since when the Council has had to economise in every way.

This has made the position of Councillor unpopular.

Though this year starts in credit there is £200 in bonds to redeem and coupons of nearly another £100.

Rates this year are not likely to bring in over £500 on the reduced assessment, so there will be little available for public works.
