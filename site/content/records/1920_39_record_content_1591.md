Redruth Reformatory.

Edith Bubb writes thanking all for their support and assuring her defenders that she has never physically abused any of the girls nor made them worse by the discipline administered.  She admits she ‘did disobey, for the good of the girls themselves, an order given.’  Like Nelson, she says.  And the request for her resignation has been withdrawn.
