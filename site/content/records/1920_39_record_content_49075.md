Christmas Eve. Business in Burra was brisk for the week before Christmas and Christmas Eve itself was the best for some years.  The streets were crowded on Saturday evening 23 December and on Sunday evening the Burra District Band gave a concert from the RSL Club balcony and had supper afterwards at E.F. Marstonâ€™s.
