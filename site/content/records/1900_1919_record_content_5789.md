Black Waterholes Supply Scheme.  The Commissioner gave the deputation a cordial reception and said the scheme would proceed at once provided the water proved suitable for railway purposes.  He regretted the distress of the unemployed, but the water supply scheme was the only way at present out of the difficulty.  A 1,000 gallon sample has been taken for testing for railway purposes.
