Burra Town Council, 19 July

The Town Clerk reported that now both E.J. Lehmann and L.L. Fiebig held hire licences for carrying passenger and the Council could do no more in the matter.

SAR advised that everything possible would be done with respect to special trains to allow children and others to see their Majesties on the Royal Visit in 1949.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. have transferred property for the War Memorial project.

The Secretary of the Aberdeen Tennis Club applied for the longest lease possible for the courts.

As ratepayers would have to approve any lease in excess of 12 months, it was resolved to hold a ratepayers’ meeting to decide the matter.

The Under Treasurer advised that a loan of £1,200 for the Burra War Memorial Project could not be approved.  [See further at page 1 of this issue.]

D.H. Field was welcomed as the new Councillor.

The Clerks tender of ⅝% was accepted for the making of a new assessment for the town.

It was resolved to order one drum of weed killer to evaluate its relative efficiency in clearing watertables compared with skimming.
