Obituary.  Dudley Armstrong of the RAAF, who died in an aircraft accident recently, was buried at Pt Pirie on Anzac Day.  His father, Mounted Constable H.V. Armstrong, was once in charge of Burra Police Station [19935-39] and is a Gallipoli veteran.

[Horace Dudley Armstrong was born 23 January 1925 at Peterborough.  The SA Deaths CD is in error in citing the death date as 20 April 1943.  The age cited is consistent with a death 20 April 1944 at Kappawanta Station, residence Nuriootpa.]
