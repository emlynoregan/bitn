Burra & District Ratepayers’ Meeting on Thursday night was well attended.  The main concerns expressed covered road deterioration and the lack of grant monies.  A petition to the Minister of Roads, followed by a deputation is to be arranged.  The Chairman said there have been many changes and proposals for change in local government in the past year and this has created a rather confused outlook.  At the start of the year the Council was in a difficult financial position, though this had improved somewhat now.  The Council has had to increase staff since January 1973 due to the increased complexity of its work.  In the year Rural Unemployment Relief Grant work was completed, resulting in improved recreational facilities at Farrell Flat, Booborowie, mount Bryan and Burra.  Some renovation of Paxton Square and the Redruth Gaol was also done.  A smoke lounge and toilets were constructed at the Burra Town Hall.  Council administration includes Town Hall hire and management, caravan park maintenance, Burra Swimming Pool maintenance and management and two sports grounds at Burra.  The projected plan for a dam on Burra Creek has been delayed by weather conditions, but is expected to proceed in early summer.  Councillors continue to promote the development of the town and district.  Rising costs will be a major factor in the coming year.  The EFS has attended several small fires this year.  A main theme to appear during the meeting was the deterioration of unsealed roads and some sealed sections within the district.  The Booborowie-Spalding Road attracted a lot of comment.  The Minister says he is going to look at the matter of road funding, but comes back with a negative result.  There seems to be no alternative, but to cut Council costs.  Perhaps we must cut staff and rely on outside contractors if and when money becomes available.  The petition and deputation will stress the need for road funds, the threat of retrenchment to Council staff and the need for a higher priority to be given to the Booborowie-Spalding Road.
