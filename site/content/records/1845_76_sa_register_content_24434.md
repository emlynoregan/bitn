Ulooloo Diggings.  A letter to a friend in Gawler from one at Ulooloo reports one store, one public shanty and two or three blacksmiths’ forges, though they are not doing much as yet.  Not much sharpening is required as the ground is easy and few holes exceed 20 ft.  Most sinking on payable gold is on the banks of the creek.  The creek is almost worked out.  Many parties say they are not getting enough to pay for their tucker.  ‘I don’t think there are six parties getting wages on the diggings.’
