Centenary Celebrations at Marrabel took the form of a rodeo on 17 October.  Visitors came from far and near and it was by far the largest crowd ever seen at this centre.  Rain threatened to spoil the event, but it was fortunately light and brief, although heavy rain did reduce slightly the attendance at the dance afterwards.  [Results are printed.]
