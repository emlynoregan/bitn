Weather.  Just before midnight on Monday a steady rain set in and up to 9 a.m. Tuesday 67 points had fallen in Burra.  Since then there has been lightning and some showers have fallen.  Scattered storms to the east have delivered falls ranging from zero to 140 points at Parnaroo.  On Friday Mr & Mrs A.S. Dearlove of Ketchowla were caught in a flash flood while crossing the watercourse near Collinsville. Their almost new Hupmobile car became bogged and then would not start.  It had to be abandoned to the rising water.  It could not be retrieved by a tractor until Saturday morning and then had to be taken to Burra to have the clogged engine cleaned out.
