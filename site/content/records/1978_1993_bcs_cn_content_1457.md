The larger detached dwellings of elegant proportions made their appearance around the 1880s.  Whit painted heads, sills and quoins contrasted with the darker stone and together with similar features of the major civic and public buildings of the late Victorian period, combine in a strong unifying theme of architectural style throughout Burra.  The impact of unsympathetic modern brick and prefabricated buildings is small, but increasing.  Their siting, scale and use of materials are eroding the historical character of some areas, including Taylor Street, Morehead Street and Chapel Street.
