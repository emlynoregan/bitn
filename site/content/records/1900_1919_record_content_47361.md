Burra & District Motor Ambulances.

Burra & District has sent 400 young men to the front and raised over £18,000 for the patriotic funds.  It has now collected £850 to buy two motor ambulances for the military authorities.  Mr J.M. McBride and Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride each agreed to provide an ambulance.  As a consequence the committee, of which Cr S.M. Lane is secretary, was able to hand over four motor ambulances to the Defence Department on 18 July: two Overlands, a Buick and an Oakland.  The presentation was made opposite the South African Soldiers’ Memorial on North Terrace, by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Henry Galway.  About 35 Burra residents travelled to Adelaide for the presentation.  Unfortunately the weather was showery.  Mr Crewes had the honour of asking His Excellency to make the presentation.  He thanked in particular the generosity of the McBrides and Mr W.G. Hawkes supported the Mayor’s remarks.  Brigadier-General Irving accepted for the defence department.  These brought to 52 the ambulances presented by SA.
