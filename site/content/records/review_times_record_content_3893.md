Matthews Emporium staged a furniture and carpet clearance last week and it was every man and women for themselves.  Some keen buyers arrived at 4 a.m. and manager Ross Drew had to face the onslaught of an eager crowd when he opened the doors at 8.45 a.m.  He said he doubted if anything like it had happened in the emporiumâ€™s 58-year history.
