Coal

[An article from the Sydney Morning Herald discussed the position of the NSW coal trade.  While Victoria and SA have not found any coal resources, there are coal fields in Tasmania, which, if developed, could provide competition for NSW coal.  Still the article is optimistic that NSW can answer any competition and retain its position as the leading supplier of coal.  Of interest to Burra was the statement:

‘Next to Victoria, South Australia is our best customer for coal.  The smelting works at the Burra Burra copper mine use up a large quantity, and when the projected Northern Railway is completed so as to make carriage cheaper, it will be worth while to smelt the inferior ores, and a greatly increased demand for fuel will then ensue.’]
