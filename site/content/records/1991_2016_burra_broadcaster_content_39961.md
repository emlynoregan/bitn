Aircraft Accident.  Dr Mike Boerema was piloting a light plane with his wife as a passenger, when he mistook the Woollana airstrip for his intended destination of Collinsville.  He came in very close to the end of the strip and then lost wind.  The plane dropped about five metres and ended up in the crop.  He tok off straight away, without realising he had lost a wheel in the incident.  The second landing also ended up in the crop, but the plane remained upright.  They were lucky to escape unscathed.
