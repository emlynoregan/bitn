Redruth Methodist Church Anniversary last Sunday was followed by a tea meeting on Monday.  Rev. Nield’s lecture on Monday was on ‘Men I have met and scenes I have witnessed in the South African War.  It was illustrated by lantern slides.

Weather.  It has been very cold with severe frost on Saturday & Sunday resulting in frozen pipes and stripping the white cedars of their leaves.
