Renaming the Post Office

A meeting on Thursday in the Council Chamber considered the proposal to change the name of the post office from Kooringa to Burra.

A.B. Riggs spoke strongly for the change on the grounds there was:

A Corporation of Burra

A District Council of Burra Burra

A Burra Railway Station

A Burra Police Station

A Burra Institute

A Burra Hospital

A Burra Show

Until recently it was confusing that Burra was not mentioned in the telephone book at all.  Burra was one of the most important towns in the north of South Australia and yet had no post office of that name to which people could write, telephone or telegraph.

I.J. Warnes favoured the name Burra Burra.

R. Humphrys thought that was too long.

M.S. Edwards wondered if that would make Aberdeen North Burra Burra.

Rev. J.A. Andrews spoke of the confusion he experienced with mail which if sent to Burra went to Kooringa and had to be redirected to Aberdeen.  If addressed to Aberdeen it sometimes went to Aberdeen in NSW.  Personally he favoured Burra and North Burra for the two post offices.

F.T. Sara said he had heard of virtually no opposition to the change.

The amendment to use Burra Burra was carried on the casting vote of the Chairman S. Kellaway.

Rev. Andrews then moved Aberdeen post office be North Burra Burra.

Mr Riggs moved an amendment to North Burra and after discussion this was carried.

R. Humphrys then said it would be less confusing to call Kooringa Burra in that case and on the meeting agreeing to reconsider the matter it was agreed to change Kooringa to Burra.

The Mayor said the Council would move to implement the change as soon as possible.
