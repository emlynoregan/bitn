Takings in hall hire and subscribers fees amounted to £679 and the year ended in a credit of over £90.  Subscribers increased from 233 to 245.  Double subscribers 133, single subscribers 57 and juvenile 43.  At 31 December 1944 the library comprised 5,646 books.  Revenue increased by £96 due to increased rental from the Town Council, the office rent and the culling of all patriotic rebates for hire of the hall.  The transfer of the Institute to the Burra Corporation [i.e. the Town Council] is in its final stages and the committee hopes to see the process concluded in the near future.  The outstanding loan is £3,160 at 4% for a period of 20 years, as at 1 February 1945.

Elected: President, A.B. Riggs; Vice-President, F.T. Marston; Secretary, M.P. Cowle and Treasurer, J. McGrath.
