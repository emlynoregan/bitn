Parklands account has spent money on trees etc. and went from £7-19-10 in credit to £39-18-7 in credit for the year.

The cemetery has had necessary repairs done and is in good order.  Its account began in credit £122-16-8 and ends in credit £144-7-10.

The Main Road Grant of £340, which is insufficient to adequately maintain them to a good standard, is presently in credit £82, but this will vanish by the end of the year.

Tar-paving has been improved during the year and the expenses are justified by the results.

Local Board of Health.

The outbreak of influenza early in the year saw added expense and the setting up of the Boy Scout’s Hall as a hospital.  The disease was soon stamped out, though several deaths resulted from it.  This resulted in a debit balance of £128-4-2 after starting the year £7-2-4 in credit.  An increase in the health rate may be necessary.

The lighting account began in debit £31-12-6 and ends in debit £33-6-4.  More money is needed to maintain even the present poor level of lighting.  Arrangements to get electric light from various private providers are proving very satisfactory.

All in all the year has been one of progress with the erection of new houses and other buildings and the renovation of others.  The replacement of Dead Man’s Bridge is in hand.  The provision of £240 from the Commonwealth has enabled this work (on condition it be done by returned soldiers).
