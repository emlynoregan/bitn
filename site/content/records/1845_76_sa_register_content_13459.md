Kooringa News, 23 May

The SA Mining Association has despatched in the week a party of miners to their northern estate, which adjoins that of the Great Northern Mining Co.  The party consists of ten men under the direction of Captain Bryant.

A promising lode has been discovered in the Wheal Sarah Mine.  It is richly impregnated with copper, was cut at 22 fathoms and is 3½ feet wide. [In the Register of 1 June the Kooringa correspondent corrects this report by saying the discovery was in the Broughton River Mine.]

Klaer Brothers continued to draw large audiences in their week’s stay here.

Weather.  Winter arrived late.  Yesterday we had a sharp hail shower and all week there has been rain at intervals.
