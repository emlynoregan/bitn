Burra Town Council decided last meeting to buy a watercolour of Kooringa depicting the Burra Mine in the days before the open cut.  Mr H. Dingle of Adelaide has offered it to them for £3, though he had paid £5 for it.

Mr Davey the Town Clerk had written to P. Milner asking him to have a look at the picture.  The latter had said it was a painting of the Mine in 1847 and should be of value to the town.

Cr Lott moved that it be purchased (he had seen it).  Motion carried.
