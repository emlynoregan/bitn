The report of the inquest into the death of Mr James Leo Cleary is very detailed, extending to more than 5½ columns on pages 1 & 4.

First witness was Thomas Maxwell Saint, Manager for Elder, Smith at Balaklava.  He was driving a car following Pearce & Cleary some ¼ to ½ mile behind.  He did not see the collision, but arrived soon after.  Mr Cleary had been in the front passenger seat and Mr Pearce was driving.  When Saint arrived Mr Pearce was in the front seat and Mr Cleary in the back seat.  Mr Cleary died soon after Saint’s arrival.

Pearce was driving a Ford V-8.  He was travelling from Burra to Spalding.  The speed of Pearce’s car was estimated at 25-30 m.p.h.  Mr Warnes and Saint drove into Booborowie to get assistance and then returned to the scene.  Mr Warnes was driving from Leighton towards Booborowie at about 40 m.p.h.  This would make Mr Pearce’s car the car on the right and Mr Warnes’ car the one on the left.  The accident happened between 3.30 & 3.45.  Mr Pearce was speaking quite coherently and was easily helped from the car.

Dr Steele gave evidence of attending the scene.  The deceased was then dead and without external injuries to cause death.  Post mortem showed death was due to most ribs being fractured and puncturing the lungs.  Shock and haemorrhage to the lungs was the cause of death.

M-C Boyce then gave evidence.  Most of it confirms the above.  He recorded a statement from Thomas Murray Warnes (21) driving a Buick sedan No. 4680 from Leighton to Oliver Baynes’ at Booborowie – travelling at c. 40 m.p.h.  Boyce gave further evidence about the scene of the accident.  He interviewed Max Pearce the next morning at his home.  He said he was going to Spalding to inspect some sheep.  Boyce said the intersection is open and no building or growth obstructed the view.  Pearce’s car appears to have rolled right over.  The centre of the near side door was driven in 2 feet from the outside alignment of the rear footboard.  Boyce’s impression was that the middle of the front of the Buick hit the centre of the side of the V-8.  The V-8 slid on its side against the cyclone fence and then righted itself.  [There was some doubt about whether the car actually rolled right over and considerable evidence was taken to try and decide this issue.]

M-C Edington corroborated M-C Boyce.  He questioned Mr Pearce in the presence of Mr Bednall as legal adviser.  On legal advice Mr Pearce did not make a statement concerning his speed or on when he first saw Mr Warnes’ car.  Pearce said his brakes were good and the road was dry.  Visibility was all right.  He did not know that the car had capsized.  Edington considered Warnes had applied the brakes 23 yards before impact, but there was no sign of Pearce’s car braking, though it seems to have swerved sharply right four yards before impact.

Allan Lomman said Max Pearce had been brought into the Booborowie Hotel.  Pearce had asked him what happened and who had hit him.  He said he had never seen a thing and enquired after Cleary.  He also gave other details concerning events at the hotel.  Mr Pearce did not really know what was going on at the hotel.

Thomas Francis cousins, hotel proprietor at Booborowie, also gave evidence that although Mr Pearce seemed to understand what was said to him, he asked the same questions over and over.

Tom Warnes refused to answer any questions on legal advice.

The findings were that James Leo Cleary met his death at Booborowie on 20 December from shock and haemorrhage caused by a collision between two cars, one driven by Max Pearce, since deceased, and the other by Thomas Murray Warnes.  ‘Evidence of negligence is shown on the part of both drivers of a nature that I cannot describe as criminal.’
