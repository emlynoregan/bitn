A.L. Bence writes again saying he had previously expressed criticism of the present system of the Unemployment Relief Committee.  He says:

I admit the system is state-wide and not confined to Burra.  In this system goods and clothing are supplied from the city, instead of which I advocated the same being provided locally.

According to the Council notes published on 13 November any alternative to the present system is not favoured by the Mayor, hence my criticism.  I was also critical of his remarks about the Government being able to supply the goods more cheaply that the local storekeepers.

Bence then goes on to accuse the Mayor of making ‘rambling comments’ in a letter which is ‘very hard to understand’, but says Bence perhaps this is due to his stupidity or lack of intellect, which the Mayor was so kindly able to point out.  On reflection he is afraid he has made the grave error of daring to pass criticism on the Mayor and so he has decided to apologise, not to the Mayor, but to the Editor for being the cause of a good column of the Burra Record ‘being wasted on such absolute rubbish as your letter’.

‘[After] reading your comments I find it is only a waste of time on my part and I am too busy a man at present to enter into any further press communications with you.  It takes a big man to appreciate a criticism and to answer same in the right spirit.’
