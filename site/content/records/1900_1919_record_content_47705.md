WCTU.  An afternoon address by Mr Stanton, General Secretary of the SA Alliance, is reported in 1 column: The Hereditary Influence of Alcohol.

[This is as typically extreme in its views as his other address, for example he cites as an instance that in ten drinking families with 52 children, only four were normal.]
