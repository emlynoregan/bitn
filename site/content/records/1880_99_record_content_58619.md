The retiring councillors were invited to speak.

Cr Hardy said that he had little to say and would address his own ward in a day or two.

He defended the North Ward overdraft, saying they had got value for money.  He believed the Mayor had acted conscientiously in voting for the highest tenderer.

Cr Harris thought the Mayor’s Report was good and explained the workings of the Council well.  Had there not been a new assessment his ward would have ended in credit.

[The £25 cost of the new assessment was split evenly between the wards.]
