Mr Rounsevell’s Central Establishment

[This is quite a long and detailed article of which the following is but a selection of key facts.]

Few are aware of the extent of Mr Rounsevell’s establishment or the amount of capital employed in his wide ranging operations.  Not many years ago few people travelled into the interior except missionary preachers, mailmen, commercial travellers, policemen and stockmen and all travelled on horseback.  Wheeled vehicle were out of the question except in the most favourable seasons of the year and even then much time was lost on waiting for repairs.  Outlying farmers were compelled to make visits to the city more often than was convenient, but visits by the females of their families were short and widely spaced.

Now the Central Road Board has slowly extended carriage tracks in various directions from the city.  In other cases rapidly expanding commerce has seen the development of other roads, perhaps neither as splendid nor as safe as might be desired.

Mr Rounsevell is an old colonist who early in his career worked hard and turned his earnings to good account.

The town establishment is situated in Pirie Street, but extends through to, and has and entrance also on Grenfell Street.  It extends over 1½ acres with stables, coach sheds, smithies, coach builders and harness makers’ shops.  The buildings have little architectural beauty, having been erected piecemeal as required.  There are three sections: the carriage business, the conveyance of mail and the Bay Road and orders.

The business employs 200 horses and the stables have room for nearly 50 horses.  Mr Rounsevell grows upon his own farm a large proportion of the consumption of this Adelaide establishment.  The workshops are needed to cope with the wear and tear of 1,744 miles per day.

[The article continues by discussing some of the variety of works done on the premises and also discusses the wide range of vehicles kept.  Rounsevell provided a great variety of vehicles for special occasions as well as the mail conveyances and coaches etc. used in country travel.  He had for hire such things as hearses and mourning coaches, wedding carriages, light gigs and unwieldy omnibuses.]

Mr Rounsevell employs some 250 people.
