Christmas Eve saw packed streets and scores of cars down Commercial St and in Market Square with other vehicles of all descriptions in side streets.  The Electric Supply Co. installed four special 2,000 candle power lights and several businesses had 1,000 candle power lights or a number of coloured lights.  All places reported good business.
