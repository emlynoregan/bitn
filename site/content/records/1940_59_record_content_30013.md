Local Board of Health

Dr Heddle, Acting health Officer, reported that the Bacon Factory premises were not in as sanitary a condition as they should be.  He recommended the Health Inspector examine them every week as they were so close to private living quarters.

Certain residents in Bridge St are to be informed it is against the Act to drain washing water into the streets.
