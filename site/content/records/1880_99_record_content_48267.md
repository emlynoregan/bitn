Monster Open-Air Meeting in aid of Broken Hill Relief

A large crowd assembled in Market Square.  Mr W.T. Rabbich, the Mayor, addressed them.  He said they were not there to discuss the responsibility for the present state of affairs, but simply to assist the distressed.  Rev. R.J. Daddow delivered an excellent ringing address.  He outlined the evidence of the real need prevailing in Broken Hill and how there was ongoing real poverty despite the fact that the men had been well supplied during the strike.  Rev. J. Hopkins and Rev. R.M. Hunter also gave addresses.  Mr H. Bennetts, a former Burra boy but late of Broken Hill, gave an account of the extent of the problem and outlined hoe the poor had survived.  There were 1,700 unemployed at present in Broken Hill and 500 to 600 of them will never work there again.  The collection raised £3-7-0 and in addition Mr McCulloch gave £5 and Mr J.R. Gray £1-1-0.  The Burra-Jamestown cricket match raised £4-6-0 and the Salvation Army service on Sunday raised 15/-.  Subscription lists are out.
