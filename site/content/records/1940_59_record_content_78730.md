Burra Town Hall Centenary falls today.

The first section of the Town Hall, then called the Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute, was opened on Thursday 27 August 1857 with a tea meeting at 4 p.m. at which hymns were sung by English and German choristers.  The meeting was in the charge of Mr R.B. Robinson and Rev. D.H.J. Ibbetson as Secretary.  Sufficient funds had been raised in sixteen months to warrant the erection of the building.  They said at the time it was erected to meet the wants and increase the comforts of the poorest and humblest individuals in the district and was not, as some have supposed, intended for the exclusive use of those already possessed of ample means and who have received in early life a liberal education.  With a Government grant the Institute Credit with the Union Bank stood at upwards of £1,400 out of which the building contractors had to be paid £920; leaving £480 to furnish the rooms, increase the stock of books and pay for lighting etc.  There were present at the opening 74 subscribers at £1 each and the services of Mr W.H. Birbeck had been secured as a librarian.  About 250 persons attended the opening.  The Town Council intends to obtain a small plaque to be attached to the Town Hall to mark the occasion.
