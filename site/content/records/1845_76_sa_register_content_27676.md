Kooringa, 27 May

Redruth Wesleyan Chapel held Anniversary Services on Sunday at which J.D. Hill preached to large congregations.  Tea and public meetings were held on the Queenâ€™s Birthday and were well attended.

Rain is much needed.  The last two days have been marked by dust and a dry, cutting wind.
