Burra Mine

Officers of the Department of Mines are hampered in their testing and searching at the mine by incomplete records of the old workings and they are seeking any help available.  Having used drilling and induced polarisation, they are now using the geochemical method, but are hampered by a lack of factual information in the mine workings below the open cut.  If any local or former resident of Burra has any old plans or reports etc. they would be gratefully received.  They would particularly like any first hand knowledge of the two diamond drill test holes put down in the vicinity of the open cut in about 1900.  One was completed in 1897 and the other early in 1900, but the exact locations are not known.  Details from a log book would be valuable.  It would be wonderful if findings warranted the opening of operations in the area.  Geochemical prospecting relies on the changes in the composition of overlying soils caused by the decay of the bedrock.  Soil movement and ground water movement mean the minerals sought are in trace element proportions.
