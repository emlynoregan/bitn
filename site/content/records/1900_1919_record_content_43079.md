The Season.  The Eastern Plains have been very dry, but recent rains have brought a slight flush of green, though more is required.  Since this was written patchy falls have been reported: some as low as 0.20” at Quondong, but up to 0.90” at Old Koomooloo, 1.20” at Koomooloo and 1.57” at Mongolata.
