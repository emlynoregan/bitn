Obituary.  Mrs George Parker was born at Stony Gap in 1869, the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Flower.  She was educated at Stony Gap and in 1893 married Mr George Parker.  After three years of marriage they moved to Copperhouse where they spent 23 years share-farming, shearing and contracting.  There was a family of six: four daughters and two sons, of whom five survive.  The youngest son, Joe, died as a result of an accident in 1925.  In 1916 Mr Parker bought a property at Booborowie and the family moved there until his death in 1946.  Mrs Parker then came to live in Queen Street in Burra where she lived alone until in the last five or six years of failing health she was forced to share her home life with daughter, Mrs H. Cornelius of Burra and Mrs Herb Collins of Booborowie.  She died at Burra Hospital on 8 January after an illness of nine weeks.  She leaves four daughters and one son: Vida Mrs Jack Pens (Burra), Mill Mrs Herbert Cornelius (Booborowie) [sic], Cecil (Queensland), Cass Mrs Oliver Earle (Swan Hill) and Lill Mrs H. Cornelius (Burra).

[Mill (Mildred) was really Mrs William Herbert Collins]

[Born Rebecca Flower 27 May 1869 at Stony Gap.]
