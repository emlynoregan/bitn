Goyder Council’s Development assessment Panel last week approved Peter Kelly’s application for a shed for sheet metal manufacturing.  However, the application was also referred to Heritage SA, which recommends that approval not be given.  If the DAP does not totally adopt Heritage SA’s recommendation the decision has to go to the Development Assessment Commission in Adelaide before it can be enacted.  This was done on 30 August.  The application was also referred to the Environment Protection Authority for comment, as it involved a spray-painting booth.  Transport SA was also consulted because the development will require a new access to a primary arterial road – the Barrier Highway.  The EPA recommended approval subject to conditions.  Transport SA also approved.  The application also had to be advertised for public comment.  Of the 22 representations made, 18 were against and 4 were for the application, although some of those applied would support it in another location.

Minister for Tourism Jane Lomax-Smith expressed her concerns that it had the potential to detract from the visitors’ ‘arrival’ experience.  Goyder Council’s Planner said that despite the application being able to satisfy the demands of the EPA and Transport SA, he was of the opinion that this will be overshadowed by possible negative implications.  Metal manufacturing should be in an industrial zone.  He supported the concerns of Heritage SA and on balance believed that the development was seriously at variance with the Goyder development Plan.  He recommended that the application be refused.  The DAP’s decision to approve means that the final word now lies with the Development Assessment Commission in Adelaide.
