Burra Show on 10 October will be opened by the Governor of SA Sir Edric Bastyan.  An attempt will be made to get the Central Command Band to attend.  Membership fees have risen for the first time since 1937.  Mr R. Humphrys has been made an Honorary Life Member.  Other Life Members are: T.D.J. Beckwith, W.H. Lloyd, A.B. Riggs and R. Fuss.

Weather.  The temperature at Ulooloo on Thursday 11 June was 16Â°F early in the morning.

The Baby Train will soon make its last visit.  It will not be continued after 22 June.

Kindergarten Week will see the Burra Kindergarten open to the public on Saturday 20 June from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.  On Wednesday 24 June the Kindergarten will be open for inspection on a normal working day.

SAR Commissioner J.A. Fargher reports that the railway from Broken Hill to Port Pirie is being converted to standard gauge and the question of a standard gauge connection with Adelaide is being discussed. Though not yet decided, it would probably be along the Port Pirie line, at least as far as Merriton.  He considered that even when constructed such a line would have little if any affect upon the number of railway workers living in Riverton.
