St Edmund’s Church at Booborowie was dedicated 24 June by the Venerable Archdeacon Bussell, acting on the Commission of the Bishop.  Bad roads deterred visitors from afar, but the church was filled with locals.  The Rector of St Mary’s and Mr D. Keynes, lay reader, assisted.  The nave of the church was completed four years ago and dedicated.  This ceremony saw the dedication of the sanctuary.  We understand that of the cost of the work of £270 less than £40 is outstanding.  Contractors were Mr J. Frahm (mason) and Mr R. Fuss (carpenter).
