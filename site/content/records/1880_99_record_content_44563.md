‘Nemo’ writes addressing comments made by the Redruth correspondent on 17 February concerning the abrupt end to the cricket match between Quarrymen & Gentlemen.

One day’s cricket is always a one innings match.

The Quarrymen & Gentlemen’s game was so decided, which was satisfactory.

It was arranged to draw stumps at 6 p.m. when the second innings were started.

The Gentlemen did not ‘take up their stumps and clear’, but the Quarrymen were responsible for taking up the ‘mallee’. 

It was Quarrymen & Gentlemen as arranged, but turned out to be Gentlemen & Combined, as only 6 of the 11 were Quarrymen.

The title of ‘Gentlemen’ was designated by the Quarrymen themselves.

The Gentlemen are prepared to play the Quarrymen at Burra Oval at any time if they play ‘straight’.
