Burra Town Council

Letter from the Hydraulic Engineer re the use of mains water for fires, to the effect that the matter was under consideration.

Cr Radford moved that water be laid on to the reserve in Ludgvan St and it be planted with grass.  Carried.

The fire hose has arrived.  Resolved that a fire reel be purchased and it be stored at the depot.

Mr Sedgman has been ordered to return the hydrant to Adelaide and had done so.

The Department is to be written to asking for its return.

The Mayor to convene a meeting at a suitable time to discuss the formation of a fire brigade.

Cr Radford moved the relaying of the ford near Gully’s as required.  Lowering its height was debated.  It was resolved that no action be taken till the road was put on the Main Roads Grant.

The Mayor was asked to stand again.  He said he had approached Mr Winnall to stand, but as that gentleman had declined he would stand unless some other candidate came forth.

Sympathy was extended to Cr Killicoat and Mrs P.L. Killicoat on the death of Sgt D. Killicoat in action.

Soldiers’ Aid Society.  Approximately 500 sandbags have been despatched.  The fund stands at £116-17-6.

Burra Cheer-up Society.   On 1 November Captain Chaplain Nield gave an interesting lecture on Egypt.  L.M. Gordon, who was leaving for the front, wrote to thank the Society for its gift.

Pte F. Tiver writes that he is ill in hospital in Egypt.

A social was given to L-Cpl Bennetts, Pte Edmunstan and Pte Higgins on 2 November.
