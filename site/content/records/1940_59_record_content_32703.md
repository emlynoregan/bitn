Burra Town Council

Last night the rate was increased from 2/8 to 3/8 to cover operating costs and pay off the large overdraft, which has accumulated over the last two or three years.  Though the rate is high the town assessment is very low.  It has not changed significantly since 1932 when property values were at a minimum.  During the coming year the Council will either have a new assessment done or recommend to ratepayers a move to rates based on unimproved land values.  The rate in 1939 was 3/9 comprising a general rate of 2/6 and a special rate of 1/3.
