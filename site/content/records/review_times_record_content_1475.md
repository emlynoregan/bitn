Weather.  After a very dry season, which had threatened near total crop failure in some areas, it has at last rained.  Over Monday and Tuesday Burra received 4.6 and then 8.8 mm (53 points).  Booborowie farmers say this may be enough for a 50% yield instead of failure.  Lucerne is responding well, though it was too late in the season to help grasslands much.

Mrs A.B .Riggs, who came to last monthâ€™s Burra Show, will be 94 on 6 November.

Mrs Flo Kellock celebrated her 90th birthday at Aberdeen Club Rooms on Sunday.
