Burra Town Council, Monday

Cr Dow moved that the Mayoral allowance be increased from £20 to £50, knowing that it cost His Worship a large amount from his private purse to carry out the duties of office.

Cr Jennison sympathised with the problem in principle, but could not support such a large increase, given the present financial position of the Council.

Crs Kellaway and Jeffery had similar views.

Bearing in mind that the Centenary Year 1936 could be expected to create extra expenses for the Mayor an increase was justified.  After discussion an increase to £30 was passed.

Damage done by stray cattle at Aberdeen was discussed.

Cr Jeffery said the pound was no deterrent.  The owners laughed at the fines, saying they got back more than the cost in grass off the roads.

The Mayor said the pound-keeper had no power to prosecute, but the Ranger could.  The Town Clerk said they had a Ranger.  The Ranger said he had been through Aberdeen night after night and never saw any stray stock; they must be let out very late at night.  It was resolved to prosecute owners of stray stock.  There was some debate over whether this was fair for owners whose stock made the occasional escape, but Cr Dow said there were people who had made a habit of it for years.  A conviction with court costs would amount to 35/-.  An amendment was carried that prosecution be instituted for second offences only.
