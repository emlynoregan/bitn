Obituary.  Mr James Brady was born at Willamottey Station on 24 May 1840*, where his father was a shepherd.  While he was still young the family moved to Mt Bryan East where he lived until the last couple of years, when he was an inmate of the Burra Hospital.  One of his earliest jobs was as a shepherd for the late Mr Richard Reed of Wandillah near Burra.  In his early 20s he went shearing at a time when they had to walk to the various sheds with their swags on their backs.  He often used to speak of the long distances between sheds up north – distances of up to 100 miles.  He was an outstanding walker in those days and more often than not he was the first to reach the shed.  Some of his mates would arrive a day or two later on account of their feet.  He used to shear at Koomooloo and would walk home to Mt Bryan East after knocking off at 1 p.m. Saturday and return to Koomooloo by Sunday night, a distance of 30 miles each way.  He always brought his shearing cheque home to his mother so they could have more of the necessities of life.  Throughout his life his work was always on the heavy side.  He was a bullock driver, made dams and farmed with bullocks at Mt Bryan East.  With his stepfather Mr Bill Phillips, in the early part of this century, he went share farming with the late Sir John Melrose at Ulooloo Station.  Jim and Mr Phillips also did quite a lot of contract fencing in the back country.  He was a good axeman and at their Newikie holding he had cleared about 400 acres of mallee scrub.  Now that area is covered in pasture – a living monument to a grand pioneer.  Until about six years ago he used to shear his own flock of about 400 sheep, with blades – probably the only man who ever lived to do it at that age.  He loved hunting kangaroos and rabbits with his dogs.  He had some outstanding sheep dogs and was very good with them.  He was a good-natured and kind-hearted person.  He never married and gave his life for his mother.  James was the oldest of five brothers and as far as is known Jack, Tom, Will and Joe are all deceased.  He also had four sisters: Eliza Mrs Regan, Lucy Mrs Carpenter and Mary Mrs Nelson, all of Broken Hill, and Mrs August Pohlner of Hallett.  As far as is known only Mrs Nelson survives.

[The date 24 May 1840 is obviously nonsense: in fact James Brady was born 3 June 1862 at Outalpa: so actually 94 at death.  He died 24 September 1956.]
