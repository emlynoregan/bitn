A Bolt.  A cart horse with a spring cart with Mr Watson of ‘Mullaby’ aboard bolted one day last week down Commercial Street.  Startled by the white posts on the bridge past Kangaroo St, it spun on its tracks, zigzagging first towards C.J. Pearce’s and then towards Jennison’s Tyre Service.  It headed for the District Council chambers and stopped undamaged right in the middle of the footpath.
