Good Friday Tennis is opposed by Revs. L.R. Lenthall, C. Christopher, M. Martin & Gowan Armstrong, who write a long letter protesting the organisation of a tennis tournament on Good Friday.  They do not imagine their protest will stop the event, but hope it will provoke thought in responsible people about their religious obligations at this season.
