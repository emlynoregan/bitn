The situation to the northeast, east, and southeast is dire.  Holder has at last got the government to introduce a bill to supply vermin-proof fencing to District Councils and others.  But areas of Crown Land are swarming with vermin as are many of the large pastoral holdings.  It is not the farmers that should be paying for fencing; it is those who have bred them that should destroy the pests.
