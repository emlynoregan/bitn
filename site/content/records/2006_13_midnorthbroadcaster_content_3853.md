Burra Boy Scouts

Numbers are presently down to 14 and Jack Webster is calling for boys aged 6 to 13 to consider joining.  Meetings are once a week on Wednesday for just over an hour.  The cost is $180, but is well worth the investment as it involves crafts, camping, games, first aid and badge work in which boys acquire a range of skills.  It improves a childâ€™s ability to interact with others.  Mr Webster said it is also a way to be involved in the community and build self esteem.
