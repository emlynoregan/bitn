13 July 1978

The Burra School & Community News has been published weekly since 19 June [sic; but other evidence suggests 9 June] and has been made available free of charge due to the financial support of the Burra Apex Club.

The Burra Youth Group.  Work on the new club rooms is progressing well and within a few weeks the old school classroom will be transformed into a pleasant recreational area.  It is hoped the building will be ready for use by the end of the month.  To raise funds the group will screen the film Rollerball at BCS on 21 July at 8 p.m.
