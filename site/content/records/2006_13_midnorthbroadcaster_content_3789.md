Mrs Pauline Walker, nee Williams, formerly of Baldina Station, celebrated her 70th birthday at the Marion Bowling Club recently.  It became an extended Williams family reunion and almost 200 friends and relatives attended.  They were the descendants of Welsh-born Israel Williams who settled at Tothillâ€™s Creek in the 1850s.  [Some of those who attended are listed and there are 2 photographs.]
