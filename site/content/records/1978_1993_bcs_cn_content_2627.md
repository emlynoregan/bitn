Burra District Advisory Committee

The Council has asked the Committee to investigate the possible uses of rooms in the Town Hall now available for adaptation since the opening of the Civic Centre â€“ rooms that were previously the Council Chamber, the meeting room and the Institute Library.  Also the last meeting of the Committee considered the future of the Telephone Exchange switchboards after the automatic exchange has been installed.  Efforts are being made to retain these as items of historic value.
