Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club AGM was held at the boat shed 23 November.  President H.C. Atkins took the chair.  The balance sheet shows a credit of £70.  Elected for 1929-30 season were: Patron, W.G. Hawkes; President, H.C. Atkins; Vice-Presidents, E.B. I’Anson & C. Carter; Hon. Secretary & Treasurer, A.J. Smith.  The annual sports on 27 January will be land based only, as the water level has fallen too low for aquatic events.
