A cow rushed out of the Burra Hotel yards on Saturday morning and charged all it encountered in a mad series of charges.  It ‘went for’ a trolly, but did no damage.  It finally chased a young man over the fence at St Mary’s and in doing so it fell heavily, breaking its back and was immediately removed and buried.
