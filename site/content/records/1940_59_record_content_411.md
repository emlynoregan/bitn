George Gallagher of Pualco Station was charged with dangerous driving.  Mr Williams of Leighton was travelling north crossing the intersection at the Royal Exchange Hotel when the defendant overtook him and tried to turn left into the road leading to the station.  Gallagher’s car struck William’s car, then hit the sign on the northern side of Morehead St, ran onto the footpath under the verandah of Harvey’s shop, then back onto the road and continued towards the station.  The court imposed the minimum fine of £10 + 10/- costs and also a fine of £1 + 10/- costs for failing to stop.
