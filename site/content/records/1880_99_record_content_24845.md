Report on election meeting, which was a very orderly affair lasting c. 3.5 hours.

P. Lane took the chair and the candidates were Dr. Cockburn, W.B. Rounsevell & F.W. Holder.

Dr Cockburn said the deficit was now just under £1,000,000 due to a decrease in land sales, poor seasons and falling income from customs and the falling SA population.  Sale of lands should decrease the deficit or go on works that would save money from being borrowed.  He had opened 30 more schools and 1,000 more students were enrolled.  He favoured a mixture of income and property tax, but a property tax was better than an income tax.  The Govt. favoured water conservation and in the future when land was sold the mineral rights would remain with the Crown.  Land to be surrendered under the 1888 leases was being cut up to allow men to combine farming with raising livestock.  He supported the payment of members, which he had introduced into the House, but it was rejected by the Council.  Mr Kingston & Mr Catt had both tried again, but again it was rejected.  He thought it would pass next time.

He had introduced a parcel post to England and would like soon to have one within SA.  He intended to stop subsidies to Institutes, which had ceased to be educational places and become mere circulating libraries.  He would support subsidised free reading rooms £ for £.  During the last 20 years one of the members for Burra had always been in the Govt.

Mr Rounsevell believed the ministry had been found wanting.  He was a free trader.  The deficit was due to extravagance, world depression and low returns from land sales.  Treasury notes should be issued.  The Savings Bank should be nationalised and it should take up the Treasury notes with the £345,000 they had in the Bank of NSW, thus returning it to SA.  Treasury Bills would fall due in 2, 3, 4, & 5 years and would be paid by the sale of lands.  Expenditure should be on developmental works such as railways, ports and water conservation.  There should be a 10% cut in civil service salaries, but not for those earning <£150, 5th class should be cut by 10%, 4th class (earning £270) by 15% and above that the cut should be 20%.

The expenditure on education should be cut.  State schools were giving more than a primary education.  The rich were having their children educated along with the poor.  The standard would have to be reduced.  If a man wants a better education for his children let him pay for it.  The Education Department should pay for itself.

A property tax was iniquitous and inquisitional and should never be tolerated - the present exemptions should be removed and the minimal taxable amount be reduced to £150.

Mr Holder held that the present deficit could not be reduced by selling Crown Land, but as long as there was a policy of selling Crown Land the income should be used for works of a permanent nature.  This had not always been done, but to use it to reduce the deficit would perpetuate the problem.  It could be handled with the use of Treasury Bills over 10-12 years, redeemable in annual instalments.  This had to be combined with retrenchments and economy.  A property tax was a tax on all a man owned and was a tax on frugality and a punishment for saving.  A land tax was more equitable and a new assessment would be a third lower than the old one.  The income tax minimum should be lowered to £200.  He favoured irrigation schemes like the Chaffey Bros. and was a free trader.  He favoured payment for members and gold mining on private properties. (With compensation to owners for damages done etc.)  He favoured the education system and wanted all classes of society taught together by the same teachers.  The solution to Rounsevell’s problem was to tax the wealthier more and then educate all the children together.  School fees should be abolished.  For the sake of a mere £10,000 the rich were pauperising the poor.  The cost of educating children in state schools should be paid per capita to the Catholic and Lutheran system as they had conscientious objections to sending their children to state schools.
