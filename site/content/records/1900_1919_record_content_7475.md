The New School of Mines and Industries on North Terrace, Adelaide, was opened on 24 February by Lieut. Governor Sir Samuel Way in a long and tedious ceremony including a speech for the better part of an hour by Sir Samuel.  The Premier, J. Jenkins proposed a vote of thanks, seconded by Sir Frederick Holder.  Sir Frederick is appearing very little in social life at present.
