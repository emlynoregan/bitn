Saltbush Prime

Clare chef Stephen Schmitz is supplying saltbush hogget carcases for $7.70 kg to top restaurants and hotels around Australia and overseas, it was revealed at a ‘saltbush hogget’ meeting in Burra last week.

He urged graziers and industry representatives to think seriously about organising the marketing of a new product to be called ‘Saltbush Prime’.

This is needed to control substitution rackets, regulate prices and develop bulk markets.  The product can be promoted as lean, clean and green – without chemicals.

It would use merinos 18-24 months with a dress weight of 23-25 kg.  Hanging on the bone (cryovac storage) for up to six weeks improves the flavour.  It should be treated as a game meat:

Hot searing followed by a long rest period

Or if slow cooked, in an open dish.

Ian Warnes of Woolgangi is supplying 25 animals per week to WildOz Pty Ltd for a fixed $40 per head.  Although time consuming, it was worthwhile because of the reliability of the sales.  Woolgangi runs 8,000 to 10,000 merinos, producing 2,500 to 3,000 lambs.  Hoggets from outside country are suitable for 8-10 months of the year, but in the dry period after Christmas the idea is to supplement from animals off saltbush plantations in the inside country.
