James Trewartha writes on Miners’ Wages

Following the appearance in two other papers of a letter from Henry Ayers, commenting on my evidence at the trial of Gilles v. Glen Osmond Union Mining Co., I seek this opportunity of clarifying what I was trying to say in my examination.

I said that the wages formerly paid in Cornwall and the Isle of Man was higher than in SA.  Except for a brief period near the discovery of the metallic ors in SA, wages here have been lower that in any foreign country where mining has been pursued.  For a few years of financial depression at Home, it is true that wages have been depressed, and this has driven miners to emigrate, but rapidly reviving economic circumstances in the UK will see this spur to emigration disappear.  The real question involved in the action referred to was the legitimate working of mines with a view to their permanency as profitable speculations.  It was alleged that the mine had not been properly worked.  Having inspected the underground workings, I was convinced the allegations were true.  It was alleged in defence that the high cost of operations here compared with in the UK prevented the development of the resources.  This is a remarkable blunder.  The costs of working a mine are strongly in favour of the colony.  The absence of large machinery and steam power and the shallowness of operations all greatly reduce costs.  Nor is the cost of wages an excuse.  The Glen Osmond miners have earned little over £1 a week and given the high costs of living in the colony, the local miner is no better off than in Cornwall.  My mining experience in Cornwall extended from boyhood to full majority, while my mining qualifications here have been perfected by long experience amid the mining operations of foreign countries and several returns to Cornwall have maintained by knowledge of operations there up to about two years ago.  I have been influenced by no private or selfish motive in giving my evidence; in fact I conceived that I had a public duty to perform, since the precedent, once established, of picking out the eyes of the mines in SA, would spell the end to everything like legitimate mining in the future.
