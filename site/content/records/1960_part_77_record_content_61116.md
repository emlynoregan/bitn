Theft.  Six Burra shops were broken into in the early hours of Friday morning.  Over 25,000 cigarettes were stolen along with $150 in coins, watches worth $160 and other items.  At about 5.40 a.m. Mr Geoff Spackman saw a white Falcon sedan speed away from the lane at the rear of Bence’s.  He and Mr L.A. Beinke notified police.

Oppy’s Save-Way	5,700 cigarettes stolen worth $107.

Market Square Café	entered, but nothing apparently taken.

Burra Food Traders	8,200 cigarettes stolen valued at $169 and $30 in coins.

Pearce’s Hardware	a .22 rifle ($89), watches to value $400 and $21.30 in coins.  Some watches and coins were recovered, having apparently been missed when the stolen goods were loaded into the vehicle.

T.W. Wilkinson	watches ($160), coins ($30), comics ($5) and cigarettes ($45).

Burra Serv-Wel	Safe and $63, 10,800 cigarettes valued at $215 and other items to $7.

The same thieves are believed to be responsible for thefts on the previous night at Angaston and on Friday night at Saddleworth.  Several stores in Eudunda were entered on the same night as the Burra break-ins, but that perpetrator was later apprehended at Pt Augusta.
