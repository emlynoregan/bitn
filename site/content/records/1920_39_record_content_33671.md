Light Horse Notes.  [References to the local Light Horse have been very few throughout the 1920s.  Some years they are mentioned going to their annual camp.]

Lieut. M.T. Fuller & Cpl R. Jeffery attended a voluntary week-end camp on 22 & 23 February.

There will be a military sports program next Anzac Day in the city, with a camp at Keswick and an encampment in the Easter Holidays at Gawler from 18 to 21 April.  The local troop has vacancies for 8 recruits at present.
