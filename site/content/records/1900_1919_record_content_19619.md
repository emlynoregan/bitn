Accident.  Mr Julius Kiekebusche has been unconscious now for eight days.  At times he is very uneasy and at other times he is quiet.  No bones are broken and nothing can be done but wait.  Mr Kiekebusche’s father is of course greatly distressed and said he had urged his son to come home before dark and believed he would have done so had not business prevented him.  Mr J.G. Rooke who found the injured man said the horse was a splendid traveller, but rather hot-headed and lively.  The injured man is unchanged as we go to press.
