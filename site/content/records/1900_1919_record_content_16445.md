Fire.  Yesterday afternoon about 4 o’clock a fire started in Mr W. Bullen’s rubbish heap near the baths near what is known as Mr Snell’s Garden.  It spread to the adjoining allotment.  Mr L. Day was attending to the garden and his and other aid prevented damage beyond about a quarter of an acre of grass and two or three fruit trees.  There are many wooden structures in the vicinity that were threatened.
