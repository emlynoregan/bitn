2nd Leader on Silver Mines in World’s End Area.  World’s End mining continues, but assay results are slow in coming in so most work is in the dark.  Whether the lodey stuff is worth the labour is becoming doubtful.  There is confusion over claims at the field as claim-holders have three months to get a survey and in the meantime many claims seem to overlap and clash, and speculators hold too many claims.  There are now over 300 claims in the area.
