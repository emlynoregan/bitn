Bible Christian Church District Meeting was held on Thursday 28 February.

Twenty ministers and seven representatives attended.  Mr Richards began with a sermon.  Mr J .Way was appointed District Chairman for the year.  Mr Roberts, retiring chairman, thanked all for their support.

First business was the examination of the preachers’ character

Secondly, reports from various stations were presented.

Thirdly, the finances of the district were investigated.

At 7 o’clock the chapel filled, with at least 500 people present.  Mr Ashton preached the sermon and the Lord’s Supper was administered to the ministers and about 80 of the friends.

The 4th and 5th sessions on Friday morning considered the work of God in the colony.

The sixth sitting on Friday examined Bro. W.H. Finch for admission to the ministry and he was approved after 2½ hours.  Messrs Woolcock and Tresise were examined on the progress of their studies.

At 7 o’clock 570 people filled the chapel for the ordination service of W.H. Finch.

The ninth siting examined Mr McNeil, who was received as a candidate for the ministry.

The twelfth sitting concerned local matters:

The anniversary services of the chapel were deemed to have been of a high order and the collection of £21 was good considering the state of Burra.

The thirteenth sitting settled the ‘stations’.  [That is the postings of the ministers to chapels and circuits.]

A tea meeting followed in the evening, with addresses by Messrs James Way, S. Keen, J. Ashton, T. Hillmann and J. Hancock.  The collections and tea raised almost £50.  The trustees and friends were pleased that in five years almost £1,000 of the debt had been paid off.

Tuesday was spent on correspondence and further consideration of financial matters.

S. Keen Chapel Secretary reported that in the past year there had been much progress with ten new chapels accommodating a further 1,500 people and two chapels ready to open in a month would accommodate 400 more.  One third of debt on chapels had been paid off.

Wednesday saw a sermon by Messrs Richard Stoye & Rock and the appointment of a committee to act with the General Committee on the Marriage Bill.

[This long article gives considerably more detail and ends with an acknowledgement of satisfaction with Cobb & Co.’s services.]
