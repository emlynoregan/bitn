The surrender and subsequent acts relating to the Waterworks.

As to the first we are surprised that all the work intended to be done was not done before 30 June to make the most of the last grant-in-aid.  This would at least have paid the police moiety.  At least an attempt to resist the claim should have been made.  [Because it was supposed to be tied to the grant-in-aid and could therefore have reasonably have been expected to cease when that ceased.]

As for the road grant, the Council got a lump sum and had no means of checking its correctness.  The critics didn’t discover the underpayment and the error has been corrected for the future.

The Waterworks were handed back as a result of the concurrence of the ratepayers.

Much of the difficulty came as a result of the unforseen depression and the non-supply of water to the Railways Department, neither of which could have been provided against.  The present monstrous assessment must be got rid of.

If the constitution of the new Council does not suit, it is the fault of those who did not stand, not of those who did.  For the Mayor to resign seems very curious because if he deems the new Council to be not in the town’s best interests then he should stay there to counter the ill effects as far as possible - leaving, from his point of view, leaves the other side in possession!
