Aboriginal Body.  The remains of an Aboriginal were discovered at New Aberdeen last week.  Local geologists consider he died at least 100 years ago because of the marks on the bones and their condition.  It is not possible to be sure whether he was buried or the body was covered by ‘the sands of time’, though the latter seems most likely.  [The following is a separate article on the same page about this discovery.]

DISCOVERED AFTER MANY YEARS

Mr A. Fuss, was engaged excavating his back yard at New Aberdeen on Thursday morning when he came across one or two bones.  This raised his curiosity, because he was always under the impression that his yard was composed of virgin soil.  He became interested in his somewhat strange discovery and proceeded carefully about the work.  After a few drives of the pick and the application of the shovel additional bones were found, and Mr Fuss than came to the conclusion that before ‘his time in the world’ someone had been buried there.  Curiosity ran very high and he called in a second party to make a full investigation.  Subsequently the skeleton of an aboriginal was unearthed.  The body was intact but the bones from the hips down were disarranged, still the large bone of one of the legs was complete down to the foot.  The right arm when the body was placed in the hole, which is about 18 inches below the surface, was put across the face and the fingers were bent under the palm of the hand.  The front teeth were much decayed, but strange to say the molars on the jaw were remarkably well preserved, the ivory on the teeth being very plainly seen.  Time has, apparently, with the aid of lime, transformed the bones into petrified stone.  The skeleton measured about six feet, and it is said to be that of a male aboriginal.  Quite a number of persons inspected the skeleton which has been buried again.  Mr W.J. Davey under instructions photographed the relic which can be inspected at the Record Studio.
