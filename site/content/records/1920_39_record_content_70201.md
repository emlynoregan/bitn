Ken Drew	for the pool – the grandstand was a waste of money

Percy Rosman	for the pool – it would save lives

Chester Sandland	for the pool – all parents should teach their children to swim

A. Coverdale	for the pool – a grandstand would be little used unless the ground was much improved

Lindsay Thomas	for the pool

M.W. Bednall	believed general opinion favoured the pool if it could be built for the money available

A.L. Bence	for the pool – a grandstand was ridiculous

Alf Walker	for the pool – a grandstand would not produce any revenue

Rev. Redding	was not opposed to improvements at Victoria Park, but felt the swimming pool had prior claim and was more in demand

A well-known pastoralist said he would give £10 towards a pool, but not for a grandstand.

The article concludes by arguing in favour of a pool to save lives by teaching swimming.
