Burra Boy Scouts.  I.J. Warnes visited the troop on Saturday and was thanked for his assistance at the Christmas Camp.  He donated Â£50 towards a larger scout room and hoped it would inspire others to contribute.  Two other gentlemen have promised to help and any other donations would be thankfully acknowledged.
