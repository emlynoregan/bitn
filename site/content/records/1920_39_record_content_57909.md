Obituary.  Mrs Frederick Pearce died last Thursday from pneumonia after a short illness. She was born at Pt Elliot on 6 September 1859.  In connection with the Methodist Church she was associated with the Guild and assisted in all church work when and wherever she could.  The croquet club has also lost a member.  In WWI Mrs Pearce was a most active member of the Soldiersâ€™ Aid Society and continued to assist until it was disbanded a few years ago.  She was a bright and happy personality.  She is survived by a husband and family of six sons and one surviving daughter: Fred M. Pearce (Aberdeen), Elliot Pearce (Adelaide), Lloyd Pearce (Renmark), Eric (Jack) (Adelaide), Elbourne (Bourn) Pearce, Alwin T. Pearce (Aberdeen) and Miss M.V. (Ola) Pearce (Aberdeen). There are several grandchildren.  One daughter, Hazel (Mrs A. Dawes of Adelaide) and one son, J.E. (Boz) Pearce, predeceased their mother.  [Born Elizabeth Anne Trigg.
