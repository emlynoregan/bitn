Weather.  The hopes for a record season have been dashed by continued dry warm weather in the last two weeks and Tuesday was hot and windy with dust, doing further damage.  To the east pastoralists are much worse hit and the position is serious.  When rain has fallen out there it has been in thin lines of storms rather than generally.  Grasshoppers have made matters worse by appearing in large numbers at Douglas, Baldina Downs and Thistlebeds.
