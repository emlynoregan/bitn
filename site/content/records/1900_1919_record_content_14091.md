Editorial condemning the management of Redruth Reformatory.  ‘It seems monstrous that ‘a brigade of four women cannot exercise that care which is reasonably expected of them over twenty mortals of their own sex.’

‘We have condemned the institution from the start, pointing out that the incarceration of the girls is more liable to make them callous than any good that can be derived from it.’

We wish to know the cause of these escapes.  The night was wet and cold yet two young women sought escape for a few hours – they expected to be caught and yet thought it worthwhile.  ‘There is a need for an investigation and publicity being given the whole working of the Redruth Reformatory.’

‘The girls ventilated their grievances to a lady friend and until these statements are refuted she has every reason to believe them.’

‘We can understand girls seeking their liberty, but we utterly fail to see the reasonableness of them resorting to actions to deprive them of life, as was the case recently.’
