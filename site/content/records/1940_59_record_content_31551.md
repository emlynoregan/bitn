Burra Rifle Club.  Best scorers on Saturday were M. Finch, O. Holmes, L.L. Martin, C. Bushell, I. Burdon, R.R. Bevan, E.C. Hopkins, P. Bown & W. Hempel.

Central Board of Health Inspector visited Burra and recommended that to stop water draining into the creek and forming a breeding ground for mosquitoes it should be made compulsory for all premises to install semi-septic systems.  An Act exists that could enable the Council to implement this practice.  There were several sub-standard houses in the town and they should be condemned when the Housing Commission approved.

Burra Picture Show Proprietorship.  In answer to a question in Council recently the Clerk, Mr E.R. Davey said that the agreement between the present proprietor of the Burra Talkies and the Council did not expire until 1950.  Mr Woollacott said he would like to see the town take over the Picture Show because he saw that as a quicker way for the debt on the Town Hall to be liquidated.  This would have to be prepared for, because there would have to be licensed operators.  It was agreed that the current agreement be placed on the table at the next meeting.

A Topsy-Turvy Ball at Booborowie, in which many of the gentlemen appeared in ball gowns and some [though fewer] of the ladies in suits, was a considerable success.

The Burra Basketball Association will comprise four teams for the coming season: Burra High School, St Mary’s, Kooringa Methodist and Business Girls.

Leighton School has been closed due to the lack of pupils.  This will scarcely boost numbers at Burra however, since three of Leightons four students were in the headmaster’s family.

Mt Bryan East School closed on 2 May.  One of last year’s scholars attends Burra High School and three others are attending Hallett Primary School, leaving only three scholars on the roll.  The school has closed twice for this reason since it opened about 60 years ago.  The last three names on the roll were Levi Hughes, Kathleen Dare and Doreen Dare.

The 1947 ABC National Radio Eisteddfod  will visit Burra.  It is to be hoped that there will be some entries from Burra.

Burra Primary School has two new bitumen tennis courts, built for it by Messrs Holton & Sons during the holidays.
