Burra Swimming Pool

The £500 appeal has reached £413-5-3.  The contractors are going flat out to complete the walls so that the roof can be added before Christmas.  Although the official opening will be later, it is hoped that swimming will be possible before Christmas.  There is a monster working bee planned for next Sunday.  The waders’ pool has to be painted and a few finishing touches are needed on the main pool.  The waders’ pool has to be fenced off from the main pool.  A number of clearing up jobs are to be done.  The pool needs to be emptied, cleaned and refilled.
