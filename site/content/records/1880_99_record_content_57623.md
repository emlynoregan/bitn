Burra District Council Elections.

In Kooringa Ward ‘a candidate who would like to have got home first was handsomely defeated’. 

His defeat was apparently helped by the campaigning of a woman because the paper reports:

‘Through some little difference between the two parties the woman put her shoulder to the wheel and worked with a will against the anxious candidate.  So well did she accomplish her task that there is a likelihood of a duel taking place between the two, but the fair one has signified her intention to toe the mark at any time.’  (Thus in column 1.)

Then, in a humorous report on the election by ‘Spec’ in column 3:

When ‘Spec’ went to see ‘The Butcher’s’ dearly-loved trainer to ask what ailed him ‘he told me that he thought he had taken an overdose of a mixture called the ‘Copperhousmail’ and Kentrophyllum lanatum combined’.

Further on he says: ‘The lady canvasser is the superintendent of the yards – commonly known as the pound.’

[Personal interest: these two comments make it clear that the woman concerned was Ellen Sanders, my great-grandmother.]
