SA Election: Mr Stocks at the Burra

Several hundred people attended Mr Stocks' second public meeting in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Monday.  G.W.R. Mortlock took the chair.

Mr Stocks rose and held before him a large poster with an extract from Mr Ayers’ letter to the officers and miners of the Burra Mine, expressing the desire of the Board that everyone in the employ of the company should exercise his own judgement and consult his own wishes only in voting in the forthcoming election.  His major points were perhaps:

A strong supporter of universal suffrage.

Supported triennial Parliaments.

Many laws need revision: one being the prohibition on distilling.

For free trade.

It would be better if all the money from land sales went on promoting immigration, as it is the lifeblood of progress.

The assistance of the state must be engaged in promoting education in the remote districts of the colony.

Taxation should be kept as low as possible.  The money is better in the people’s pockets.

He favoured local district control of the police force.

He hoped (and believed) that education would reduce the need for so many police.

He repeated his assurances that both Captain Roach and Mr Walters had assured him that they would do nothing that could be construed in any way to arise from malice of ill-feeling in consequence of the conscientious exercise of the franchise.  They agree that they have no right and no desire to interfere with the political rights of the people.

A show of hands indicated strong support for Government grants in aid of education and strongly against any grants to aid religion.

Mr Stocks asked if they thought any elector committing felony should be struck off the electoral list for life.  A majority agreed.

He said that shortly before the Burra mine was discovered the Association’s funds were reduced to £70 and his son had induced them to go on; pledging £70 of his own before they should give up the search in which the Burra Mine was discovered.  He said if one man had a better claim on them than another it was the father of Samuel Stocks Jnr, ‘whom you all respected, and some of you loved’.

‘It would indeed be an honour to occupy the place in the New Council which my son, had he been alive, would have occupied.’

He said he would, if elected, present to Parliament a petition from the Burra, even though it should be opposed to his views.

He would vote for grants in aid of religion, where it is really wanted, would support free trade and would aim to reduce duties and taxes.

He said he was in favour of mineral leases, believing they could do more for the colony than even the Burra Mine had done.
