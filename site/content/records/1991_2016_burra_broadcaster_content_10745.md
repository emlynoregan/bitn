Accident.  A Farrell Flat man rolled his vehicle on the Barrier Highway just south of Burra on Saturday morning.  He was unconscious in the vehicle for about six hours before being found and was transferred to the RAH with a badly broken ankle and minor head injuries â€“ he will not be playing football for the Rams for the rest of the year.
