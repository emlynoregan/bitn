Burra Town Council, 15 October

The Government Grant for Main Roads will be £350 with local contribution to be £100.

The Unemployment Relief Council responded to notification of payment for persons on rations for relief work and advises the Council that it would have to pay for the employment of those not on rations from its own resources: the latter cost being so far £5-15-0.

Permission was granted for the Electricity Co. to swing a light in the middle of the intersection of Chapel & Commercial Streets to better illuminate all corners.

There was discussion over the employment of the men on relief work and the payment from the Unemployment Council.  It was generally thought the limitations imposed were unfair in that they penalised those who were endeavouring to help themselves and tended to drive people onto the rations, but as Cr Dow said: ‘the condition was not a good one, but the point was that the grant was clearly made for rationees only’.

It was resolved that the assessment for 1934-35 would be that of 1933-34 with the necessary alterations and additions.

There was debate about trees and the need to trim some and replace others.

The Mayor thought that ‘crates’ [i.e. tree guards] were out of date and a post either side allowed trees to grow straight and provided them with better light and made cultivation of the ground easier so that they grew better.

Cr Riggs said in his part of the town wandering cows still did a lot of damage.  He moved that action be taken to abate this nuisance.  Passed.

Cr Dow wanted the town gardens put in order.  They needed regular attention rather than major work after being allowed to fall into disorder.  The Mayor said they couldn’t afford the sort of attention he sought.  Nevertheless, it was resolved to employ a man to tidy the gardens and plant new lawns in the Kooringa gardens.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 6th stage of the Baldina Trophy on 20 October when the best scores were from H. Woodman, P.W. Hogan & C.W. Pearce.
