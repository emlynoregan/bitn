‘Inky’ Sellars came in recently with a query concerning the date of Queen Victoria’s death.  He recalled getting a half holiday at school, but couldn’t recall whether it was 21, 22 or 23 January 1901.  Mr Auhl, the present headmaster, was able to discover that ‘Inky’ was there in Grade II, having transferred from Miss Bentley’s School after Grade I.  Queen Victoria died on 22 January and the school got a half holiday of 23 January.

[A list of ‘Inky’s’ classmates is printed.  ‘Inky’ was Roy Sellars 1891-1969.  See 88, 31 (2), 10 Aug. 1965, page 1.]
