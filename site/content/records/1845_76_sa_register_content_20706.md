The Kapunda Mines

The mines are in transition.  The rich ores have gone.

The first discovery was made by Messrs C.S. Bagot and F.S. Dutton while seeking some stray sheep.  The first ore was raised on 8 January 1844 and the first five dray-loads of ore departed Kapunda on 23 January 1844.  The first horse whim to drain water began on 4 March 1845 and kept the mine dry to 15 fathoms.  A steam engine began to pump water on 1 July 1848.  Crushing machinery followed.  A larger engine began work in January 1851.  As at 1862 all water was directed to one shaft and pumped out by this larger engine.  The first engine was then used for haulage and crushing.

Smelting began in December 1849 and for some time a large portion of the ore was reduced to regulus before shipping.  The gold rushes saw smelting cease between March 1852 and March 1855.  Nearly all the miners left and it was with difficulty the engine was kept going to keep the mine dry.  At one point there were just four miners, but the men returned in 1854 and especially early in 1855.

The ore types are quite varied.  To December 1864, 35,280 tons of 21 cwt had been raised of an average produce of 20%.  Underground workings are nearly all confined to the first 80 acre section number 1271, though the company acquired sections 1284 and 1405 to the south of the original section and some allotments north and part of section 1400.  [The engines, machinery and buildings at the mine are then detailed.]

All the ores raised are now reduced to fine copper before shipping.

[Operational changes introduced under Captain Osborne are the detailed, including changed ore treatment arrangements.]

The smelting works have been abandoned.

[There is then discussion of the production of copper dust of 80% copper to be exported to England in casks.]

All carriage within the site will be on tramways.

Handling ores according to Henderson’s Patent is said to accommodate then as low as 3 or 4 %.  The process has not been made public, but involves wet and dry operations.  The wet operation uses sulphuric acid.

It is estimated some 30,000 to 40,000 tons of ore have been raised at 4 to 5% copper and this will be subject to the process.  Great quantities of water will be needed and will be taken from the deepest shaft.

Previously much copper in solution escaped into the River Light, but efforts will be made to contain this extravagance.  At present about 200 persons are employed – 100 of them tributers.

The new company objects to the workings being within the Corporation boundaries with the accompanying rates charges and they also object to the railway’s rates for carriage.  They believe they are entitled to concessions as they presently pay £400 to £500 a month and expect shortly to increase that to £1,000.
