Swimming.  About two weeks ago a shooting party went to Princess Royal and the day was hot enough for some swimming.  [A comment in column 6 suggests in Komatipoort Creek.]  Walter Truscott and George Herbert both got cramp and Thomas Broad entered the water to aid them, though he cannot swim.  Only the aid of others present saved him in turn.  Afterwards a committee was formed to present Mr Broad with an illuminated address in recognition of his brave attempt.  This was presented on Wednesday when the party visited Princess Royal.  Mr E.F. Lockyer gave an eloquent address.
