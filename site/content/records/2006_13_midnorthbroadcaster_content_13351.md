National Trust SA President David Beaumont expressed relief at the decision.  He said the Monster Mine was of national importance and has been nominated for World Heritage listing as a trans-national component of Cornish Mining Sites.  The site also protects important remnant grassland and 24% of the indigenous species have conservation ratings at the national, state and regional level.
