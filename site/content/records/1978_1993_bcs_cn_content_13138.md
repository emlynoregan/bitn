With planning well advanced it is hoped the 1986 Festival will exceed all previous.

The 1983 Festival produced joint profits to organisations in excess of $11,000.

The final program should be available this week, but the following is known:

Friday 10 October	Yarn telling with Mr Jim Kelly with music and drinks by the creek.

Saturday 11 October	Jim Kelly and his bullock team will feature with Mr Jim Lowe, muleteer, at the Burra Show prior to the commencement of the Gulf Road re-enactment and also will be in the Festival Procession and Sunday afternoon activities.

Saturday will see the 109th Annual Burra Show.  [In fact, due to years when not held, it was the 94th Burra show.]

The many special features will include:

Blade and mechanical shearing competition

Wool testing demonstration

Video film ‘Proud Pedigree’

Elders historical film of Market Day sale in Burra (1930s)
