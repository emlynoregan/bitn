‘Irate School Leaver’ writes:

‘There are at least a dozen or more girls who will be leaving school and would like to gain experience in Burra before going to a more challenging job in Adelaide.  Why then can’t they find positions in their own home town?  I put this question to all employers – Why do you prefer married women to single girls?’

‘The majority of married women working have families and husbands who can ably support their families, why then should the women have to work?’
