Ratepayers’ Meeting re Electric Light.  Burra Institute.

The Mayor said that after the last meeting it had been promised there would be a complete canvass of the town and another meeting before a poll on the subject.  The canvass resulted in 477 lights promised for East & West Wards and 174 in North Ward.  The East & West Ward figures did not include public buildings or places where directors’ or a committee’s approval was needed.  The expert advice was that it would not pay to extend the scheme to North Ward.  Though commercially they could make the scheme work for just East & West Wards, they would have to pledge the general rate of the whole town to secure the loan.  If the poll supported the scheme they would have to submit a statement of cost and then raise a loan.

Mr Fuss drew attention to the alteration in the proposed wording of the ballot paper allowing the Corporation to install the lighting in any part of the town it saw fit – giving it power to omit Aberdeen.

Mr Tietz asked if it were fair to ask North Ward to come into the guarantee and yet reap no benefit.

The East & West Ward Councillors were in favour of extending the scheme ‘when it is found to be a possible paying proposition’.  The expert advice was that it required 300 lights to be economically viable in North Ward.

The Mayor said the present idea was to take the power as far as St Mary’s.

Mr Fuss, ‘It is only a right thing in a town like Burra that party feeling should be done away with and one part of the town assist another if necessary.  Before long he had no doubt, the North Ward would be able to hold its own, and even now he felt sure that the scheme as a whole would pay.’

Cr Wicklein said, ‘There was no town in South Australia situated like Burra; it was so scattered, and consequently difficult to manage.’

Mr Thomas thought there should be a lighting rate and if Aberdeen were short of £50 equalise it.

The strong should help the weak.

Cr Wicklein would strongly object to a rate.

Cr Walker was opposed to leaving North Ward out – he said 430 lights in East & West Wards were said to justify spending £2,500, but an extra £750 needed 300 lights to justify it and even West Ward extended to Opie’s Hotel.

The Mayor said various places in East & West Wards would be uneconomic – like Cemetery Flat.

Mr Crewes thought the scheme should be extended to the whole town.  Sacrifices would be needed to avoid cliqueism and party feeling.  At present 33% of general rate expenditure went on streetlights and he doubted their moral or legal right to so use it.  The health rate is in good condition so why not reduce it from 10d to 5d and have a 5d lighting rate?

Mr Winnall then effectively summed up the situation.

The Mayor picked up Mr Crewes’ point and said it was quite legal to pay for lighting using the general rate.
