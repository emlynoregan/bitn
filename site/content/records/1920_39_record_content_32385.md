Weather.  The long dry spell since the promising falls in September means there will not be much hay this year.  From Leighton to Hill River the crops are good.  Oats has failed in most places.  On Tuesday patchy showers brought up to 40 points to some areas, but to the east most falls were below 20 points, although ‘The Gums’ managed 36 and Glenbowie 40.
