The Burra Show was held at Victoria Park on Wednesday in moderately fair weather.  Though the threat of rain may have kept some people away, there was still a record attendance.  John McLaren as secretary is to be congratulated.  Horse numbers were down, but the quality was up.  A later show would help horse entries.  (But if by more than a fortnight it would harm sheep entries, as seed would appear in the wool.)  Agricultural and dairy produce were both good.  Fowl entries were high with over 300 this year.

‘Mr A. Forrest scored well with his three-year-old filly, plough and dray horses and a team of six, and approprirted [sic] Mr Thos. Sandland’s splendid prize of £5 for the latter.’

Cattle were poorly represented and there were only a few dogs.

Sheep and wool were well represented and pride of place went to Thomas Sandland of Koo-owie and W.T. Mortlock of Martindale.  Also doing well were A. Gebhardt & John Collins and for small flock owners, Mr F.G. Dawson.

In vegetables Chin Young predominated and in flowers R. & A. Fuss did well.

Music was provided by the Terowie Brass Band.

[Personal interest:

Chin Young won a prize for his Newfoundland Dog.  He got prizes for: collection of vegetables, collection of herbs, collection of salid [sic] vegetables, bunch of green onions, 2 marrows, 3 cauliflowers, 3 lettuces, 6 white turnips, 6 parsnips, 6 red beet and 3 sticks of celery.
