Vandalism.

On the 24 December there was damage at the Memorial Oval.  Windows in the toilet block were broken and a toilet pan smashed.  All globes and fittings on the basketball court were smashed.

On 1 January filthy words were painted on the front steps of the school, the practice tennis courts, the yard, classroom doors and garbage cans.  At the oval they appeared on the toilet block, grandstand, basketball courts and scoreboard and at J.J. & B.C. Richard’s garage and on five school buses.  Others were painted on the base of Peacock’s Chimney and on the stobie pole in front of Matthews Emporium.  Five young persons were reported and they have since removed the paint.
