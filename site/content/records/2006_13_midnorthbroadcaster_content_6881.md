Burra History Group President Meredith Satchell said the group is planning to publish a new pictorial history of Burra because Ian Auhl’s Burra, A Pictorial Memoir is now out of print.  The aim was to compile a book using photographs not used in Auhl’s publication, to bring the book up to date from his 1975 book and to include some colour photographs. An appeal is made for photographs, especially of the period after 1975.  They would be kept only briefly for scanning and then returned.  Not only is the book seen as a way to preserve the history of the town, but as a method of promoting its image to our visitors.
