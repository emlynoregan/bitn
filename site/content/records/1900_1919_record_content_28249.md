SAR.  There is agitation to make the railways operate more sensibly and conveniently.  Fresh fruit and vegetables arrive on the train at 6 p.m. just as the gates are locked for the night.  Generally it sits there unsold till morning when an extra hour would see the perishables delivered expeditiously.

There are also complaints about the timetable, which has been changed to the disadvantage of many, but especially those attending the saleyards.  The editor considers that allowing four hours for a journey of 100 miles is hardly a great sign of advancement.

[It is not possible to indicate the real nature of the problem here because the timetable that is printed in the paper is exactly the same as that printed in February 1910!]

Timetable as printed â€“ but presumably out-of-date.
