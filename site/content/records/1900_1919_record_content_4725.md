The Telephone.  An effort is being made to induce the Government to arrange telephonic communication between Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen and to the Burra Railway Station.  It is to be hoped this effort will succeed.  Almost every businessman in town has signed the memorial to be forwarded to the Government.
