Obituary.  Ellen G. Byles who died 26 April aged 39 was the younger daughter of Mr & Mrs W. Byles of Aberdeen.  She was born at Kooringa 10 May 1896 when her parents were resident at Douglas, now known as Thistlebeds.  Her parents later went to Broken Hill before returning to the Burra district after a few years.  Miss Byles was educated at Burra Model School and Copperhouse School.  From an early age she wished to become a nurse and a day or two before her 21st birthday she started her career at Kapunda Hospital.  After two years her health failed, but after a rest she resumed her training at the Adelaide Hospital.  She was at Burra Hospital for a time and then went to the McBride Memorial Hospital to go through the midwifery course.  She then undertook private nursing before being appointed a charge nurse at Bedford Park Hospital and later became Matron there.  She then purchased the Warraweena Hospital which she conducted until ill health again forced her to relinquish charge of it.  She was ordered to the far north and much needed rest.  After regaining her strength she took up nursing once more in Sydney, Jamestown and Clare Hospitals and six years ago became Matron of Riverton Hospital until ill health forced her to resign in April 1934.  She died at Memorial Hospital North Adelaide and was buried at Kooringa.  She is survived by her parents, one sister Mrs S.M. Bettison of Mt Mary [and four brothers] P.B. [Philip Brettel] of Ironmine, Alex [Alick Herbert William], Frank [Frank Morgan] & Walter [Walter John] of Pt Lincoln.  She was a granddaughter of the late Mr & Mrs John Morgan, pioneers of Douglas.
