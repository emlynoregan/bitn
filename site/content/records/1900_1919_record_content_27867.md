The Season

The outlook has never been better for both wheat growers and pastoralists in the Burra district.  The new wheat areas around Shafton, Braefoot, Mt Bryan, Petherton, Koonoona and to the northwest and southeast generally are expected to break records.  A few areas are infested with dandelion and they will need careful handling.  Averages of 20-30 bushels are talked of.  Farmers in the Mt Bryan area are jubilant.

For pastoralists lambing was good and shearing is expected to cut out considerably better than expected a few months since.

Dairymen also are having a profitable time.
