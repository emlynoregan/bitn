Leighton Hall Annual Dinner on 5 August was largely attended.  The report of this dinner reveals [as nothing else in the paper does] that confirmation of the war was received on 5 August and that it resulted in a hurriedly arranged meeting in Market Square where the National Anthem was sung and three cheers raised for the king and the British Army and Navy.  The crowd then gave three cheers for the Mayor.  At the dinner ‘Rule Britannia’ was sung after three cheers for the British Empire.

The Hall debt stood at £350 after the extensions.
