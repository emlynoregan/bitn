Ian Auhl’s Address: Burra The Anatomy of a National Trust Town is printed.

[Auhl begins by talking about the problem of Burra’s name as a town and the Burra of the Five Towns – choosing as his five Kooringa, Copperhouse, Redruth, Aberdeen and Hampton.  He goes on to speak of how it is still in some ways three towns – Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth.  He goes along with the story of ‘the early separation of the towns upon distinct nationalistic lines – Cornish, English and Welsh.  For nearly 20 years there was no direct road for traffic between the northern and southern towns.  He then says that there was no Corporation or Council of Burra until after the mines closed in 1877.  This is such a bad error that it is hard to believe that Auhl would have said it and it casts doubt on the authenticity of the text – though it is early in the period of his historical research.  He also says that only two hotels were allowed to operate inside the Mining Association’s area.  This is another error which it is hard to believe Auhl would have made.  The Burra Hotel, the Miners’ Arms and the Pig & Whistle operated in Kooringa for a long period and for shorter periods there were also others.  The Commercial Hotel also began operation near the end of the mining period.  In addition the Smelters’ Home, while at Burra North, was still within the Mining Association’s area.  He goes on to discuss how the Mining Association kept the railway outside their section and to talk of the term ‘The Burra’, supposing it to be a contraction of ‘The Burra Mine’, given that the name did not then apply to the town properly speaking.

He considers that the focal point for Burra: an Historical Town is the old mining area and its destruction would destroy any prima facie case for Burra as an Historic Town.  The retention of the unity of the town is also important.  He draws a distinction between a place of the past and a place with a past.  Burra is definitely the latter.  Burra once saved a struggling SA from bankruptcy and he believes it is now time for SA to save Burra.

History, for Historic Towns, must be more than interesting, it must be important and to attract money that importance must be at the state level, not merely parochially.  Time, he says, is running out.  Auhl then goes on to acknowledge the National Trust Museum, but considers it more important to see the town itself as the museum.]

Burra’s claims, he considers, are:

Except for Kapunda it is the oldest mining town in Australia.  Kapunda began in 1842-43 and Burra two years later.  Coppermania was the predecessor of gold fever in the eastern states.  When gold was first discovered near Bathurst Kapunda had a population of 1,000 and Burra one of 5,000.  There were deserted mining villages in SA before there were any mining camps in NSW or Victoria.

Mere age is, however, not enough; the town must be capable of survival.  Kapunda the mining town, survived, but it has been much outgrown by Kapunda the agricultural centre.  Burra, unfortunately for its growth and development, remained isolated and its population declined from 5,000 in 1850 to 3,000 in 1877 to now 1,000 or so and it has tended to make use of what buildings it had.  When the mine closed it became a forgotten town, struggling to survive – almost a frontier town on the edge of Goyder’s Line, with empty saltbush plain to its east.  The district turned from mining to wheat and sheep and from that to stud breeding.

Another reason for its survival has been its physical solidity.  Knocking things down has been an Australian pastime.  Burra buildings are solidly built of a hard carbonaceous shale, which splits easily, but presents a face which withstands weathering.  The mine buildings at Burra have withstood neglect, time and weather much better that the limestone structures at Kadina and Wallaroo.  Progress which involves the modernisation of shop fronts etc. is not necessarily progress in a tourist town.

‘It is my firm belief that Burra’s biggest business lies in its possibilities as an historic town.  The destruction or radical alteration of its buildings to me constitutes the destruction of its assets.’

Auhl thought the Burra Town Council more far sighted in this respect than most others.  Of course Burra will need modern buildings and institutions, such as for its hospital and school and a motel, but it does not need modernisation of its existing buildings, which are the very assets of its future.

Happily Burra has largely used the buildings it had and its walls are largely intact, though some are sadly neglected.  Hardly any street of sector of the town lacks the sort of place which a visitor cannot find with delight.

The isolation of Burra has, in large measure, been responsible for its preservation, but this is at complete variance with its early history, when it was the economic heart of the colony.  Many towns on the Copper Road and from Gawler to Burra grew around the wayside inns marking the end of a day’s journey for the bullock teams to and from Burra.

The history of Burra is visual rather than written.  There are very few living in Burra who could remember even the closing of the mines.  Few locals know the story of their town and fewer realise its significance.  Since the visit of the Adelaide National Trust to Burra there has been some revival of interest and a subsequent tour for local people brought an almost overwhelming attendance.

Written History

When Burra’s history comes to be written it will almost be the history of SA for 1845-60.  It took ten years for SA’s population to reach 20,000, but in the following four years it jumped to 60,000.  By 1848 its mineral exports were £320,000 out of a total of £465,000.  Shipping increased from 10,000 tons in 1844 to 80,000 tons four years later.  At times the mine had 6,000 bullocks on the road, with at least 1,000 drivers and drays.  Burra’s population was 5,000 when Adelaide’s was 20,000.  This history remains to be told, though Geoffrey Blainey made a beginning in his book The Rush that Never Ended.

Vandalism

The slow vandalism of time and weather has had little impact on Burra’s native stone buildings. The vandalisms of individuals, often thoughtless, but sometimes deliberate or inspired by greed, or sometimes almost sadistic, have had their effect.  There is also the vandalism of indifference.  This is the most dangerous, as it allows the other forms to go unchecked.  This cannot be checked without the help of Acts of Parliament.

There is also the vandalism of snobbery, which believes a mansion is intrinsically more worthy of preservation than the houses of common people.  To me the preservation of the miners’ huts in the Burra Creek is as important as the preservation of Ayers’ House.  Let us remember that the former preceded and were responsible for the latter.  Country museums have a bad habit of beginning to look alike.
