Jemison then gave evidence about how the trail had been followed to Byrne.  The tracks had led down Bridge St from Grow’s, across the footbridge and into Chapel St near Vivian’s stables [Commercial Hotel] and thence to Charles Park’s store opposite Drew & Crewes’ store.

Byrne blamed his lack of memory of the day in question on ‘drinking very heavy on colonial wine from Saturday till Thursday morning’.  He denied any motive for such an act, but could not rightly remember much of the days in question and believed someone had poured kerosene on him.  He was committed for trial at the next criminal proceedings.
