Burra Town Council.

The Mayor reports that the commissioner of Public Works has decided not to use water from the Burra Waterworks for the railway engines.  He advises that the Council should continue the lease for three months from 31 December to give the Council an opportunity of reducing the present debit balance.  The final decision will be left to the new Council.

Of the Mayor’s Fund he said the Town Clerk said the actual expenditure had been £183-6-4, leaving £16-12-10.  The list would remain open till 19 Nov. when the Mayor would make up any deficit.

He felt disappointed that despite some support many of whom it was anticipated had not donated.

Mr Glynn’s lecture was poorly patronised and appeared likely to have created a debit.  The £15-16-0 from the Children’s Jubilee Demonstration was for a drinking fountain to be placed in the Avenue.  [Permission for this was granted.]

The next meeting of Council would be the last of the present Council.

Necessary repairs to the pump in Market Square were ordered.

The Council has inspected the reserve in Aberdeen where Mr Ridgway has used 9,000 gallons of water for which he has not paid.  There was also the question of a hose, and piping used on the fence, both of which were paid for by Council.

No decision was reached on any of these issues.
