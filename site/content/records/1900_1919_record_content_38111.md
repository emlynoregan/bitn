Rev. Father O’Halloran who has been in Burra 2½ years has been moved to Streaky Bay and he was accorded a social and dance in the Institute last Thursday with the Mayor, E.W. Crewes in the chair.  J.Q. Hogan presented an illuminated address.  J. McLaren spoke as a next door neighbour who remembered Father Dowling and Father Redden.  Father O’Halloran came from Ireland and became a priest at 35, beginning work at Pt Augusta for four years before coming to Burra.  (Other details of the social run for 1½ columns.)
