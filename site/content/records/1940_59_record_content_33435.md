The Bible Christian Church began its work in Burra in about 1848 when Mr James Blatchford arrived and with J. Pellew and J. Halse they conducted services in turn.  A society of 47 members was formed and a church and Sunday school to hold 200 was erected.  The first minister was Rev. J. Rowe.  A larger church was built on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Bridge Street [East].  This was closed and sold after Methodist Union.
