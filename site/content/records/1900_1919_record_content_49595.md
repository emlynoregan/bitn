Mrs Simpson attained her 93rd year on 31 January.  Her first visit to the town was before the mine started.  The township of today was then about three houses and one hotel, ‘The Pig & Whistle’.  She was born in Forben, England in 1824.  He father, Mr Samuel Hawkes being engaged in farming.  Her mother died when she was 10.  In 1844 she married Mr Richard Simpson, a shepherd.  They lived in a hut a good distance from the head station on Booborowie Run, having been engaged by Dr William Browne whilst coming out on the Schacamchen in early 1851.  They travelled from Adelaide by bullock wagon, passing only about three houses on the way.  Mr Browne once told her husband to engage anyone who came along, but he replied he had not seen anyone looking for work for the previous three years.  Aborigines were common and at first very wild, but later became more friendly.  Her first visit to Burra was made on foot – about 18 miles from Booborowie.  After about 20 years the family took up land at Mintaro, but after 12 months returned to Booborowie and then after a while took land at Mt Bryan.  After a hard battle they retired due to Mr Simpson’s ill health and settled in Burra, but her husband died after a short time, in 1889.  She recalls the dugouts in Burra Creek, some of which were very comfortable and roomy.  In early days Mrs Simpson was an active worker in the Primitive Methodist Church.  Until the last year she has been very active and managed her own business affairs in connection with property she owns in the town.  She has two sons and a daughter: John Simpson (Belalie North), Richard Simpson (Burra) and Mrs J. Robinson who lives with her mother.
