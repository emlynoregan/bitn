Burra Burra DC

There has been correspondence from the Local Government Association Mutual Liability Scheme re the Draft Joint Use Agreement between the Council and DECS for the use of the Burra Community Pool.  Council has decided that DECS be required to complete the process to divide the land on which the pool and surrounds, including the car parks, and to effect the transfer of it to the Council as a matter of urgency.  Local State MP Mr Rob Kerin will be asked to assist.
