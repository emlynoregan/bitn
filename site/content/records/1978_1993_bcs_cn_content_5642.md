Booborowie Hall extensions were opened by Hon. Dr Bruce Eastick MP last Saturday night.  The new facilities include kitchen, smoke-room, foyer, change rooms and toilets.  The project has been supported by a ‘Buy a Brick’ campaign with $1,567 raised so far.  $508 worth of bricks was sold at the dance.  A bank loan of $25,000 was taken out to complete the project.  D.G. & M.N. Benton carried out the renovations at an approximate cost of $50,000.  The Arts Council of SA contributed $10,000 and the Burra Burra DC $10,000.
