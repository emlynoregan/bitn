M.A. Radford responds to the letters re the cattle inspector.  Meat is inspected by the Board’s inspector apart from the Inspector of Cattle.  If a proper inspection of meat is required there will be the need for a proper abattoirs and a highly-paid inspector.  In fact in the last 20 years 2¼ carcases, one head and one tongue have been condemned and it cost the Board £45 to defend the Inspector’s last carcase.  But why do we suddenly have this situation when for years the Central Board has approved inspectors lacking officially recognised qualifications.  Milk is periodically subjected to inspection and I cannot recall a case where the local inspector has condemned a cow.
