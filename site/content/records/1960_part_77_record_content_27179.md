Fires.  Hallett fire fighters had to attend to two fires in the last week.  Goods and clothing in a Lands Department Cruiser caught fire on Thursday night just north of Hallett. It was extinguished within a few minutes.  On Friday at 1 p.m. 150 acres of grass feed at ‘Willogoleche’ in the Tommy’s Gap area was burnt.  Despite difficult terrain it was put out without stock or property loss.
