She was born at Kooringa in 1868 the third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John Rogers of Baldina and married Flower Humphrys of Hanson in 1888.  They lived first at Kooringa and then Hanson before Mr Humphrys purchased an estate at Manoora.  A few months ago they decided to retire and purchased a new house built by E.V.
