Kooringa News, 17 December

The explorer Stuart, accompanied by Mr Auld, one of his party, Captain McKay of Mt Deception and Mr John Chambers, arrived at Kooringa last evening by the Mt Remarkable mail.  They were enthusiastically received by a large crowd at the Post Office.  Mr Stuart appeared in a very low state; as well he might, having suffered from scurvy for much of the trip.  On reaching the Post Office he alighted with difficulty and on being brought to the front, Mr W.H. Wilkinson read the following address, which had been hastily prepared for the occasion:

‘To John McDouall Stuart, Esq.

Sir, - Hearing of the probability of your passing through our township this evening, we the undersigned have hurriedly assembled to congratulate you, on behalf of the inhabitants of Kooringa, upon your safe return from your explorations in the interior of this vast continent; and also to assure you that we, in common with the rest of our fellow-colonists, fully appreciate the valuable services which you have rendered the public in revealing the condition and resources of that portion of our land hitherto unknown.  We regret that lack of opportunity prevents our making a more suitable and worthy acknowledgement of our obligations to you, but we are convinced that the satisfaction which you must feel in having faithfully done your duty will in itself be no small reward.

‘We again congratulate you on the successful termination of your arduous enterprise, and tender you a most hearty and unanimous welcome on your safe return.

We, are, &c.’

(Here follow the signatures of W.H. Wilkinson, W.L.H. Bruse, J. Burnell, W. Young and others.)

Mr Stuart then briefly replied somewhat as follows:

‘Gentlemen – You will not expect me to say much in my present circumstances; but I heartily thank you for the honour you have bestowed upon me.  As I have not yet officially reported myself to the Government, I cannot enter into any details of the results of my trip, but I may say that I have accomplished all and more than the Government expected of me.  I have exceeded my most sanguine expectations; and when my journal is published you will be surprised.’

Cheers were given and the bus moved off and the assembly dispersed.
