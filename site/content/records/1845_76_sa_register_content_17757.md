In their case the more valuable one makes their property the more one has to pay for it should one desire a renewal of the lease.  On the other hand should it be a losing bargain, the lease is quietly dropped and very seldom is anything more heard of it.  The companyâ€™s remedy then is to pull the house down or let it for a low rental.
