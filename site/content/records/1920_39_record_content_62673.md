Kooringa Improvements

In view of the Centenary Celebrations many places in the main street have received a coat of paint and some have internal renovations as well.  Matthews Emporium is getting an up-to-date frontage and some internal changes.

Mrs Klaffus will be 90 on 27 August.

Sister J. Kidman was given a farewell at ‘Heathmont’ on Saturday prior to taking up a position at Wakefield Street Hospital.  She has been at the Burra Hospital for a number of years.
