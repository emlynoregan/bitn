Editorial on the 1888 land leases which the editor regrets has largely gone into the same hands as before, much of it in large areas.  The average price of Â£1-18-0 per mile per annum is too high under present circumstances and represents a degree of speculation.  [A list of the largest purchases appears on page 3.]

The Report of the Land Commission has been laid before Parliament.  It recommends that the present very complex legislation be swept away.  The auction system should go.  Land Boards should classify and value the land.  There should be only two forms of tenure: deferred payment for the fee simple, or perpetual lease with rentals revised after seven years.  The proposal was to be limited to land within the counties.

[The actual recommendations are printed on page 3.]
