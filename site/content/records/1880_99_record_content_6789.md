Burra Town Council 11 April

A letter from the Central Board of Health urged more diligence from the local inspector.  Specifically they urged him to ensure all cesspits to closets be made watertight which is especially important where wells are largely relied upon for a water supply.  A pigsty in the centre of town also calls for attention.

Cr Rabbich, as owner of the said pigsty said he had been required to provide a cesspit at the lower side of his sty and fit steam-tight covers to the boiling down coppers and this was being done.

The secretary of the Yorke’s Peninsula Mining Association wrote notifying that the question of the Aberdeen Reserve would be laid before the directors.

The Hospital Board, having been advised that the drainage from the Hospital was creating a nuisance, replied that it could find no nuisance and only lavatory water was concerned [presumably this means bathwater] and under the circumstances they decline to comply.

The Inspector said the drain in question issued onto adjacent land and there were dead animals in it and it was very offensive.  As the nuisance was on the adjacent land the owner thereof was to have notice not to allow the nuisance to continue.

The scavenger was removing ‘ashes, dust and house refuse’, but declined to remove other ‘offensive matter’.

The Inspector is to see that either the scavenger or the Hospital removes same.

Dr Sangster wrote asking for a notice at the corner of the road near his back gate re driving around it at walking pace to protect his children and also asked to be allowed to deposit horse manure in the creek at the back of his yard if it is removed regularly - this would not be a nuisance to anybody he says.  He says his own premises are too small to permit the manure to be stored on site.  Both requests were refused.

The Inspector was told to destroy stray goats.

The entrance to the Recreation Ground is to be in the centre of the west side and 24’ wide.

The Kingston Tce footbridge is to be shifted & a lamp is to be erected in Market Squ.
