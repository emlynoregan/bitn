Accident.  Mr Thomas Bewley was delivering milk in a cart drawn by a pony in Chapel Street on Tuesday morning, with a little girl, when the axle broke.  The two passengers were thrown out when the horse bolted and was not caught until it reached Market Square.  Both the passengers were found semi-conscious and Mr Bewley, who is an aged gentleman, sustained a nasty gash on his head.  After treatment by Dr Sangster, both were sent home.
