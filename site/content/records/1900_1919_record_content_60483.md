Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. met the train on Thursday to welcome Tpr Dave Eig & Tpr Sealey, [Seeley] though the latter preferred to escape the ceremony.  Trooper Eig tried to enlist seven times before being accepted.

On Thursday [sic – though this clearly reads as a separate day from the preceding] they greeted Pte J. Hoare, who though born in Burra and who lived a considerable time here, did not enlist from here.

On Saturday they assembled to welcome Sgt Jack Field.

Next Friday the Ladies’ band will go to Adelaide to take part in Violet Day there and the Military Commandant, Brigadier-General Antill, will invest the girls with service stripes for the work done.  Burra’s Violet Day will be 4 July.

Pte Stuart Cameron and Pte Reg. Friend have quietly returned to town.
