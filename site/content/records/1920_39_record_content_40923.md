Burra Town Council, 1 February

The Finance Committee recommended a rate of 2/3 in the £ to give each ward a spending power of about £150.

Burra electric Supply Co. is to be asked for the same reduction on its contract as in 1931.

An unsightly wall opposite Redruth Methodist Church was mentioned, but the owner of the land is unknown.  If the owner can be discovered he is to be asked to put the place in order.
