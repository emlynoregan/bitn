In 1912 John Griffiths built a shop/residence at 8 Morehead Street, Aberdeen and his wife operated a successful business there for approximately 30 years.*  At the rear of the property a stone building was constructed and used as a storeroom.  Over the years it has had many uses and when Richard Holbrook & Jenny Field purchased the property, it was a dilapidated granny flat.  They have now had it converted to a two-bedroom Bed & Breakfast.  Stephen Angel helped with design and furnishings.  David Parnell replaced an exterior stud wall with stone and in conjunction with Chris Kelly restored the stonework.  Simon O’Connor of Tunglebung Pioneer Furniture made a lampstand, table, curtain rods and bush gates.  Peter Strawbridge, blacksmith, made door latches, etc.  Alan Hall of Burra Furniture Works made other furniture and other local tradesmen, Malcolm Beinke, David Loffler, David Nourse and Adam Green contributed their skills.
