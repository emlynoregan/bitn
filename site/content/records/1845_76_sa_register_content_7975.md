Arrival of the 1st Gold Escort Direct from Mt Alexander

Yesterday afternoon the First Gold Escort with Captain Tolmer emerged into view from the picturesque Mt Lofty Ranges, having performed a most arduous and important duty.  They were joyfully and honourably welcomed into the city, where their journey terminated in King William Street between the Treasury and the GPO.  Captain Tolmer supervised the transfer of the treasure to the strong vault and took about 400 letters to the Post Office.

[A long list of recipients of the gold is printed.  It extends for about 1â…” columns, giving the names of the dispatcher, the recipient and the amount.  This was later criticised as information for would-be robbers.]

Over 4,000 persons greeted Captain Tolmer at Mt Alexander when he explained the Bullion Act and the intentions of the SA Government.  Many intelligent questions were asked of him and on hearing his answers the meeting expressed their confidence in the SA Government and the SA Police.  Captain Tolmer said there would be no charge on this first experimental escort, but the meeting resolved they would willingly pay 2%.  They stated that they would still clearly be better off than risking the hazards, delays and vexatious charges of remittance via Melbourne.

[The article then goes on to talk of changes in the Assay Office and the problems about actually getting cash for the gold delivered.]
