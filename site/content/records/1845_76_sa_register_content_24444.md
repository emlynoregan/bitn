Ulooloo Diggings.  People in Kooringa seldom hear of anyone coming from the field with gold.  There is no doubt some have made good wages.  If the reef could be found a good industry might be established.  About 200 men remain on the field, many having left, but others arrived.  There is less rowdyism and a policeman was there last Sunday.  The old creek is still the focus of activity, though a small rush occurred on Monday to a gully about Â¾ mile from the camp.
