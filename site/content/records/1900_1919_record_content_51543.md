Burra Cheer-up Society.  The Ladies’ Band went to Clare for Australia Day there on 29 August.  They went by train to Farrell’s Flat where they were picked up by car and reached Clare c. 7.15 a.m.  They were then free till lunch at 11.30.  Then they led the procession and played several times.  The weather then deteriorated, but the band played from Mr Bentley’s balcony.  They then returned to Farrell’s Flat where they played at a lecture in aid of Red Cross funds.
