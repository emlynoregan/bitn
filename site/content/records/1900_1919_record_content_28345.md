Poison Weed.  The Hon. J.J. Duncan lost c. 240 sheep between Braemar and Lock Winnock last week through their eating a green pea-like creeper with pods.  Others have had less severe losses.  Sheep seem to ignore the plant unless very hungry, but then eat it and die suddenly.  The weed is prolific in some watercourses.
