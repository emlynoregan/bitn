Proposed Sheep-breeders Association.  Up to 1913 the Burra Show was held in September and served the sheep-breeders well, but the move to October, which was better for farmers, does not suit the pastoralists.  The later show is better for the public and consequently a meeting of pastoralists was held on Friday to consider holding a separate sheep show.  A special meeting of the Show Soc. is called for to consider the matter.
