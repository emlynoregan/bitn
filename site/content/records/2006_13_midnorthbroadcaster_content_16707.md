Midnight Oil Cottage (at Cobb & Co.’s Corner)

Work on preserving the building has begun.  Local builders have been able to stabilise the roof, so reducing the fear of walls caving in.  CMC Chairman Bruce Stockman said it was pleasing to see work had started and he appreciated all the support given.  Paul Wilson has stabilised the roof and taken pressure off the walls.  In the next phase in July stonemason Chris Kelly will begin on restoring the stonework.  The Midnight Oil Cottage Preservation Fund is currently selling framed prints of the cottage for $250 to bolster fundraising efforts. The prints are by Glenn Allen of Unique Panoramas.
