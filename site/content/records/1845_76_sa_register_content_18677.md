Saddleworth News, 21 June

A large meeting was held at Stuart’s Hotel Saddleworth on Monday 19 June to consider the urgent necessity of petitioning Parliament to place the road through this constantly growing district on the schedule of main roads.  It was moved that the road from Forrester’s via Riverton, Saddleworth and Chinkford to Black Springs should be placed on the schedule of main lines of road.

[The major argument was the centrality of the road to a large and growing agricultural area presently badly served by roads.]
