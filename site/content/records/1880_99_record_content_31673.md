Burra Town Council, 18 Feb.

The Mayor reported he had visited the road through the Police Paddock to Hampton.  Mr George Ford, who owned the land on part of one side, desired it not be opened yet, but the end near Hampton to be sloped down for light carts.

Messrs Lasscock, Butterworth & Shortridge waited on Council to ask if it would put two men on for a week to prepare a cycle and running track at the Recreation Ground if the Lodge would put on two men for the same time.  The coming Oddfellows picnic is to be held there.  The Council decided, after deliberation, to agree.
