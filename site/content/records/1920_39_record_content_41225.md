The Annual Show on 28 October was a great success.  Prize money had to be cut, but the show struck excellent weather, drew a big attendance, had excellent exhibits and produced an all round success.  Last year there was a profit of £33 and this year it is £8-14-10.  Considering that the Government subsidy of £35 was not paid this is a good result and the overdraft has been reduced by £5.  Elected: Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, A.B. Riggs & S.H. Robinson.  Burra has been allotted Wednesday 26 October for the next show.
