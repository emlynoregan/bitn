Barkers of Baldina Cottages

Last year Ron Smedley divined the site for a bore to be drilled between Jennison and Pearse Row of the cottages.  It was drilled to 38 metres and delivers 600 gallons per hour.  It has greatly improved the overall appearance of the Commercial Street site and reduces water costs.  The plaque at the official opening last year was unveiled by Jock Duncan and Ron Smedley [Photo.]
