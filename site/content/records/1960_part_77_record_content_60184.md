Burra National Trust Branch held its AGM recently.

President W.L. More gave a résumé of its activities.  An Australia-wide appeal was made for funds to rebuild Peacock’s Chimney.  The complex of buildings at Peacock’s Shaft was demolished by Samin Ltd.  After discussion Samin agreed to bypass the complex to give time to remove the stack.  To date $8002.36 has been received.  Bad weather slowed the rebuilding, but it is now to the stage of the top brickwork.  Much volunteer labour has kept the cost so far to $3,688.47.  Thanks are due to all the donors and especially to Ian Auhl for setting up the appeal and to Messrs G. O’Connor, D. Cockington and M. Tiver for so much of their time.  On 29 September the Thomas Pickett plaque was unveiled.  Mr Bonython as State President of the National Trust gave an address.  Mr Ian Auhl recounted the story of Thomas Pickett and Mr Stan Woollacott dedicated the memorial.  The stone used is part of one of the counter-balances from the old Mine.  The Waterworks officially handed over the Bon Accord engineer’s shop and the manager’s cottage to the National Trust on condition that Mrs Fisher be allowed the use of the cottage as long as she requires it.  The roster system at the Museum has worked well.  The increasing number of coaches and school visits to the town is placing an increasing demand on volunteer guides. Mr Woollacott estimates 7,000 visitors to the Museum.  [Various other people are then thanked.]

Elected: President, W.L. Moore; Vice-Presidents, G.R. O’Connor & L. Warnes; Secretary, M.A. Tiver; Treasurer, D. Cockington; Curator, S. Woollacott and Historical Officer, I.L. Auhl.
