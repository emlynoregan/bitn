Local Board of Health.

Burra Hospital forwards accounts for infectious disease patients totalling £76.  (All were for typhoid patients – classified as an infectious disease under the Act.)

Five cases of typhoid and one of erysipelas were reported in the last fortnight.

The Hanson Railway Station has been improved with the installation of a gas plant.  There is a shelter house and a waiting room.
