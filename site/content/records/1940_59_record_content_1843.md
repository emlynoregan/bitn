Burra School celebrated Empire Day on Friday.  The boisterous weather led to the celebrations being held indoors.  There was an Empire Day address from the Minister of Education, the Hon. S. Jeffery, on the radio, and a message was read from Viscount Bledisloe, President of the Empire Day Movement.  An address by H.J.B. Jennison, Chairman of the School Committee followed before the children were dismissed for a half-holiday.
