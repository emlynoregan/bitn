The Clerk reported on nominations for Councillors.  [See 8 May, page 2.]

Resolved that the Highways and Local Government Department be advised that the proposed road from Harding’s corner Black Springs, via Western side of Porter’s Lagoon, passing tanks at Hanson, following the eastern side of the railway to Kellock’s crossing, then proceeding through Burra passing Hospital to Burra North.

[This sentence would seem to be incomplete.  Is the Council proposing this, accepting this proposal from the Highways and Local Government Department or opposing this proposal?]
