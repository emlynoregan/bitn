District Advisory Committee

Mr Woolley reported on the Tourism Conference he attended.

Mrs Bence and Mrs Carpenter had useful information from a visit to the Barossa Valley Tourism Office.

Other matters being dealt with are:

Improvement of the news service provided by papers circulating in the local area.

Beautification of the Burra Creek area in the town.
