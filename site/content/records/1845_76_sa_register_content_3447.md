‘A Scotchman’ writes from Kooringa, 1 January 1849, that in February last, the Rev. J.C. Bagshaw (Anglican) was appointed to this district.  While here, he has truly fulfilled the duties of a Christian pastor.  The appointment was intended to be temporary (12 months) and I am given to understand that his slender salary has been defrayed from English Funds and his Bishop (it is said) declines to continue to support a clergyman to benefit a congregation apparently unwilling to defray the costs.

Since Mr Bagshaw’s arrival, a noble building has been erected as a schoolroom, and is temporarily used as a church.  Its form is adapted to both uses.  This building is being ceiled and plastered and can accommodate 250.  All seems to be unaware of the imminent removal of their minister or are too concerned with temporal matters to rouse themselves to address this subject.

I write to try to arouse then to stir themselves to supply the funds necessary for the establishment of a permanent Church of England clergyman in Kooringa and to petition the Bishop to this end.

[Ian Auhl in The Story of the Monster Mine etc. page 300 says that the salary of Bagshaw & his successor Rev. Pollitt, was largely met by the Patent Copper Co. which had recruited him in England to serve as chaplain for their works.]

Mr & Mrs Adams threw a New Year party for upwards of 200 Sunday school pupils with roast beef, plum puddings, tarts and other delicacies, in the grounds of J.B. Graham Esq.’s Prospect House last Wednesday.  Afterwards about 150 adults, who were also invited along to witness the occasion, were entertained with a cold colation.
