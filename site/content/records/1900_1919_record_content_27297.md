The Football Crisis.

On 4 July the names of H. Williams, A. Carroll, H. Gordon and E. Raymond were submitted by Kooringa for registration by the Association.  Aberdeen held a meeting and voted that their delegates be instructed not to allow their registration for Kooringa.  After a warm discussion at the next Association meeting the Aberdeen delegates left the room.

A recent rule says ‘no player be allowed to play for any club . . . living outside a radius of 12 miles and any player must reside in the district 14 days before being allowed to play for any club’.  

The men in question have complied with this, but Aberdeen believes if they are allowed to play a game they then qualify to play in the final whether residents or not.  Both Aberdeen and Kooringa have broken the previous rule in the past.  The men in question are presently playing with the Clare Club, which is in the Mid-Northern Association, of which rule 22 forbids playing for more than one associated club without the consent of the executive, which Aberdeen says has not been given.  Aberdeen says it has withdrawn from competition for the rest of the season.  The Association has passed a resolution not allowing matches to be played on Aberdeen oval without Association approval.  G.R. Maxwell has resigned as Association Captain to be replaced by R.J. Hill.  Farrell’s Flat, Mt Bryan and Hallett teams are being asked to join the Association for 1911.  The match with Broken Hill today will not include any of the Aberdeen players.
