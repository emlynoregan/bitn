Obituary.  The late Cornelius Wesley Gare was born at Bimbowrie Station in the precincts of Quorn on 6 March 1870*.  His father was Edward Gare, manager of the Station.  Later the family moved to Mt Bryan on the land and still later to Mt Bryan East, until forced by drought to move to Broken Hill in 1888.  Here Mr Wesley Gare tried to earn a living with horses and drays in connection with mining, but these too had to be given up and he became a shift worker at the South Broken Hill Smelters until 1893 when the big strike was on.  He then went to Queensland and undertook a butchery business at Charters Towers, but about a year later he contracted typhoid fever and his life was despaired of for quite some time.  He eventually made a slow recovery.  He stayed another four years at Charters Towers, part of the time in mining and part of it as an engine driver.  In 1898 he returned to Burra and married Miss M.M. Frances Thomas of ‘Three Trees.’  The couple went to New Zealand where Mr Gare had the promise of a job as an engine driver at the Waiomo Mines.  They stayed for two years before returning to Burra where Mr Gare joined his brother-in-law, Mr Henry H. Thomas in sheep farming.  They soon became successfully established as sheep men.  His property was at Mt Bryan East which proved bountiful this time despite earlier misfortune there.  He retired to Burra 24 years ago.  He was always very active in the Methodist Church.  While at Broken Hill he was one of the first members of the Broken Hill YMCA and also of the Christian Endeavour Society.  He remained loyal to his church to the end, attending the morning service at Redruth Methodist Church on the day he died.  He was a teetotaller and was never heard to swear.  He also took his civic responsibilities seriously.  He was a member of the Hallett DC for over 35 years, a member of the Burra Hospital Board and a Trustee of the Mount Bryan East Methodist Church.  His children are Messrs Ivan Gare of Burra, Laurie Gare of Mt Bryan East and Mrs John Reed of Gawler.

[*Note that despite the above the registration of birth states Cornelius Wesley Gare born 28 March 1870 Bimbowrie North East: died 10 August 1952 Burra.]
