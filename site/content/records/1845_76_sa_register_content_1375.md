31 March 1847, page 2

Accident/Obituary.  Mr Denton, formerly of Kermode street North Adelaide and a shoemaker and carrier to the Burra Burra Mine, met with a fatal accident on Monday evening.  He was returning from the Mines with a dray laden with about two tons of ore and was riding on the pole.  Near Bryce’s on the Adelaide side of Dry Creek, he appears to have gone to sleep and fallen from the vehicle.  The wheel passed over his head, crushing it in a shocking manner.  He is survived by a wife and five children.  [George Denton died 29 March 1847 aged 45.]
