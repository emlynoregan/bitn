Burra Show.  ‘A Rare Exhibit’: A vixen and six young were exhibited at the Burra Show last Wednesday and attracted much attention from the many who had never seen a fox before.

The show just escaped the heavy rain of Thursday, which brought the creek down higher than for some time.

The floodwaters on Thursday threatened the small footbridge in front of the Post Office, (comprising simply three boards without side rail) when it rose to within two inches of the boards and over them in places.  Some children diverted to the Burra Hotel crossing which also need attention.

While the creek was running strongly in the morning Howard West, son of William West Sen. amused himself by running back and forth over the footbridge opposite the Post Office until he became giddy and fell in.  His screams and those of his brother were attracted Mr Vardey, who plunged in fully clothed and caught the drowning boy with some difficulty.  He was taken to the home of John McLaren where he was bathed and comforted before going home in a trap sent for him.

The Corricks attracted a great deal of excitement with people assembling on the steps before 7 p.m. by which time at least 200 people were present.  Sales of 1/- tickets were suspended at 7.20 and 2/- ones at 7.40 when there was no more seating available.  Forms were set in the aisle and right up to the stage.  People crammed like sardines onto the wings of the stage and many were turned away.  The program was intensely funny and particularly refined.  Monday saw another bumper audience.  Mr Chris Young convulsed the audience both nights.
