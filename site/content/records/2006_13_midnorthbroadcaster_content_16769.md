Burra Red Cross thanks all who contributed to Red Cross Calling in March.  Collectors raised $2,813 and the trading table raised $702.45.

Rosene Kotz writes appealing for help.  She is preparing a book of photographs about old stone shearing sheds in SA and would like people to let her know of such if they have one.

Kate Conners, nee Madigan of Yandama Station near Broken Hill and formerly of Booborowie, will this month lead a presentation at the Leading Ladies Luncheon in Adelaide.  She will speak of her experiences as a grazier and also as the wife of a person with spinal cord injury.  The luncheon will be held at The Highway Hotel, Anzac Highway on Friday 31 May.  Proceeds aid the Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association of SA.

[Edition No. 1072 (4), 15 May 2013, page 8 adds that she will also talk about the challenges of being teacher to daughter Jemma, aged 5, through School of the Air, while attending to baby Jimmy, who turns one on Saturday.  She will present her experiences of being one of the rare remote families without the aid of a governess.]

The Burra History Group held its AGM last month [actually 28 March] and President Meredith Satchell reported on the yearâ€™s activities and accomplishments, including:

The purchase of six 1800 x 1800 mm wheeled pin-up boards to mount displays in the Town Hall.
