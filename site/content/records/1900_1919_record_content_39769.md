Local Board of Health

The credit balance fell from £60-1-1 to £26-13-1, but the rate was dropped from 10d to 6d to transfer money to the Parklands account as above.  A reversal of this adjustment is probable in future as we need to provide against epidemic outbreak.

The Health Officer reported only four cases of infectious disease: two of tuberculosis and one each of diphtheria and enteric fever.  The tuberculosis and enteric fever came from outside the district.  Influenza and pneumonia have recently been a major problem caused largely by abnormal weather.
