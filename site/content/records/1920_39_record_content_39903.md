The Emergency Committee

Last Monday under the aegis of this committee there was a meeting in the Institute.  Dr Earle Page (Federal Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government) was accompanied by C.A.S. Hawker MHR, Walter Duncan & Mr Blesing MLCs, Mr Grenfell Price (Secretary of the Emergency Committee) & Mr Badman (Emergency Committee Senate Candidate).  Short notice and lack of advertising meant a smaller attendance than otherwise.  The Emergency Committee comprises representatives of the Citizens’ League, Country Party, Liberal Federation, Political Reform League & Producers & Business Men’s Political Committee.  It aims are to fight against:

Government extravagance and high taxation.

Repudiation of debts.

Political inflation.

Communism.

The Mayor presided and the meeting began with the singing of the National Anthem led by Mr Guy Dollman accompanied by Mr Hann & George & Laurence Hann. This was followed by the Song of Australia.  Dr Page’s speech is reported in some 4¾ columns.  (The last ¾ on page 4.)
