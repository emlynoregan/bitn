Over 1,400 availed themselves of the usual seaside trip to Semaphore on 22 February.

The annual show on Wednesday 26 October was a great success in excellent weather.

An Anzac Day service was held in the Institute on Sunday April 24 and was crowded.

In September we applied to be brought under the Fire Brigades Act of 1913.  The estimated cost of establishing and maintaining the Burra Fire Brigade is:

Motor Fire Appliance	400

Accessories	175

Rent	12

Uniforms for four men	44

Wages for 1 auxiliary foreman	55

Wages for 3 auxiliary firemen	105

£791

Council’s two ninths for 1st year	175

Succeeding years

Wages	160

Rent	12

Contingencies	 12

£184

Council’s two ninths of £184	£40-17-9

We expect to be able to manage without increasing the rates.

(Burra comes under the Act from 31 January 1922)

One consequence of this has been the Government’s agreement of the inadequacy of the pumping machinery at the Waterworks and they are now installing a suction gas engine.

Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

This was first mooted on hearing of the first death at the front and a sum of about £36 was collected, but the movement started in earnest on Peace day when £1,800 gross was taken.  Later a contract was let to Mr A.S. Tillett of Adelaide.  Strikes and other delays have held up progress and the foundation stone could not be laid till 6 April this year when H.E. the Governor of SA Sir Archibald Weigall performed that duty.  A further gross of £1,900 was taken on that day.  Strikes and shortages of labour etc. have caused ongoing delays.  The contractor now says that men are now engaged in completing the work and expect to complete the building in about six weeks.

The Financial Statement showed the rates collected were £732-17-1 with just over £11 outstanding and £8 of that was expected to be in by the end of the year.

Receipts by Ward show an emerging gap between North and the other Wards:

North Ward	£217-12-1

East Ward	£277-17-6

West Ward	£237-7-6

Government subsidy was	£119-6-5

[Ward accounts are printed.]

The Park Lands account ends c. £22 in debit.

The Cemetery account end c. £97 in credit.

The Lighting account ends c. £47 in debit – the largest items being Carbide £62 and lamp lighting £59.

The Local Board of Health is c. £64 in debit.

Main Roads is £95 in debit.

The Chairman of the Local Board of Health reported from Dr Ashton that there had been 15 cases of mild diphtheria in the year in one outbreak.  There had been three cases of enteric fever, four of measles and one each of scarlatina and phthisis – the last from outside the area.

The ambulance with W.R. Lee in charge had proved to be of great benefit to the district’s sick and disabled.

Cr Radford said the Wards had credit balances this year, as it has not been possible to get all the approved work done.  Lighting was expensive and had been better done this year.  Some electric lights were installed, which had also cost a considerable amount.

Cr Kellaway thought the East Ward’s money had been well spent in the two years of his office.

Cr Treloar said the Council this year had turned down a £4,000 scheme to install electric lights because it covered only Kooringa and ran only as many lights as there were now.  He had been the only one to oppose the Fire Brigade because of the inadequacies of the water supply, which often failed.  He was sure the real cost of the brigade would be much higher than that cited.
