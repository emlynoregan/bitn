Mr William Russell:

Was a farmer near Jamestown and had been in the colony 27 years.  He had spent time in the District Council and the Farmers’ Assoc.  Further taxation was needed.  He was never a member of the National Defence League.  They scorned him as he favoured progressive land tax.  The Legislative Council had been too conservative in the past.  Farmers had not been fairly represented in Parliament and not one sat in the House of Assembly.  The extra tax should come from properties of over £5,000 – the large sheep runs – not from farmers.  He was for the payment of members, but for cutting their income from £200 to £150.
