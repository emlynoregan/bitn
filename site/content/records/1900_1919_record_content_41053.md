Letter from Thomas Wilks of Mt Bryan East to the Register concerning the report that Thomas Fairchild had discovered a human skull 70 miles east of Burra.  Captain Arrara, a Spaniard, who came from South America in charge of mules for the Burra Smelting Copper Co. was lost out there in 1858 or 1859.  His horse returned to Baldina Station with only its bridle.  Sgt. Hooper from Burra organised a search party without success.
