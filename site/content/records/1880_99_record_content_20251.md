Where are the 10 chains of footway on the Slaughterhouse Rd?  There is not an inch.

Other people acquainted with the other streets say other items are equally incorrect.

Though finances are sound thanks to increased rates and the new loan, to assert as the Mayor did that more money could have been spent on the eastern footway, without affecting finances is not to be credited.
