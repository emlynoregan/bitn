The Battle of the Bands Festival (BOBfest) was held at the old Redruth Gaol on Saturday.  Burra band ‘Toby’s Avenger’ (Tristan Brak, Kimberley Brak, Isaac Angel & Doug Wilson) are pictured, but it was the Peterborough band ‘The Never’ that won first prize.  Northern Sound System sponsored the event.  Eight bands took part, including three from Burra: Toby’s Avenger, The Sore Foot Effect and Alibi.  It was an alcohol free event and the crowd was enthusiastic.  This was BOBfest’s third year and a final festival is planned for Clare in 2010.  Over 400 tickets were sold.  As well as the competing bands the audience heard last year’s winners The Secret Game and the Adelaide band Granny Flat.  Second place went to Strike X and there was an encouragement award for Clare band Best Before.  [Photo on page 8 of Sore Foot Effect.]
