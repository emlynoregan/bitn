Eastern Wool created a dilemma at the Burra Railway Station on Monday.  Two trucks loaded with wool arrived at the Station.

Coal restrictions had caused a lack of trains.  The wool could not be dumped on the siding and the Road Transport Act makes it illegal to take the load on to Adelaide by road.  Neither did it seem reasonable to take it back to the Eastern properties.
