Perlite

An application has been made for a perlite expansion facility on the NW outskirts of the town, adjacent to Adchem.  The application now goes to the Environmental Protection Agency for assessment.  Chillagoe Perlite of Queensland aims to establish the facility to produce perlite wine filtration medium, to replace imported diatomaceous earth, currently in use in Australia.  Later its uses could expand to such industries as: edible oils, margarine, breweries, paint, toothpaste, household abrasives, pharmaceuticals and soft drinks.  The deposit of perlite in North Queensland is owned jointly by Ian Meyer and Edwin James and is the worldâ€™s largest deposit with over 600 million tons of high grade ore.  That would keep a factory going for at least a century, if natural gas supplies were available.  Local employment would be needed in the construction stage and then production would be in three shifts, each requiring three workers.  Local owner-drivers would be needed for deliveries.  The ore could be delivered by rail or road transport.
