Obituary & Inquest.  An inquest was held on 15 November by J.D. Cave JP as coroner, on the bodies of Mrs Morrison and her son who drowned on 14 November.  [Born Jane Agincourt Lambert: died aged 34]

Alexander Cobb - Works for Murdoch Morrison of Flagstaff.  Mrs Jane Morrison was his wife and Donald his son.  Just before sundown the children, Mary, Ann and John came to say Mother and Donald were in the tank near the house.  It is a waterhole c. 10’ deep and 12’ in diameter.  On arriving at the tank could see no bodies.  Tried dragging the tank with wire and then got a rope and wire.  Was then sent to get Mr Morrison’s brother.

Donald McLean - (Labourer) Overtook the three children on my way home and went to help at the dam.  Got out Mrs Morrison, and the boy 15 minutes later.

Murdoch Morrison could add little except he believed the boy had probably slipped in trying to fill a waterbag and his wife drowned trying to save the boy.

Verdict was accidental drowning.  [Donald Morrison was born 5 December 1873.]
