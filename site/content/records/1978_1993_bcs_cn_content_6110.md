Ian Auhl writes of having discovered details of the life and headstone of Captain Henry Roach of the Burra Mine.

His house was in Gover Street North Adelaide where he lived in retirement until his death in 1889.

The headstone is in Payneham Cemetery.  [Photo.]

He was Chief Captain of the Burra Mine 1847-67.

In this period he was second only to Henry Ayers in directing the activities of the mine.

He was born in Redruth, Cornwall, in 1808, in the heart of the tin and copper mining area.

His obituary in the Observer of October 1889 says:

‘Captain Henry Roach who died on Sunday at the ripe old age of 81, formerly engaged in Cornwall mines where he gained experience which stood him in good stead in his colonial career.  Previous to coming to South Australia, he went to Bolwar in Colombia in South America.  In 1846 he settled in South Australia and received his appointment in 1847 to the Burra Burra Mine.  After twenty years of faithful service he retired and has been living ever since on his property in Gover Street, North Adelaide.  He was a man justly respected for his uprightness and sterling character.  His funeral service at Payneham was attended by a considerable number of citizens including Sir Henry Ayers.’
