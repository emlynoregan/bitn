T.C. Stott’s description of the bulk handling system for wheat is reported in c. 1⅓ columns.

In it he said the company expected to use the facility at Ardrossan this season and plans were on hand for a terminal silo at Wallaroo with depot silos at Paskeville and Bute.  Finance for construction comes from a toll of 3d per bushel on wheat, rising to 6d in the second year.  This will eventually be repaid, commencing in 12 years after the date of joining, with arrangements for deceased estates and those leaving the industry.  Farmers join the co-operative voluntarily.  Bagged wheat was becoming increasingly difficult to sell.  Mr Stott also spoke on the International Wheat Agreement made in Washington.  He was speaking at the Booborowie Hall last Tuesday night, when about 40 primary producers attended.
