The World Archaeological Congress will meet in Burra Town Hall this weekend for a symposium on indigenous culture, heritage and intellectual property rights.  At least 80 archaeologists will meet with lawyers, film-makers, natural scientists and university students for the three day conference.  The conference is about the Ngadjuri people and how they were displaced and their difficulties in returning and gaining access to their own culture and history.
