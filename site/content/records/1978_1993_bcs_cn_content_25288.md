BCS.  Staff Profiles: Christine Mitchell

I was recently appointed to BCS to teach Physical Education for Years 8-12, after teaching for four years on contract at Murray Bridge HS, Karoonda Area School, Immanuel College, Scotch College and Somerset College (Queensland).  I was born at Peterborough, but moved after one year and spent time in the Riverland, Alice Springs and Adelaide.  Burra is my first appointment as a permanent employee.  (PAT: permanent, but filling a temporary vacancy.)  I enjoy playing basketball and have been busy with three swimming carnivals and three athletics carnivals yet to come.  [Photo.]
