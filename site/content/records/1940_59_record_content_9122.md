Burra Town Council, 16 February

The RAA has forwarded four signs for gas producer cleaning grounds.

The Mayor reported that a Geological Search Party would soon visit Burra to investigate the possibility of mineral deposits in the district.  This was the result of a case put to the Copper Commission jointly by the Council and the Progress Association.

The Lord Mayor of Adelaide wrote thanking the Burra people for contributing £265-8-6 to the ‘Sydney’ Fund.

Resolved that the bridge near Kakoschke’s be renewed underneath.
