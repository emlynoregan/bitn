‘Erratic Correspondent’ produces a remarkable defence of former Cr Hardy which could only have been written by Hardy himself!

‘I must say it is a pity he was paid out in such a manner, but it is only for a time, as the ratepayers who have the interests of the town at heart cannot for long forget such services rendered by him.’
