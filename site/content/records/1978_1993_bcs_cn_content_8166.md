Burra District Advisory Committee has expressed its concern over the intention of the Burra Burra DC to lease Redbanks Reserve for grazing and to allow the continued use of the area for off-road vehicles.  Off-road vehicles have partly destroyed a large section of the scrubland and will continue to do so until it is all destroyed.  Stock grazing would place a further strain on the area – especially in the open areas.

Concern was expressed that grazing would destroy one of the few remaining scrub areas in the district.  The feed left is needed to preserve the area as a nature reserve and any further grazing would turn it into just another pastoral area – it would stop the re-establishment of scrub and saltbush.  It was suggested that if any area had to be grazed it should be the area west of Baldina Creek and the eastern areas (flats and scrub) should be left as a nature reserve.

The committee felt that off-road vehicles should be removed.

They suggested off-road vehicle users were violating Native Clearance Control Regulations by removing mallee for fires and that the Council was liable for this as the leaseholder.  It recommended that the RAA be requested to delete Redbanks Reserve as a recognised off-road vehicle area.  (They felt that a partial removal of off-road vehicles would be ineffective.)  It was recommended that application be made under the Native Vegetation Retention Scheme for the fencing of the reserve to keep out off-road vehicles.
