Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  Many thousands of yards of ballast have been taken from the quarry on Elisha Ford’s property and at times 50-60 men have been employed.  Why it has been closed in favour of a quarry at Sleep’s Hill is not known – at the time the contractor said he could supply it as cheaply as Sleep’s Hill Quarry.  Cr Lott said the Council should move to have the quarry re-opened.  Cr Jeffery said he had argued at the time with the Commissioner who tried to convince him it was as cheap to carry ballast to Terowie from Sleep’s Hill as it was from Burra.  A motion for a deputation to wait on the Commissioner on this matter was carried.
