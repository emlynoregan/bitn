Burra Mine

It is expected the Mine will be in production by the end of 1970 and will employ 60-70 men when in full production in 1971.  This was announced in an election speech by Mr E.C. Allen MP in Burra Town Hall on Thursday night.  Samin Ltd has called tenders for the removal of waste material and of the ore itself.  The necessary plant to do that is estimated to cost $2 million.

Stage 1.  The company will treat 250 tons of ore per day.

Stage 2.  By October 1971 this figure will increase to 1,000 tons per day and will involve the removal of up to 7,000 tons of waste per day.

It is thought there are about 4.3 million tons of copper ore.

Samin Ltd is negotiating with the SA Housing Trust for houses to be erected in Burra.
