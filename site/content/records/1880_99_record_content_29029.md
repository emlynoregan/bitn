Local Board of Health

T. Richardson is complaining about the nuisance of C. Schutz carting manure near his dwelling.

A complaint has been lodged about the dirty state of the Burra Hotel premises: two cases of typhoid fever undoubtedly originated on these premises.

Messrs Rabbich & Sons objected to the manner in which they have been singled out for committing a nuisance.  [Presumably a reference to the lid required for their boiling down operation.]
