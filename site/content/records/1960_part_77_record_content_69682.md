St Mary’s Burra

On Saturday night the children took part in an informal rehearsal for the confirmation ceremony on Sunday.  They met the Bishop and had a chat with him in the Hall.

On Sunday after the sermon Leighton Biggs was baptised and then the confirmations were carried out by Bishop Rosier for:

Dion Biggs	Leighton Biggs	Roy Blight

Jennifer Buckton	Merridy Buckton	Anne Field

Ann Hurst	Jennifer Kempster	Maryann Shipard

Antony Stephenson	William Wardle	Mark Williams

The organist and Master of Chorister at St Peter’s Cathedral, Mr David Swale played magnificent music on the organ.  The Cathedral Choristers added to the occasion, while enjoying their camp at the Redruth Hall.  The only thing to mar the occasion was the persistent rain.
