Obituary.  James Thomas died 23 August at his residence ‘Northfield’ Redruth.  He was born at Kooringa 3 April 1860, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs James Thomas and the last surviving of a family of four sons.  He received most of his education at Burra, at private schools of that period.  On the closure of the Burra Mine he went to Wallaroo with his parents, where he gained business experience by working in drapery, bakery and chemist shops.  However, the land called him and he left Wallaroo to join his father and brothers at Banbury (Mt Bryan East.)  Later he got together a team of bullocks and went to Mt Gipps, the other side of Broken Hill, for wool.  This was certainly a venturesome enterprise, for he was still only a lad.  Sheep farming appealed to him and he battled hard shepherding sheep in rough country with plenty of wild dogs about.  He endured great hardships, often losing instead of making money, but he set the foundations for a more successful career to come.  In 1890 he married Miss Ada M. Gare and their first home was on a property known as Martindale, near Ketchowla Station.  They then moved to Tomkinson near Caroona Station, where they struggled to make ends meet.  In 1899 they came into the Razorback, just beyond Mt Bryan and soon after secured ‘Wallinga’ Mt Bryan East, where they lived with their family until their retirement.  One of Mr Thomas’s outstanding achievements in the sheep farming business was the producing of fat lambs for the Freezing Works in a country considered to get too little rainfall for that purpose.  He succeeded in this for a continuous period of over ten years.  He took an active interest in all public matters and was a Hallett District Councillor for many years and an active member of the Agricultural Bureau.  He was a great lover of music and organised and trained a piccolo band of boys at the local school – one of them is now the world-famous explorer, Sir Hubert (George) Wilkins, who was born at and spent his early years at Mt Bryan East.  When he retired in 1921 Mr & Mrs Thomas came into Burra and purchased the property ‘Northfield’ at Redruth, where they lived until his death.  In retirement he was not active in public affairs, but was busy in good works, which he performed quietly and unostentatiously.  He was the Chairman of the Burra Benevolent Society and a member of the Unemployed Relief Committee, where the aid was often out of his own pocket.  He was a regular visitor to the sick and suffering in our local hospital and at the home of the aged until illness claimed him.  As in his early days, he continued to love music and took a great interest in the Burra District Brass Band, of which he was Patron.  He paid for extra lighting at the Rotunda.

The funeral on 24 August was very largely attended.  The Burra Band, under Bandmaster J.H. Murison played Jesu lover of my soul as the funeral procession went down the long avenue to the grave.  He leaves a widow and three sons: G. Ralph Thomas (Hogback Station), Frank G. Thomas (Mt Bryan East) and Alan L. Thomas (‘Wonnara’ Terowie.)  There are seven grandchildren.

[Born ‘Three Gums’ District of Burra 3 April 1860: died 23 August 1935 Redruth.]
