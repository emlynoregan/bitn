Delegates’ Meeting 11 June

Among more routine matters Mr Ledgard for Spalding said they were very dissatisfied with the umpiring, especially with that of S. Kellaway [Jnr] and asked that something be done.

Mr Rohde of Hallett said their instructions were to vote against S. Kellaway as a central umpire.

Mr Harding for Booborowie said they were very dissatisfied with the match of 9 June, especially the first half.

Mr Kennedy of Kooringa said they too were dissatisfied with umpiring, especially that of G. Harris and they wanted change.

S. Kellaway Sen. rose and said that as a delegate and not as a father he thought ‘S. Kellaway was making a very fair job of umpiring.’

It was resolved after considerable debate to appoint two more umpires from the list of previous applicants, effective 16 June.

Mr Kellaway Sen.’s amendment that there be no change failed for want of a seconder.
