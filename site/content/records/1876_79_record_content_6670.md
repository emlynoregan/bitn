Gustav Gebhardt v. Drew & Oliver. This case is reported at some length. Drew was sued as executor in the estate of W. Oliver, deceased, for £72-12-4 being the balance due on sheep sold in 1876. As contracts etc. were not written it took a lot of discussion and eventually the verdict was for Gebhardt in the sum of £35.
