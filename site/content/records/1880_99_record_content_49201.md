Burra Town Council, 20 March.

A deputation with S. Hill as spokesman waited on the Council re unemployment in the town.

Mr Holder has reported that he has seen the Commissioner of Public Works and has as yet received no reply, but does not think the reopening of the Ballast Quarry is likely at present.

Cr Linkson said there were 67 men out of work in North Ward.  He moved that a deputation wait on the Government this week.  2nd Cr Walsh and carried.

Cr Linkson said anyone who agreed to go must pay his own expenses.

Amid a deal of squabbling the Council moved to employ some men clearing out watertables on main roads.

Cr Linkson moved 12 men be so employed.  Carried

Cr Parks’s motion for a call of the whole Council was then brought forward and again the Mayor ruled it out.

Cr Parks said that last time it was deemed informal.  It is formal this time – still the Mayor would not entertain it.

There followed a series of heated exchanges over the capricious way the Mayor accepted or rejected motions and ignored by-laws when it suited him.

Cr Linkson then moved the Council adjourn as the Mayor refuses to go on with the business.  Cr Parks 2nd.

The Mayor refused the motion.

The Councillors left.
