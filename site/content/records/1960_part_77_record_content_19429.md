Burra Town Council, 24 March

Council voted to approve a takeover of the townâ€™s main roads by the Highways Department.

A letter is to be sent to the Police Department expressing concern at the delay in building a new Police Station at Burra: the matter having been investigated several years ago.

The Council will advertise for a part-time typist to assist the Town Clerk.

[The advertisement appeared in the paper of 7 April page 2, for a job 2-5 p.m. Monday to Friday.]
