Kooringa News, 5 February

Mr J. Burnell delivered the second lecture in a series for the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Society on Tuesday.  The subject was James Ferguson.  Mr J.R. Stephens took the chair.  Attendance was not very encouraging.

Burton’s National Circus Troupe has been performing here on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  On each occasion there was a full house.  They maintained their old reputation for first-rate proficiency.
