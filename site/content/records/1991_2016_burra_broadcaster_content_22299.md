An Anonymous writer complains that the local transport company has been cleaning their trucks and trailers on a Burra North roadway near the Burra Creek in contravention of the law.  When challenged their response was that they had been doing it for ten years and Council was aware of it.  Council has sent the firm a letter, but no action has resulted.  The EPA has also not responded.  Perhaps clients could have an impact by changing business is the company continues to act like an environmental vandal.
