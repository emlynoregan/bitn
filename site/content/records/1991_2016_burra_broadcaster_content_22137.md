Editorial

In recent weeks visitors to Burra have been interviewed by volunteers on behalf of the University of Canberra as part of a survey of three historic mining towns: Burra, Charters Towers and Maldon.  When I interviewed Mary Talbot Cross and her husband Roger they wondered why Burra didn’t have a walk of fame.  This seems an excellent idea.  Brass plates could be placed in the footpath at intervals acknowledging Burra’s famous sons and daughters.  Names that come to mind include: Thomas Pickett, Sir Henry Ayers, Henry Roach, Essington Lewis, Daisy Kennedy, Mary Warnes, Ian Auhl and Sir William Frederick Holder.

Voice of Youth is the premier public speaking competition for secondary school students in SA & Broken Hill.  Because of the number of Burra students entering, two heats will be held at Burra Community School.  The first on 4 May will be against Clare H.S. and the second on 10 May against Kapunda H.S.  State finalists will compete this year in the National Final in Adelaide.
