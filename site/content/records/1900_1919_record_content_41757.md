Wounded.  Although not having enlisted in Burra, the wounded in the Dardanelles include two soldiers who once worked here.  Don Brooks [actually Donald Hamilton Brooke] at one time with the National Bank in Kooringa was wounded in the foot.  S. Cameron, who worked for a time for S. Burns, was also wounded.
