Copper & Lead Production in SA

Since our last summary the Directors of the Burra Burra Mines have paid the twenty third dividend of 100%.  By the ships William Prowse, Thetis and Confiance a considerable supply of miners has arrived and proceeded to the mines.  Should others follow as expected, we may soon see the mines in full work again.  Captain Pascoe has supplied the following approximate return of copper and lead ores raised in SA since the first discovery of metalliferous ores.

The value of 115, 520 tons of copper ore at £15 per ton would be £1,732,800 and of 2,429 tons of silver-lead ore at £12 per ton would be £29,148.

Most of these ores were raised between 1844 and 1850.  We are assured that reckoning every man, woman and child employed in raising and preparing ores, even before the goldfields were discovered, never exceeded 3,000 souls.  This means the average returns of their productive industry in those years averaged nearly £600 per head.

Nothing approaching exhaustion has resulted from such productiveness.  The Burra Burra is still as rich in its quality of ores and has great productive capabilities.  Kapunda’s ores have averaged 21% and before 1848 eight lodes had been discovered and were all producing.  It is difficult to form an estimate of its future productiveness.
