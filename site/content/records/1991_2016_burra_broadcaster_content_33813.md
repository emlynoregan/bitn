The Railway Bridge over the highway at Burra North was removed on 27 May.  Roger Kennedy of Clare sent his 30 tonne crane over for the job.  In the near future the concrete surrounds will be removed and the embankments will then be sloped back to open up the whole area and improve visibility.  [Photo]
