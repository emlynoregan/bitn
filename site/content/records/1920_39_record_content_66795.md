Obituary.  L.L. Wicklein of Kooringa died 29 April at Burra Hospital after a short, but severe illness.  Council acknowledged his death with a minute’s silence.  He had owned a jeweller’s and watchmaker’s business in Kooringa for many years and was a Councillor for two years, 1914, 1916.*  He retired some years ago to Pt Augusta, but Mr & Mrs Wicklein returned to Kooringa about two years ago.  His wife was Miss Ada Chenoweth [Chynoweth], youngest daughter of Mr & Mrs James Chenoweth of Kooringa who survives with one daughter, Mrs James Melville of Rawlinna WA (who is visiting her mother) and one son Fred Wicklein of Whyalla.  There are three grandchildren.

[*This is incorrect.  He was elected for West Ward from December 1911 to November 1913 and re-elected to serve the term December 1913 to November 1915, but was hounded from office in November 1914 due to the animosity for enemy nationals, though he had been born in Australia and his Hungarian-born father had been a naturalised British subject for about 50 years.]

[Otto Leopold Ludwig Wicklein born 13 July 1870 Adelaide.]
