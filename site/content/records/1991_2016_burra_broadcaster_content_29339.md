On 2 November lightning started a fire northeast of Burra in the hills on the property of Hamish Baker.  Units from Burra, Booborowie, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan and Baldina attended with some private units as well.  Some 25 acres of grassland were burnt.  A fire also broke out opposite ‘Barton Hill’ when straw under a green barley crop was ignited by a lightning strike.
