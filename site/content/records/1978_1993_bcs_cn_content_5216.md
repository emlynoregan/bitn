Burra Kindergarten

There will be another working bee on 22 November to complete landscaping.  It is hoped this will be the last.  The Kindergarten will be closed on Monday 23 November and Tuesday 24 November so the new Kindergarten can be established.  The first session at the new Kindergarten will be 25 November.
