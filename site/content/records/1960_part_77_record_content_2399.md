Football.  North Eastern Association

A Grade	Booborowie 12.13 defeated Hallett 7.13

Spalding 14.16 defeated Leighton 4.3

Burra 9.14 defeated Redlegs 5.4

Inter-High School Sports held at Riverton last Wednesday were abandoned at the luncheon adjournment due to continual rain.  This was unfortunate as Burra was in the lead to bring home the Handicap Shield.
