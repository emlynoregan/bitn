Burra Creek Flood.

The sudden flood in the Burra Creek on Sunday evening attracted young boys to the water.  Several got into the bed to race the water and foolishly stopped at intervals to see how close they could let the water get to them.  This went on till the old ford at Roach’s Flour Mill was negotiated where the three boys – one called Fuss and the other two Stewart – found themselves stranded on some old stonework forming part of the ford, with water all round them.  Fortunately young Harvey arrived and at the risk of his own life rescued the young Fuss who was being carried down the stream some distance and must else have perished amidst the slush and debris.  Harvey got Fuss back to the island.  The boys removed their shoes, but by then they were too scared to attempt to wade ashore.  The police were sent for, but Harry Austin arrived with a horse and with difficulty got close to the boys and one at a time took them to the bank.  Fred. Heinrich and W.J. Richards helped at this stage and the latter fell in while helping and cut and bruised his leg.  Young Fuss was beyond recognition due to the mud on his face and clothes.
