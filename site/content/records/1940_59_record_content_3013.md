He came to Mt Bryan when c. 18 to work for Mr Henry Tralaggan.  Later with his brother Joshua he took up land at Mongolata.

He attended the Burra stock sale on 2 August and was taken ill suddenly on 8 august and died at the Burra Hospital.  About 63 years ago he married Miss Cornfoot of Mintaro, who died in 1917.  The deceased has since lived with his son, F.J. Lomman.  There were eight children. The only daughter died some years ago, but the seven sons survive: W.H.
