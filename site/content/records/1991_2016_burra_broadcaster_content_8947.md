The John McDouall Stuart Society

Nearly 50 members will visit Burra on Saturday 16 December as guests of the McDouall Stuart Board, which managed the Burra Art Gallery.  They will bring exhibits to be on display over the weekend.  A highlight of the visit will be the unveiling of a plaque on the Old Post & Telegraph Office to commemorate the achievements of the ‘South Australian Great Northern Exploration’ crossing from Adelaide to Australia’s northern shores and returning without loss of life in 1861-62.  The group led by Stuart reached a point at Chambers Bay 129 km east of Darwin and on his return Stuart sent a telegram from the Post and Telegraph Office at Burra [to the Governor] and spent the night at the Burra Hotel [where the Hospital now stands] before going to Kapunda by coach and thence by rail to Adelaide.
