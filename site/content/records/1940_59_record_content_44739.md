‘Ratepayer’ writes complaining that no landowner at Burra North will sell vacant land suitable for a house and small garden, despite sometimes holding it undeveloped for 20-60 years.  They say they might want to build.  A young couple, the man a returned soldier, is frustrated by this attitude.  Council should rate such land higher.
