Richardson was charged with selling less than 1 gallon of brandy contrary to his storekeeper’s licence.  On 13 December Sheperdson went to the wine and spirit cellar behind Mr Park’s shop and asked for a bottle of brandy, which was supplied for 6/6.  Despite a plea of entrapment and others of a technical nature the defendant was fined £10 plus £3-14-0 costs or 28 days.
