Memorial to Fallen Soldiers.

A meeting at Mt Bryan on 9 May was chaired by I.J. Warnes, Chairman of the Mt Bryan District Council.

Mr Warnes said the first meeting at Leighton had called on the Mayor of Burra to convene a meeting of delegates to consist of two from each DC and two from the Town Council.  They had all heard a lot of what Burra had done and it had always taken credit, not the district.  It had taken the money and decided what to do with it.  The suggested meeting was held on 18 December, but it was not a meeting of delegates.  Instead the whole Town Council was there and other residents beside.  Though the residents left, the Town Council and members of the Burra DC stayed.  All that was decided was that:

A suitable monument is to be erected in Burra by Burra & District.

The Corporation of Burra and each DC is to appoint two delegates to form an executive committee.

The Burra town meeting last week had voted for a monument in Market Square.

The RSL had asked for a meeting of delegates to hear their scheme at a meeting in their rooms.  The scheme was put by Mr Thompson.  They could please themselves if they wanted to join Burra (Voices of: ‘We don’t.’) or do something for their own district.  (Voices: ‘We will.’)  As far as Mt Bryan was concerned there was a proposal to add two rooms in front of the District Hall.  (A library and a billiard room.)  It was suggested the £240 to provide work for returned soldiers be so used.

Mr W.D. Thompson then put forward the RSL scheme for a museum hall as outlined in last week’s Record.

Mr Beaglehole thought any local trophies could go in the rooms on the Mt Bryan Hall and not to Burra.

Mr Quinn would do something at Mt Bryan first and then support Burra afterwards.

There was an awkwardly worded motion, the effect of which was to put Mt Bryan first.

Mr Warnes called on the meeting to think carefully – they couldn’t go to Burra without giving and if they tied themselves hard and fast to Mt Bryan they would be solely on their own.

The motion was then altered to put Mt Bryan first and then if they liked the Burra scheme, they would help them afterwards.

The motion was carried 9 to 1.  [This figure seems surprisingly low, given that the report also says about 50 people attended, but subsequent proceedings suggest that some 40 abstentions might have occurred.  The proceedings are not very clear, as the next paragraph says the motion was then withdrawn to enable a new one to be put.]

Mr Beaglehole then moved that Mt Bryan supported a local scheme and this time there were 30 for, 1 against and 21 abstentions.

Mr A. Pledge moved the memorial take the form of two rooms on the front of the hall.  2nd Mr Beaglehole.

Mr Warnes assured them the DC would not object if they could raise the money.  Carried.

A committee was appointed and the building is to be called the Mt Bryan Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial
