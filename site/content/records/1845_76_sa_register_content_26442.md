‘A Subscriber’ writes re the Mt Bryan Road.  He does not think the Government can be aware of just how disgraceful its condition is for forty chains north and twenty chains south from the Mt Bryan Hotel.  On 12 July he was stuck on the road in a light trap.

At present traffic in loaded drays is virtually at a standstill.  Every shower makes it still more impassable.  The coming harvest will generate much traffic to the Burra Station, not to mention the great quantities of wool en route to Port Adelaide.  ‘I hope our worthy Commissioner of Public Works will at once take the matter up, and place this piece of road in a passable state; and I may say that the above road is our only feeder to the Burra Railway.’
