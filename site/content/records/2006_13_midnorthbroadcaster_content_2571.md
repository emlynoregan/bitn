Boh Wall was picked as a wicket keeper in the Australian Country XI for the Australian Country Cricket Championship in January.  He was excellent in that position, taking 14 catches behind the wicket and conceding only 9 byes in ten days of nearly 500 overs of cricket.  As a batsman he was very handy as well, scoring two crucial half centuries.  SA had the same win-loss record as the two leading sides, but came third on % after Victoria and Queensland.
