Court.

Daniel Keenan, Daniel O’Brien and Patrick Hogan have all received one month for being idle and disorderly.

Alfred Jacka has been sent to the reformatory school till the age of 18 for stealing a cucumber from the gardens of R. Snell.

Hogan was jostled in one of the Iron Mine & Leighton Athletics Club races recently and his protest was dismissed.  Now his father has decided to pursue the matter in court.

M.S. writes re M-C Jemison’s conduct.  M.S. was a hawker who entered Burra, got a licence and went to sell his wares.  He accidentally called on M-C Jemison and on being invited in showed his wares.  Jemison gruffly asked if he had a licence and when told he had one in his purse was told roughly: ‘Now retire from my office.’  When M.S. remonstrated for his attitude Jemison said: ‘I’ll confiscate your goods for you.’

M.S. told him he could not, as he had done no wrong.  M.S. then went to complain to the chief magistrate of the town.  He was too upset to continue his work for the next two days.

‘A Mother’ writes re the case of Alfred Jacka who was sent to the reformatory for 1 year 7 months for picking up a cucumber which was not even attached to a growing plant.  Why not punish the other boy as well?  The mother relies upon her two boys for support and he has work to go to.
