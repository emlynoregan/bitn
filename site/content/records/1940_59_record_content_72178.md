Weather.  A wonderful rain from the east came as an Easter gift.  Up to 225 points were recorded on Good Friday and most soaked into the soil.  Most dams are now full.  Early feed can be expected and ewes with lambs will benefit as following two previous rains in March seeds have germinated.  Samples of the falls: Koomooloo 128 points, Woolgangi 127, Braemar 208, Hogback 111, Mt Bryan East (Dunstan’s) 233, Princess Royal 90, Burra 107 on Saturday with 3 points since.
