Burra Artists’ Trail

A group of local artists has been working on creating this trail of eight venues, where the public can view works of art in homes and studios:

Pauline McPharlin at Saffron Downs, who can also cater for lunches by appointment.

Dick Cleland has a Woodshed Gallery.

Grace Delaney will exhibit in the Bakehouse Gallery.

Glenys Christopher’s Studio is at Ford’s Corner.

Helen Jensen’s studio is in her lovely cottage garden.

Ruth Norris’s work can be seen at the Pharaoh’s Tomb.

Wendy Douglas exhibits her work in the dining room of the Commercial Hotel.

And of course the trail includes the Burra Regional Art Gallery.
