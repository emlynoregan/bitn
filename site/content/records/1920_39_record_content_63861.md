The Grand Final of Centenary Week was a dance in the street when an estimated 1,000 people were present.  All traffic was diverted to the eastern side of the Rotunda and the celebrators filled the western side.  Music from an accordion was supplied through a Lomas Amplifier.  Dancing continued almost to midnight.
