Goyder Council

Quotes will be obtained from suitable companies re obtaining heritage advisory services.

The road from North Booborowie Road to the NW corner of the [Booborowie] cemetery will be renamed Orchard Road.

Council has expressed concern about the financial sustainability of the Burra Visitor Information Centre, based on financial data available for 2011-12 and the first two months of 2012-13.  Clarification of the position will be sought from BRTBA.

Consent was given for BRTBA to sub-lease the first floor of the Visitor Centre to Flinders University for office space associated with Mid North Knowledge Partnership.  Council will allocate an unbudgeted $6,000 towards upgrading the rooms.

Support was given for rebuilding a failed section of heritage wall on the school perimeter at allotment 12/14 7 Bridge Terrace.  [Paxton Terrace?]

Ward Funding Allocations for Burra

BBH Football Club $300 for water bottles and carriers.

BBH Football Club $4,000 for a PA system.

Burra Cricket Club $300 for equipment.

Burra Bowling Club $8,000 to repair and repaint the outside of the clubroom.

Burra Bowling Club $2,000 for a fertilizer spray unit.

Burra Community Development Program $1,000 to repaint the Burra Town Hall supper room.

BRTBAâ€™s application to upgrade the back room at the Burra Visitor Information Centre was deferred until the financial viability of the Centre was established.
