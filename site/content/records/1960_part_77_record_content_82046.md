BCS

A meeting of parents was attended by more than 100 people.  The election of the new School Council was held.

New members: Mr R. Shipard, Mr R. Thamm, Mr R. Stockman, Mr B. Stockman and Mr G. Kellock.

Continuing members: Mrs O. Holmes, Mrs J. Tiver, Mr D. Nettleton, Mr G. Searle.

Mr D. Lloyd represents the District Council and Mr R. Mason is the Parliamentary representative.

For the Parents & Friends’ Association elected were: President, Mrs C. Stockman; Vice-President, Mrs M. Lloyd; Secretary, Mrs H. Reed and Treasurer, Mrs G. O’Connor.

The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. in 1976 had nine meetings with an average attendance of 48.  Mr R. Thamm reported that the Centenary Booklet is in the hands of Mr I. Auhl and is progressing well.  The application for a dental clinic was refused as there are insufficient students for a full-time clinic, but discussion with Mr Don Dunstan indicated the possibility of a mobile clinic.  Mr I. Allen has resigned as Chairman of the Primary School Council, a member of the Community School Council and as Chairman of the Community School Management Committee after years of dedicated work.  A minute of appreciation was recorded.

A Council Levy of $500 per family, which in comparison to many schools was very modest, was added to the booklist this year.  It will be used for administration costs, insurance fees, maintenance of Council property and for school amenities.  [This must surely be a misprint?]

Mrs E. Carpenter, Community School Co-ordinator reported on programs and services offered.

In 1975 there were four DFE Classes and in 1976 there were 9.  There were 7 voluntary classes in three centres; Burra, Hallett and Booborowie and 4 voluntary evening classes.

In October Community School Week saw 292 adult enrolments.

There was a Vacation Recreation Centre run each holiday.

Youth Club attendance varied from 40 to 80.

The Burra Community Entertainment Group put on Salad Days.

Support was given to Arts Council Productions and to the Art Gallery Travelling Exhibition.

A Junior National Trust Branch had been established.

Horse riding was organised in vacations.

A Dog Obedience Club was run.
