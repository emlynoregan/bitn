Burra Town Council 19 February.

The previous decision on ‘sharps’ was reversed on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Mr Andrews will continue as scavenger and will work 22 days a month rather than 20.

Cr Batchelor moved and Cr Drew 2nd that Ayers St be made and maintained by all wards equally.  Cr Ridgway indignantly opposed this and indeed threatened to resign if the matter was allowed.  Cr Dunstan agreed and said he too would resign.  The Mayor thought this an overreaction for which they would be sorry on further reflection.  The motion was then withdrawn pending preparation of an estimate for making and maintaining Ayers St.  Notice of a motion to make workmen pay for sharps was given.
