Mongolata Goldfield

A question in Parliament by Mr Melrose reveals that Byles’ Mongolata had requested the Government supply a diamond drill to test the field and the Department was looking into it.

Byles’ Mongolata is also reported to have taken over Block 8.

There was the usual complaint that the field was receiving less publicity and assistance than it merited.
