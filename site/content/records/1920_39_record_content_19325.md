‘Interested’ writes asking for particulars on the Hospital Board to which the editor replies:

Originally the Board was of 12 Government appointed people.

When reformed the Board comprised 12: five elected by ratepayers as a body and seven nominated, one each, by the contributing Town & District Councils.  (Apoinga, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Booborowie, Hanson & Burra DCs and the Burra Corporation.)

If the proposed alteration is sanctioned by the Chief Secretary as is likely unless ratepayers strongly object, the Board will comprise seven members, being only those nominated by the Town & District Councils.

Almost no one seems to object to the reduction in numbers, but many do object to the proposed method of election.  On suggestion is that at the annual elections of Councillors one member for the Board should be elected by the ratepayers in each district.  We believe this would satisfy all parties.

[A minor problem her might have been that Town & District Council elections were out of step with DC elections in July and Town Council elections in December.]
