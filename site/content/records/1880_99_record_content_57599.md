Editorial on Sanitary Matters.

The Chief Inspector of the Central Board of Health, Mr Farrell, visited Burra a few days ago.  After a thorough inspection he was almost entirely satisfied.  His only real complaint was the boiling of offal etc. at the premises of Messrs Rabbich & Sons, butchers, without any of the precautions required by the Health Act to prevent the escape of offensive fumes etc.  This is not a new complaint and has been before the Local Board of Health on different occasions.  Too much praise cannot be given to Mr J.R. Gray, the local Corporation Inspector, for the admirable way he looks after the sanitary condition of the town.

2nd Leader on the secret nature of Council proceedings and specifically on the matter of an account that was queried by Cr Sampson.  Councillors are not to receive any financial advantage from Council and an account for wood (for the Waterworks) was from A. Harris on printed billhead, but with ‘junior’ hand-written in.  The genuineness of the account was queried and Cr Harris then withdrew it and asked for the return of the wood.  BUT if the account was genuine, what authority had Cr Harris to withdraw the account and so do A. Harris jun. out of the amount due?
