Unemployment Relief.  On Tuesday the Mayor got notice from the Conservator of Water that 50 married men would be employed on a Government Reservoir in the Hundred of Bundey, section 68 at 4/6 a day with the Government finding tents and tools.  [The 50 seems to be an error for 20 in light of what follows.]

20 jobs were offered to 50 men needing work and they had to walk 30 miles to camp carrying provisions, blankets etc. with them.  Only the first 20 would be employed, any others having to walk the 30 miles back!  Still, the required number has gone.
