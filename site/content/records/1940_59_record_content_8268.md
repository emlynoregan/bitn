Obituary.  Roderick Wilson SBA.  Sympathy is expressed to Mr & Mrs Hugh Wilson of Burra over the loss of their son [in the sinking of HMAS Sydney].  He was a bright, happy son who nobly did his duty.  As far as we know Rod. is the first of our Burra Boys to pay the supreme sacrifice.

[A letter from G. Bolton of George Bolton’s of Adelaide, Roderick Wilson’s last employer before he enlisted, is also printed.]

[Roderick Richard Wilson was born 14 June 1919 at Kooringa.  He was lost in the sinking of HMAS Sydney on 19 November 1941, though the registration of death gives 20 November.]
