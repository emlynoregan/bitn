Obituary and Inquest.  At Gum Creek on 20 April J.D. Cave JP was coroner on the body of Thomas McMahon who died 19 April.  [Aged 40.  The registration of death gives 19 May as the date, which is clearly an error.]

The deceasedâ€™s wife, Theresa Ann said that two years ago he had had rheumatic fever.  He had considerable trouble after that for some weeks with a chill, but was then well until about three weeks ago when rheumatic fever symptoms returned.  Got some medicine from Clare six days ago.  His condition fluctuated and for two days last week he had lost the use of his limbs.  We had no idea he was so seriously ill and he died quite suddenly, seeming to choke on Tuesday morning at 1.20 a.m.

Dr Brummitt had treated the deceased two years previously for colic, but had not seen him since.  The verdict was heart failure caused by rheumatic fever.
