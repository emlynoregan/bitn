Cold Storage & Ice Works

Huge loads of rabbits have been coming into Burra.  The rabbits are put into clod storage and then shipped by semi-trailer to Adelaide.  The cold storage is to be put on a proper footing by Messrs C.H. Cummins & E.G. Franklin of Adelaide, both of whom have been employed by William Angliss Ltd.  Ice will also be made on the premises and the works will run 24 hours a day.
