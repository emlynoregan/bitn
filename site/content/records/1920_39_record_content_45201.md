Mr McHugh MLA moved a vote of thanks to the Premier and also to Dr Ward & Mr Grundy.  He was seconded by Mr George MP.

Dr Ward & Mr Grundy responded and Mr Critchley MP moved a vote of thanks to Mr Warnes.

In the evening the Mayor entertained about 80 guests at Burra Hotel and the speeches are reported in a little over 1 column.  This was followed by a civic reception at the Institute.

The Premier’s speech on this occasion being largely political with an election coming soon and with references to the policy speech delivered on Tuesday evening at Kapunda by the Leader of the Opposition.  The speeches are reported in somewhat over 2 columns, but reflect state and national issues rather than specifically local matters.
