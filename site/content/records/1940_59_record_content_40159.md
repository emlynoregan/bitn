Floods.  A severe thunderstorm with hail struck Mt Bryan East 27 December 1948.  At Charles Dare’s 4 inches of rain fell in the afternoon.  Mr Vic. Hughes registered 2 inches.  Dust Hole Creek flowed at its highest in living memory.  Many hundreds of pines and other trees were carried off at 20 m.p.h. or so.  A horse was swept away and Miss Rhonda Thomas’s per sheep.  The roar of the creek could be heard three miles away.  Much fencing was damaged.  The southern part of the same district got only 40 points.
