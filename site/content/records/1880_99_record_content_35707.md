Burra Town Council.

Cr Sampson moved that plans for a new footbridge across the Burra Creek be laid on the table for a fortnight.  Cr Hardy 2nd, especially as the cost was about £100.  He felt the plans were more elaborate than necessary.  Carried.

The bridge behind the Burra Hotel is proving more expensive than expected so the Mayor proposed that the Council subsidise the private expenditure £ for £.  Cr Sampson moved East Ward give £3-10-0 and Cr Watt moved that West Ward give £3-10-0.  Both carried.

It was resolved that Council join the Municipal Association.

Mr Geake was appointed lamp lighter for the quarter.

The Mayor had authorised the Town Clerk to issue certain notices re the Sunday closing of hotels.

Cr Sampson thought this was a matter for Council and he wondered at the legality of a poll of ratepayers based on South and Middle Wards when such wards no longer existed.

Cr Hardy felt embarrassed when he was asked about the notices and had to admit he knew nothing of them.  He asked if Mr Holder had anything to do with the matter as it might place him in a false light with some voters at the coming election.

Other Councillors reiterated the general trend of these comments.

The Mayor was sorry to have offended, but felt he had to give notice under the Act and Mr Holder had no role in the matter.
