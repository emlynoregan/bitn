The Smelts Paddock

This article deals with the new trail and signage around the site and lists some of the points:

The Patent Copper Co. was formed in London in early 1848 to build and operate a smelting works at the Burra Burra Mine.

By mid-1849 the first smelting house was completed with eight furnaces and a refinery, with three furnaces added in 1850.

The English & Australian Copper Co. took over in 1851.

A second smelting house with nine furnaces commenced operations in 1854.

As payment the smelting company retained one third of the copper produced.

The operations were conducted by Welsh smeltermen, brought out from Swansea with their families 1849-55.

Houses for up to 75 smeltermen were provided at the works.

The village of Llwchwr was established about 1 km to the north in 1855.

The smelting works employed 1,000, including 400 teamsters in 1851.

At first refined copper was carted by bullock dray to Pt Wakefield.

After 1857 it was carted by mule teams to the Kapunda railhead.

Production declined after 1862, when smelting works were erected at Pt Adelaide and operations at Burra ceased in 1869.

In all some 28,000 tons of copper metal were produced from 150,000 tons of Burra ore – at today’s prices for copper this was worth some $100 million.
