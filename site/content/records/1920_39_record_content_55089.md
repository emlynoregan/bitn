M.A. Radford writes to say that the Mayor’s memory in saying that Mr Radford had previously proposed the damming of the Burra Creek was faulty.  He (Mr Radford) had consistently opposed any such move.

Any overshot dam would soon fill with debris and clearing it would be beyond Council resources.

Hindering the flow in a big flood would be dangerous and threaten houses.

He also warned about getting earth from the oval to make the banked cycle track.  There is bare rock barely beneath the surface and earth was brought in to cover it.
