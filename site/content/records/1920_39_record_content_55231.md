Cr Dow said, ‘You can’t keep back the sea.’

The motion was carried with Cr Dow opposed.

Con Samuels applied to have Ridgway’s premises in Aberdeen registered as a betting shop.  This letter was received.

The Redruth Police advised that A.T. Pearce had applied for approval to use the storeroom owned by F.M. Pearce on the corner of Moorhead & Cooper Streets Aberdeen as a betting shop.

A motion to approve this was carried.

A letter from lawyers for W. Marshall of the Aberdeen Quarry asked Council to wait on the Minister for Railways concerning ballast contracts for the quarry.

SAR wrote saying that Sleep’s Hill ballast was superior and no more costly.

The Mayor said Burra ballast was the finest in SA and was being offered at the same price as that from Sleep’s Hill.  He would help the Council in the matter.

Cr Jeffery said using the quarry would make a difference to the town and a deputation should wait on the Minister and a motion to that effect was then carried.
