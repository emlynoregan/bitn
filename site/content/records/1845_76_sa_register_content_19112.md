Editor:

In the last few days we have had complaints from Rev. Cox and from a writer from Angaston about the standard of public conveyances in the country.

Mr Rounsevell has replied in plain terms.  He speaks of Mr Cox’s attacks as ‘shameful’ and ‘untruthful’ and takes the position of a persecuted innocent – attacking Rev. Cox and asking in ‘a style more vigorous than polite’: ‘Why did Mr Cox get into and overload, and try to break down the conveyance, when he was told there was not room for him, but insisted on incommoding the usual passengers, annoying the driver, damaging the vehicle, injuring the business, and insulting the owners, and putting false statements to the papers?  What does he mean by it?’

We have a word or two to say to Mr Rounsevell.

He is the great conveyance king among us.  There are but few persons in the colony who are not at some time obliged to be placed at his mercy.  Given the state of the roads over which his coaches travel perhaps we cannot seek any great degree of comfort, but we ought to have the assurance of safety and a covered coach should keep out the rain.  A person who has acquired a monopoly cannot say ‘You are not obliged to go by my vehicles; if you don’t like them you need not use them.’

Having driven all other conveyances off the road, he is bound to pay regard to the interests, safety, and, as far as possible, the convenience of the public.  This is recognised in for example the railways of England and the legislators there guard the rights of travellers, and so it ought to be here.  It would help if inspectors of vehicles were appointed in all towns from which conveyances start.  Such inspection is provided in the city.  We mention Mr Rounsevell by name as he is the most extensive of all coach proprietors in the colony, but the remarks would apply to all who keep carriages for hire.  Some sort of supervision is needed.

It would be wiser in Mr Rounsevell to accept a hint from those travellers who have found his arrangements defective, and to remove the evil rather than resent it.

[The editor goes on at considerably greater length.]
