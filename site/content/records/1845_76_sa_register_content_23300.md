Government Schools in 1869

The report of the Board of Education recognises that a complete reorganisation of Government schools is impending and acknowledges that as presently constituted they are totally inadequate to requirements.  Data for reorganisation are being collected.  The report includes 330 schools; 5 more than for 1868.  20 schools closed and 25 new ones opened.  Only three of the new schools were in corporate towns, but six closures were in such places.  The rule of the Board has been to maintain a minimum of three miles between certified schools; not an inconvenient distance for children to walk in a climate like this.  Beyond the chief centres of settlement half time school have been trialled where sufficient pupils can only be found within a radius of six miles.  A half time school has been tried at each end.  The chief drawback is getting qualified men willing to undergo the extra drudgery of walking between the two schools.  SA makes less use of young people as teachers compared with schools in the UK.  There much of the instruction in the lower grades is done by youths, often mere boys, often for little more than the credit of a position which may lead on to something better.  These volunteers make teaching a part of their own education.  Here the average income of Government teachers seems high in relation to what obtains in England or America.  Last year it was £103-13-4.  But there is no discrimination on the value of the product.  Teachers of roadside schools delivering minimal reading, writing and ciphering are paid as well as those delivering the best middle-class education.  We have many excellent teachers who deserve more and scores of poor ones who are drawing men’s wages for boys’ and women’s work.  [The article then goes on to elaborate on the benefits of using youths, with minimal pay for the simpler educational tasks.]

SA has never yet trained a teacher of its own.  All have either been imported or improvised, or like Topsy they have grown fortuitously.
