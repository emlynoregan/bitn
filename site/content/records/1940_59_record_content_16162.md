Rabbit Plague.  Pastoralists are confronted with huge numbers of rabbits and some are distributing poison baits from carts.  Some complain that the phosphorus baits kill birds with consequences in increased insect troubles.  Rock wallabies are also killed.  Others embrace the poison cart as the only solution before rabbits ruin the country.
