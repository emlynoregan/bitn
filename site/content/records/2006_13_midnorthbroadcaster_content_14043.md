Commercial Street

The Burra Community Management Committee is seeking to promote public discussion regarding the Goyder Councilâ€™s plans for a pedestrian refuge in Commercial Street.  The CMC is concerned to promote pedestrian safety in the main street.  The proposal would mean the loss of car parks outside Oppies LGA and would restrict traffic to one lane at the crossing point.  [Plan printed.]
