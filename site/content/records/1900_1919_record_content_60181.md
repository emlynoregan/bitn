Miss Edith Cave was given a farewell from the Cheer-up Hall on Tuesday afternoon 20 May.  She is soon to leave Burra to live in Adelaide.  She will be greatly missed as Secretary of the Burra Women’s Branch of the Liberal Union, Secretary of the Red Cross Soc., an earnest worker for St Mary’s church (with her sister fanny), and has for many years arranged the Burra Hospital Christmas Party for staff and patients.  She was presented with a handbag containing a significant sum of money.
