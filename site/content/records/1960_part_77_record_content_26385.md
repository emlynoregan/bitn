Aberdeen Tennis Club held its AGM 17 September.  In the next season the club will enter one ‘A’ Grade team and two ‘B’ Grade teams (Blue & White).  It will support a move for a junior team.  President R.R. Reed reported on a successful year in which the ‘A’ Grade was narrowly defeated in the grand final and the ‘B’ Grade White team took the premiership.  The club undertook the erection of toilet blocks this year.  Dudley Jacka drew up plans and the work was done by F.M. Pearce & Sons.  The Easter Tournament was a great success.
