A Yellow Triumph Stag Convertible was dumped in the Burra creek early on Friday afternoon by a woman who was arrested shortly afterwards for house breaking and theft.  It had been stolen in Adelaide on Wednesday and its owner was devastated because he had spent years restoring the vehicle to mint condition.  [Photo of the car in the creek near the Caravan Park.]
