Kooringa News, 8 December

Mr Billing has been exhibiting his collection of wild beasts here since 6 December and a great many have availed themselves of the opportunity afforded.  The youngsters have been greatly delighted by the sight of lions and tigers.

Mr C. Todd, Superintendent of Telegraphs, has been inspecting the township to find a site for the telegraph office and other arrangements for the telegraph, which is shortly to be carried on here.  It is hoped that the site will be in some central position.

Business is flat and dull and some of the larger stores are selling at Adelaide prices or less.

A great many drays are still on the road and as many as fifty can be counted in sight at one time in the town.

The weather has been cool; from 84°F on the 2 December and only 64°F on 8 December.
