The Record libel case.

This is reported in great detail.

On 12 September the paper ran an advertisement in which it was suggested that Joseph Cartwright had visited the house of Mrs Alfred Willmott and made improper proposals to her.  Cartwright then sued the Record and Alfred Willmott as defendants in a libel case.  On Monday 8 October the case ran from 11 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and the court was filled in the day and crammed at night.  The defence of The Record contended that the paper’s apology in the next issue was ample for anyone, but ‘a money grabber of the worst kind’. 

Louisa Jane Willmott, wife of Alfred Willmott gave evidence that Joseph Cartwright had called several times at her home while her husband was away.  Cartwright’s wife was a cousin to Alfred Willmott.  The vital day was 7 September when she said he called before she was up and dressed, because she was not feeling very well.  He went away, but later returned when she was dressed and after some conversation had suggested they go into her bedroom and he had placed his hand under her clothes.  She had told him she would not and was not such a d______ fool.  She said she would be telling his wife and had also complained of his behaviour to her sister and mother.  Her children Frank (9) and Mary (7) were present throughout.

The counsel for the plaintiff tried to show her as promiscuous and a habitual liar.

She admitted the marriage had been in difficulties, but said she and her husband were now getting on fairly well.  However, she could not say ‘I have been faithful to my husband altogether.’

Her version of events was supported by the two children and Alice Moore (her sister) and her mother Mrs Lines.

Mr R.G. Nesbit for Mr Davey of the Burra Record gave a long address contending that the apology published and a letter sent to the plaintiff were adequate in the circumstances.

The evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff was an absolute denial that the whole event took place and a denial of ever being to the house.  [Cartwright would scarcely admit knowing which house they lived in, though they had previously been neighbours in East St.]  Much of the evidence sought to show Cartwright’s whereabouts on the day in question to account for his movements and to show he could not have been at Mrs Willmott’s house.  His reasons for going to the saleyards near the Burra Hotel seemed a bit thin, but a number of respectable witnesses saw him there and/or spoke to him.

After the evidence was presented there were long addresses by both Counsels and the bench adjourned.  When the court reassembled the SM reviewed the evidence and said the court was unanimous in fixing damages at £50 against Willmott and the Record.
