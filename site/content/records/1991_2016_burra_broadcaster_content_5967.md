BCS.  Rolling stoppages in SA schools by the SA Institute of Teachers were a response to cutbacks in the State Government’s education arena.  BCS was affected with a stoppage from 2-3 p.m. on Tuesday 14 March.  For Burra a major cutback was the reduction of 30 hours of the student service officer’s time – time which had to be made up by teaching staff.
