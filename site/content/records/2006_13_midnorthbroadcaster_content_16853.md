This 15 day mountain bike adventure left Adelaide on Saturday 11 May and will tour the Flinders Ranges along the full length of the Mawson Trail, ending in Blinman on 24 May.  More than 140 cyclists completed an 87 kilometre ride from Riverton to Burra yesterday as part of the 900 km Bike SA Outback Odyssey.  Most participants come from interstate and overseas.  They and their support crews went to the Burra Oval to camp overnight where they were catered for by BBH Football and Netball Club and BCS.
