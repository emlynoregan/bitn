Redruth Court.

The Richards case is reported in great detail over 4 columns.  Richards presented some contradictory evidence and did not have the evidence of Mr Reed to corroborate part of his story, but he seems to have been a bit unlucky.  Costs were not awarded to the Corporation because the culvert cover should not have been left off.
