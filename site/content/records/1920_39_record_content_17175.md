Editorial: Welcome ‘Back to Burra’

This piece is a general effusive welcome for old friends, but within it are some historical references of interest.

‘You will miss the great block of buildings which enclosed the smelting furnaces, but the grand old chimney still nobly stands and will do so for untold centuries against all wind and weather unless deliberately felled.’

For the most part it is slightly purple prose.

‘Back to Burra’ got off to an auspicious start with the arrival of the Broken Hill Express from the north on Friday morning.  Visitors were greeted by a fleet of cars and motored to their place of abode.  They drove under a welcoming arch at the station gate and there was another at the Institute.  Streets were dressed in bunting and shops dressed in greenery and flags.  Thereafter a reception committee greeted each train.  There was another decorated arch at Lewis’s bridge.

On Saturday after lunch crowds gathered to see the monster procession that preceded the sports carnival at Victoria Park.  It was due to depart at 1.30 p.m. and surprised many in Kooringa by reaching the post office by 1.50 p.m., announced by the strains of the Foo Foo Brass Band.  George Hann & Cr Stanley Kellaway had been very effective marshals.

[A listing of individuals of note and their costumes then follows.]

High School girls in tennis costumes filled a car and Burra Serenaders all in fancy dress occupied a lorry.  [They are also named.]

The mine bogey [jinker], which 62 years ago brought the big engine to the mine, was a feature.  S. Kellaway and Wally Lee organised its resuscitation after 45 years in the Mine Stores.  Its 60 bullocks and 6 bullockies were replaced for the occasion by a tractor driven by W. Lee.  Fully 100 cars must have taken part.

The sports day then followed at Victoria Park.  The newly refurbished sports track proved a great success.  The gate takings were £60.  [Results are printed.]

In the evening a successful social was held in the Redruth Memorial Hall and at Kooringa the Salvation Army Peterborough Band gave an excellent band concert in the Army Hall, while in the Institute a splendid picture program was screened to a crowded audience.
