Historic Photograph Display

About 70 people attended the opening of the display of historic Burra photographs in the Burra Town Hall supper room on the afternoon of 10 December.  The display has been set up by the Burra History Group as a permanent feature of the Town Hall.  The photos are for sale.  Eric Fuss was acknowledged for researching and writing the stories and captions for the photos.  The exhibition was opened by Nancy Pearce, who donated several of the pictures and whose great grandparents settled in Burra in 1848.  She spoke of the Burra she knew as a young child â€“ of floods and dust storms and the old swing bridge and of cattle being driven down Chapel Street to the slaughterhouse at the end of Ayers Street.  President of the History Group, Meredith Satchell thanked those private individuals who had loaned photographs to be copied for display or had sponsored the frames.
