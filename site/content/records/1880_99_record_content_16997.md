Street Trees. [A ½ column revealing F.W. Holder’s continuing interest.]

The trees planted last season are doing reasonably well.  Welsh Place looks very promising.

Also in Paradise, Kingston St, by the bridge, and in Chapel St they are doing well.

Aberdeen and Redruth Reserves are looking promising, as is the plot behind Mr Bartholomæus’ store.

Many street trees are doing well, especially the road from Kingston St corner to the Recreation Ground.

Some attention is needed to replanting and staking, but overall we have no reason to regret the expenditure.
