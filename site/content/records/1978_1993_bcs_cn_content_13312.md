Burra Hospital seems likely to be affected by Government plans to reduce obstetric and neonatal services in country hospitals.  A discussion paper presented by Dr S. Britton on behalf of a steering committee has suggested this and it would see these services transferred to Clare Hospital.   Many of the statistics in the paper have been manipulated to this end.  This move could be a forerunner to the loss of acute care, emergency services and surgery.  Burra Hospital would then be little more than a nursing home with resultant loss of skilled staff and doctors.  If you are concerned at this prospect the time to react is now.  The Board of Management wishes to ensure that all existing services are maintained.  Copies of Dr Brittonâ€™s report can be seen at the Hospital, the Council Office and the Community Library.  Submissions or letters should be sent to Dr S. Britton, the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition or the Minister of Health.
