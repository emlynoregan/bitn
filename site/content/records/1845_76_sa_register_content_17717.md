Kooringa News, 18 August

Miners are still leaving for Moonta and Wallaroo, as the mine here is yielding poor wages.

Mr Novis who used to supply Burra with fish from the Murray has taken over the refreshment house at Booborowie and is likely to do well given is well-known character for cleanliness.

The stock of one of the retailers here was sold by auction last week.  Mr T. Box was auctioneer and the sale continued all week.

The sheep farmers are somewhat excited by the revaluation of leases.  The sale of Mt Bryan is likely to test how far they will be depreciated.
