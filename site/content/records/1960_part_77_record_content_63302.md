The meeting requests the Council to organise its affairs this year to enable a reduction in rates next year.

This meeting appoints a deputation through our local MP to the Minister of Roads and our local Federal Member in an effort to achieve an increase in grants to the Burra Burra DC.

Legal advice was that nothing could be done about the increase in the rate from 0.9 to 1.4 cents in the dollar.
