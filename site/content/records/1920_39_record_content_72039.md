Burra Town Council, 15 August

Council approved a rate increase of 8d in the £ to bring the rate to 3/2 in the £.

No letter has been received from the Institute asking for financial help.  Cr Dow said the ratepayers had refused to allow £400 to be raised by debentures, so this was the only way left.  During the course of the year Council had to pay off its overdraft and meet normal commitments.  He moved the rate be 3/2 and was seconded by Cr Samuel.

The Town Clerk said that probably there would still be a deficit of £128 at the year’s end.

Cr Lott raised the question of the swimming pool.

The Mayor said perhaps the pool would not be built.

Cr Dow wondered what the Government would do if it were not built.

Cr Dow said the rates could not be collected before 28 February 1939.  [Under normal conditions.]

With the Council nearing its overdraft limit of £700 he moved the rates be collected within 21 days as allowed for under the Local Government Act.  Passed.

Cr Jeffery said they would have to be very careful to reduce the overdraft.

Cr Lott said the state of affairs was the aftermath of 2-3 years ago.
