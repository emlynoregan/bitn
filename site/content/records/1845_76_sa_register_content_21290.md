Kooringa News, 23 October

Inquest/Obituary.  Mr Isaac Turner, a resident of Glendore was near his home with his son William on Tuesday 22 October.  He asked William to fetch the horses and when his son asked if he should also fetch the colt his father fell down before he could reply.  When asked he was able to move his eyes, but could not speak and almost immediately died.  He had often complained of illness and a medical man who saw the corpse said he had died from heart disease. He leaves a widow and a large family insufficiently provided for.  An inquest was held this morning before T.S. Potter JP and the verdict was ‘Died by the visitation of God.’

[Isaac Turner died 22 October 1867 Black Springs aged 42.]
