Sunday Sport

Following the recent Council decision not to allow cricket on Victoria Park on a Sunday the Record searched its files and found a report on 27 February 1940 of a Council meeting on 19 February 1940 in which the Council decided that an application for occasional Sunday Cricket at Victoria Park was approved provided play ceased by 5.30 p.m.  We can find no motion rescinding this decision and believe it still stands good.  Quite a large section of the community is of the view that banning play on Sundays is a narrow attitude.  Most towns in Australia allow it and we know of no harm resulting.  Local Government bodies are against organised sport [on Sundays] but few if any have objected to games where no admission is charged.  Sport on Sunday often includes players not considered for the more strenuous weekday matches and improves their physical fitness.  Some cannot get away from work in time for practice for football or cricket and so are barred from Saturday teams.  Most city colleges under the trusteeship of various Protestant and Roman Catholic denominations allow students to play Sunday afternoons.  Of course sport is played in Burra on Sunday, just not on parklands.  The grass tennis courts, which could have been built near the bowling green, were placed at Burra North on the outskirts of the town as players wished to enjoy Sunday games.  Today golf, tennis, cricket and football can be played off parklands.  We wonder if, when vetoing Sunday sport, the Council is carrying out the wishes of the majority or the few.
