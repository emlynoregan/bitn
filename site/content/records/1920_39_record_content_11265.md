Burra Town Council, 16 July 1923.

Advice was received from the Local Government Department that the Baldina to Burra Road and Shafton Road would cease to be main roads.  The Council will object to their removal from the schedule of main roads.

The overseer said he had employed the lad Voumard to light lamps to give the lamplighter H. Wilson time to care for two horses, no one else being available.  The lad had been warned of the danger and had no occasion to light a match near the generator.

Local Board of Health

The ambulance had recently been out without stretchers and a wire stretcher had to be used.  It was also not running too well.  One problem was they could not get anyone to take the responsibility for the ambulance.

Burra Matronâ€™s Dance was held very successfully and is reported in just over one column.

Burra Rifle Club.  On Saturday a shoot was held over 200, 500 & 600 yards.  Best shots were F.W. Lown and S. Cordon.

Burra Show Society.  Mr Winnall resigned from the committee on leaving the town.  Various preparations for the next show were made.  It was decided to increased admission charges for adults from 1/- to 1/6 and to run special trains from Adelaide and Terowie.
