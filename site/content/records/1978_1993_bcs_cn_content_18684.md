Burra Printing Press

Last year the appeal to raise funds for the purchase of the Burra Record printing equipment and other relics saw about $4,200 raised â€“ a shortfall of $1,800.  Recently the Advertiser Newspaper Limited donated $1,800, which has been received on behalf of the town by the National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright to complete this important historical purchase and secure the collection for Burra.  The donation followed a suggestion from Burra resident David Bunney that the Advertiser be approached.  It is hoped some time in the future to set it up and have it working again.  It is certainly a valuable collection.
