Burra Creek

The Goyder Council has approached the Community Management Committee to help manage feedback on the Burra Creek Planning Study.  The task will be undertaken by a sub-committee led by Bruce Stockman.  The initial phase will deal with the area from the Bowling Club Footbridge to the Caravan Park Footbridge.  The aim is to enhance the amenities for recreation and enjoyment of the local environment.  It is also intended to reduce the cost of the present arrangements.

At present the operation of two bores costs $50,000 annually.  Of this about $10,000 is spent on servicing the pumps due to poor water quality.  368 million litres of water is provided, but it appears that the creek lies on a gravel bed and a fault line, which causes a high loss of this water back into the aquifer.  The present withdrawal rate is unsustainable.  The west bank in particular needs further development to render it usable by visitors and the community.  Ideas being considered include:

The lining of the creek with clay or an environmental liner to reduce water loss.

Combined walking/cycling paths for both sides of the creek.

A new recreation area on the west bank below the Town Hall car park.

Management of the weed/reed growth to provide bird habitat, but without choking the creek.

Planting with appropriate native trees and shrubs.

A prohibition of vehicular access to the banks to prevent compaction of soil and so extend the area of useful park.

A reduction in the area of the current water feature to reduce the cost of maintenance.
