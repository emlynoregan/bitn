[Additional note.  Neither Miss Lucy Webb nor Rev. John Devenport in St Mary’s Burra – The First 150 Years mentions that in about September 1881 Rev. Howitt was given twelve months leave of absence for health reasons.  He seems to have visited England and was expected back in September 1882.  Rev. F. Richmond was appointed to fill the vacancy, but he transferred to Maitland in January 1882, to be replaced by Rev. W. Marshall, who seems, from the Burra Record, to have been engaged until September 1882.  Rev. Howitt arrived back earlier than expected in late April 1882.  Rev. Marshall was compensated with a payment of £40 from the church and a further £60 collected from the congregation.  He went to Quorn.]
