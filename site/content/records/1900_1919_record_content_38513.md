Burra Institute, 13 July.

G.E. Dane reported on the production of Messiah on 10 July in the Institute.  71 voices in the choral class and 26 instrumentalists with 7 principals from Adelaide.  It was an artistic and financial success.  Every seat was reserved and hundreds turned away at the door.

Thanks were extended to Norman Pearce and R. Fuss for attending to platform additions etc. and to A.J. McBride for a loan of a motor car and E.J. Harris for horses, trolly and men.  J. Drew lent furniture and P. Milner acted as secretary and attended to details and A.A. Davey was caretaker.

The performance was favourable reported by the critic in The Mail 13 June 1914.
