Political Meeting at Burra

Mr W.R. Ridgway chaired a meeting of some 300 electors at the Burra Hotel on 28 January.

Mr Rowland Rees was welcomed and addressed the gathering.  On education he supported payment by results and secularity.  He would compromise on free education and support a small fee for those able to afford it.  He would support a Bill to make education compulsory and would support legalising trades unions.  He was in favour of opening more of the land to the east of Burra for cultivation.  On the question of railways, he favoured a line from Farrell’s Flat to Jamestown as it would go through the centre of an agricultural district.  He also favoured a line to the Barrier Ranges and one north from Port Augusta.  He favoured free trade in conjunction with NSW & Queensland, consolidation of the Real Property Act, extension of the jurisdiction of the Local Court and the payment of MPs.

W.B. Rounsevell was greeted with both cheers and disapprobation.  He said he supported making larger areas of agricultural land available at £1 per acre.  He considered immigration very necessary.  He supported light and cheap railways, including an extension of the Pt Pirie line and construction of a feeding line to the Burra Trunk Railway.  Primary education should be free, secular and compulsory.  He favoured consolidation of the Real Property Act and would vote for stamp, legacy and succession duties.  He supported free trade as far as possible, but was opposed to payment of MPs.

A vote declaring Mr Rees a fit representative was carried by a large majority. Votes for and against Mr Rounsevell were about equal.
