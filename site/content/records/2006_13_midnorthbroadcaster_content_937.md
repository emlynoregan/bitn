Advertorial on Bullrush Country Clothing store.  Proprietors are Kerry Mosey and Richard Nicholls, who have opened a new headquarters for the company in Burraâ€™s main street.  Ms Mosey started the company in Adelaide in 1994 and they have now a Burra store and one about four times the size in Hamilton.  It has a strong mail order and website trade.  The official Burra opening will be this coming Friday.  [Photo.]
