Obituary.  Ellen Dixon died 25 April.  She was the mother of Jack (Hanson), Gladys (Prospect) , Albert (Bowmans) and Oliver (Melbourne).  [Born Ellen White, she married William Thomas Dixon in 1891.  The birth is not certain from the evidence available, as ages cited do not accord, but perhaps born at Pewsey Vale 13 September 1861.]
