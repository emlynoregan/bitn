RSL Burra Sub-Branch AGM was held 22 January.  The President H.J.B. Jennison reported a slight increase in membership for the year, but regretted the loss of Mr Sexton the Treasurer and past President who had left the district in very poor health.  W. Pickering had taken over as Treasurer.  The Anzac Sports were a wonderful success and the financial results were splendid.  The branch was in a sound financial position.  This yearâ€™s Anzac Service was very largely attended.  It was resolved to hold Anzac Sports on 27 April 1935.  Elected were President, W.F. Pickering; Vice-Presidents T.J. Canny & J.H. Murison; Secretary, G.H. Dow & Treasurer, W. Anderson.
