Obituary/Inquest

On Wednesday afternoon Mr McDermott held an inquest at the Pig & Whistle into the death of a young man named Joseph Rowe who had died the previous day as the result of an accident sustained last week at the racecourse.

Dr T.H. Mayne:

Was called to see the deceased on 1 January at the racecourse.  He was suffering from a severe concussion of the brain.  Believed then it could proved fatal and attended him up to his death yesterday.  The concussion was caused from a fall from a horse.  Deceased was not sober at the time.  The external signs of injury were slight, but the concussion was the immediate cause of death.  Deceased had not regained consciousness since the accident.

John Edwards:

Had been drinking with friends at the Racecourse Inn [Lostwithiel] and was returning across the course when the deceased and some friends on horses intersected their path.  The two groups narrowly avoided a collision and when I looked back deceased and his horse were lying on the ground together.  The horse was on top of the man.  Stopped to render assistance.  Thought the man was drunk and unable to control his horse.  Had earlier seen him nearly run over a woman and child.  When the doctor came the body was removed in a cart and had not seen it since.

William Killicoat:

Had been with deceased until 10 minutes before the accident.  At the time of the accident was near the winning post and seeing the crowd, went and found the deceased lying on the ground with the horse on top of him.  There was no one then within 50 yards.  Got the horse off deceased and Mr Edwards arrived and assisted.  They got deceased into a sitting position, but he was quite insensible.  The doctor soon arrived and deceased was taken away in a cart.  Deceased was not drunk, having had only a glass or two of ale.

Edwards was recalled and satisfactorily explained discrepancies in the evidence.  He had tried to move the horse before Killicoat’s arrival.

William Teague, who had been with Edwards, gave corroborative evidence.

Edwards explained that Rowe’s own party did not immediately know he had fallen as he was riding last in their group.

The coroner was satisfied that there seemed no doubt as to the cause of death and the jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased died from the effects of a fall from a horse, producing concussion of the brain, on the racecourse.’

[Joseph Rowe died 8 January 1861, Kooringa aged 25.]
