Dr Sangster’s Farewell.  There was a good attendance at the Institute on Monday afternoon to witness the presentation of a gold watch to the departing doctor.  The Mayor S. Burns presided.  The Town Clerk Mr R.H. Steele read a draft of the letter from the Burra Town Council and there was a long list of speakers including: Mr T. Mc Waters (for the Burra DC), Mr J. McDonald (for the Booborowie DC), Mr F. Treloar (for the Hanson DC) & Mr W.G. Hawkes (for the Apoinga DC).  Dr Sangster had been medical officer for all the Councils.  In the absence of the Chairman Mr Winnall represented the Burra Hospital Board, F.T. Harcus (Burra Institute), C.J. Pearce (The Rechabites), W.J. Davey (The AOF), F. Treloar (MUIOOF), Cr C.S. Lane (Burra Musical & Dramatic Club), Mr Gebhardt (Burra Automobile Club), L.A. Lewis (Burra Racing Club), Rev. H.L. Ebbs (The Anglican Church) and various personal friends all spoke.    The Mayor then made the presentation of a gold watch and chain.  Dr Sangster replied saying he was leaving for two main reasons: to be better able to keep an eye on his sons when their time came to go to school and he wanted to rub shoulders with other medical men with a view to making further progress in his profession.

A public welcome was then accorded Dr Caw who is taking over Dr Sangster’s practice.
