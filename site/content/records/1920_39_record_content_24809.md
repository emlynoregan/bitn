Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club, 8 November

Mr A. Smith elected secretary to replace Mr G. Pattullo who retired due to pressure of business.  The catering tender went to C.M. Pratt.  Iron and timber has been bought to provide accommodation for catering and to house the boats in winter.  Arrangements have been made to get timber for a larger and more substantial jetty and 50ft for seating.  People have been enjoying the lake in the last two or three weeks with the water clear and free from weeds.  The swing has been erected.
