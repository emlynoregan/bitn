This was one of the worst years in SA.  For most of the state it was the driest year on record.  In the pastoral country many stations have had to be abandoned and the winds accompanying the dry conditions have resulted in sand and dust storms that have killed and buried the bush.  Heavy monsoonal rains on 26 December broke the dry spell.  Christmas Day was hot, dusty and boisterous, but rain on the 26th was heavy with one shower alone bringing 40 points.  On 27 December 75 points fell in half an hour and news from the northeast country began coming in with reports of falls higher than in Burra.  Two flood waves came down the Burra Creek and its tributaries for the first time in two or three years.  The racecourse was completely submerged.  J. Allen, mail contractor, returned last Sunday 5 January and said some of the watercourses had been running until Saturday and there were miles and miles of water lying about in some places 6ft deep.  He thinks it will be a couple of weeks before a normal mail run with motor vehicles will be possible.  Aldeman’s, The Lagoon and Sturt Vale are cut off and mail could only be delivered by buggy.  Whether this is a real breaking of the drought will depend on follow-up rains.  Annuals will now come on, but perennials like salt, blue and black bushes will take two to three years to recover.  We understand that standing wheat was little damaged
