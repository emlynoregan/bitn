‘A Wanderer’ writes: ‘It is a well known fact that what is wanted is the removal of the barrier which prevents labour having access to the land, and the only thing which would in any way benefit the industrious poor.’

Following a death from typhoid in Burra he says ‘a stricter supervision is required, as dead fowls are constantly thrown into the small creek near the bridge in Thames-street, along with heaps of other refuse, some of which has been covered over with a little dirt, but the wind and rain again exposes the corrupt matter to view and at times the stench is sickening. We know that typhoid is dangerous.’
