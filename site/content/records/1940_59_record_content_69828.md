Advertiser Tour Bicycle Race

This passed through Burra on Saturday.  Under present conditions 20-30 riders and a few officials arrive late on Saturday and all have left by 9.15 a.m. next morning.  Compare this with the hundred or so riders, trainers, followers and officials that used to be here for a day or two prior to the start of the Burra-Adelaide Cycling Classic of the past.  On Saturday mornings the departures of men from the limit men to those on scratch were spread over an hour to an hour and a half and drew a large interested crowd.  Has Burra now been deprived of these happy occasions?  We hope not.
