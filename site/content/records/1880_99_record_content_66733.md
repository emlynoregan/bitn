AO Foresters Court Unity Lodge No. 3015 celebrated its 40th birthday with a social at the Kooringa Hotel on Friday evening.  Numbers exceeded capacity and many had to wait their turn to sit down.  Toasts and speeches in plenty.  Mr C. Fuss proposed ‘Forestry with success to Court Unity’.  He said forestry was in existence in 1847 – one present, Mr J.M. Hunt, had joined Court Perseverance in Adelaide in that year.  In 1899 the lodge in SA had 70,000 members and a capital of over £90,000.  Vice Chairman, W.J. Davey said Court Unity had started on 11 August 1859 at the Court House in Redruth, before moving later to the Institute.  The first meeting had 20 members.  Still living from then were H. Nankervis (Father of the landlord of the Burra Hotel), Mr Davis (Father of Thomas Davis of Aberdeen), John Clements (of Cobar NSW), Evan Jones (of Spalding) & Robert Bevan (of Redruth).  Other early associates were J. Sampson (the present Mayor, though absent due to ill health), James Prior, William Prior, R. Collins, R. Hoare, J.R. Gray, C.B Griffiths & D. Wells.  In the first ten years growth was very slow with only ten new members and funds reaching £95.  After 20 years there were 44 more to make 74 in all with funds of £233.  From 1879 growth was more rapid and the 30th anniversary saw 135 members with £738.  Membership was now 187 with £1,529.

The Juvenile Court – Court Pride of Burra – was a valuable source of members.

The toasts and speeches were supplemented with songs and Bro. A.B. Hiddle delighted the audience with several musical selections on the gramophone.  The Burra Orchestra also attended.
