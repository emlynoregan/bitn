Floodwaters from the property of D.H. Adams and properties to the west caused a large volume of water to cross the bitumen road about 150 yards north of Mr Adamâ€™s home on Saturday evening.  A large bank of sand and silt was deposited across the road.  Mr Adams and Mr Colin Pfitzner hauled a number of cars out with a tractor until Constable P. Logan closed the road.  At 9 a.m. Sunday the Council grader cleared the obstruction and the road, though still flooded, was re-opened.  Floodwaters also crossed the road from Coghill Creek near the town where two and a half feet of water stopped traffic for many hours.  Other district roads have been damaged.
