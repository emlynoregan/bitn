St Joseph’s Convent.  Laying of the Foundation Stone for the New Wing

The accommodation for the sisters of Mercy has for many years been very inadequate and the Bishop of the Diocese Rt Rev. Dr Killian noticed this and it was decided to add to their building.  The foundation stone was laid on 31 July.  The visitors taxed the church’s accommodation for mass at 11 a.m. after which the congregation and other visitors including the contractors T. Woollacott & Sons went to the convent where the schoolchildren formed a guard of honour for Dr Killian.  The stone was laid and blessed and the party moved to the shelter of the verandah due to the high wind.

Fr Nesdale welcomed the Bishop.

The convent presently was of four small rooms, one of which was a music room for students.  Of the three remaining only one had a fireplace and this had been the case for 45 years without complaint.  The parish debt had been reduced enough to enable the improvement to be contemplated.  The Burra congregation comprised 50 families.  The tender to Mr Woollacott was for two rooms, bathroom and septic tank for £613-8-0 which with furnishing would be c. £650.  Frank Neagle had drawn up the plans and specifications.

The Bishop said that allowing work to start on such an expensive building without significant money in hand was unusual, but it was necessary this time.
