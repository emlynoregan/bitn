40 people attended a meeting at Mt Bryan to discuss the location of the station. It was moved that its location revert to the original decision; i.e. Sec. 75. An amendment moved that it be at the travelling stock road. After discussion the amendment was lost 12 to 24 and the motion passed 22 to 12. A memorial reflecting this has been sent to the government.
