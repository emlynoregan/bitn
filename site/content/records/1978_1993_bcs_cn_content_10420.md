A submission has been made to the Burra Burra DC for the acquisition of the cottage, smoke house and stables on Kotz Estate, with a view to ultimately adding it to the key hire system.  The building shows materials and techniques of the 1850s.  Present indications are that the Copper Interpretive centre will now be built on the Mine Site and the Bon Accord will revert to National Trust ownership with $30,000 of J150 money to be spent on its buildings.
