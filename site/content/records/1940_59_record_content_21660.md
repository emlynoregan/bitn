Burra Stud Rams.  About 70 stud rams were loaded onto a train for transport to the Sydney Ram Sales on Wednesday.  They came from a number of properties, with the biggest quotas from North Bungaree (19) and Koonoona (18).  Mr Keith McBride is in charge of the rams on their five day journey and will have to find his own eating and sleeping arrangements en route as well as attending to the watering and feeding of the rams.
