Letter.  Peter Opperman, President and David Hill, Secretary-Treasurer of Burra Cricket Club write to inform the public that the club may not field a cricket team this year because at present only seven players are willing to commit to playing every Saturday.  About 15 are needed to make the team viable.  Burra has one of the best ovals and best facilities in the Belalie-Mokota Association.  The Club will hold a meeting at Burra Hotel on Monday 13 September at 8 p.m.  Please attend to ensure the future of the club.
