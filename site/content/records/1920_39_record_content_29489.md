Burra Local Court, 14 January

Following the accident at the Burra Railway Station on 17 November 1928 when C. Attrill drove his bus into the corner of the building severely injuring himself and less severely several passengers, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.

M.G. Dobson gave evidence of the trip to the station starting from the Commercial Hotel.  At the vicinity of the post office they stopped and the four present consumed two bottles of beer and another was opened at the Royal Exchange.  He couldn’t say if Attrill drank any there or at the Bon Accord where they also stopped, but they then drove to the station on the bottom road with one wheel on the footpath at 25-30 m.p.h.  Dobson did not notice Attrill to be drunk and did not change his opinion later.  It was not customary to approach the station on this road.  The footpath was on the right hand side.

F.C. Waddy also said the driver seemed sober.  But a statement he signed on 18 November was different.  The defence objected to its use as evidence.

The police then changed the charge to negligent driving which he pleaded guilty to.

There had been a previous conviction and Sgt McDonald pointed out that the maximum penalty was £50.  Mr Daly urged that the licence not be cancelled because it was Attrill’s means of livelihood.

He was fined £50 plus £5-7-6 costs or three months and have his licence cancelled and be barred from getting one for 12 months.  The fine to be paid in instalment of £10 per month.

Mr Daly asked for a stay of proceedings for 21 days to allow for an appeal in regard to the licence.
