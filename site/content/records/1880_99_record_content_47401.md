Burra Town Council, 6 November

The Mayor reported that the Bon Accord Bridge would be completed on 23 November.

He read his annual report.

Mr Harvey, for St Mary’s, applied to use the oval on 30 November.  Granted.

United Friendly Societies were granted use of the oval for 26 December.

A committee was appointed to arrange the opening of the Bon Accord Bridge.

Mayor’s Report 1892

Extensive reduction in the bonded debt has limited spending this year, but nevertheless good work has been done.

The year began with the general account in credit £66-1-7

Main income was from rates	£465-18-10

Government subsidy	£115-10-3

Plus others to total	£708-15-6

Expenditure

Bond redeemed	£200-0-0

Public Works		£239-4-5

Cash in bank		£147-1-9

Bonded debt

Burra Oval: £600 of the £700 bond issued 1 April 1882 has been redeemed.

Public Works bonded debt (including the town survey £400) was £1,800, of which £800 has been redeemed.

Parklands have a £100 bond.

The debts have severely limited expenditure and forced rigid economy and unfortunately have limited the ability to employ labour in times of unemployment.  The debt is however decreasing and will hopefully be extinguished in four years.

The assessment this year increased by £95-2-9 due to new buildings in the town.  Some ratepayers are saying it should be reduced on other buildings due to age and dilapidation.

Ward expenditure

North Ward expenditure was	£79-6-8

Of which main items were:	Moorhead [sic] St	£14-19-6

Repair & gravelling footpaths	£18-16-0

Fore St	£8-8-0

Hampton Rd	£6-6-0

East Ward expenditure was 		£75-5-7

Of which main items were:	Thames St	£13-4-7

Bridge St bridge repairs	£8-10-1

Smelts Rd	£6-2-6

Lamps	£6-2-6

West Ward expenditure was		£89-3-1

Of which main items were:	Chapel St	£10-4-3

Kangaroo St	£12-9-3

Kooringa-Aberdeen footpath	£33-2-5

Half the cost of Lower Thames St	£5-16-11

Parklands

A £100 bond was redeemed.  Rates income was £118-4-1 plus £2-19-0 from the oval.
