Burra Town Council, 5 March

Most of the time was spent debating the role and authority of the overseer whose position had just been advertised and also the working conditions of other employees.

Cr Woollacott said he had been investigating the cost of concrete kerbing and found it would not cost half as much as stone kerbing.

Cr Kellaway said that at the recent fire at Aberdeen the brigade had arrived after some time with one man and a second came later, which was unsatisfactory.

Cr Woollacott said the time from receiving the alarm to arrival was less than five minutes.

The matter will be reported to the Fire Board for information.

Cr Woollacott said it took 12 minutes to get water as they had to go to three plugs before they could make a connection.  This problem will also be referred to the Board.

M.A. Radford wrote about the Council’s inspection of the town.  He refers to the findings concerning North Ward.  They reflected at the time on the actions of past Councillors, but as he points out, North Ward has almost as much area and roads as the other two wards put together and at the same time less revenue than either of them.  East Ward is responsible for Smelts Rd – the worst kept road in the Municipality.  Mr Radford also says that 75% of rates is due to the ward, but in some years this does not happen.  A considerable proportion for some years went to Deadman’s Bridge, which strictly speaking was East Ward work.  Also there is no obligation for Parklands rates or the Board of Health rates to be spent in any particular ward and so Kooringa gets the lion’s share.  Victoria Park takes much of the former and cleaning water tables chiefly in Kooringa takes much of the latter.

‘the new Councillors will soon learn that it is easier to find fault than to rectify faults and that when they have done their best there will be plenty to come and criticise their work.’
