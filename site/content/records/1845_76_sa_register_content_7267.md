Gold in NSW.

Mr Middleton, formerly of Kooringa, writes to his mother from Turon Diggings in NSW, 11 August.

Mr Gordon, I and another person from Adelaide bought a lot of tools from a person who had made £900 in one week.  Hundreds are making money fast, but it is all chance.  Two thirds of the people are walking up and down the river looking for a good spot, which it is hard to find.  Gold can be found everywhere, but in such low concentrations that it does not repay the labour.  We have just cleared our board since arriving here, but hope to get a better place next week.  The tools are spades, picks, crow bars and tin dishes.  Sometimes we have to dig 12 feet deep and wash all the stones and earth we dig out to get the precious stuff.  Gold fetches from £3 to £3-10-0 per ounce.  Provisions are very dear. I have seen a great many here from Burra.  Some stayed only a day before deciding to return.  It is no use coming here without a little money to buy tools to get a start.  Some men are working for 15/- to 20/- a week and board because they lack the capital to buy tools.  I would recommend those in good employment in SA to stay there.  Apart from the chancy nature of the business there are hardships to endure; ‘sleeping under a gum tree, and living on damper and mutton alone, and very often without salt, which is 6d per lb.’

I am told there are places within 30 miles where gold is to be found in great quantities, but the immense influx of water makes it impossible to work there during the winter season.
