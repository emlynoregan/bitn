Burra Town Council.

The Commissioner of Public Works advises the 4” main to and from the reservoir will be replaced by 8”.  It is not yet intended to enlarge the reservoir.  Pipes over the Bon Accord Bridge are to be 2” wrought iron.

The RSL was given permission to take electric wires across the road to their premises.

Electric street lights have been fixed at the National Bank Corner and in the Rotunda as arranged with Messrs Lord Bros. and Humphris.

On Friday morning the Mayor ordered the fire reel to assist at fire at the Drew & Crewes store and believed that but for the reel both the wood stacks and the store would have gone: the posts on the northern approaches to the Bon Accord Bridge had been burnt.

Cr Dare said there should be a fire brigade.

The Town Clerk said he was the secretary and about the only one left of the brigade.  He would endeavour to get some men together.
