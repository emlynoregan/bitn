Income for the year 1891	£596-7-6

Expenditure

Interest	£382-18-0

Other	£299-12-10

Total	£682-10-10

Rates yet to be collected should about balance the account.

The main extension to the supply has been to the Public School from Kingston St.

Unpaid Rates.  Rates have not been paid on about 108 allotments in Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Hampton and Millerton.  Ownership is hard to trace, but action to sell the properties to recover the rates will be needed after securing the necessary legal authority.

Railway Crossing.  Despite repeated requests to the Railway Commissioners we have been unable to secure gates for the Bon Accord crossing.  Action has been promised, but nothing has eventuated.

Trees.  In the town 700 trees were planted this year.  Over 400 were placed in No. 2 Reserve at Redruth and the balance filling gaps around the town.  September’s heavy frost has unfortunately killed many of them.  This work is ongoing and has done much to improve the former barren and uninviting appearance of Burra.

The sanitary condition of the town is good.

The cemetery has a credit of £99-10-9, though regrettably much of this is from interment fees this year.  SAMA has this year granted an extension of a strip 100 feet in width on the south side of the cemetery, now being enclosed in a stone wall.

The main road grant of £300 has been expended to the extent of £298-3-8.

In 1885 the Mayor, John Dunstan Jun., impressed on the Midland Road Board the need for a bridge at the Bon Accord ford, but without success.  This year a numerously signed memorial supported by the Town Council and the Mt Bryan, Hallett, Hanson & Booborowie District Councils (But not the Burra D.C.) was presented to the Hon. Thomas Playford calling for a bridge.  A favourable inspection by the Inspector General of Roads, Mr C.T. Hargreaves, resulted in a vote of £1,500 for the work.  Levels are now being taken and work should begin soon so the northern approach to the town will be much improved.

There was a difference of opinion on the validity of some of the standing orders of the Municipal Corporations Act 1890 and this was referred to the Municipal Association for their advice and opinion.  The committee is still ongoing, but the advice was that the standing orders are sufficient and penalties under them are recoverable in the courts.

[This presumably refers back to the circumstances surrounding attempts earlier in the year to declare Cr Rabbich’s seat vacant.]

Last 20 December a local option poll showed that ratepayers of East and West Wards were in favour of Sunday closing of hotels.

Though not strictly a Council matter, I am pleased to note the formation of a Mounted Infantry Company of some 40 men in the town.

I extend my thanks to the Town Clerk, Mr William Davey, who has fulfilled a difficult task with diligence, integrity and punctuality.

W.H. Hardy writes a letter on the burden of the Corporation rates.

He is pleased that Parliament looks likely soon to allow the ratepayers to choose assessments based on unimproved land value, rather than as present on improved value, which taxes a man more when he improves the town and so is a wet blanket on enterprise.  Even in the main street there are several ‘unsightly cribs . . . which would disgrace a mining camp’ because any improvement would mean higher rates.

Are we forever to place obstacles in the path of improvement?  J.M. McBride and Elder, Smith & Co. have spent much money improving the town and employed many and now must pay the Corporation pretty heavily for doing so.  Meanwhile SAMA are actually increasing their funds as a result of idleness.

Cricket.  Where are the Burra cricketers?
