Burra Races last Wednesday were highly successful.  The course and grounds had been watered and rain the day before eliminated any dust.  Fields were small, but the racing was keen.  The course was in good order.  Gate money was down, but it seems likely that the club will make a profit on its two meetings for the year.  There were seven races, including a hurdles event.  [Results are printed.]
