On Wednesday afternoon the body of John Dolman, farmer of Baldina, was found in Baldina Creek near the ford.  Dolman had set out for Burra with a load of wool and some time later Norman MacLean, who is visiting William Barker of Baldina set out after him to ask him to fetch something back from the town.  He met the wagon a little above the ford, but there was no one in charge.  He stopped the horses, went back to seek Dolman, and found the body.  On informing Mr Barker the latter returned with an employee and at the ford met Harry Vivian of the Commercial Hotel who had gone to meet the Quondong Mail because he had heard the driver was ill.  The police were sent for to collect the body.  The ford was about 15’ high above a rock mass where the body was found.  Deceased was well known, having resided at Baldina near the Douglas Primitive Methodist Church for many years.  He was aged 61.

At the inquest it was stated that the deceased had not taken the direct road to Burra because it was bad, but had detoured to use the ford so Norman MacLean met the wagon instead of having to overtake him.  The wagon track was 12’ from the edge of the ford.  Deceased was blind in his left eye which would have been nearest the fall.  The verdict was accidental death.  [Registered as dying 29 October aged 69.]
