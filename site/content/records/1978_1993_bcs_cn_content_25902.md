Royal Adelaide Show.  Engine Tear Down Competition.

This yearâ€™s team of Daniel Neill and Travis Thamm completed the teardown in a fast time of 4.04, but the engine failed to start and by the time the fault was corrected their overall time put them out of the competition.  The winners were a team from Christian Brothers College.
