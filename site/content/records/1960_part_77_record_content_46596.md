The Footbridge across the Burra Creek near the Bowling Green is expected to be open to pedestrians tomorrow or Thursday.  The old bridge was unsafe and was removed several weeks ago.  Mr Thamm constructed the new bridge, which was placed in position by DC plant units.  It has a 62 ft span.

[It had been closed in April.  See 91, 12 (2), 1 Apr. 1969, page 4.]
