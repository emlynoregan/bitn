Red Cross AGM.

Mrs John Tennant, President, presided.  During wartime all circles are under control of headquarters, with all money to be used for the benefit of sick and wounded soldiers, the establishment of hospitals and the supply of ambulances & equipment etc.  Before was started on 1 September 1939 the membership was 14.  The objective then was to raise money for WWI soldiers, to assist the local hospital and to care for any deserving cases brought to our notice.  We had then £21-7-5 in hand.  When war was declared the money on hand was used to buy materials and wool, to be replaced when funds raised for the war came in.  CWA granted the use of their room for the duration.  A Red Cross Rally and Concert & Button Day and Sale of Stock, together with donations raised £100-3-3.

£200 was later sent to Lady Gowrie Special Appeal after another series of fund-raising events.  On 2 June we opened a special Ambulance Fund and we hope by the end of July to send £500 to headquarters for this purpose.  In 9 months we sent to headquarters £691-0-8 and purchased materials to the value of c. £400.  We have sent parcels away monthly (comprising c. 500 articles).

The VSD has 65 members.  A course of First-Aid and Home Nursing was given by Dr Steele and Matron Robinson.  13 First-Aid Certificates and 7 Home nursing Certificates were issued.  18 members formed the Transport Section and were instructed by W.R. Lee.

Red Cross Election: President, Mrs J. Tennant; Secretary, Mrs E.F. Marston; Assistant Secretary, Mrs R.J. Jeffery; Treasurer, Mrs C.J. Butler.
