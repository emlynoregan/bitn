Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM was held last Thursday and drew a low attendance.  Elected were:

Patron	Rex C. Warnes

President	Graham Kellock

Senior Vice-President	Ron Shipard

Junior Vice-President	Neil Hurst

Secretary	Darrell H. Field

R.E. Mason presented the Presidentâ€™s Report for 1972:

The show was held on 7 October and was opened by the Governor of SA, Sir Mark Oliphant, accompanied by Lady Oliphant.  This was the first activity of the Copper festival weekend and attendance almost doubled that of last year.  The weather was unsettled, with dust at first, but it improved later.  The new sections for pigs and cattle were a success and ring events were popular, as were the dodgem cars at the sideshows.  Sheep shearing was popular too and the Agriculture Pavilion was filled to capacity.  School exhibits were popular and the industrial displays were well patronised.  The wool display was of a high standard, but sheep numbers were very low.  The Flower Pavilion was a picture.
