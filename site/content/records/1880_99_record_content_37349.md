Obituary & Inquest.

Phillip Kemble aged c. 2 drowned in a waterhole at Baldina on 17 July.  [Born Philip Gordon Kemble 11 August 1888.]

Inquest was conducted by W.R. Ridgway JP.

John Kemble, father of deceased:

Waterhole has been there the last 14 years, is some 22 yards from the house and about 4’ deep, containing c. 18” of water.  It has steep banks and is unprotected.  Have 9 children, one besides the deceased under 5.  Wife was ill in bed.  Mary Williams looks after the children while my wife was ill, but also attends to housework.  Mary Williams last saw the child near the waterhole alone c. 3 p.m. and missed him at 4 p.m. when she found the body.  One of the little boys retrieved the body and I carried it to the house.

Frederick Kemble gave evidence of retrieving his brother’s body - had been driving some cattle about 100 yards away.

Verdict was accidental drowning, but the jury added that ‘the parents were censurable for not having the said waterhole protected, it being so near the house and with so many young children in the family.’
