Northern Crops.  Crops north of Burra in the areas of Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett are looking splendid.  Grass on Booborowie Run and other pastoral holdings is also good and the sheep are in fine condition.

Riverton.  The Government refreshment room at the Riverton Station has now been completed and awaits only a tenant.  The building is handsome with bow windows and will doubtless be a great convenience.

Mt Bryan Road.  Following the deputation of 2 October and the subsequent decision by the Central Road Board to spend the whole of the Northern contingent fund on the Mt Bryan Road, great promptness has been shown by the authorities.  Mr Morris the Superintending Surveyor of the Northern District has also acted promptly and the road is now in splendid condition and has carried all the traffic that was detained owing to its state of disrepair.
