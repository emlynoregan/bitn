Ratepayers’ Meeting

About 30 people attended the meeting called by the Burra Burra DC Chairman Cr R.B. Jennison last Wednesday night.  The Council had felt the impact of a slowing inflation rate.  While Government grants for road works are decreasing, the no-strings Federal Grants increased to $45,000 from $20,000 in 1975-76.  Council has budgeted for a planned program of district road works.  Nominated streets in Burra will be reformed and sealed.  Council assisted with the site works at the new Burra Community School and the go-ahead for this $3 million project will stabilise Burra as an important district centre.  The improvements to the Burra Creek in the town in conjunction with the Tourist Promotion Committee, Apex and BCS and the National Trust is another significant project.  We hope drainage problems in the business area will be addressed with funding for the Effluent Drainage Scheme in 1977-78.  Plans are under way to give the district a superior library service.  Council will join in the Pest Plants Control and Vertebrate Pests Act projects.

[The report then lists a number of subjects about which questions were asked, but does not report any answer given.]
