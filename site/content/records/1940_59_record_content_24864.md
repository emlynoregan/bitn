Pte L. Ward said ‘Burra wanted rubbing out and drawing again.  It was alright for the boys when they were going away, but now they were back and the war had been won it appeared as if it cost two bob to say good day to them.  They asked for hospitality and got none.  If it were not for one or two people like the Mayor, fellows would hardly know they were home.’
