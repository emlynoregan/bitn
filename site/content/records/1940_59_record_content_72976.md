James Maxwell Little appeared at Burra Police Court on Friday on assault and shooting charges.  He pleaded not guilty to both.  Inspector Hudson of the Pt Pirie Police said Little had threatened to kill his wife on a number of occasions and had attempted to choke or strangle her.  Fearful of her life, she left him on 4 February this year.  They had been married in 1945 and had four children.  They lived first at Mt Gambier and later at Mt Bryan.  Geovanni Mancini was questioned through an interpreter.  He has been working at Mt Bryan for thirteen months and before that at Burra.  He knew the defendant for about one month.  Little came to his camp on Sunday 13 May and wanted to go rabbit shooting on a farm about sixteen miles away.  On returning from this they passed a farmhouse where Little saw his wife’s car.  He asked Mancini to stop and they waited for about three-quarters of an hour.  When Mrs Little’s car left he told Mancini to follow it to Burra, where he would stop and pay for the petrol.  The rifle used for the rabbits was Mancini’s and was unloaded in the back compartment of the car.  While they were at the Northern Café another car went past [presumably the one they had been following from Mt Bryan] and Little forced Mancini at gun point to follow the car, saying he wanted to talk to his wife.  After passing the car for some distance, Little told Mancini to stop, open the bonnet and hail Mrs Little as she approached.  Mrs Little did not stop and Little then forced Mancini to follow, again at gun point.  After driving at up to 75 m.p.h. they again overtook the other car and Little told Mancini to pull across the road to stop the other car.  Mancini wouldn’t do this and was again threatened.  As they approached a bend Mancini said he heard a shot.  Little had been sitting in the back with the left hand door open.  On hearing the shot Mancini pulled up and the other car kept going.  There was then a scuffle and Mancini grabbed a knife from the front seat and got possession of the rifle, made Little get out of the car and then drove home to Mt Bryan.  When questioned he said he tried to tell people about what had happened, but failed due to his poor English, but the people at the Mt Bryan Hotel asked his to ring the police.
