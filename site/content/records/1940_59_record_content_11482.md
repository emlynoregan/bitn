The Mayor disagreed with the scheme entirely and said he was not prepared to allow the ratepayers to become milking cows.  The war position was too serious to allow the Council to enter any such arrangement at present and he did not see why the State Bank could not reduce the debt and did not think the building worth the amount of debt.  If the Council hung out the Bank would eventually be forced to reduce the debt.  Besides which there might be inflation.

Cr Martin pointed out there could be cheaper money for the scheme from the State Bank, but the Mayor said his own recent experience did not suggest that.

Cr Marston wondered why the Mayor was so opposed now when last year he was so anxious to take over the building on behalf of the Council.

After further discussion it was resolved that the Town Clerk ascertain if permission would be granted to the Council to borrow the money.
