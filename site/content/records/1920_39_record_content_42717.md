Obituary.  John Collins

Last Wednesday we recorded the death of Mrs Collins at the early age of 69 and today we record that of her husband on Saturday last, just five days later.  Pneumonia and the shock of his wife’s death proved too much for him.  He was buried alongside his wife and daughter Hilda who died in April 1931.  He was the second son of the late pioneer pastoralist Mr Henry Collins of ‘Lucernedale’.  After marrying he took up residence for a short time at Mt Bryan East before taking land further east now known as Collinsville where he set about establishing a breed of Merino sheep with the aid of his sons.  They became famous in every state and South Africa.  In 1910 he bought the ram Dandy Dinmont from Haddon Rig stud in NSW for 1,500 gns.  Others followed including Lord Charles of Bundemar for 2,000 gns in 1915.  He acquired a number of other properties on which there are well-built homesteads each with a fruit and vegetable garden.  Collinsville became famous for its fruit and flowers before the recent severe drought and the same can be said of Mulga Hill and Willera.  He was a long-serving member of the Hallett DC and a keen supporter of sports.  His sons were prominent in cricket and tennis.  He was an ardent Methodist and local preacher.  For many years he was a martyr to asthma.  Years ago he was active as local preacher for the Terowie Circuit, preaching at Pandappa and Ketchowla frequently.  He was a member of Kooringa Masonic Lodge and AO Foresters.  Five sons attended the funeral: Horace C.J. Collins (Terowie), Fred. H. Collins (Tooperang), P. Newton Collins (Booborowie), Arthur L. Collins (Mt Bryan) & Lindsay Collins (Collinsville).  Also his son-in-law G.A.M. MacBryan and brothers; Joe, Dan, Eddie and Arthur as well as sisters and numerous others from the Mid-North & City.  [Born 8 July 1859: died 22 July 1932 Mt Bryan.]
