World’s End Creamery.

Yesterday the new creamery at World’s End was opened.  Operations had previously been carried out at F. Duldig’s residence.  Mr Duldig has erected an Alexander’s Cream Separator with a capacity of 200 gallons of milk an hour.  The machinery is driven by an oil engine.  After being measured the milk runs into a large vat and thence through a heater to reach about 86°F and then into another large vat for separation of the milk and cream.  The skimmed milk is carried through the top of the roof by aid of a force pump and taken to a large tank.  The cream is conveyed to a large cellar to be cooled.
