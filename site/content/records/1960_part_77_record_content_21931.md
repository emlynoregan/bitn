Burra Show 1964

The show last Saturday was opened by the Governor Sir Edric Bastyan.  Attendance was about 2,000 and the gate takings were £179, only about £10 below 1963 despite a showery morning and a persistently wet afternoon.  Previous rain meant the grounds were probably the wettest ever underfoot.  Despite this the crowds came and ring events and other activities continued.  The SA Police Band made a small contribution at the opening, but was otherwise prevented from performing by the rain and returned to the city at about 3 p.m.  The Governor opened the show at about 12.45 p.m.  He arrived in the morning and stayed at the Commercial Hotel, due to the changed arrangements because of the weather.  There he was surprised to find himself speaking Arabic with Mr Rasheed.  After the Governor’s speech [which is printed] the band played The Song of Australia and the official party then adjourned for luncheon.  After lunch the Governor toured all the exhibits and watched some of the ring events.

Industrial displays occupied more space than for many years.

Side shows were more numerous, but patronage was quiet due to the rain.

The Schools’ Display was a fine effort and Rural Youth had a display on Bush Fire Prevention.

Young’s Caterers of Melrose did an excellent job with the catering.

The Rural Youth Club organised a dance in the pavilion in the evening and door takings were £22.

[Judges’ comments on each section are then printed.]
