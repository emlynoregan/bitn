Accident.  Mr Bert Wardle was bulldozing rubbish down the slope of the town dump on Saturday morning when the ground gave way beneath his crawler.  The tail of the dozer sank some eight feet with the front still on top.  Bert scrambled out and the nearly lost dozer was retrieved on Sunday morning.  His son Ray showed real courage in climbing down to work the controls as the tow cable took the strain.
