Burns v. Fairchild.

Burns sought £5-5-0, being the balance due on a roller made by him for Fairchild.  This was not a standard order and the machine had to be invented from Fairchild’s description of what he wanted.  He felt he had been grossly overcharged and paid £16-10-0, believing this was sufficient.  The court found for Burns as no doubt now they had a roller as a pattern one could be made very much more cheaply, but the first one produced was not unreasonably much more expensive.
