Work is proceeding very satisfactorily with some good results from recent crushings.

Curlew has had an excellent crushing.

The Central Mine has had a satisfactory crushing.

Wildildie put through 9 tons that averaged about 1½ oz to the ton.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate crushing averaged about 1 oz per ton.
