Hanson Memorial Hall.

It is now some years since there was first agitation for a suitable memorial to the boys from the district who gave their lives in the Great War.  Lack of support caused the abandonment at the time, but of late the need for a hall has been keenly felt and recently Mr Schumacher convened a meeting which decided to build the Hanson Memorial Hall on an enclosed reserve opposite the Council Chamber.  A strawberry fete to raise funds was held on 5 November.  This demonstrated the need for a hall, being held in the open with the Council Chamber used for tea and supper.  Fortunately the weather was excellent.  Â£100 was raised.
