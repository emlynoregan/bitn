The Burra Show will be held on 7 October.

[The article contains the statement:

‘Did you know the first show was held in a walled enclosure in the old smelting works, opposite Johnny Green’s Chimney’

This statement could be misleading. The chimney referred to is the resited Peacock’s Chimney at the Mine Entrance on Market Street.  Johnny Green’s effigy has been place on top of it.  The enclosure referred to is indeed ‘opposite’, but quite some distance away; on the eastern side of Smelts Road.]
