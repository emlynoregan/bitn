Weather.  Burra had a week of wind, hail and snow with falls recorded each day to a total of 134 points.  Thursday was bitterly cold with a heavy fall of hail followed by a light fall of snow in Burra, but heavier falls between Mt Bryan and Hallett, especially on the hills.  The afternoon temperature in Burra was 36°F.  The Burra Creek ran strongly for the fourth time this season and flowed over the Pig and Whistle crossing for the first time in a number of years.  [Photos of the Pig and Whistle crossing and the St Just Street Ford.]

Many district roads are impassable and the Burra-Hallett and the Hanson-Farrell Flat roads are damaged with washaways and potholes.  The main road at Cobb & Co.’s Corner was submerged on Saturday morning and the Clare Farrell Flat road was also under water for some distance.
