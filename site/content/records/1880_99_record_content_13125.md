‘Order’ was outraged by a brass band parading the streets on Sunday like a circus procession.  ‘I must just inform you that it is generally conceded that larrikinism has increased at least twofold since the advent of the Salvation Army at Redruth.’

This ‘obnoxious procession . . . disturbed congregations while they were worshipping in the churches, and upset one Sabbath School at least.  I know that the penalty for this is very severe and means imprisonment.’

Methodist’ from Aberdeen also wrote to complain that the Salvation Army had paraded through Aberdeen and Redruth and disturbed the Sabbath School and again in the evening when it disturbed the Redruth Wesleyan Church Service.  They also marched past the Primitive Methodist Church during anniversary services.

‘I presume to entice the people away.’

The Salvation Army, he says, have done good work and continue to do good, but this sort of action is unjustifiable.  He describes four steeds harnessed to a four-wheeled vehicle bearing men in gold-banded caps playing brass instruments with an inscription on the vehicle: ‘Grand National Circus’.

‘They resemble them too in their tunes which are light, gay, or what you please to call them, for I don’t call them sacred.’
