Burra School is part of an excellent system of State Education in SA.  It is remarkably uniform in the colony despite variations in teachersâ€™ abilities and temperament and training.  Despite this there is sufficient freedom for the teachers to exercise individual preferences and affinities.  True teaching is not aimed at the acquisition of unassimilated knowledge, but rather the teaching of understanding and taking in knowledge that may be used as the basis for future enquiry and deduction.  The training of the state teachers has made the work of the schools thorough and effective.  The children of today are infinitely better off than their parents.  When a child leaves school it can hardly be said to have begun its education, but if rightly and wisely taught it is ready to commence it.
