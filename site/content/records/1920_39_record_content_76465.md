Universal Half-Holiday

A.D. McDonald MP has given notice to amend the Early Closing Act, which would see all establishments under the Act close at 5.30 p.m. weekdays except Friday and at 12.30 p.m. on Saturday s.  It seems certain that other amendments would then make Saturday a universal half-holiday. At present there are only two towns observing the half holiday on another day: Clare and Renmark.  Other towns object to this, and have threatened to push for the cancellation of all shopping districts with shop owners opening at will unless Clare and Renmark fall into line.
