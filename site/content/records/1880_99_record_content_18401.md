D. McNeil declined to fence allotments as ordered by the Council.  Only one of them, he said, belonged to him and he declined to fence that either.

The Mayor was authorised to sign the plan of the portion of Short St sold.

A deputation of ratepayers requested Council to rescind their resolution and not to proceed with the footpath on the eastern side of the road to Aberdeen this year.  This followed a ratepayers’ meeting on Wednesday last.

J. Hosking, Chairman, reported their resolution and was supported by F.W. Holder - other work in East Ward was more important.

P.L. Killicoat also spoke in support - many sheep crossed from east to west and would break it up while fencing it would be expensive.

Mr J. Phillips supported them too - other works were more important and the path on the western side was quite adequate.

Mr Geake also supported the deputation.

The Mayor, John Dunstan jun. said the whole of the ratepayers’ meeting was a storm in a teacup.  It was never intended to keep an extra man on for longer than a fortnight and there was nothing to rescind.  The motion merely said the work should be done and to make this operative another motion would be necessary.

Cr Ridgway said SAMA would have to fence the frontage to the road.

The Mayor said their wishes re the further work on the footpath would receive the consideration it merited.  He had also received a requisition that the work proceed, based on the need to provide unemployment relief and to give a proper and safe approach to Kooringa.

[The petition was signed by William West as agent for SAMA and contained 42 other names.  The paper says that the reading of these names caused amusement and since few if any of them seem to be those of prominent citizens I suspect they were those of SAMA tenants probably from places like Paxton Square.]

Mr Holder said the council had shown its determination to proceed in the matter with three separate motions and he did not feel the deputation was in the sort of false position suggested by the Mayor.  They were obliged for the counter-petition, which demonstrated the weakness of the side it was meant to serve.

The Mayor said that in the event of the footpath in question being completed he intended taking the matter of fencing and planting into his own hands and would hand it over to the ratepayers free of cost.
