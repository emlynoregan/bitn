Hallett Electricity.  The supply has been rather erratic in recent weeks and on 10 March the engine finally gave up.  Mr R. Nutt came to the rescue with his tractor to give power for a few hours in the morning and from 7 to 11 at night.  Hallett had a meeting on Thursday to try to solve the problem, but Hallett cannot get ETSA power until Burra takes power from the Trust.  Mr Nutt has had to reclaim his tractor for farm work, but Mr John Murray came forward with a tractor. The old engine meanwhile has been sent to Adelaide where ETSA will overhaul it in the hope it can be kept going until Trust lines reach the town.
