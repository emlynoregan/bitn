Burra Red Cross Centenary

A small crowd witnessed the unveiling of a commemorative plaque in the Burra Red Cross Centenary Rose Garden on Tuesday 21 September by Hon. Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP.  Burra Red Cross President, Pat Kakoschke welcomed those present and recounted a brief history of the branch.  There were only seven Red Cross branches in SA that will turn 100 this year, with 100 years of continuous service.  The first Australian branch of Red Cross was instigated by the wife of the Governor General, Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, in Melbourne on 13 August 1914 – war having been declared on the 4th.  Within two to three weeks a number of branches had been established across SA, including the one in Burra.  Red Cross quickly got health services to the front, including hospital equipment, often moving more quickly than the government bureaucracy.  The role of the Red Cross continues today – for example in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  [3 photos.]
