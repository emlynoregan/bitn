Kooringa News, 17 December

Burtonâ€™s Circus played two nights to very fair houses.

Last week a mob of sheep belonging to Messrs Rochfort & Fisher, in endeavouring to pass some belonging to Mr Burkitt, had to go through a piece of ground where the poisonous plant still flourishes and about 80 died from its effects.

A cart containing Mr Bruse, Mr H. Bruse, three children and Mr A. Thomas toppled over last week when the horse plunged after a wild Irishman drove the shafts of his cart into it.  Luckily no bones were broken and the extent of the damage was a few bruises.
