E.R. Davey, Town Clerk, produced a 1⅔-column letter on the town’s electricity supply.

On 23 November 1937 the Town Council entered into an agreement with the Burra Electric Supply Co. [BESC] to supply electricity to the town for 15 years.  This expired in November 1952.  Negotiations began in July 1952 to extend the agreement, but no agreement has been reached.  Four conferences have been held between the Company and the Council and one that included Mr R.H.M. Lea, Chairman of ETSA.  When negotiations began the Council had applied to ETSA to be included in their scheme for the electrification of the Northern Areas.  Mr Lea had asked for certain details to be obtained from the local Company, which they had refused to supply.  In October 1952 ETSA advised that it hoped to be able to connect Burra with a transmission line in about 2 years.  Work of national importance has since lengthened this period.  [Connection of Radium Hill to the grid.]  ETSA then spoke to the local Company and undertook to provide a diesel plant to maintain supply if it were needed.

BESC said it was in a position to meet demand for the next seven years.  ETSA so advised the Council, saying that BESC must have a large reserve of plant if they expect to meet all load demands for a further seven years.  The Secretary to the Premier wrote to Mr Hawker MP saying that it sounded likely that a seven year extension of their agreement would require BESC to obtain additional plant and from a State government point of view such an acquisition would be undesirable, as ETSA had a spare diesel plant available and would be in a position to supply power from its mains in about two years.

Council is prepared to extend the franchise for two years and BESC will not accept an agreement for less than seven, saying they need such a period for planning and the uncertainty effect on staff.  Negotiations were deadlocked at 28 November 1952 when BESC sought a three-way conference, which took place on 8 January 1953.

Mr Lea reiterated the two-year time frame and the offer to supply plant from ETSA.  In an emergency ETSA could supply material for the line from Waterloo, if the Council and/or the Company would provide the labour.  Council thought it better to await ETSA construction in two years.  The community appreciates the service given by BESC since 1923.  [Sic: supply actually began Thursday 27 March 1924.]  However, Council is desirous of safeguarding the future supply so that when ETSA power arrives all will be in order.

This article was written to advise ratepayers of the position and to squash any rumours that may be circulating relating to this matter.
