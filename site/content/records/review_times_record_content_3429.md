Paxton Square Cottage Fire

Fire gutted three of the Paxton Square cottages last Sunday.  Arson is suspected.  The fire will not affect this weekend’s Jubilee 150 Heritage Town opening, as the two rows of cottages restored for tourist accommodation were not damaged.  Detective I. Humby of Pt Pirie CIB said the fire probably started in cottage No. 29 which was the worst damaged.  It seems likely that someone lit a mattress there.  Detective Humby said that no long-term damage would result, as the fire was confined to the wooden shingle rooves.  Damage of $35,000 was caused, mostly due to the cost of shingles.  The cottages are Australia’s earliest example of company housing* and housed miners from Burra’s Monster Mine during the 1840s.  They have been progressively restored for tourist accommodation under the direction of the Lewis Board of Management, funded by the State Government.

[This is not strictly true.  The SA Mining Association erected cottages for its workers at Burra as early as 1846 in Thames Street.  It would be surprising if other companies had not done so earlier.  The scale of company’s housing stock at Burra may have been unprecedented.]
