Redruth Court

There is a one column report of the case of William Lord v. John Barratt for assault.  [Lord, who describes himself as a miner, said he normally earned £3 a week and got 30/- from the lodge when hurt.]  The Bench found for the plaintiff, but as there had been provocation the fine was £13, which would only cover the cost of the action.

James Mayger was fined £5 for obtaining liquor during prohibited hours by claiming to be a bona fide traveller. [From John Calloway of The Pig and Whistle.]
