Editorial on Town Council and Public Works. 
A meeting of ratepayers has been called to authorise the borrowing of £400 to meet expenditure connected with the new bridge in Burra. Visitors to Burra must wonder at the ‘primitive condition as regards roads footpaths &c.’ 
For many years SAMA policy of leasing and not selling allotments prevented progress. The same cause of uncertain tenure and mistrust of SAMA saw the railway terminus so far from the business centre. The annual income of the Corporation is about £800 of which £600 is from the rates which, if expended on public works, attracts a subsidy of a like sum allowing £1,200 to be spent in a year on improving the town. (Or if the police rate be deducted still nearly that sum) This year began with a debit of £300 and now over £200 is in hand or to be received and it is proposed to spend this on necessary works, but such as attract no subsidy. Thus if we deduct the £300 debt and say £250 from the £600 mentioned above only £50 is left to spend in such a way as to attract a subsidy, i.e. Govt. subsidy this year would only be £50. 
There is of course the repayment and interest on the loan, but these would be spread over several years and would not be nearly as great as the advantage obtained. Act 16 of 1861 allows for a poll of ratepayers if at least six demand it. At this poll ratepayers assessed at £25 annual value and below get I vote and there is 1 vote extra for each additional £10 to a maximum of 6 votes. The Act provides for the issue of bonds at an interest rate not exceeding 6% and the bonds would not be bought at par. The Corporation would get probably £94 for every £105 and at that the bonds would likely be taken by the banks on the security of the rates. Repayment would begin in say three years by which time grants-in-aid are likely to have ceased. We should be free of debt in seven years, having had seven years of comfort.
