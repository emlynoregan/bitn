Characteristics of the 1897 paper.

By 1897 the paper was getting easier to read in that the type was larger and sometimes small headlines were employed, but in general it was a poorer quality product.

Pages 1 & 4 were full of standard advertisements for the whole year, virtually unchanged.  Even errors persisted for many months.  The 6 January paper, perpetuating an error that began on 2 September 1896, urged in large type that births, marriages and death notices could be had for:

‘one shilling each if not exceeding thee lines, over thee lines 2/6’.

The second ‘thee’ was eventually corrected on 8 September 1897, but the first persisted till 2 March 1898!

Page 2 was mostly advertisements with very little variation in the first 4 columns.  The notices of stock sales, church notices and other classified advertisements did vary slightly, of course, but not in format and anything like news was rarely reached before columns 6 or 7 and sometimes not till page 3.

Editorials disappeared except on rare occasions, such as Christmas.

The paper had ceased to insert overseas items except for some humorous paragraphs and not many items from other colonies got in either except by the same criterion, allowing that Broken Hill was regarded as almost local.

Current Topics purported to cover local events and SA items, though with less detail than earlier years and little editorial bite.

Something for Everyone drew paragraphs from everywhere, but most were light weight humorous pieces.

Half of page 3 was taken up with repeated advertising material posing as stories, but really selling Mother Seigel’s Syrup, or Clement’s Tonic, Eucalypti Extract (Sander & Sons Eucfetus Extract), and Dr Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.

Town Council activity was apparently uncontroversial in 1897, but meetings were barely reported.  Tenders are noted and the state of accounts are reported, but little else.

Sporting reports are scanty and seemingly inconsistently reported.

Sparks which originally gave cryptic remarks on local events degenerated into a few local references interspersed with jokes from some printed source, some of them being recycled as the year progressed.

Page 4 continued to be dominated by large advertisements; many not local.

All in all the paper ceases to be a record of town life in the sense that it had been at least up to the mid 1890s and even more so in earlier years.

There is little follow through with items.

Minor matters before the courts are dealt with in a mocking humour – especially those involving excessive alcohol.

Spelling and grammatical mistakes, while not rife, are not infrequent.  The non-agreement of subject and verb being, perhaps, the most striking of the latter.

For much of the year some fiction in the form of a serial story was included on page 3, but not continually.  Items of original poetry were fairly common.

Letters to the editor were uncommon.

A strange form of advertising is the long columns of small print which masquerade as either news or short stories of one sort or another, and which are repeated unchanged for weeks.  Surely no one ever read them, at least after their first appearance, but they sought to sell such things as Mother Seigel’s Syrup or Dr Williams’ Pink Pills.

Serials in 1897.

Three serials were printed in the year:

That Bushranger by ‘Louie’ author of Which was Mad? and A Little Pickle etc. ran from 3 March to 10 March.
