Jazz in the Monster Mine is one of the Mid North’s most popular events.  It had its origins in 1997 when John & Suzy Tilley offered the use of ‘Petherton’ to raise funds for the restoration of Sir Hubert Wilkins' homestead.  Over the next five years the natural amphitheatre of the old orchard at ‘Petherton’ was the setting for ever growing audiences.  The profits exceeded $20,000.  When the restoration was completed the venue moved to the open cut at the Burra Mine with the permission of the National Trust who lease the site, the Goyder Council sho own it and Adchem who own the access to the Mine Pool.  It has since been a bi-annual event, but organisers now feel that with 50% of patrons being first time visitors, it could become annual.  Profits could go towards reconstruction of the buddle pits near the resited Peacock’s Chimney.  Another possible project would be the rebuilding of the boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s Engine House, as an interpretive centre.  AGL are keen to commit to sponsorship and the event is planned to run again next February.
