Robberies.

On Monday night Mr Luke day’s shop in Thames St was entered through a small window on the eastern side by breaking the glass and removing a bolt.  They damaged the till, but failed to open it.  Its back drawer was locked and rather ingeniously made.  They stole a variety of goods which included: 5 lb tobacco, 2 bottles of pickles, 2 bottles of sauce, 2 bottles of scent, 2 bottles of eucalyptus, 1 bottle of eye lotion, 1 lb tea, 12 lb sugar, 1½ dozen packets of cocoa, 3 pairs of scissors and some sardines.  There were no signs of a light having been struck, so it seems the robbery was all done in the dark.  Suspicion falls on three tramps who have been living in Paxton Square for a few weeks and who left town very early on the morning of the robbery.

The same night the office at H. Roach’s Roller Mill was entered through the front window after an attempt at the back had failed.  Some stamps and a breach-loading gun were stolen.

[Later other items were also missed.]
