The Annual Buffalo Christmas Tree was held in the Town Hall last Friday.  Father Christmas came and was welcomed by the Sitting Primo, Mr W. Carpenter who also welcomed Members of the Ministers’ Fraternal and all others.  He invited the Mayor to open proceedings.  The Buffalo Lodge has been organising similar events for a number of years now.  About 200 gifts were distributed amongst the children.  Supper followed the gift distribution and the proceedings had been opened with carols sung by the Kooringa Methodist Church Carol Choir.
