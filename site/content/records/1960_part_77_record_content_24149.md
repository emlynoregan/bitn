Burra High School Sports were held on 8 April in glorious weather.

[Cup winners are not very clearly identified in the paper.  Where two names are given it is not stated whether they are reporting a tie or a winner and runner-up.  The absence of other runners-up makes a tie likely, but on the other hand three ties seem unusual to say the least.]
