Obituary.  Mr William Peacock arrived in the colony in the ship Glenalvon 28 December 1838.  Within three years he took part in an important meeting on the future of the colony.  In 1842 he became a member of the City Council as an Alderman.  He always supported the voluntary system in religious matters and took an active part in meetings on the subject in 1846.  In 1848-49 he was active in the movement for responsible government and in 1851 was returned as a Member for Noarlunga, defeating Major O’Halloran.  Four years later he was re-elected and served till 1856.  In 1861 he entered the Legislative Council, retiring due to the effluxion of time in 1869.  As a politician he was decidedly Liberal.  In Commercial circles he will be remembered as the founder and head of the well-known tanning and wool-scouring firm of W. Peacock & Son.  He was also a large holder of real property.  For long he was a deacon of what is now known as the Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, though latterly he worshipped at Stow Memorial Church.  His health has been in decline for some time and his death on Tuesday 20 January was not unexpected.  He was in his 84th year.  He is survived by a widow, one son, Caleb Peacock (manager of the firm for some time) and one daughter, Mrs Weston, relict of the late Dr Weston of Victoria.  [William Peacock died 20 January 1874, Hackney aged 83.]

[Not mentioned here is that he was a major shareholder in the SA Mining Association.]
