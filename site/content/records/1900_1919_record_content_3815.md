A Bolt.  A pair of horses with a buggy bolted from the stables on Sunday morning.  They left the trap hanging on a corner guard in Kingston St, wheels broken and body bent.  The horses went along Commercial St and turned onto the hill near Mr Thomas Sandlandâ€™s, thence across to Queen St, down Stock St, into Lower Thames St and thence via Kingston St and were about to turn into the road to Victoria Park when they lost the buggy.
