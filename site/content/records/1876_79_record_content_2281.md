The 1st town council declared a rate without complying with some technical formalities which resulted in a round-robin protest stating that those signing felt that the rate was unenforceable. The council took offence and didn't reply. The protesters went to the Supreme Court and the rate was quashed. A new rate was then declared in April 1877 for the year ending 31 August 1877. The opposition then declared it would only be legal if it ran till 31 December 1877. The Council declined as this would cause them to lose £120 in Govt. subsidy on work done before 31 Dec. 1876. The opposition then got legal advice that the rate was again unenforceable. The Council got contrary legal advice. They then resolved to go to the local court for resolution, but also there was a public meeting in May at which nothing was resolved; a motion to approve the Council action being lost by one vote. The Editor expressed concern at the damage being done to the town regardless of which legal view prevailed in the end. The paper in fact was fairly even-handed in its condemnation of both parties. [There had also been a number of appeals against the valuation/assessment process.]
