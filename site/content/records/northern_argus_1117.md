Morphett’s Enginehouse

Te work on this J150 project has begun.  The work will see stonework re-pointed, the building re-roofed in slate, floors replaced and the building made waterproof.  Displays on Cornish beam engines will be installed.  As well as Jubilee 150 funds, the Department of Mines and Energy has contributed some $80,000.  It is intended to re-open the miners’ entrance to the shaft and to re-timber the upper section of the shaft if funds permit.  This would enable the public to view the shaft itself.  Three pieces of timber, each some 48 feet long are being imported from Canada to be used in the shaft.*

[*Reports on CXVI, 8052, 7 May 1986, page 19 and CXVI, 8061, 9 July 1986 indicate these timbers were actually to support the new floors in the building.]
