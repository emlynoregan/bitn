[This was advertised as the Jubilee Show, but why seems unclear.  ‘Jubilee’ usually implies the fiftieth anniversary – though other periods are possible.  The first show was in 1877 and there was a hiatus of 8 years from 1886-93.  Perhaps the alternative meaning of a season of great rejoicing covers this event.]
