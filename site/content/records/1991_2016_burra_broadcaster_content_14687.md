Burra Hospital.  It is hoped that a joint Director of Nursing for Burra and Clare Hospitals can be appointed in the near future.  Lesley Phillips commenced this month acting in a duel campus role, with her temporary position ending on 19 January 1998.  Management is waiting for a report from the Australian Nursing Federation on the viability and feasibility of the idea to be tabled with the SA Health Commission and to give them direction in the matter.
