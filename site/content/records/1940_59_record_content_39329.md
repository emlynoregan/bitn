St Mary’s Church Centenary Celebrations

The Rector of St Mary’s, Rev. R.S.T. Pettet did a great job at organising the celebrations this week, aided by an enthusiastic band of volunteers.  The sum raised at events is in the vicinity of £500 and so far no decision has been made about what to spend it on.  The weather for the seven functions organised was good, despite rain threatening occasionally.  A Continental on Tuesday evening raised £120.

A program of organ, piano and vocal music in the church on Wednesday evening produced c. £20 and the Debutante Ball on Friday raised c. £75.  There was a reunion at Baldina Station Homestead on Saturday afternoon.

Thanksgiving services were held at St Mary’s on Sunday 14 November.  There was a Sung Eucharist in the morning at which the Organist was Clem Davey.  Lunch followed in the Parish Hall.  There was a Children’s Service in the afternoon.  In the evening Evensong was held at 7 p.m. with a procession of the choir to the hymn ‘Thy hand O God has guided’.  The services were conducted by Rev. Pettet, with Archdeacon Bulbeck preaching.  About £229 was collected at the morning service and about £45 at the evening service.

The Continental on Tuesday 9 November was held in the spacious grounds of Mrs S.M. Sandland’s ‘Heathmount’.  The night was a little colder than desirable, but the large pines provided some shelter and there was a large fire that proved to be a popular spot.  Stalls were set out on the wide verandahs and under the trees.  Rev. R.S.T. Pettet welcomed the large number who attended.  Songs were rendered by Miss Mavis Halliday and by Mrs Pickering, a former Burra resident, who returned for the occasion.  The Burra Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston officially opened the Continental.  During the evening Father Christmas arrived and distributed presents to all children of school age and under.  The function ended at about 10.30 p.m.

Armistice Day was observed at Burra on Thursday 11 November.  Shortly before 11 a.m. returned soldiers and citizens assembled in Market Square at the foot of the monument.  The ‘Last Post’ was followed by two minutes silence and then by ‘Reveille’.  The President of Burra RSL Sub-Branch placed a wreath at the foot of the monument and recited ‘Remembrance’.

Mr Norman Wilson was given a farewell from the town at the supper in the Parish Hall following Evensong on Sunday night.  He had been a great worker for the church, but was moving to Adelaide to be employed at the Pharmacy at Northfield.  Rev Pettet presented Mr Wilson with a handsome leather suitcase.
