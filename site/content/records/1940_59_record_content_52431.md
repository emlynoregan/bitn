Weather.  O n Monday night a storm with terrific winds swept across the district.  Wind velocities reached 80-90 m.p.h. Early in the morning a thunderstorm with much lightning heralded its approach and the wind rapidly increased in strength from 6 a.m.  Dozens of sheds lost their roofs and iron walls were flattened.  Many picket fences were knocked flat and trees were uprooted.  Three large gums were blown over in the stationmasterâ€™s yard.  One fell on the house and penetrated the ceilings of two rooms.  The other fell on outhouses.  Another fell on the railway cottage and one cut the telephone link along the line.  Cliff Lott was lucky when a large pine tree missed his house by a couple of feet.  A portion of Paxton Square lost its roof, which landed in the yard of the Kooringa Hotel.  Several electricity poles were flattened, cutting supply and a tree fell on wires near the Burra north Police station.  Several homes lost verandahs.  The Burra-Farrell Flat telephone line is precarious with the wires holding up the poles in several places.  One shed in Burra North lost its roof, which has not been found.
