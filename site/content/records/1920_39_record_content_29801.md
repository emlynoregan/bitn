Weather.  In the last week it has been extremely hot and sultry with electrical storms.  On storm on Friday was bad and fused an electricity pole near James Pearce’s house in Graham.  Mrs Pearce, standing at the time in the passage, fell to the ground and has two scars on her right arm like steam scalds.  Very little rain fell, but to the east a few places were lucky – 72 points at Thistlebeds and 45 at Wepara (Mt Bryan East), but most places only received very light falls.
