Inquest into the fire at Opie’s Hotel.  F.W. Holder JP as coroner and William Bentley as foreman of the jury.

Francis John Hooper Vivian:

Returned form Adelaide on the evening train on 18 January to be told there had been a fire in the hotel cellar causing c. £15 damage.  Cannot give any explanation for the origin of the fire.  Fire seems to have started in the S-E corner, though a quantity of burnt paper is also in the N-W corner.

Sara Jane Vivian, wife of above:

c. 4.00 a.m. Agnes Kenane was roused by smoke in her room.  Roused Joseph Shore lodging in Room 4.  Tried to enter the bar, but couldn’t due to smoke.  Shore roused the police.  Thought I smelled smoke c. 2.30 a.m., but went back to bed.  (Three doors separated the bedroom from the bar.)

Agnes Kenane:

Was aroused c. 4.15 a.m. by the smell of smoke.  Checked the kitchen first and then roused Mrs Vivian.

Joseph Shore:

Was roused about 4.30 a.m. by Agnes Kenane.  Saw smoke coming from the cellar grating and went to rouse the police.

Charles George Spencley, ostler:

Slept in Room 6: the top room in the passage.  My duty was to trim the lamps and keep the kerosene, which was left in the chimney of the long room opposite the bar.  There was a bottle of kerosene on the floor of the bar the next morning, but it was not in an unusual position.  I helped carry the water to douse the fire.  Have not been down in the cellar lately and rarely have jobs in the cellar.

William John Woolacott [Woollacott]:

Assisted by M-C Eaton put out the fire.  The principal part of the fire was in the S-E corner in cases and bottles of grog and straw.  There were also papers burning in the N-W corner.  No smell of kerosene or other cause of fire was evident.  One case burning was almost under the grating to the outside.  A fire from the grating could have run into the S-E corner.  When the floor was opened with a crowbar a case of brandy was on fire and a great blaze came up.  Lodgers and others often sit smoking and cleaning their pipes on a form directly above the cellar grating.

M-C Thomas Henry Williams:

I am in charge of the Redruth Police Station and was roused at c. 4 a.m.  I couldn’t find the fireplug.  Roused Mr Simpson, the Waterworks Engineer and learnt the equipment of hose and necessary appliances was in Kooringa.  I went and got them from Richard Andrews, the scavenger.  In the meantime others had got the fire under control.  I also saw the source as being in the S-E corner and burnt papers in the N-W.  No cause could be detected.  I thought the papers could have been ignited when the wooden case exploded.  It took a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes between the alarm and my arrival with the canvas hose to fit the hydrant.

M-C Henry Thomas Eaton, stationed at Redruth:

On arrival I broke the panels of the door and opened it and then opened the trapdoor, but couldn’t get to the fire that way.  Had to pull up the floor over the fire after which a few buckets of water seemed to put the fire out in the S-E corner.  Mr Woollacott and I then went down the steps behind the bar and put out the remainder of the fire.  Noticed the burnt paper.  The brandy case had been almost under the grating.

The jury saw no evidence to show the origin of the fire, but no evidence to suggest it was other than accidental, but they regretted the absence of any provisions for utilising the waterworks water for extinguishing fires.
