Obituary.  Mr Robert (Bob) Burns, fourth son of the late Mr & Mrs Samuel Burns of Kooringa, died at Memorial Hospital, North Adelaide on Thursday 15 August after a long and trying illness, the result of war injuries aged 42.  He was born in Burra in Chapel St.  In his early manhood he went to Fiji, where he lived for some years and it was from there he enlisted for service in the Great War and was attached to a British Regiment, rising to the rank of Lieutenant.  He remained in the UK after the war for some time.  He married an English girl and later returned to Fiji and Australia.  After selling his Fijian property he became for a time the owner of Barrata Station near Quorn and though not in good health hoped to regain his strength.  This was not to be and he had to retire from active life.  He bore his long illness with fortitude.  He leaves a widow and one daughter, Miss Jean Burns.  He also leaves five brothers: Norman, Jack, Garfield, Gladstone & Charles and three sisters: Mrs P. Murrie, Mrs F. Treloar and Miss Melva Burns.  [Robert James Burns born 7 August 1893 Kooringa.]
