A.H. Farnden reports sinking a shaft to 45ft.  Stopped sinking and has come up 25ft and started to stope out ore at the north end of the shaft showing good values.

We understand several interstate investors have put capital into the field.

The battery is still going at full pressure and gold has been quoted at Â£8-10-6 an ounce.
