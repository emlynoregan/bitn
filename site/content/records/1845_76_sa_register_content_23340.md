Northern Mail Routes.  A meeting at the Aberdeen Hotel on Monday discussed the changing of the starting point of these mail routes from Kooringa to Wetherston [Farrell Flat].  Mr A. Motley took the chair.  He said the Government had placed a number of buildings in Burra, giving the impression that it was considered the entrepot for the north and people had reacted accordingly; a belief reinforced by the placing of the rail terminus there.  The change would adversely affect the trade of the town; already in a depressed state.  Wetherston had merely 20 farmers in the area, a squatter and an eating house.

[The report reveals that there had been petition and counter petition pushing the two rival routes; one leading north from Wetherston [Farrell Flat] to Booborowie and the other from Kooringa via Mt Bryan Flat.]

Mr O. Harvey said the proposed new route had a very poor road; he had recently been in its vicinity a week earlier when it appeared more like a canal and the mail would have been best carried by a flat-bottomed boat than by coach.  The Government would have to spend thousands of pounds to make the proposed route serviceable.  Finally the meeting passed a resolution moved by R.A.J. Müller ‘That this meeting pledges itself to use all constitutional means to carry out the resolutions carried by the Kooringa meeting on Wednesday, the 18th instant.’  Mr W. West seconded.
