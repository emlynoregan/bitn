Dogs Attack Sheep.  In the past week in the district 15 sheep have been killed and 100 mauled by dogs.  One dog was destroyed on Friday night, but more sheep were killed and mauled on Saturday night, proving that more than one dog has been involved.  Sergeant Teague is investigating and warns dog owners they can be held responsible for loss or injury caused to stock.  Uncontrolled dogs in any paddock etc. can be destroyed if worrying stock or in any paddock etc. where stock has recently been worried.
