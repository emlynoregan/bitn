Obituary.  Mrs Louisa Bourman died last Thursday at the residence of her youngest daughter, Mrs W. Pryor of Black Forest.  She was buried at Kooringa on Friday.  She was born in Hindley Street Adelaide 30 June 1840 and was a daughter of Mr & Mrs Williams.  After the death of her father her mother married a Mr Clark and the couple lived for many years in Thames St in a cottage where the Burra Croquet Green now is.  The family came to Burra in its early days and Mrs Bourman spent practically all her life in Burra.  Until last week Burra could claim not only the oldest surviving SA born man in Mr Sam Baker, but also the oldest SA born woman in Mrs Bourman.  After her marriage to Fred Bourman they lived in Thames St Kooringa where her large family of eleven children was born.  Her husband died 33 years ago.  Mrs Bourman was of slight build and was a bright and energetic woman who put her long life and splendid health down to finding employment for every hour of the day.  A few years after her children had all married and settled down her youngest daughter prevailed upon her to come to Adelaide and reside with her.  Unlike many other elderly folk, the bustle of the city appealed to her and whenever she paid a visit to Burra she was always glad to return to the city.  With increasing age she grew frail, but retained her mentality and eyesight.  While living in Burra she was an attendant and member of St Mary’s Church.  Of her family nine survive.  Two daughters, Mary [d. aged 16] and Minnie, died as adults.  Surviving children: Mrs Will Gillett (Magill), John (WA), William (Sydney), Benjamin and Walter (Kooringa), Mrs W.A. Gebhardt & Mrs T. Gregor (Kooringa), Mrs W. Pryor (Black Forest and Alf (Broken Hill).  There are a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
