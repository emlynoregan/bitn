St Mary’s, Burra is undergoing repairs with the aid of a $25,000 heritage grant.

It has been having problems with the letting in of water on the weather wall and into the organ loft.  A National Trust architect estimated the repairs at about $30,000 three years ago.  The Heritage Commission grant came in response to an application by the Rector Fr Richard Morris.  As well as the grant they offered a loan for the rest of the cost.  Fr Morris believes the trouble stems from the replacement of lime mortar with cement about twenty-five years ago.  Clare builders McKendrick & Ahern began work about a month ago and expect to finish at the end of March.  They will re-point and repair the weather wall at the top where the pointing was bad.  They will replace the guttering and attend to flashings, ridge capping and parapet walls, waterproofing the last.  The windows will be sealed and the interior re-plastered in preparation for painting.  The 81-year-old pipe organ cost $700 in 1905 and was overhauled four years ago for $4,000.  Its replacement today would cost about $70,000.

Recent renovations have allowed the removal of a window from the original St Mary’s from its storage in the organ loft.  It will now be repaired and placed in a more visible position in the church.  It was originally placed in old St Mary’s in 1872.
