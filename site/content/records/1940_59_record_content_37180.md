Lillian June Mattner

First saw Weiss as she was going out the door and she stopped when he spoke.

She turned and walked into the kitchen to stand by the stove.

Lance was standing nearby to her left, facing the window.

She was going to open the oven door when she noticed Weiss with the rifle trained on Lance’s back.

Witness said ‘Look out’ and Lance swung around, caught her hand and pushed her behind him.

There was the sound of a gun and Lance fell down after taking several steps towards the door.

Witness felt several impacts after the shot and fell to the floor.

When she got up she went outside and Weiss went with her.

Weiss said he wanted to get away as soon as he could and she probably agreed with him.

They went as far as the road, with Weiss helping her, when she asked Weiss to get her daughter.

Weiss did so and they walked as far as the dam, when she could go no further.

They discussed his escape and eventually he agreed to carry her back to the house and to get a doctor.

After she suggested they could say it was an accident, he said he would shoot himself in the foot.

He bathed her wounds and then went to hide the rifle in some rabbit burrows, returning at about noon after an absence of about an hour.

While he was away witness found and loaded Mr Phillips’ shotgun and placed it in the bedroom next to hers – for her own protection.

Weiss left the second time after about five minutes.

She had first met Weiss through an advertisement in Madam Wu’s column in The Chronicle – ‘J----is a war widow with a baby, is fond of music and horse riding.’

When she left the house with Weiss he had not known she was shot, but when she told him he removed two fragments of metal from her body – before going back for her daughter, Marlene.

They had discussed the possibility of hiding in one of the disused houses in the vicinity.

The cross-examining counsel then sought to extract information about the background of Mattner’s relationship with Weiss and other matters dating from 1947.  Some questions were ruled inadmissible, but details reveal that she had agreed in 1947 to marry Weiss, but no date had been set and later she had told him she would not marry him.  The defence asked questions that implied Mattner had a somewhat dubious past and also that she suggested to Weiss that they concoct a story of accidental shooting at ‘Studholme’.  Mattner’s responses are not straightforward, but she also at times implies that she acted through fear.

The inquest continued on Thursday.

Mattner:

Weiss had never visited her at Phillips’ property until the fatal day.

After she and Weiss had parted at Parker’s property [in 1947] the next time she saw him was at Aberg’s Café in Burra.

She denied having obtained £5-10-0 from Weiss for a wedding dress.  She got 10 shillings for doing his laundry and £5 to buy sundry items for herself.  The wedding cake had been ordered, but no wedding date fixed.
