Burra & Districts Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial, Committee Meeting

Professor Henderson replied suggesting the inscriptions be kept as simple as possible – the memorial is proof of the gratitude of the people and there is no need to say that men who gave their lives are brave.  So:

‘This memorial was erected by the people of the Town and District of Burra in honour of their sons who died for King and Country in the Great War 1914 to 1919.’

‘To honour the memory of the Volunteers from Apoinga, Booborowie, Burra, Hallett, Hanson and Mt Bryan.’

This was accepted with the change to the north plate changing ‘the’ to ‘this’ before Town and omitting ‘of Burra’.
