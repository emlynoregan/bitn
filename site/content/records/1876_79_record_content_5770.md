Burra Town Council. 20 Jan. Report of complaints re a nuisance created by the rubbish depot at Nelson. The Inspector denies the nuisance.

On the question of scavenging Cr Geake thought business places paid most and should be serviced weekly and other residents fortnightly.

Salaries were decided: - The Town Clerk to get - as Overseer	£20

as curator of the cemetery	£10

as secretary to the Board of Health	£10

There was discussion re getting water laid on to the cemetery and having a fountain installed, [presumably a drinking fountain] but first they had to get permission to lay pipes from the spring across SAMA's land.
