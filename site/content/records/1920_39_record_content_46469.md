Obituary.  George Robert Hutchins who died at Aberdeen recently was born at Ramsgate (England) 3 March 1852 and arrived in Australia 25 June 1855 on the Thymouth Castle.  He was educated in Adelaide and later learnt plastering, but in hard times took up other works.  He settled at Balaklava area and later returned to Adelaide and married Eliza Mary Camplin in 1878.  They lived first at Norwood before going to Wilmington in 1882, where his wife died in 1886. When the Teetulpa gold rush broke out he went there before taking to station work and was employed for many years by the late Mr A. Tennant around Pt Augusta district.  He also worked for Sir Sidney Kidman and travelled extensively interstate.  Prospecting fever took him to White Cliffs opal fields after which he worked on Yardea Station for 26 years, but when A.J. & P.A. McBride sold that he transferred to Braemar.  He was taken ill on holiday to Adelaide in 1932 and returned to Burra to live with his granddaughter Mr Les White and died there on 15 June aged 81.  He leaves a daughter Mrs A.T. Brandon of Booborowie and a son Mr E.J. Hutchins of Wilmington.  There is one sister Mrs E.S. Hill of Wilmington and 18 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.  [Death registered as Hutchings.]
