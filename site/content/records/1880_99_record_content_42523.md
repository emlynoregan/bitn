3rd Leader on moves, again, to consider a property tax.

A property tax would be a levy on all that a taxpayer owned over and above his debts, with land being on the same footing as personal property.  At present we have land and income tax.  The former is levied on the unimproved value of all land and the latter is levied on all incomes above £200 p.a.

The progressive land tax proposals would see a levy on large estates for the purpose of encouraging their sub-division by compelling owners to pay what the land would contribute if it were so sub-divided and utilized by a number of persons.  The taxes, other than income tax, are preferable as they are not a fine for special industry or ability.  The property tax is defective in not distinguishing land from other property.  Land shows a general tendency to increase in value not only over time but due also to population growth, public works etc.  Taxation needs to distinguish between land and other property.

It is also necessary to consider progressive aspects of tax.  A man on £2 per week needs every penny of it: one on £10 a week can spare a considerable % of it before his necessities are affected.
