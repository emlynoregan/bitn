The Secretary’s report was for a year that had not been a financial success.  Membership was the lowest for ten years.  They had enrolled three new members, but had lost five.  They were in debt to the Bowling Ground Syndicate for £13-12-6 and needed to find £19 or so for water rates by November.  Elected: Patron, Dr D.M. Steele; President, R.J. Grant; Vice-Presidents, A.B. Riggs and S.C. Genders; Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.
