Review of 1993

January

Australia Day Awards:  Citizen of the Year was Colleen Spackman and Junior Citizen of the Year was Martin Heath.  Event of the Year was the Booborowie Centenary of Education.

It was announced that the former Nurses’ Home at Burra Hospital would become a Boarding Facility for BCS students, accommodating up to ten students from isolated areas.

On 25 January Burra experienced its worst floods in 50 years, when up to eight inches fell in some parts, causing flooding and washaways in the main street and adjacent areas.

Student results of note for 1992 were published:

Bronwyn Kurtzer 20/20 for SSABSA Accounting

Natalie Taylor 20/20 for SSABSA Photography

Andrew Duncan 20/20 for PES Geology

James Gosse 20/20 for Agricultural Commerce & Welding & Fabricating

Amy Gebhardt 20/20 for English

(The last three students studied in Adelaide, but come from the district.)
