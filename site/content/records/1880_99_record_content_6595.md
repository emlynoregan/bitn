Public Notice.  â€˜I sold the Lease of my House to Mr [sic] Treweek two years and three months ago: she had no cash to pay me; so I lived in the house with them until she had, and we parted good friends.  I never spoke to her since, nor was I on her premises.  I went a couple of days before the fire to see a neighbour on business about a quarter of a mile below her house.  I am innocent of the fire, and what she said about me and my wile [sic] was a perfect lie just to excuse herself.

CARL KRONCKE
