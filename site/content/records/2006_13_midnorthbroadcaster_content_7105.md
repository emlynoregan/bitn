Jacki Mattey of Terowie writes to contest the view that the Electors Meeting at Burra was well attended with just 45 out of a potential 1650 or so present.  The other two meetings were conducted in a co-operative manner with good communication, unlike the confrontational manner adopted by a small, but vocal sector of the Burra contingent.  ‘Coming along with a lot of motions, the meaning of which either support the Local Government Act, or state the obvious, is basically a waste of time.’

‘Simple requests to the council are often just as effective as formal motions.’
