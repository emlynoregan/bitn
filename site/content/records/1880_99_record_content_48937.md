Miss Spence’s Lecture on Effective Voting, last Wednesday at the Institute.

She received her first lesson in politics from her mother, who died five years ago, aged 97.  She remembered the agitation in England in 1832 over the Reform Bill.  Excellent as Mr Boothby’s ballot was in giving absolute privacy it did not protect minorities and the truth is not always got by counting heads – sometimes great reforms start with a single mind.  Proper representation would educate voters, cut bribery and corruption, and diminish mischievous effects of class and local interests.  Equal representation was needed.  She had waited for a man to come forth, but none had.  Over thirty years ago she had published a plea for pure democracy – the system advocated by Thomas Hare.  Effective voting was not only just and equitable, but also practicable.

The meeting held a test election.

Each person was asked to place a figure in the space opposite the name of the candidate he or she preferred, to vote for not more than six of the twelve and to indicate the order of preference by numbers.
