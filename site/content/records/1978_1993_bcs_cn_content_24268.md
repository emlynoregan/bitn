Burra Burra Hospital Inc.  The Hospital became incorporated under the SA Health Commission Act following a special Board Meeting on Tuesday 21 July.  The main benefits accrue to the hospital staff through increased portability.

CEO John Chilton will be trialling a joint administration position for six months with Riverton Hospital as recommended by the Lower North Health Association.  Last year the Hospital finished the year within budget despite cuts to funding.  Outside works included:

Security lighting to the rear car park.

Automatic sprinkler system to lawn areas.

Removal of trees and a new garden formed on the eastern boundary.

Repairs to bitumen areas near Allied Health Rooms.

Major inside improvements:

New air conditioning to Allied Health Rooms.

New ECG monitoring machine for intensive care.

Computer upgrading.

TV & video in the lounge room.

The Midwifery Wing is being upgraded with new floor coverings, curtains and furnishings.

The Hospital also recently secured a Home & Community Care grant of $16,000 to purchase a 14-seater bus with wheelchair access for use by Day Care and other community groups.  Further funds for this will come from:

The Hospital	$2,000

Council	$2,000

Day Care Reserve	$4,000

Day Care Fundraising	$4,000

In 1992-3 despite proposed budget cuts it is intended to upgrade the outpatients and casualty sections of the Hospital.
