‘Scattergood’ writes concerning the need to attend far more seriously to roads.  Much of the northern roadwork will be done in areas where there is little stone.  In such areas in summer dust holes to axle depth on wagons develop and in winter [holes develop into bogs].

The writer proposes a law compelling the fitting of sled-shaped runners between the pairs of wheels so that when wheels sink six inches into dust or mud the sled takes the weight and the wagon is glided readily over the problem area.
