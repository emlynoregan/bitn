Burra Show was held on 11 October under ideal weather conditions.  Mr H.M. Scott acquitted himself very well as Secretary for the first time, ably assisted by President A.B. Riggs and Vice-Presidents F.H. Reed & R.W. Humphrys.  [Other committee members are named.]

The gate was £140-8-0 (apart from membership fees).

Draught stock and swine had no entries; otherwise exhibits were good.

The group exhibit of pastels by Mr Len. Bence was outstanding.

Poultry & bird exhibits were up to quality.

Cattle entries were not as many as they might be, but competition was stronger than last year.

The cookery entries could have been more numerous, but Mrs D. Auhl’s Christmas cake would have graced the pavilion of any show.

Flowers were good and the Ring Events well up to standard.

Dairy produce was rather disappointing and the days of smoked hams and sucking pigs etc. seem to be over.

Sheep exhibits were somewhat better, but stud masters still do not patronise their local show to any extent.

The schoolwork was not for competition and we thought the Mt Bryan & Copperhouse displays topped the lot.
