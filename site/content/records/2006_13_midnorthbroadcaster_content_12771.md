The 91st Norwood Cycling Club ‘Burra Classic’ Cycle Race will be held on Saturday 6 August, with the inaugural Peter Reilly Handicap run on Sunday 7 August.

The race was first run in 1907.  Sir Hubert Opperman took the win and fastest time honours twice in the 1920s and a fastest time in an earlier attempt.  Keith Thurgood recorded the fastest time seven times, ended by his first outright win in 1935 and then had another amazing win in 1967.  Saturday’s race starts at the Town Hall and goes to Mt Bryan and back before going on to Robertstown and return, for a total of 125 km.  The Peter Reilly Handicap commemorates a local supporter of the event who sadly died last year.  There will also be races for juniors over the weekend.
