Thomas Wilson Corlyn, medical practitioner:

Was sent for and found deceased lying on the floor of the blacksmith’s shop, apparently dead.  Administered artificial respiration for about 50 minutes.  Supposed he died from drowning (asphyxia).  Note a mark on his chest, perhaps from falling on a plank.

The jury concluded the deceased was found drowned while in an apoplectic fit, to which he had been subject.

[This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD.]
