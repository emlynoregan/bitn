Burra’s Adchem has struck a deal to obtain copper cement from the Mountain of Light deposit near Copley.  Mt Gunson Mines Pty Ltd, a sister company to Adchem, holds three leases in the Leigh Creek area and has come to an arrangement with Leigh Creek Copper Mines Pty Ltd, which has taken over the leases.  The surging copper price has made this source viable after lying dormant for forty years.  Leigh Creek Copper Mines spent more than $3 million drilling for 21,000 tonnes of the mineral.  Prices reached $6,330 (AUD) a tonne last week.

High copper prices are not an unmixed blessing for Adchem, as they force up the price of its input, scrap copper and other raw materials needed for its output of copper oxide and copper carbonate.

Production in 2005 was c. 7,500 tonnes of copper oxide and 2,300 tonnes of copper carbonate – only slightly down on the previous year.
