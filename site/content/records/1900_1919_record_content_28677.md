‘Short & Sharp’

West’s Pictures on Friday night last were the best seen in Burra.

A successful aeroplane flight has taken place in WA.

[Obituary] Mr Henry Braefoot Scott* died on Friday last at Milton, Cootamundra, aged 74.

Our own Tommy Ryan MP ex-railway porter etc. is off for a trip to England.

Mrs W.H. Hardy of Kooringa who has been seriously ill is still in the hospital.

The calendar issued with last week’s Record was much appreciated.

The ex-Mayor (Mr S. Burns), who was so ill at the time of the last elections, is staying on Kangaroo Island.

Mr W.H. Hall, a telegraph operator at Kooringa Post Office, has been transferred to the Adelaide GPO.

Many of the young chaps are sorry that the Burra Swimming Club could not be kept alive.  Always the same when too late.
