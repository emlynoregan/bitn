The SA Museum will run tours to the normally inaccessible palaeontology sites at Redbanks Conservation Park during Palaeontology Week.  Fossilised remains were first discovered there in the early 1900s*, but in 2000 an almost complete skeleton was discovered as well as remains of a Thylacine and of a Thylacoleo (a marsupial lion).  The discoveries near Burra are important because they are fairly close to the surface and more intact than elsewhere.  Fossil Tourism is growing in Australia.  [Article of â…“ page.]

[*This is incorrect.  The first discoveries were near the town in 1868.  There was a further discovery at Bundey in 1889 and a major one at Redbanks in 1890.]
