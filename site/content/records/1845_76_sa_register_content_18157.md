Kooringa News, 2 February

Nothing has been done in relation to the election since a meeting attended by not more than a dozen persons.  There will not be much expense attached to the election as it was resolved not to advertise, but just to send the bellman around calling the meeting.

Peter McIntyre and Alfred Hack were fined respectively £2 & £5 with costs for travelling with sheep without giving notice according to the Act.

Several parties are returning from Wallaroo as many could not get work there, but the families of others are going, so the population here remains about the same.
