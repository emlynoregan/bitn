Kooringa News, 2 January

Last Friday evening Re. D.J.H. Ibbetson delivered a lecture at the Mechanic’s Institute to a large audience on the subject of ‘Practical Science’.  Mr McDermott SM took the chair.

The Political Association had a thinly attended meeting on Saturday night at the Burra Hotel.

Thefts.  Some weights have been stolen from Messrs Peacock’s establishment and other items were taken from the premises of J.G. Genders, spirit merchant.  Two men will appear in court tomorrow in respect of these matters.

Yesterday and today were observed as half holidays because of the races here, but they were poorly attended.
