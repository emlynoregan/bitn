‘Baton’ reports on the Burra bandsmen.  [The style suggests this might be W.H. Hardy.]

He reports hearing a somewhat erratic practice session somewhere on his peregrinations.

The writer then says he strolled to the No. 2 band at the Institute where they were about to enter and play for the rink so he cannot say more.

The No. 3 band was one concertina, 1 cornet, 1 drum and several timbrels. [Which sounds like the Salvation Army]

It is, he says, silly for a small place like Burra to have two bands: why not do away with animosity and make one good one.
