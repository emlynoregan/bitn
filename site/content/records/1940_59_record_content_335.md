Swimming Pool.  The Under-Treasurer has asked how much progress has been made on the Burra Swimming Pool.  The Mayor says apparently if the Council wants to retain the Government money loaned to them it will have to proceed with the pool.  If the pool were built the Council would receive £334 from the Government when it was finished.  The Tanunda pool cost £700 and was operating at a profit.  The Mayor suggested the Committee hand over its funds to Council and with their help he would build the equal of the Tanunda pool.  Council could raise 100 yds3 of screening at little cost.  It would be impossible for the Committee to raise the £2,000 for the plans they had in hand.  Cr Reed moved the Committee be asked to hand over the money collected to enable the Council to build a pool.  Cr Villis 2nd.  Carried.

Cr Robinson moved that Under-Treasurer be advised Council was taking over and ask for an extension of time.  Cr Samuel asked if there were plans in hand for a £750 pool.  The Mayor produced a set of plans already passed by a competent architect.
