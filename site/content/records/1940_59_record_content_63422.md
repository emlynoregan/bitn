Obituary.  Harry Douglas Jones of Bulyanninie Station was accidentally shot on Monday 26 April.  He was driving a buckboard and a man beside him was taking a film of a fox hunt.  In the back another man was shooting foxes with a pistol.  The pistol accidentally discharged as the vehicle passed over a saltbush and the bullet entered Jonesâ€™ right side, killing him almost instantly.
