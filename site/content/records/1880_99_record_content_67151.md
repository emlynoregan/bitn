‘In treating the slag considerable care will be necessary . . . on account of the savings been [being?] in a matalic [sic: metallic?] state’.  But as work proceeds if necessary other appliances will be added consisting chiefly of an elaborate new vanner [sic] being patented by Mr May, in which material will be reduced with little if any loss of water.

The slag will be trucked along tram lines to a pair of cages at the foot of large bins then hoisted up 50’ and tipped into the bins then through a powerful stone breaker, going thence per launder to an enormous pair of rollers to be further reduced then elevated to the trommels and a section having been treated by battery the classifier and jigs will carry it to the final stage of concentration.  Motive power is a high pressure engine fed by two large Cornish boilers.  The site has its own blacksmith’s and carpenter’s shops, store and office.  The engine and pumps were run on Sunday when many visitors went to the site.  The plant should be in full working order in a week or so.  There is a heavy 10-head battery.

[A vanner is a machine for separating minerals from earth etc.  A trommel is a rotating cylindrical sieve.  A lauder is a trough of water used to carry material or in separating materials.]
