M.W. Bednall writes to clarify and correct the court report of 30 August issue.  For a start the defendant pleaded not guilty.  He then clarifies certain other evidence and adds that the Magistrate decided the offence was caused inadvertently because the licensee dozed off and was unaware of the arrival of the group.  He did the unusual thing of acceding to the request to grant a certificate that the offence was trifling and would impose the minimum penalty without endorsing the licence.
