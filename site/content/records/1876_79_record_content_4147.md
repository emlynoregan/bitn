Anglican Bazaar. Last November the Anglican Bazaar raised over £90, intended for the building fund, but used temporarily in repairs and additions to the old parsonage. The remains of the bazaar were offered on 14 June, but the weather was so bad there were hardly any customers, so it was intended to auction off the remaining items after the concert. The weather reduced the numbers present there too, but it went off quite well and raised c. £60.
