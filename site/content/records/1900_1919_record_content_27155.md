Burra Gymnasium

For some time there has been a move from residents of Aberdeen and Redruth for a gymnasium.  Admirable premises have been secured through the kindness of Mr Henry Roach, in the former Butterworth’s Mill and the club was opened last Tuesday night by the Mayor, Mr S. Burns, when there was a large attendance of ladies and gentlemen.  Mr H. Roach was elected President and Mr J. Thompson, Secretary.  Speeches in support were given by Rev. T. Weatherill, Mr H. Roach, Mr J. Tapp, Mr C.A. Fuss, Mr H. Thomas, Rev. Lower (Curate of St Mary’s) and Mr George Bartholomaeus.
