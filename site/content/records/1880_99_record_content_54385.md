Burra Co. MR.  Lieut. Joseph Blott resigned a few weeks ago and has been replaced by Lieut. F. Field.  Lieut. Field was born in Hamilton, Victoria in 1863 and came to Burra as a young child.  He was among the first to volunteer when the Burra Mounted Rifle Co. was formed and soon rose to L-Cpl and then a month or two later passed his exam to Corporal and then to Sergeant and Sgt-Major and now to Lieutenant.  The annual inspection of the company is due soon.  Capt. J.A. Watt is still very weak and not able yet to fulfil his duties.
