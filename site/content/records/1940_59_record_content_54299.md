Burra Primary School roof and tanks were inspected on 3 April by two superintendents of the Architect-in-Chiefâ€™s Department.  A.L. Clode promised to submit a price to the Education Department within seven days for the renovation of the roof with new box gutters and to clean gutters.  Mr Yule will supply three new 2,000 gallon tanks to collect water from the outside gutterings only.  Water will be pumped from the underground tanks.  Mr G. Stevens has advised that work on the yard will begin in two to three weeks.
