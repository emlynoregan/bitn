Goyder Council has released a Representation Options Paper as the first step in the Representation Review process.  It seeks comment on such options as:

How many electors each councillor should represent; which leads on to deciding how many councillors there should be.

Should the Council be represented by a Chairperson or a Mayor?

Should there be Area Councils, Ward Councillors or a mixture of both?

If there are wards should there be one councillor per ward or multiple councillors per ward?

If there are wards where should the boundaries be?

If there are wards what should they be named?
