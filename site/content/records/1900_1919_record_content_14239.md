Stolen Tobacco.  On 28/6 19 lb of Charmer tobacco was stolen from the Gawler railway station goods shed.  Cheap tobacco was offered to a local shopkeeper here at 2/1 lb as against that from the manufacturers at 2/9 lb.  M-C Grosser overtook the man in the northern end of town and being mistaken for a customer, was offered the whole 12 lb lot for 2/- lb.  He asked to see the article and was shown it at the Bon Accord Hotel.  The man, called Durke, was soon in custody and awaiting a trip to Gawler.
