‘This week marks 75 years since gold mining started at Mongolata,

and the following has been written for the Broadcaster by Steve Boyes

Gold was known to be in the area since at least 1908 when it is alleged that Mr T. Hawkins, a shearer and prospector, found gold between Newikie Creek and the site of the mines. It was also known that Ted Bywater had been fossicking for gold in the area for about 25 years.

Harry Byles was an unemployed Station Manager who had been working for Mr I.J. Warnes. He had permission from Mr George Morgan of Wildildie to prospect on his property and found gold on Section 36W on the east side of the Mongolata Hills. This was first reported in the Burra Record of 26 November 1930. The Mining lease for "Byles Mongolata" was issued on 1 January 1931. This later became the Byles Mongolata Gold Mining Co. which acquired many of the other leases as they became vacant.

The find at Mongolata started a mini gold rush with many claims being pegged around the Byles lease, mostly by local people, and within a short of time over 100 men were working out there on about 40 leases over a 5 mile strike length.

In 1930 the world was in the middle of the Great Depression. South Australia was almost bankrupt and the Federal Government was not in a much better state. Thousands were unemployed throughout the country with over 120 men in Burra. There was no such thing as the dole in those days and these men and their families existed on rations provided by the Government and distributed by the police and the local Council.

Conditions on the field were primitive with people living in tents or dugouts and there was little water in the area. They had few tools and equipment, no suitable clothing or footwear, and no money to buy them.

Some of the gold was in small nuggets which could be handpicked but, as there were no facilities to treat ore at Mongolata, the rest had to be sent in bags by rail to the battery at Peterborough. After lobbying of Government by State and Federal MPs and the Burra Council a battery was installed at Mongolata which opened on 2 March 1933.

In May 1931 the Mongolata Gold Prospectors’ Association was formed to "watch the interests of the prospectors both on and off the field and do anything to assist the development of the field". This led to lobbying the Burra Council, Mines Dept. and the State Government for help with such things as tools, clothing, explosives, water supply, increased rations and, most important, investment by businessmen in Adelaide. These met with limited success as illustrated by the provision of a First Aid Kit from the Mines Dept. consisting of two bandages, l/4lb of boracic acid and a tourniquet.

Over the next few years conditions gradually improved for the men. In June 1932 the Mongolata Sports Association was formed, tennis courts and a cricket pitch were built with fixtures being played against teams from surrounding area, and the annual Sports Day started with athletics and cycle races. In July 1934 Bill Carpenter opened a store out there, and later a boarding and eating house providing accommodation and meals for the miners.

The Mines Dept. records show that up to 1947, 7,578 tons of ore from the field were treated and 10,864 oz. of gold produced, which at today’s gold price would be worth around $7,000,000. This does not include any ‘specimen’ gold which was not reported. The peak year was 1933 when 2,490 oz. were produced, 40% of the SA gold production.

The Byles’ Mine is now mined by Kevin Wallis. Tours of the mine and the battery can be arranged by booking at Mongolata Gold in Commercial Street. .’
