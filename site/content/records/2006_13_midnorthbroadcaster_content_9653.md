Bruce & Celine Stockman celebrated their golden wedding with more than 130 family and friends last weekend.  During the celebrations daughter Ondy wore the original wedding dress and Anne-Marie wore her mother’s going-away outfit.  Father Laurie Quinn presented a blessing in the form of a parchment scroll.  The event was held at the Sports Complex.
