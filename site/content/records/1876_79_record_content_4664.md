Rabbits. A ratepayers’ meeting at Hallett decided on the rabbit rate, though many thought it rather useless and compulsion was the only way to go, but in the meantime. . . There was a debate on whether to make it just a rate to clear the Council of debt on the rabbit account (a 4½d rate) or to go for more to pay for scalps as well. Mr Dunstan moved for a 1/- rate. Mr Windsor amended this to a 6d rate, but the amendment failed.
