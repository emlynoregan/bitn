The hospital was shown to be in serious financial trouble.  In November 1922 a Government letter said that the Government subsidy would be 30/- for every £ raised by subscription and rates.  Another paragraph of the letter says the Government is liable and contributes 3/5 of every £2-10-0 of the actual expenditure which suggests the Government pays 30/- for every 50/- raised.

The Board had been acting on the assumption of the 1st paragraph.  In addition the Government has been deducting the overdraft before calculating the subsidy as that was not money raised.  The Chairman said at the present rate a time would come when there would be no subsidy at all and by next February the overdraft would be £1,500.  The Chairman thought they would have to close the hospital.  Mr Melrose said they had spent £2,296 rates and received £2,479, which corresponded with neither rate of subsidy mentioned above.  The bank is insisting that affairs be put in order.  A meeting with the Government has seen them pay all money due up to the present, which amounts to £697.  This has squared the bank account up to the last meeting.  The hospital is living beyond its means and urgent changes are needed.  A detailed financial breakdown of the income and expenditure, by Mr Sampson, follows.  Over the last few years the Board has been distracted by the dispute with the doctors and more recently with the late matron.  He presented a plan for severely tightening expenditure control and reducing the size of the Board.  Changes also suggest leaving the cost of burying indigent patients to the police as it is their duty and expense.  He presented an 11 point approach.
