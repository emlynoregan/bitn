Burra Mayor T.H. Woollacott was eulogised on the radio on Tuesday morning with respect to the Housing Scheme, which is filling the empty Burra houses rapidly.  It is believed the matter was raised by Mr Woollacott with the Premier on a visit to Adelaide and the result is the lack of population in the country is being rectified and the congestion in city housing is being alleviated.  The idea is to move people unessential to the war effort in the city to vacant country housing to free up accommodation in the city for munition workers etc.
