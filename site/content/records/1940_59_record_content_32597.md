Burra Mine.  The Town Council recently discussed whether the mine site should be acquired by the town for its historical associations.

Cr S.J. Woollacott supported such a move if it could be got for about the figure Mr Villis paid for it.  The royalties for stone would pay the interest.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said a recent officer of the Tourist Bureau was much taken with the echo there which people travelled long distances to hear in the Old World.

Mr Villis will be asked for a price.
