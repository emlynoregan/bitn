Letter.  Ian Auhl writes saying that the Governor General was apparently non-plussed to hear that two of the S.T. Gill paintings were recovered from the town dump.

‘It certainly surprised me.’

Auhl then outlines the real sequence of events:

He found the paintings under the Burra Town Hall stage in 1966.

He took the four paintings to Adelaide to the Art Gallery of SA with the full knowledge and permission of the then Mayor, Mr E. Baulderstone.

This was necessary because three of them had been gathering mould under the stage and all four needed to spend time in the Art Gallery fumigator and have fungicide treatment.

They also needed to be authenticated by art specialists.

He had been shown the wooden access panel to the under-stage area by Burra Institute Librarian Mrs Steer and was actually looking for missing bound copies of the Register newspaper from the 1850s, when the discarded paintings had been found.

The discovery and the other S.T. Gill paintings in the Art Gallery of SA had motivated him to write the book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era – South Australia 1841-51, Paintings of S.T. Gill.
