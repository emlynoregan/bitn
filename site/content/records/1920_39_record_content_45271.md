Burra Town Council, 6 March

Cr Jennison was in the chair in the absence of the Mayor.

Tenders were received for two culverts in Aberdeen across the creek: one near Mr Short’s and one near Drew & Crewes’ Bilk Store.  P.J. Harrison tendered £16-17-0 each and Roy Woollacott £21-15-0 each.  After discussion the tenders went to Harrison.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the fine report on tree planting from T. Wilkinson.

Work on the Adelaide road was proceeding satisfactorily.

Cr Bevan thought the other wards should aid North Ward in the cost of the two culverts giving access to the saleyards.  It was a benefit to the whole town, but not specifically to North Ward ratepayers.

Cr March was opposed, Cr Jennison supported, Cr Riggs was opposed on the basis of the cemetery road and because East Ward paid more rates than any other.  Eventually it was resolved that the sum would be taken from the Government Grant.
