Natural Resources SA Murray-Darling Basin has appointed John Wood to its Burra office to work alongside Wayne Mitchell as NRM officers for the Rangelands Region.  John is looking forward to tackling weed and pest problems here.  Priorities will include the wheel cactus program east of Terowie, the containment of Lincoln weed in the Terowie area and continued control of African Rue at various sites.  Roadside African Boxthorn is another concern.
