Editorial on The Elections.

The editor strongly opposed the current Govt. and said its apparently dazzling policy was actually threadbare.  The Premier had made the division of the colony into three or four electorates for the Legislative Council of less importance than reforms that would give the House of Assembly more power.  The editor thought the former change was vital.

Tariff revision as proposed was too sweeping and would strike a heavy blow at the colonial industry and so lead to unemployment.  Tariffs on things not produced in the colony could certainly go.  He was much against a property tax.  [i.e. a wealth tax] He was in favour of a land tax and for a transcontinental railway based on the land grant system.  He was opposed to the decision not to proceed with the railway to Melbourne.  [It was then halted at Nairne.]  He favoured an outer harbour and wondered why there had been no reference by the Govt. to calls for a reduced freight charge for the carriage of wheat on the railways.
