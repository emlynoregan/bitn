Burra Town Council.

Messrs Ayers & Gall wrote asking if the Council wanted to secure the RPA title to the cemetery.  It was resolved to do so.

Mr W. Geake said the Commercial St lamp would not burn properly despite some attention being received.  It was resolved to buy a new burner for it.

C. & A. Fuss asked a culvert drain be made in front of their new building.  It was resolved they be allowed to do so at their own cost to the satisfaction of the dayman, or the Council will do it and bill them.

Tar to be applied to the footpath from Mr Mc Bride’s to Lally’s and from McBride’s to J.C. Sandland’s.
