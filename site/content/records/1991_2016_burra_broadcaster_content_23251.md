Burra Community School had an outstanding Royal Show this year with its first outright champion in a class.  After a disappointing result on the hoof the students were rewarded on the hook.  Three steers were prepared.  Clancy, the Murray Grey steer proved a bad tempered and suspicious animal and was eventually expelled from the show ring and dragged back to his stall in disgrace.  Yogi, the Red Angus was the best on the hoof, managing a fourth place in his class.  On the hook Clancy was the champion trade carcase and only one point away from overall champion.
