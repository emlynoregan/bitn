Obituary.  John Dawson Jordan of Ashfield Sydney died 11 December in Sydney after a short illness aged 89.  He was well known in Burra, having carried on a business here many years ago as a watchmaker and jeweller.  He then went to Broken Hill and upon retiring went to Sydney.  He was born in April 1845 and remained in excellent health until his last brief illness.  He married Miss Mary (Polly) Pearce, a daughter of the late William (tailor) Pearce of Burra.  She died two years ago.  The couple had celebrated their diamond wedding.  There is a family of four surviving sons and two daughters: Arthur (Gawler), Ernest (Mitcham SA), Albert (Melbourne) and the Misses Gertrude & Ruby (Sydney).  For many years her parents resided with their elder daughter.  Three sons and a daughter died before their parents: Edgar, Jack, Clarence & Annie.  Mr C.J. Pearce of Kooringa is a brother-in-law.  [Born 7 April 1845 London, England.]
