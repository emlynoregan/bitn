Redruth Reformatory

There has been a disturbance at the reformatory.  Trouble has been brewing for some weeks and after prayers on Friday morning some eight girls climbed onto the roof where they danced around like demons and screamed abuse.  Some piled up stones from the parapet in anticipation of the arrival of the police.  Other stones were dropped down various chimneys.  Two confined in adjacent cells managed to dig a hole between them through a 20” wall and attempted to break down the doors by throwing blocks of stone at them.  Another in a cell lined with corrugated iron twisted several sheets partly off the wall.  In about one hour those on the roof broke about 50 windows by throwing stones at them.  When the Mayor arrived the girls on the roof thought he was the Commissioner of Police and came down, though two of them did so on the outside of the walls and escaped.  They have since been apprehended.  The cause has been the actions of the well meaning, but inexperienced ladies of the State children’s Council who have undermined law and order at the institution.  When Miss Bubb took over four years ago she was confronted with a determined revolt which she put down by judicious use of the slipper – though not more than many a mother would have.  Also she used a Hessian dress on a refractory girl as a punishment and to prevent her running away.  She then improved conditions at the place and gave better food and paid for outings for the girls.  Two years ago we visited and the girls looked contented, well fed, well clothed and all was in order.  The State Children’s Council tried to force Miss Bubb’s resignation over the use of the slipper and when foiled by the strong support for Miss Bubb from every visiting clergyman and magistrate in the town they published a list of regulations which removed most of the means of discipline available.  The girls soon became aware of the regulations with the results we now see.
