Burra Institute held its AGM 22 January.  No subscribers other than committee members attended and due to three of those were unavoidably absent it was necessary to draft in two subscribers from the vicinity to make a quorum.  The continuing depression had meant a continuation of the financial struggle.  Book in the library 	31 December 1933	7,285

31 December 1934	7,565

Removals saw a decrease in membership:

31 December 1934	Double	61

Single	161

222

31 December 1935	Double	53

Single	153

206

The Chess Club went into recess earlier than anticipated due to lack of interest.

Finance.  Money in the National Bank	31 December 1933	£87-11-4

31 December 1934	£130-5-2

Efforts to organise dances with the local Jazz Band did not succeed and raised only £7-4-3.

The floor has been reconditioned and is in excellent form for dancing.

During the year the caretaker Mr A. Davey moved from the Institute cottage into his own new premises after 30 years in residence.  The Institute cottage has been let to Mr Wandke without any renovation being necessary.

The Institute Choral & Orchestral Classes under Mr G.E. Dane again contributed the major part of the Christmas Concert at the Hospital.

In the coming year work will be needed on the front of the building.

Elected were President, Max Pearce, Vice-President, A.B. Riggs; Treasurer, M.W. Bednall & Secretary, F.T. Sara.
