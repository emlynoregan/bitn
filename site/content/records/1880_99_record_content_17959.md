Burra Town Council, 1 June

Captain Holder asked permission for Burra Co. RVF to use the Recreation Ground as a parade ground. - Granted.

The Secretary to the Commissioner of Crown Lands wrote to say that Dr Cockburn, having explained the position of Council in respect to the policeman from Redruth, it was decided to credit Council with the amount which had been charged.

The Surveyor General has said he would not oppose closing Short St, Aberdeen.

The Hydraulic Engineer wrote that the cost of the works should be ascertained by certificate of the Department and it would be costly and undesirable to depart from that provision.

Cr Ridgway moved that they pay without prejudice, as there were other ways to get the information through Parliament.  He believed that the Department had charged 50% profit on pipes.

Cr Coglin said he would 2nd if ‘without prejudice’ were omitted.

Cr Ridgway objected to this, saying the police incident showed the value of persistence.

He feared there were old waterworks included in the value.  About £300 was expended there in enlarging the railways tank and that might also be included and perhaps all the old scheme’s losses as well.  There was no 2nd for Cr Ridgway’s motion.

Cr Sampson moved that the account be paid and at the same time the request for details be renewed.

Cr West moved that the account be paid and Cr Coglin 2nd.

Cr Sampson’s motion was carried.

The Mayor had information on a larger Waterworks engine.  It would make a difference of £55-11-6 p.a. in fuel costs.  To work the present engine to fullest capacity would double the fuel concerned.  [At least I think this is the gist of the argument - the prose not being crystal clear at this point.]  Maintenance costs would rise too.

Cr Ridgway thought they should pay interest on the engine coming and order a larger one too.

There was also a discussion on the roads around the railway station.
