For the 8-10 year-old group M. Tiddy won a box of chocolates for coming first, Violet Wardle got an electroplated jam dish for second prize and Arnold Heinrich won a hairbrush as third prize.

Urwin & Co. had over 6,000 attempts to guess the number of lollies in a bottle filled with sweets of many different sizes.  Mrs Mitchell was first and won a travelling bag worth £2-2-0.  Miss E. Oates came 2nd and won a salad bowl and Mrs W. McDonald came 3rd and won a lamp with globe.

Frank Harris’s ‘Stocking’ was to be won by guessing the name of the doll, but 70 guesses failed to nominate ‘Lucille’ and so Mr Harris gets to keep his stocking.

E.J. Harris offered an 8-day clock to the one who guessed the time it would stop.  This was won by Mr R. Gurney and Mrs W. Lee came 2nd, winning 5 lb of tea.
