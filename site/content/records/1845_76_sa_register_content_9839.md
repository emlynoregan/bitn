Kooringa News

Instead of having a footbridge placed across Commercial Street, it is being filled with gravel etc. by men employed by the SA Mining Association.  The creek is also being deepened and so, thanks to the Company, the main street will be both cleaner and safer than hitherto.

The enlargement of the Wesleyan Chapel is progressing favourably and the appearance when finished will be very pleasing.  A bazaar will shortly be held to aid this project.
