Frank Harris is in his mid-eighties and someone recently challenged him to yell ‘Fish-O’ as loud as he used to when he stood at Elder, Smith & Co.’s corner to sell fresh fish.  It is said he could be heard on Brewery Hill and even that he could be heard at a funeral at the Burra cemetery while the parson was intoning ‘Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.’
