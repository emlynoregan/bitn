Burra Town Council Elections.

There was an election in each ward and for the Mayoralty.  The Mayoralty was certainly decided on the question of the electric light.  Mr McLaren was for a scheme for East & West Wards only, extending to North Ward when it could be proved economical.  Mr Crewes was for no scheme unless it included all wards from the start.  The voting reflected these differences clearly.

Crewes	McLaren

North Ward	99	29

West Ward	29	61

East Ward	61	92

182

East Ward	Lane	109

Moore	44

West Ward	Wicklein	58

Hardy	33

North Ward	Radford	88

Richards	41

[In his address at the declaration of the poll McLaren refers to Crewes having a severe accident a couple of days before and to an anonymous letter writer in the campaign â€“ knowing that Crewes was absolutely above and beyond such a thing.]

McLaren was surprised by the outcome because he felt he had the Council behind him.

Mr Hardy said that although it was not the first time he had supported a vote of thanks to the returning officer, he thought it would be the last.  [It was: he died in 1916 without standing again.]
