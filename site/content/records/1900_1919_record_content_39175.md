Letter from R.J. Woollacott, dated 17 August 1914.

[R.J. Woollacott was a son of T.H. Woollacott of Aberdeen and he had been in England as an electrical engineer when war broke out.  In this letter he says he is planning to return, but he soon decided to join up.]

He had spent the week war was declared in Scotland.  Already preparations were evident with guards on the Forth Bridge etc. and on every pier.  The harbours were mined.  Great Britain was an armed camp with the railways under military control.  There was an air of suppressed excitement with everyone still going about their usual business.  Some big firms were paying the full wages of men who had gone to the front if they were married and half pay for those who were single.  At Siemens [where Woollacott was working] the works manager had joined the German Navy and some of the leading technical men had gone to fight for Germany, and many of the men had gone to do the same for England.  The firm was paying the wages of all alike.  He says he intends to return home about the end of October or the beginning of November.
