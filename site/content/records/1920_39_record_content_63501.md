At the Burra school steps the President of the Burra School Committee, Mr A.B .Riggs, welcomed the Minister of Education, Mr Jefferies.  The Mayor made supporting remarks and the Minister responded before declaring the Exhibition open.  Dr Steele moved a vote of thanks and was supported by Mr G.F. Jenkins MP.  The visitors then moved inside to the exhibition of work.  The large junior room held displays from the various primary schools.   [These are then described at some length.]

The Burra High School had a particularly interesting show in the science room where various clever demonstrations were given by the Second Year boys.  In another area various hobbies were displayed.  The Domestic Arts and Woodwork displays were impressive.  In the centre of the Domestic Arts display was a beautifully iced Centenary Cake, the work of the First Year students.  The Second Year girls had set out an invalid’s tray and a traymobile equipped for afternoon tea.

The afternoon was devoted to sports activities from 1 p.m.

[These are described and the results printed in about 1⅔ columns.]
