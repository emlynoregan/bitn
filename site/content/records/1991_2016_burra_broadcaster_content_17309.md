Letter.  S. Roberts, President of the BBH Social Club writes condemning the low life who stole $200 worth of liquor from the club’s presentation night at the Burra Town Hall.

Burra Little Athletics had a marked lack of attendance at their AGM.  The committee has agreed to hold their offices for a further 12 months, but are not prepared to continue.  [Sic – meaning?]

It has been agreed to hold three athletic meets with the first on 19 October at the bottom oval, after which an attempt will be made to form a committee.  [The implication seems to be that if a committee does not come forward then, the club would cease.]
