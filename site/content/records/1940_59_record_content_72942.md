Burra Air Force Association

The Association has received considerable help towards renovating and improving their newly acquired club room in Queen Street. A new fence between their block and that of Mr J. Kellock has been completed and Mr Kellock paid three quarters of the cost.  Mr John McBride has donated the cost of the front fence â€“ low brick with a cyclone top.  Mr J. Kellock will also pay half the cost of the back fence, which runs north-south.  Mr John McBride is also arranging for repairs and renovations to the building.  Mr W. Carpenter has donated paint and has volunteered to do the interior re-decoration and members are doing the external painting.  R.C. Lott offered the timber for fences at cost.  T.R. Rogers donated half the two-inch pipe for the fence.  The Town Council will assist in tidying up the creek area at the rear of the block.  The rest of the block will be grassed and have playground equipment for the children.  The proceeds from the Annual Air Force Ball on 1 June will go towards this project.
