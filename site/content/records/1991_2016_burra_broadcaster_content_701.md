Last Steam Train to Burra

There was great excitement in Burra when the railway from Adelaide was opened in 1870.  The railway then pressed on north to become an important link in the SA network, linking Adelaide with Broken Hill, Perth and Central Australia.  Now 20th century transport has hastened the decline of the line and it will be closed to passenger traffic at the end of September and freight trains seem likely to cease soon as well.  The Australian Railway Historical Society and SteamRanger are marking this historic event with a special last run featuring two locomotives representative of the line.  The locomotives will be either Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey or more likely The Duke of Edinburgh and Alco Diesel 958.  The train will depart Adelaide at 8 a.m. and return about 8.30 p.m.  Loco 621 The Duke of Edinburgh will lead the train from Adelaide.  It was typical of passenger trains on the line in the 1940s and 1950s.  If a larger train is required then extra centenary cars will be added and loco 520 Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey will have to head the heavier load.  Arrival at Burra is expected at 1 p.m. and there will be a break there of about 1Â½ hours.  There are no turning facilities at Burra for large locomotives and so the steam locomotive will have to return tender first with the Diesel 958 doing all the work.  There will be slow journey back, starting from Burra at about 2.30 p.m.  There will be generous photo stops en route.
