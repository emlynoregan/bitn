Editorial on The Waterworks.

We had thought that the Town Council was behaving in a needlessly offensive way towards the Hydraulic Engineer in demanding the particulars of the costs of the Waterworks.  We had in our simplicity thought the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department would take items on actual cost and the Council would have to pay the interest on this whether it seemed excessive or not, knowing that the expenditure had been under the watchful eye of the resident engineer, Mr Jobson.  The particulars now to hand are so peculiar as to justify the Council’s stand.  Some seem to point either to wilful falsification or to grave blundering.  All the Council inherited from the old Aberdeen Waterworks is the pipe main and it is impossible it should have cost £960.  Other prices set down are almost beyond belief.  As we understand full particulars will follow we refrain now from comment except that the statement that pipes are quoted at cost in Adelaide does not match indents in the Public Works report where we find the prices cited are at an advance of no less than 75%.
