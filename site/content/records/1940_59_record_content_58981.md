Accident.  A Citroen sedan collided with a tractor and grader near Schuyler’s Crossing 2½ miles south of Mt Bryan on 6 May.  The car, driven by Mrs A.C. Farrant of Broken Hill, was travelling north and Ross Day of the BBDC was travelling south.  Mrs Farrant was apparently passing a semi-trailer in a cloud of dust when the accident occurred.  She was treated for shock and bruises and the car was extensively damaged.  The tractor lost an off-side front wheel and sustained a bent axle.
