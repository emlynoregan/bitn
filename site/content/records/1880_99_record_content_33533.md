Broken Hill Railway.  The NSW Government has refused to allow a 5’3” gauge line to be laid to Broken Hill.  The SA Government will now consider laying a third rail from Terowie to Port Adelaide.  [Which would have allowed narrow gauge traffic an uninterrupted run from Broken Hill to Port Adelaide.  It was never constructed.]
