Letter.  Rosemary Seaford writes re Burra Girl Guides.  She joined seven local guides at a practice training camp at Burra Creek Gorge and was impressed by the improvements that have been made there and congratulates the camp’s leaders Sharon O’Connor, Debra Spackman & Emily Spackman for their teaching of skills to the girls and for their organisation of the camp.
