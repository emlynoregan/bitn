Not Cricket!  Aberdeen played Manoora at Manoora on Good Friday.  Manoora 53 & 144 defeated Aberdeen 66 & 31 for 6 when Aberdeen forfeited.  The Aberdeen captain withdrew from the ground following his brother, H. O’Brien’s dishonourable conduct in arguing with the umpire after being twice clean bowled and once stumped.
