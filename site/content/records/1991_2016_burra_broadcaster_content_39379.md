BCS students are preparing to launch a high altitude balloon called Wilkins 1.  If successful, it will record data and images from heights of more than 20 km.  The craft weighs 500 g and is designed to film for more than three hours and to operate in sub minus temperatures and at almost no air pressure.  This is part of the UniSA Connect Program and involves a group of about 40 students from the Mid North and Yorke Peninsula.  BCS students involved are Riley Webster, Sam Haddow, Kieran Le Vagueresse and Grace Paert.  The four recently travelled to UniSA’s Maths & Science Centre at Mawson Lakes in a full day workshop of the STEM Career Network.
