Kooringa Methodist Church was crowded on Tuesday on both the floor and gallery for the special missionary meeting with the President of Conference and Dr Brown and his Missionary Party.  There was a well-attended meeting in the afternoon.  Revs W. Jeffries, W.H. Hanton & Dr Brown took part, but the piece de resistance was a delightful address by Rev. Daniel Lotu of Fiji.  The collection was Â£1-8-0.
