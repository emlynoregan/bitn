Wind Farm Rejected

Regional Council of Goyder’s Development Assessment Panel rejected a major new Stony Gap Wind Farm proposal from TRUenergy, citing noise-related health issues as the reason when it met last Wednesday.  This is the first wind farm proposal to be rejected by a council since the State Government’s legislation was passed in 2011.  Concerns including sleep deprivation, low frequency noise and vibrations were to the fore, with complainants fearing the issues that have cause complaints from residents living near the Waterloo Wind Farm.  Elected members of the panel Crs Peter Dunn and Jane Kellock were not convinced by the answers supplied by TRUenergy and with the support of Mei Lin Schwarz the proposal was rejected 3 to 2.

TRUenergy will now consider its options.
