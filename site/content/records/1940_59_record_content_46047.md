Accident.  Head on Collision.  At 5.45 p.m. on Saturday a car in charge of M. Ryan was standing near the 4-mile peg on the Baldina Road when a car driven by N. Cains of Caroona Station crashed into it, forcing it back some 20 yards and then turning it over.  One child occupant crawled out and another had to be pulled out.  Mr A. Reed came along almost immediately and conveyed the injured to Burra.  Mrs Ryan was treated at Burra Hospital and Mr Cains was admitted with head injuries.  Both cars were old style tourers.
