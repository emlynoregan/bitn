‘Ratepayer’ writes re ‘Where are we?’ of the previous issue.  At the last meeting of Council a letter of sympathy was sent to Mr Pryor.  This was an insult to Mr Pryor and sent with no good feelings toward him.  If published it would open the eyes of ratepayers.  The Council made no complaint against him while working; therefore they should be fair and honest with him.
