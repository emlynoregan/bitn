Redruth Court.

John W. Pickering, junior porter, alleged that Martha Gully set her dog on him resulting in torn pants and a bitten leg when he tried to remove her from the station platform for which she had no ticket.  Miss Gully said Pickering had torn her dress and she did not know the dog had followed her from home.  Both sides produced witnesses and eventually the court decided Gully was guilty and fined her 5/- plus costs.

Two visitors to Burra, John Glass and Patrick Duggan, were charged with stealing two pairs of boots valued at 2/11 a pair from Martin Pederson, boot and shoe maker of Kooringa.  They were found wearing the boots on Saturday night in the Burra Hotel.  They pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 1 month in gaol.
