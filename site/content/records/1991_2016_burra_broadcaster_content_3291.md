Burra Swimming Pool

It was decided at last Weekâ€™s meeting that the pool would be open to the public as soon as gates were installed on the gymnasium verandah and this is being worked towards in haste.  The meeting decided that the school could use the pool for swimming activities, which have included swimming lessons.  More trees will be planted and further landscaping will occur between the bus bay and the canteen.  The site is to be smoke-free.
