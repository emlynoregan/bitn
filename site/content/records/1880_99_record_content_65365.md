Editorial on The Festive Season

The year began hopefully and the season opened splendidly for farmers and pastoralists.  Sowing and germination went well with rain to the end of August, but than drought set in and 1898 will be another failed year.

‘Still, we have much to be thankful for, and in many ways, although we have met diversity [sic] and have been disappointed in some respects, we have been protected and preserved through another year by our Creator.’

The colony enjoys British freedom and peace.

The editor then goes on with the usual Christmas greetings and good cheer and expresses the confident hope of returning prosperity locally with the re-opening of the mine.  The paper can claim a wider range of business and wider area of circulation than any contemporary outside Adelaide.
