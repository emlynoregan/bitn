SA Supreme Court.

There is a long report of a civil case: William Killicoat v. The National Bank of Australasia Ltd.

Essentially the case arose from a mortgage the bank gave Killicoat and on which it foreclosed.  Killicoat made ten rather lengthy claims in his case against the bank, but the core of the matter were the claims they had exceeded their power to sell, had included charges that were neither reasonable nor legitimate and had sold greatly more stock than they were entitled to, so causing him considerable financial damage.  He entered a claim for £3,554.

Among the complaints was that he had not received an adequate statement from the mortgagee in possession.  After hearing a lot of evidence Mr Justice Boucaut said that the Bank had sold in excess of its claim and ordered the disclosure of accounts.  He then gave an opinion that if counsel were agreed on this point they would be well advised to settle before returning after an adjournment he had to make because of criminal sittings the following week.

[Mr J.H. Symon, appearing for Killicoat, said the bank had sold £1,300 worth of sheep, when their claim at the time was for £350.]
