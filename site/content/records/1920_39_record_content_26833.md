Burra Town Council, 7 May

M.A. Radford and others objected to Graham St being fenced off and to rubbish being deposited in St Just St.

J.E. Pearce was given permission to build a house in Chapel St for Miss L. Harris and E.J. Harris was given permission to erect a motor shed in the same street.

The Inspector has 15 cases on the books for infringements of by-law 30 and has been attending to stray horses and cattle.  He (E.J. Davey) also complains of interference in his work by a Councillor ‘who so overstepped the mark and for a time forgot that he was a member of the Burra Town Council’.

The report then makes clear that Cr Woollacott had been caught infringing the by-law and subsequently when Mr Davey had parked in front of Messrs Bright & Bright’s offices, the Councillor had proceeded to measure the distance from the corner.  Mr Davey said he was protected from prosecution while in the execution of his duty (he had been talking to M-C Geering).  He declared Cr Woollacott’s action to be ‘an absolute insult, this sort of thing is bringing the council down, in the eyes of the public, to the level of a schoolboy class’.

Cr Woollacott asked how it was interfering with the Inspector’s work.

Davey said: ‘You impersonated an Inspector.’

Cr Woollacott wanted legal advice from the Municipal Association on the validity of asking people on the street to pay instead of going to court and whether, if they subsequently went to court and were acquitted, they would get their 5/- back.

Cr Woollacott said Mr Davey’s car was wrongly parked for a long time, though he himself only stopped two seconds.  Mr Davey said it was half an hour.

Cr Woollacott did not believe it right that the Inspector should be breaking the very by-law he was handing out fines for violating.  He had been parked 14’6” from the corner and it should have been 25’.  The Town Clerk said the law refers to the near side wheel and not the offside as Cr Woollacott had measured and his position was legal.

The argument continued for some time.

The Mayor said at the sale he had heard a dozen men laughing about the matter, which makes a laughing stock of the by-laws.

Cr Pearce regretted that people had reflected on the Council as a whole, when the matter was between one Councillor and the Inspector.

Cr Harris said he was under his verandah when it occurred and the Inspector’s car seemed from there to be incorrectly parked and several ratepayers there had that impression.  He saw Cr Woollacott go across, but did not see what followed.

The Inspector’s report was finally adopted except for the phrase which reflected on the Council as a whole.

The cemetery bridge has been repaired.

Cr Pearce said the bridge near Mr Finch’s past the cemetery was unsafe.

Cr Woollacott said in his opinion a single span concrete bridge would be the most effective and cheapest solution.  Measurements and estimates of cost will be obtained.

The Local Government Department will pay for one side if Council will pay for the other, of the cost of extending the tar on the sides of the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen.
