A cryptic paragraph says that a ‘coloured individual, who is well, but not favourably known, in the town’ has arrived and that Luke refused to act as this ‘coloured fellow’s agent.’  [There is a reference to this person as Aaron, so in view of the advertisement on page 2, he seems likely to have been Aaron Lewis.]
