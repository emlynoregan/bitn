Sgt Kain of Redruth advised that the Government had approved additional food rations for Christmas and an extra cash grant of 10/- for a man and 10/- for his wife and 2/6 a child to a maximum of 22/6 for a family for those on rations.  This amount had to be worked for.  Among the names Sgt Kain submitted for Burra were about 20 from Mongolata which Council considered were outside its district.  The total granted for Burra was about Â£30.  It was resolved to place the list of unemployed with the Overseer and for Ward Councillors to find the work to be done.
