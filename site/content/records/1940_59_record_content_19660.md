Obituary.  Mt John Carmichael, probably the oldest former soldier in Victoria, has died at Red Cliffs aged 95.  He was born in Burra SA in 1849 and went to Victoria when aged two and moved around the goldfields there with his father.  The latter then joined the armed forces in New Zealand.  John Carmichael later joined his father and also served with the forces there for two years, fighting in the Maori Wars.  He married in 1882 and took up land at Red Cliffs [near Mildura] in Victoria.  He is survived by his wife who is 87 and by nine children.
