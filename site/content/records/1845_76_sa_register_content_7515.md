Kooringa Magistrate’s Court, before Henry Chambers & George Bull. 10 November

Mr Fitzgerald wanted to know the result of the message Mr Grant was ordered by the Magistrates to convey to Mr Ewbank.

Mr Ewbank said he only wished the payment to be withheld for three weeks so he could ascertain correctly the amount due to the complainant.

Mr Fitzgerald said that under the Masters and Servants Act the Bench had no alternative but to grant a warrant of distress.

Mr Ewbank said he would have no objection to paying the money into Court provided it remained there until all the wood was brought in.

Dr Bull pointed out a clause allowing the defendant the right of appeal and said Mr Ewbank could have availed himself of that option.

After further legal argument it was agreed that half the money be paid now and the remainder in three weeks.

Thomas Viant was charged with being drunk and disorderly in the Miners’ Arms and with assaulting William Richardson.  He was fined 5/- for being drunk and 10/- for the assault and ordered to pay 1/6 for broken glasses.
