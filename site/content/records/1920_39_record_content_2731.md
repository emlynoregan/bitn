The Mayor has written that considering Burraâ€™s record in the war effort it was worthy of more than ordinary recognition.

Dr Steele has resigned as Health Officer and Dr Ashton wrote applying for the position.  Cr Radford objected on the grounds that the doctors were controlling who was to get the job and he thought that inappropriate.  He moved that Dr Steele be re-appointed.

The Mayor thought it better to so settle a matter of dispute that had been in the town for years.

Dr Ashton was appointed.
