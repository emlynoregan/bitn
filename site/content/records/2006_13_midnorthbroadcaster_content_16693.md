Burra’s 22nd Antique & Collectables Fair last weekend attracted crowds almost reminiscent of Copper Festival days.  Organisers were thrilled with the success.  There were lots of visitors and the town was abuzz with activity.  There was plenty of activity at Burra North too where antique shops, markets and garage sales drew plenty of interest.  The Clare Concert Band and Bold as Brass supplied music for the event.
