A Fight took place last weekend between youths in Burra.  Some of them later sought hospital treatment.  After the fight some youths from Burra and Adelaide were involved in a chase along a dirt road at Leighton.  One vehicle forced another off the road and into a tree.  Some Burra youths then located a parked car nearby and began to smash it with fence posts.
