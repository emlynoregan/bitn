Obituary/Inquest.  The inquest on the death of Edward Gascoigne was resumed on 20 August.  Dr Dashwood was re-sworn.  He said he saw the body three hours after death and made a post mortem examination.  The body was very livid; the countenance very pinched; pupils dilated, indicative of intense suffering.  [The evidence then goes on to describe the state of various organs.]

The deceased died from an attack of acute peritonitis.  The symptoms of the disease very much resemble those of arsenical poisoning.  He had removed the stomach and a portion of the other viscera and tested for arsenic, antimony and strychnine, but found no trace of any of them.  He despatched the material to the Colonial Surgeon for a second opinion, but was clearly of the opinion that the deceased died of acute peritonitis of not more than 48 hours’ standing.

William Ey of Adelaide, analytical chemist, reported receiving the viscera etc.  A white powder in the stomach proved to be magnesia.  No trace was found of either mineral or vegetable poisons.  The white powder in the prisoner’s box was carbonate of magnesia.

The jury returned a verdict that the deceased had died from natural causes.

The coroner then discharged the prisoner, quite clear of any stain upon her character, so far as the charge was concerned.
