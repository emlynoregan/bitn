Burra Town Council, 16 August

Highways and Local Government Department advised that the grant in aid for expenditure on other than main roads was £275 for the year and the District Road Grant was £100 with Council’s contribution to be £100.  The Clerk said he has applied for £300 and suspected the £100 was a misprint.  An enquiry will be made.

The Mayor reported on the Civic Reception and other activities of the New Zealand visitors recently.
