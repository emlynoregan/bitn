First Burra Wolf Cub Pack in connection with St Mary’s Church.  This was organised under the leadership of Mr L.H. Miller and continued by Rev. F.B. Hewitson and then by Rev. J.S.W. Coles.  Head officials have regarded this as a closed pack and desired it become open to anyone who wished to join.  The present acting cubmaster has decided to open it to any lads of suitable age.  On Easter Monday there was a camp at the Gorge for three days and they had a good time despite considerable rain.
