Burra Mine

There is a photo of the old open cut with Morphett’s Engine & Winding Houses and chimney along with Peacock’s Engine House & chimney, with instructions to see the bottom of page 3 for a photo of the same area with the new open cut in operation.  [The 1972 photo actually appears on page 2.]
