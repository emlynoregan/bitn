National Trust

A Junior Branch of the National Trust has been formed within the Community School.  The inaugural meeting was on 15 April.  President, Brenton Henriks; Vice-President, Anthony Lloyd; Secretary, Daryl McGuire; Treasurer, Anthony Quinn and works foreman, Mark Hopkins.

The group’s present major objective is the completion of the restoration work at the Bon Accord building.  The Senior Branch is removing the Queen Victoria letter receiver from its position in Commercial Street to allocation opposite the Barker Homes near the Hospital, where it will once more be on active service.

The town’s original fire engine will be kept in running order and will be seen at special events.

[In the paper of 4 May, page 7, this was corrected to say that the comparatively recently retired 1930s Diamond T fire brigade will be kept in running order.]

The restoration of the Powder Magazine is nearing completion.

The new waterproof surface replaces the original roof platting.  The stonework will soon be re-pointed and an iron gate placed at the entrance.

Borers have attacked the roofing timbers at the restored dugouts.

BCS will conduct a recreation program for young people during the May school vacation.  Mr Richard Bednall, the Physical Education teacher, will organise the program.  Community involvement now includes card evenings and a yoga group.

Mr Bob Steel, President of Burra RSL, addressed an assembly of students from Year 4 to Year 12 on the significance of Anzac Day at an assembly on Friday.
