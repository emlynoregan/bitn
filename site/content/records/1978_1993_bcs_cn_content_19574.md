Burra Printing Press etc.

The purchase has now been completed with the aid of a large final donation from the Advertiser.  The small equipment, posters etc. are stored at the National Trust Archives while the large machinery remains in the old Record building.  The new lessees of the building have agreed to the presses remaining in their original room and would like to make a feature of them.  A committee to make decisions about the display of this valuable part of Burraâ€™s history is now needed.  Anyone interested should contact Maureen or Barry Wright.
