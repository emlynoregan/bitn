Cr Robinson said the ward fee per patient was now 10/- a day.  Many patients did not pay this much and it was still to be the fee unless the assessment was that they were unable to pay.  The hospital had lost 28/- a month on each patient admitted.  The Hospital is to be asked to provide a monthly report to Council.
