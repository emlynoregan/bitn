Burra Town Council, 21 January

The Burra electric Supply Co. advised that the line to the Burra Hospital had been completely rewired and there was no possibility of ETSA doing anything to the line prior to 30 June 1958.  The agreement has been completed by the company and is in the hands of the Trust for signature.

The ABC advises that the SA Symphony Orchestra will visit Burra 21 August 1957, offering a free concert matinee for children and an evening concert for the public.  It was resolved to make the Town Hall available.

Tenders are to be called for work on the new CWA room at the Town Hall.

[Page 2 tenders say for the replacement of a lath and plaster ceiling by a fibrous plaster one and painting.]
