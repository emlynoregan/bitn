Obituary.  Gottlieb Wilhelm Heinrich died and was buried at Point Pass on 19 April.  He was long prominent in public affairs there and a liberal supporter of charitable causes.  His untiring efforts had much to do with getting Warren water brought to the district.  He was born at Hallett Valley near Tanunda on 2 July 1854 and as a young man was a member of the Bethany Brass Band, Bethany Young Men’s Society and the church Choir.  In 1876, with his brother Ernst, he took up land east of World’s End at Baldina and on 5 February 1880 he married Anna Emilie Hetzel.  Four year’s later after bad times he was forced to move to World’s End where, closer to the ranges, he lived for 40 years.  In 1924 he moved to Point Pass.  In 1930 the couple celebrated their golden wedding.  Mrs Heinrich died on 26 May 1936 and he died on 17 April 1940, aged 86.  He is survived by six sons, four daughters, 26 grandchildren, and a brother at Tanunda.   [Died 17 April 1940 Point Pass.]
