Football.  The Premiership at Booborowie on Saturday:

Kooringa	1.1	1.4	3.5	6.7	(43)

Booborowie	0.2	0.6	3.10	4.10	(24)

Last Wednesday the Kooringa Football Club held a Ball in the Burra Institute to finish off the season and celebrate the premiership.  We believe it was the best attended for the season.
