Burra and the Rail Strike

The town is just about coping.  Mail services have been disrupted.  The first mail delivered by truck arrived at 10 p.m. having been scheduled for 10.30 a.m.  Hotel keepers and tobacconists have had trouble maintaining supplies.  Local businessmen are doing their own transporting from Adelaide.  Egg transport is in trouble, with stacks of empty crates in Adelaide and no way of returning them.  Adelaide is short of eggs, while storekeepers in the country have eggs going bad.  Bran, pollard and chaff supplies are another area of difficulty.  Big transports are becoming a familiar sight, taking freight and passengers to Broken Hill.  Passenger bus times compare more than favourably with trains.  A Pioneer bus recently left Adelaide at 6.10 a.m. and got into Burra only a little over two hours later.  Thank goodness there is no petrol rationing.
