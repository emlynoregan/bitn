Characteristics of the 1906 paper.

Page 1

A useful business directory for the town.

Large advertisements that were a mixture of local and others.

Page 2

A town directory with information on Municipal Officers, Markets, the Institute, Banks, Postal Matters, the Court, Train Timetables, Lodges, Cabs, District Council and Churches.

Then large advertisements, mostly of local origin.

Page 3

Advertisements, some of which look deceptively like news items.  Sometimes a news item, but rarely if ever local.

Page 4

Some smaller advertisements: sales and public notices.  Local news dominates the page.

Page 5

Local news and reports from regions and Adelaide etc.  Also padding in the form of humour and quirky items from around the world.

Page 6

Some advertisements that look like news, more ‘fillers’ some other advertisements and sometimes some reading matter.  For most weeks from 24 January to 11 July there was an episode from Charles White’s Australian Bushranging.

Pages 7 & 8

Large advertisements.
