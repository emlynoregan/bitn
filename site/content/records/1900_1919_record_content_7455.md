Court.

There was a family dispute over two lots of wandering fowls that has resulted in George and Frank Ford not talking to one another.

[A court case was reported with a lengthy explanation of an essentially trivial matter in the paper of 25 February 1903]

A second court case arising out of the incidents is reported in this issue.
