The Abberton under Capt. Pain arrived last Sunday, having left Plymouth on 1 September.  It carried 8 passengers in the cabin and 185 steerage emigrants.  (63 men + 63 women + 59 children)

It brings news of the sale of two parcels of ore at Swansea on 19 August

[* The fraction here is illegible.]

Average price £13-19-3 per ton.

By comparison a recent sale of Cornish and Devonshire copper ores of 3,015 tons had a highest price of £9-17-6 per ton for 77 tons and the average yield of 9¼% for an average price of £5-15-6 per ton.

Several parcels have now realised above £30 per ton and one kind of ore now very prevalent will certainly realise £40 per ton.
