Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc. AGM, 20 June.

Despite curtailed expenditure much good was done.  The wood list has had to be cut down drastically.  Freemason’s Lodge regularly sends a cheque.  The Society would be pleased if others did so as well.  Regrettably the President, Rev. J.A. Andrews died during the year.  Elected were

President, Rev. V.R. Secombe; Vice-Presidents, Rev. C. Gray, Rev. N. Usher & Mrs A.B. Riggs; Hon. Sec., Miss H. Wilkinson; Minute Sec. & Treasurer, Mr A.H. Strong.
