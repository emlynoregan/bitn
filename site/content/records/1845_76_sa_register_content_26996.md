‘Vox Populi’ writes in response to C.B.T. re Sir Henry Ayers.

He says the very example cited in support of Sir Henry hardly adds to his credit.

The writer says: ‘I have come to the conclusion that he has always been a waiter upon other people’s enterprise, having as far as is publicly known never done anything to assist in developing the resources of South Australia, so also in politics he is a waiter upon other people’s ideas.’

It is true he took a prominent part in bringing about what are known as Goyder’s valuations, but he was led by a very much more able man in J.H. Barrow.  It is also acknowledged that the enforcement of those valuations was disastrous.  Not only did they ruin the prospects of the most important interests of the colony, but they also produced a strong reaction, in consequence of which the squatters were allowed their runs on long leases, on improved conditions at about half their value.  In some years this meant a loss to SA of at least £40,000 – and some leases have many years to run.

‘The fact is Sir H. Ayers is a most painstakingly methodical man, very useful in formalities and comparatively small matters, … but, like most men of detail, he is deficient in any work requiring originality of thought or boldness of conception, and as a statesman capable of initiating any policy suited to the wants of a young and growing colony with great resources like this he is a complete failure.  The one thing his friend C.T.B. gives him credit for was undertaken with eyes shut, and with little or no thought as to the consequences.’
