Booborowie Football Club AGM is reported in 1 column.  Elected: Patron, G.S. Hawker; President, Frank Sullivan; Secretary, Barry Dinham; Captain, Kevin Cousins; Vice-Captain, Colin Treloar and Coach, Frank Willis.

A proposal to install showers in rooms adjoining the present dressing rooms was deferred as a quote suggested a cost of over Â£400.  It was thought better to wait a year or two and build new dressing rooms in a grandstand.
