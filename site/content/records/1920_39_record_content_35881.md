Weather.  Optimistic expectations of agriculture were modified somewhat when Monday produced a blinding dust storm.  It blew all Monday night too, but some showers on Tuesday helped to keep the dust down.  To the east Monday was as ‘black’ a day as any on record.  N.H. McBride started from Ki-Ora about 4.30 p.m. for the 45 mile trip to Burra, but was forced to turn around after a quarter of a mile, a journey that took 20 minutes, so thick was the dust.  He had difficulty breathing.  Inside the house with the electric light on it was not possible to see pictures on the wall 24ft away.  He tried again about 7 p.m., but ran into another storm and had great difficulty in reaching Kellock’s at Thistlebeds where he had to turn the car around and have a rest.  He finally reached Burra at 11.15 p.m.  Prior to the start of the storm the eastern country was looking good, but unless rain falls soon the dust on the vegetation will wreak havoc.  The dust storms continued out east on Tuesday.
