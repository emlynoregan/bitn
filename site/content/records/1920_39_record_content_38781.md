Burra Town Council, 20 July

Unemployment Relief Council has allotted Burra £6-11-3 for leather and underclothes for necessitous children under 14.

L.M. Gordon asked the Council to sell or lease to him 27ft of the allotment between his residence and that of Dr Steven.

The Mayor said that as it was a right of way such action would have to be approved by the Department and a single objection from an adjacent ratepayer could stop it and as Mr Gare was known to object it was pointless to proceed.

Cr Bevan said Mr Gordon’s plan would improve the street and Mr Gare had already blocked the road with an embankment at the top.

Cr Pearce said the Council made it.

Cr Button valued it at £2 a foot and moved it be left as it is.

Rubbish on the road between Mr Gordon’s and Dr Steven’s is to be cleared up and local residents warned not to place further rubbish there.

The old quarry on the same hill is to be levelled off as it was an eyesore.

Kooringa Methodist Church held a full choral service last Sunday evening under the leadership of G.E. Dane.  Rev. H.S. Jarvis officiated.
