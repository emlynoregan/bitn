Burra traders’ Association is calling a meeting for 12 July to consider its future.  The few active members are unable to continue the effort to put on the Christmas events in Market Square, but don’t want to let down those who really enjoy the nights.  Another consideration is the new obligations of paying $700 to close Commercial Street for 30 minutes.
