SA Elections: Mr Stocks at the Burra

Mr Stocks arrived at the Burra on Friday 16 May.  A public meeting was held on Saturday in the large room at the Burra Hotel.  Mr Stocks was enthusiastically greeted and Mr Gumer of Aberdeen was voted into the chair.

[Not certainly identified, but probably Richard Gummer.]

In introducing Mr Stocks the Chairman said that Mr Stocks had not intended to address a public gathering, but had agreed to do so in compliance with their wishes.  There will be a public meeting on Monday evening.

He began by extolling the success of the colony in such a short time: â€˜A few years ago it was inhabited only by natives and look at its high and rising position now.  They needed to be careful in laying the political foundations of the country, having seen both the excellences and the defects of the mother-country.

[He went on at some length and some of his points were:

He was in favour of universal suffrage.

He favoured voting by ballot.

He had seen most of the Directors of the SA Mining Association and had been assured they would not influence a single vote and he had assurances from Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Company to the same effect.

He favoured steps for the intellectual improvement of the people

Steps needed to be taken to promote education of children in the bush.

He was a strong supporter of Sunday schools.]
