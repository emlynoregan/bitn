A Trip to Kooringa in 1850.  Reprinted from the Register in 1850.

An SA colonist who has not visited Burra has neglected to inspect a marvel.  It is a triumph of co-operative enterprise, liberality and economy, as credible to its directors as it is profitable to its owners and beneficial to the colony.  I enquired as to the most expeditious and cheapest mode of visiting Burra Burra.  A seat was suggested in the travelling chariot with the Directors on one of their periodic visits to the Mine.  Not knowing the Directors and not wishing to wait for such a grand occasion, I took a seat in the mail cart, a van-shaped vehicle covered with canvas and capable of containing about ten passengers.  The proprietor, whose easy manner put everyone in good humour, managed to stow twelve in it.  Even an old lady whose bonnet box was cruelly crushed declared that no one could be angry with Mr Chambers.  He went at a brisk pace through Hindmarsh, descending gullies and scaling banks with great confidence.  When conversation began when we got fairly on the lower road, each assured the rest that the dust was intolerable.  One of the passengers said he had just returned from California, of which he gave a graphic account.  He had saved a good sum at the Burra Burra and wishing to try his fortune in exchanging copper for gold, set off for San Francisco.  His degree of success could be judged from his wasted face and squalid appearance.  [His story then continues for several paragraphs.]

We left Adelaide at c. 3.30 p.m. and reached Gawler Town at about 7 p.m.  We put up at the Old Spot where Mr Schmidt maintained the reputation of the place established by its founder, Mr Calton.  The next morning the group divided.  The Kapunda passengers went on in a spring cart.  Burra Burra passengers continued in a spring cart without any covering.  The horses too were greatly inferior and had but one shoe among the four of them and one with a swollen leg and the others with worn hoofs, so that it was with great difficulty they were induced to move at all.  On arrival at She Oak Log there were no fresh horses ready and the mail was handed over to the driver of the spring cart, which could proceed much faster.  Progress to Kapunda was slow and one of the passengers had often to alight to flog the crippled horse, but eventually the driver was compelled to set it free – which had he done it at first would have saved much time.

We breakfasted at Ferrant’s just on entering Kapunda where everything was in good order and readiness, despite our very delayed arrival.  Newcomers of the roughest class joined the vehicle here and soon made a seat in the mail cart a very unenviable position.  One of the men was a fine specimen of the ‘old colonial bore’, who insisted on recounting his hair-raising adventures.  He was, however, eclipsed by the arrival of an Irish wench whose gross language and forward behaviour is beyond description.  The coarse behaviour and conversation continued till we reached the Burra Hotel.

At the Burra Hotel it was Saturday night and the part set aside for the sale of strong drink was full of people in every condition from sober through exhilarated and joyous to quarrelsome and singing and crying drunk.  Germans were singing a chorus in one corner and Welsh smelters were listening to a Celtic solo in another.  Cornish miners, English and Scotch mechanics and Irish labourers all combined to swell the mighty discord.

In contrast the hotel rooms were spacious, cool and well-furnished apartments, where the din of voices was softened by distance.  The waiter glided noiselessly about and I enjoyed a hearty dinner and went out for a moonlight view of Kooringa.  It differed in no respect from any other thriving town.  There were a number of large shops and a great concourse of people marketing in a quiet and orderly fashion.  I did not see one policeman, nor any occasion for one.

(Note [presumably by Ian Auhl]: the towns of Redruth and Aberdeen had only been laid out in August 1849, which explains why the writer does not refer to them.  The population of Kooringa including the dugouts was 4,300 in 1850.)

The next day was Sunday and the Sabbath was strictly observed.  Besides the [Anglican] Church there were chapels for the Wesleyans, Independents and Primitive Methodists and the Roman Catholics and divine service in a private house.

There are several streets and the houses are generally well built.  In some places are rows of substantial stone cottages built by the company.  The chimneys of one of them having as much masonry as would suffice for two of the flimsy building society cottages which disgrace the streets of Adelaide.  There seems to be an abundance of good stone in Kooringa, which the inhabitants are putting to good use.

One of Kooringa’s most singular features is the subterranean habitations of ‘The Creek’.  For a distance of more than two miles the banks of a ravine are perforated with vaulted chambers in which a populous are living in apparent health and comfort.  From above those dwellings (to which some future etymologist, with the accuracy characteristic of his study, will trace the name of Burra (Burrow)), present a squalid, but exceedingly diversified and picturesque appearance.  Some are quite cottage-like in their exterior, having stone fronts, well proportioned doors and windows, with verandahs and fences guarding the approach.  In those cases the earth is cut away to give a perpendicular front and that secures a sort of terrace before the door.  But in many instances there is merely a horizontal cut running far enough into the bank to gain a height for an approach to a door with a similar cut of smaller proportions for a window and the rest of the house is a perforation of the bank continued from these apertures.  In most cases the chimney is level with the surface, or raised a foot or two by a pile of a few stones or partially embedding a headless flour or ale cask.  Accidents sometimes happen when night walkers fall down the chimneys.  Their arms generally arrest their descent, but they remain caught until rescued by an occupant from below, either furious or friendly as the case may be.

On Monday I visited the Mine, which is situated on the side of a hill.  A considerable stream of water flows down the acclivity fed by the steam engine, which works incessantly day and night raising nearly 800 gallons of water every minute.  Diverted into suitable channels, it carries on the work of washing ore and an immense space is occupied by heaps of rich green and blue ore in every stage of preparation, from the immense masses sent up by the miners to be washed and pulverised and carefully packed into canvas bags for removal by bullock drays to the port, or to the smelting works of the Patent Copper Co. on the other side of the creek.  Under extensive sheds men and boys of all sizes carry on the operation of ore crushing etc.
