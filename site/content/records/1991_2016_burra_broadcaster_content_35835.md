Burra National Parks and Wildlife Office

Was established 4Â½ years ago.

Ian Falkenberg appointed District Ranger.

There were then three Conservation Parks in the Mid North, with a combined area of 3,000 ha.

Now there are 8 reserves totalling c. 85,000 ha.

The most recent addition is Bimbowrie Station in the Northeast Pastoral Area, comprising 75,000 ha.

Bimbowrie Station is dominated by granite and sandstone hills, river gum water courses and chenopod shrub land plains.  It is rich in geological features and Aboriginal heritage.  It is currently being destocked and visits are by appointment only.  (About 6,500 head so far removed with c. 500 to come.)

Darren Wilson has recently been appointed Works Supervisor at Bimbowrie.

Darren has also removed from the new reserve c. 150 feral goats and fox baiting will follow to protect Yellow-footed Rock Wallabies.

Senior Ranger Michael Freak has been undertaking a fish survey in Baldina Creek, assisted by Friends of Burra Parks.  No native fish were found in the deep pools of Baldina Creek at Redbanks.

A Heysen Trail shelter has been erected at Caroona Creek Conservation Park, where about 50 feral goats have recently been culled.
