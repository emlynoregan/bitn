‘In cellar Cool’ was a performance in the Old Brewery Cellars organised by the Burra Tennis Club last Saturday.  About 240 people attended to hear Normie Kush’s Adelaide Jazz Band playing some hot Dixieland jazz.  At the end of one of the tunnels old film clips from the 1950s, 60s and 70s were screened.  A coffee shop was set up in another tunnel.
