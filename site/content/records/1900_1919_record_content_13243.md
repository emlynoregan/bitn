Eroni’s Circus drew a fair attendance.  It was the largest and most complete circus since the time of Cooper & Bailey.  They came via the Mt Bryan Road and formed a procession over ¾ mile long – stretching from the Kooringa Post Office to the Royal Exchange Hotel.  There were 100 horses. The tent erected was one of their small ones, but had a capacity ‘of many thousands of people’ [sic!].  They played Thursday & Friday.  The family, which is large, is teetotal.
