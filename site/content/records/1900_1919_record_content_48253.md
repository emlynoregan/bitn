Black Springs Red Cross Society Report.  The interesting sentence is that which reveals that the barn to which they had fled after the hall secretary asked for hall fees was that of Mr W. Turner ‘which has been generously lent for the purpose’. 

[From the letter on page 4 W. Turner appears to be the father of W. Howard Turner of Leighton, who had featured in the correspondence.]
