Burra Town Council.

Correspondence with the Railway commissioner re the restoration of the Saturday night train continues.

Enquiries re possible electric light schemes also continue. Mr Christie of Messrs Christie & Gardner was present re their electric light proposal.

The main question was whether it was better to have a large and small generator or a large generator and storage battery.  Mr Christie said in theory a small town should be better off with a battery because it enabled continuous service without having to run an engine continuously, BUT a battery cost c. £1,000 and because it was impossible to get engineers who understood them well its average life was not over 5 years.  Their firm would therefore recommend one engine of 100 h.p. for the heavy evening load until about 11.30 p.m. and a small automatic 15 h.p. engine to carry the load from 11.30 p.m. to daylight.  This could run for six hours without needing attention.  When told that Jamestown would not be without its battery he said their experience was only of 12 months and a battery would be good for a year or two.  The best one he knew was at Numurkah in Victoria, which with extraordinary care had lasted 6½ years and might go another six months.  With a battery a 70 h.p. engine would do.  If they went for the automatic set option they would need to have a boy on the premises when it operated.  He would send them an estimate of the relative costs of the alternatives over 5 years.

The Hydraulic Engineer will be asked about the possibility of using electricity to pump the town’s water and the railways will also be approached about their usage.
