Burra Town Council, 31 Jan.

The Institute sent a delegation re the cutting down of the street and footpath at the Institute and expressed concern about the fence that is encroaching two feet onto the footpath at the southern end, tapering to nothing at the north.  The committee considers an advantage is to be obtained by moving the fence to its correct position and even if it remains the cost of changing the entrance and underpinning the retaining wall will be c. £60.  The Council would need to consider the request to allow the wall to stay and will report on it later.

Rev. Richards and Messrs Launder and Roberts reported on the dangerous state of culverts near the front of the Bible Christian Church.  This was referred to the Public Works Committee.
