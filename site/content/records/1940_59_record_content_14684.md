Burra Town Council, 16 August

The Burra North water trough needs replacing.  Mr Sara offers one at cost price, but the Council has one in stock and will use that.

The Finance Committee will consider the tender of £200 to paint the town woodwork.

A slow down sign is to be erected in the lane alongside Mr Coverdale’s pharmacy.
