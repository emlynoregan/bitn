Weather.  Rain fell in the district in the last day or so.  It is too late to be of much benefit to grain crops, but lucerne growers will benefit.  Falls to the east were disappointing and insufficient for dam run-off.  To the west falls of 50 points to an inch were registered with 97 points at Burra.  To the east falls were very variable, but almost nowhere recorded more than half an inch.
