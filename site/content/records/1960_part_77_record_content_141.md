Hanson Road.  In the paper of 13 January 1945 it was suggested that there be a new Burra-Hanson Road to meet the Kapunda Road two miles south of Black Springs.  It was suggested that it run along the eastern side of the railway line instead of going past G. Finchâ€™s residence.  On reaching Hanson it would continue past the water tanks on the Whyalla Pipeline and then along the western side of Porter Lagoon to meet the Kapunda Road.  Now fifteen years later the Burra-Hanson section is nearing completion.
