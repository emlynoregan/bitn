Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary 17 October.

Rev. Arthur B. Lloyd, a son of one of the pioneer ministers of the church officiated.

Instead of the usual tea meeting a social evening was held on Monday in the Lecture Hall.  The financial position of the church is sound, but with no very large surplus to carry on.
