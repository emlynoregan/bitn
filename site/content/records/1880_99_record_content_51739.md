Wesleyan Sunday School picnic held at Koonoona on the holiday Thursday, 9 November.  [Presumably the Kooringa Sunday school as the Redruth one reportedly went to Sod Hut the same day.]

Burra Literary Soc. did not meet last Friday and the next meeting will be in the German schoolroom for a 6d entertainment in aid of the Societyâ€™s funds.
