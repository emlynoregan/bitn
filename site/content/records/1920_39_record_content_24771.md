The Main Roads Question

A meeting of representatives from the surrounding DCs and the Town Council was chaired by the Mayor Mr M. Collins in the Council Chamber on 1 November.  The object was to obtain more money for the maintenance of main roads.  Bitumen roads had been put down in some places purely for pleasure, but here the producers of the Stateâ€™s wealth were almost completely ignored.

Cr Kellaway (Burra Corporation) said roads to places like Victor Harbor or parallel to railway lines were constructed when feeder roads to country rail centres were penalised.  Main road grants were decreasing and maintenance was impossible on the present allowance.  The Labor Government had promised to recognise claims for more, but never delivered.  Road traffic had risen 75% and road grants decreased by 25%.

Cr Pearse agreed with the sentiments, but thought it inopportune at this time when the Premier had just said there was little or no money available for main roads.

The Mayor distanced himself from the remarks of Cr Kellaway re the Labor Government.
