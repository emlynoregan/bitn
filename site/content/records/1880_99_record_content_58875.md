Sparks Column.

Salvation Army: exit Captain Scoones and enter Captain Mayne.

E. W. Crewes returned to Burra from Tasmania on Monday.

Kate Hayes recently married a young man named George Henderson aged 17 and there is a great to do in the family of the latter.  [There is no indication of where this occurred.]

William Geake Senior is seriously ill and there is little hope of his recovery.  He is 65 and a colonist of 42 years.

Obituary.  Dick Edwards died in South Africa about six weeks ago.  He was an old resident of Burra who left here to take charge of a mine in South Africa.
