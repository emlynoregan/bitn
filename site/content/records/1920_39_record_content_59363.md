Weather.  On the last day of 1935 Mt Bryan East had a severe thunderstorm.  Falls of around 2 inches were recorded in the district.  Dust Hole Creek received a heavy run-off and the flood was perhaps the highest known since settlement.  In places the water was 15 ft deep and over a chain wide.  All fences went before it and trees and rubbish of all sorts was carried to the swamps out Mongolata way.
