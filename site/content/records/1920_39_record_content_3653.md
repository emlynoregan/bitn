Shooting at Riverton Station

Koorman Tomayhews, supposed to be an Austrian, ran amok at Riverton Station on Tuesday morning as passengers were rejoining the train from the refreshment room.  He fired revolver shots from the end of the platform.  He is supposed to have fired some 50 shots and had 40 cartridges on him when captured.  Mr Brookfield MLA (Broken Hill) rushed to overpower him, received two shots in the belly and is said to be dying.  W. Smith of Peterborough and W. Crowhurst of Oodlawirra and two others including a lady were also injured.  The train was delayed for over one and a half hours.
