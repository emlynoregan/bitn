Burra Burra Show Inc.  The Committee met last Tuesday and decided on the plan for the new sheep pavilion.  The plan for a 72 pen shed was adopted.  The ring will be enlarged and reshaped to avoid sharp turns.  Mr A.R. Downer will be approached to open this yearâ€™s show.  The Society will apply for a special railcar to run to the show from Adelaide.
