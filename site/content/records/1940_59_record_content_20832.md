Obituary.  Mr Reuben Lloyd of Ironmine died suddenly last Tuesday.  He had appeared to be in good health, but after cycling about three-quarters of a mile to visit a neighbour, he suddenly collapsed while having a cup of tea.  He was born at Erskine in July 1890, the second son of the late Mr & Mrs W.H. Lloyd.  He was educated in Erskine and lived there for many years.  In World War I he enlisted and was a stretcher-bearer in the 3rd 48th Battalion AIF.  He saw three and a half years of military service and was awarded the Military Medal.  On returning from the war he took up land at Ironmine, where he has lived ever since.  In 1921 he married Miss A.L. Scholz of Ironmine, who survives him.  He is also survived by four sons: Frank and Jack (RAAF), David and Robert and one daughter, Mrs H. Griffen of Mt Bryan.  Burra RSL Sub-Branch provided a Guard of Honour at the funeral on Thursday.  [Reuben John Lloyd, born 9 July 1890 Hundred of Morgan; died 13 March 1945, Leighton.]
