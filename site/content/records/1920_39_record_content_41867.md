Burra Local Court, 9 May

Laurence Johnson was charged with cruelty to a horse by Sgt G.E. McDonald.  The evidence is reported at length in some 1¾ columns.  McDonald had seen the accused beating the horse with a whip in the vicinity of the old Baldina Church while another man, H.B. James, hit it with a piece of wood.  The defence alleged that they were attempting to cure the horse of a bad and potentially dangerous habit of placing its head on the other horse’s neck.  The defence also of course challenged the severity of the beating, but at times was inconsistent, as found by the bench.  Lawrence was fined £3-2-6 including costs or 28 days.  H.B. James was fined 25/- in all or 7 days for being an accessory.
