Weather.  Burra received the tail-end of a large West Coast dust storm last Friday afternoon.  Lights were needed in businesses for some hours, though the violent wind of the West Coast petered out by the time it reached Burra and the dust gently settled.  There was a deal of thunder, but less than 20 points of rain, which brought plenty of mud with it.
