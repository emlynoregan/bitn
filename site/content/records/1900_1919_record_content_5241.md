W.R. Ridgway writes expressing concern over the great silence from the new Burra Burra Copper Co.  The money was subscribed and the company was expected to make an early start on work.  What have the directors done since?  Where is Snowâ€™s machinery?  Who do the present tributers work for?  Do the directors ever meet?  If so what do they decide? Etc., etc.

The editor comments that he knows no more than the writer.
