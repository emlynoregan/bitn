Burra Town Council, 5 May

The Town Clerk said the Burra Band Committee still existed, but it would soon be handing over certain instruments and funds to the care of the Council till a band was formed again.

Roy Bourman applied to erect a large workshop at the corner of Eyre & Bruce Streets. [Sic: since neither of these streets exists the former could be Ayers St, but nothing like Bruce as a name suggests itself.]

J.C. Goodridge’s tender to rewire the Fire Station was accepted.

A letter of sympathy was sent to the Dare Family on the death of G.E. Dane.

Mrs Louisa Davey had a celebration on 4 May on the eve of her 90th birthday.  Now living in Henry St, Croydon, she is the widow of the late Joseph Davey late of Croydon & Burra.  Her parents Mr & Mrs Rawlings were among Burra’s earliest pioneers.  Though Mrs Davey’s sight and hearing are impaired she is mentally alert and has a good memory.  A cake was made by her daughters [Alice] Mrs Norman Pearce and [Mabel] Mrs Ted Ridley and was cut at tea time by Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook, a very old friend.  Over 50 visitors called, including four daughters and two sons: Hetty, Alice, Mabel, Florrie, Will & Jack.  [Check ‘Hetty’ as I can find no birth of a Hetty, but there is a Minetta alive in 1947: perhaps ‘Netty’ or a nickname?]

Fire.  The woodwork of part of the rear of the house of Mrs Ian Richardson caught alight from some unknown cause on Friday afternoon.  She applied buckets of water while waiting for the fire brigade who soon had the fire extinguished.
