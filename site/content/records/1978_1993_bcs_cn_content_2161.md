Burra Memorial Oval Management Committee has discussed the erection of clubrooms at the oval.  The idea would be to include bar and kitchen facilities and an area for social gatherings.  Members are considering plans and have visited clubrooms in other towns.  Mr Don Roberts the District Clerk was successful in obtaining a grant for clubrooms at the Hamley Bridge Oval when he was Clerk of the Owen Council.
