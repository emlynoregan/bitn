Court Cases: The Editor Replies

The object of reporting cases was not to ‘wash dirty linen in public’, but rather to try to warn others of potential trouble. – a person fined for parking his car in a manner likely to cause danger to other road users, may serve as a reminder to others to act responsibly as well as reminding them that the police are on the job.

In another case recently a man was fined for driving an unregistered car, but without any reporting, how many people realise that his licence was cancelled for 12 months and he cannot register a vehicle for 12 months.  Such cases increase the awareness of the law among innocent people.
