Porter’s Lagoon Reserve will be improved by the Demobilised Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Assoc.  They intend to have conveniences, dressing sheds and rain water tanks installed by next summer.  It is a popular picnic spot on Sunday afternoons and the swimming is not too bad.  Some years ago facilities and sports were organised there by a group based at Farrell Flat, but dry seasons dried up the water [in the 1930s] and then WWII brought an end to the scheme.
