The Burra Heritage advisory Committee convened a workshop at the Civic Centre last week, which was well attended by a cross-section of the community.  The purpose was to hear ideas on the redevelopment of Market Square and Best Place.  Douglas Alexander said it was not about bringing in a bulldozer, but to guide and inform relatively minor decisions that when multiplied would amount to a significant impact.  Further consultation will follow in February or early March.  Much of the input called for upgrading of existing facilities â€“ the greening of both areas and more shade and seating.  Other comments focused on the condition of roads and footpaths and the need for the parking of buses.  Better signage, especially for Burra North was another issue.  Better street furniture was another concern.
