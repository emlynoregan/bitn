The Season looks good, even out east where the grass is plentiful and the stock in good condition.

Rabbits, sparrows, and chilblains are currently plentiful.

The Travelling Dairy has been thrown on the rubbish heap.

The Payment of Members Bill has been passed by the House of Assembly.

William Killicoat has lost about 50 sheep to dogs and offers a Â£5 reward.

[The value of the reward appears in an Advt. on p.2]
