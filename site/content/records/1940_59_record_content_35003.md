World War I & II Honour Roll for Booborowie

A meeting on 17 January discussed the proposal for an Honour Roll for war service personnel.  A committee was formed and George Harris was elected Chairman, with L. Gill as Secretary.  Several designs were examined and a final selection was made.  The roll will take the names of war service personnel for WWI and WWII.  Funds will be raised by canvassing the district, for which purpose it has been divided into four zones and collectors appointed.
