Mackerode Carob Orchard

Twenty years ago Andrew Gebhardt of ‘Mackerode’ began planting carob tree orchards on his property.  Many local wondered why.  The property now has 100 acres of trees forming Australia’s first commercial carob orchard.  It costs about $7,500 per hectare to establish carobs and there is no return for at least a decade, but when the trees mature and reach full bearing the returns should be about $10,000 per hectare.  Of the world’s production of more than 300,000 tons of carob, Spain produces 50% and Italy & Portugal a further 25%.  The first Mackerode crop was harvested by hand in 1996.  A mechanical harvester was introduced in 2000.  In the mid 1990s market research was conducted with a small amount of carob syrup produced in a cottage industry style.  It revealed there was a real market for the product.  The first kibbler was imported in 1997 and is now commissioned at Burra.  This separates the seed from the fruit and then water is added to dissolve soluble solids and create the syrup.  Carob is seen as a healthy alternative to coffee or chocolate.  It lacks the caffeine stimulant found in coffee and the theobromine stimulant found in chocolate.  The Burra orchard has established a carob industry in Australia, but increased production will be needed to warrant construction of a local gum extraction plant.  Once production has reached a suitable level, a marketing program will be required to exploit its potential as a food and drink flavouring.
