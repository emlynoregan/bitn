Burra Primary School Parents & Friends’ Association AGM was on 28 March and elected Chairman, M.G. Stockman and D.H. Field as Secretary-Treasurer.

In conjunction with the Welfare Club we have achieved out object of building a special luncheon room for over £1,200.  In the process the yard has been made more level and put in a better condition for asphalting.  The room has yet to be furnished.  After twelve months with acting headmasters, the Department finally appointed Mr Kies last May.  This year, with increased enrolments, we have had a seventh teacher appointed.  To relieve overcrowding at the start of the year, a class has been put in the luncheon room, but the Minister has promised to have a moveable classroom erected by the end of April and this building has actually begun.

Painting of the school is to be done soon and somehow the pigeons are to be destroyed.  Visiting Day and Arbor Day were well attended and there was an excellent school concert in the Town Hall and a school picnic at Gum Creek.  Free milk has finally been arranged.  We have been negotiating with Council for repairs to the swing bridge.  We wish to record our appreciation for the work of Mr Colin Morrison for his efforts as a teacher, an acting headmaster, in the Garden Club and in other school activities.  He has moved to the High School.
