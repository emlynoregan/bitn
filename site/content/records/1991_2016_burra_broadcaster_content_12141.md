The Four S.T. Gill Paintings have been valued by James Elder of Elder Fine Art Galleries at $300,000 to $400,000.  He has suggested they could finance a major town project, such as the renovation of the hospital â€“ possibly with a two to one subsidy from the Government of SA.  He said they were of extreme historical importance and their conservation must be a concern for the local council.  A likely purchaser would be the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.  The Council has said the paintings are to be housed in Burra and it resolved at its last meeting that they would not be sold or permanently removed from Burra.
