Kooringa News, 2 March

Monday was the worst day of the season with nothing but dust to be seen.

Fire broke out in the dwelling of Mr W. Young, which destroyed the kitchen and outhouses completely.  Only strenuous effort saved the adjacent houses of Mr P. Lane and Mr A. Thomas.  Mr Lane’s roof caught alight in four places.

Fire has been raging on Messrs Duffield & Porter’s run.

On Saturday I visited the new copper discovery taken out by Mr Murphy.  All the indications are that it will turn out a blank.  This was the view of the Captain of the Bundaleer Mine who was one of the party.

The elections passed very quietly with few taking any interest.
