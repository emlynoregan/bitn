[This death resulted in the ‘murder tombstone’ in the Burra Cemetery:]

The wording reads:

ERECTED

HIS BROTHER SEAMEN

TO THE MEMORY OF

JOHN SMITH

OF LONDON AGED 24 YEARS

WHO WAS MURDERED BY

A GERMAN IN THE

TOWNSHIP OF KOORINGA

ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1849

[Note that evidence given at the trial suggests that the crime took place on Christmas Day: i.e. the evening of Christmas Day, rather than Christmas Eve.]
