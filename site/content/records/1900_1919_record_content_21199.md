Donald McDonald, an old man who lives opposite the Kooringa Methodist Church, was assaulted when he opened his door on Christmas Eve.  He was brutally kicked and had to be admitted to hospital.  He says he does not know who did it.

‘it is understood that the matter will be hushed up for obvious reasons.’

[A century on, the reasons are no longer so obvious – but a check of police and court reports may reveal something of his character!]
