Weather.  General rains throughout the district have delivered 2-3 inches in the past week.  242 points were recorded in Burra and 384 for May.  World’s End received 331 for May and just over 2 inches for the week.  The ground is now wet and rain causes run-off.  Porter’s Lagoon was filling strongly on Sunday and all dams in the area are full.  Farmers need two or three weeks of fine weather now for weed control and seeding.  Star thistles are a problem in fallow and clover is growing rapidly.  In sheep fly strike is widespread.
