Rates collected for the year amounted to £945-13-0.

North Ward	£142-11-0

East Ward	£171-0-0

West Ward	£152-11-0

All wards ended the year in credit: North & East with about £21 each and West about £42.

Parklands.  Dead trees have been removed and replaced and hundreds of trees added.  Wanton destruction of trees continues to be a problem.  A garden has been planted by the Black Bridge in Kooringa.  The account began in debit £23 and ended in debit £3-5-8.

The Cemetery.  The main expenditure has been in repairing the walls for £28-8-6 and in painting for £10-5-0.  The year opened in credit £140 and ends in credit £113.

The main roads grant was £430.

Tar paved roads previously done have been attended to.  We look forward to tar paving all the main thoroughfares.

Local Board of Health.  Started the year in credit £101-11-0 and ended in credit £47-13-6.

Lighting.  This account opened in credit £3-1-8 and closes in debit £6-18-4.  Carbide was very dear this year and greatest care had to be exercised.  The town has 20 lights and each one costs over £7-10-0 to maintain and yet the results are far from satisfactory.  Improvement to a more up-to-date system is needed, but will have to await the end of the war.

Carbide costs for the year	£71-7-7

Lighting [Lamplighters]	£70-1-0

The Corporation owns 2 horses, 2 drays, 1 water-cart, 1 road-roller, 1 hand-roller, 1 sanitary cart, 1 tar sprinkler plus tools etc.

In general the town has made satisfactory progress considering the war raging.  Many new and substantial houses have been erected.  Roads have been reclaimed and new gardens formed.  The appearance of the town has improved.  The telephone system has been extended.  With stock, wool and produce prices high only the return of peace is a hindrance to prosperity.

[Check this last statement, which surely is the opposite of what was said!]

I thank citizens for conferring on me the honour of filling this important position.  I had intended to retire ‘for I feel that . . . in normal times two years should be the longest period a person should hold the position.’
