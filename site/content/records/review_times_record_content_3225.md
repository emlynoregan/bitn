Burra Lions Club held its annual handover dinner at the Sports Complex on Saturday.  Incoming President Robin Eberhard farewelled the outgoing President Sergeant John Reed, who is leaving the town for Coober Pedy on 7 July.  John Maidment proposed a toast to Sergeant Reed who has been in Burra for five years.  He had joined the Police at the age of 17 in his home town of Leigh Creek and in 1961, 17 years to the day, he returned to work there.  Mrs Reed will also be missed, having been active in sport, the BCS Council and the Anglican Church.  Their eldest child, Peter, will stay in Burra to complete his education and will continue to play football for the Rams B-grade team.  Daughter Kylie (13) and Vicky (10) leave with their parents next month.

Burra Burra DC will investigate the availability of funding to quarry bluestone for kerbing and the employment of two stone masons to cut the rock.  It is thought that funds might be obtained either through the Commonwealth Employment Program or from the Heritage Branch of the Department of Heritage & Planning.

The Burra Preservation Organisation discussed the possible removal of Victorian letter boxes from the town and the Burra North by-pass at their meeting on Thursday last.  About 35 people attended.  In response to a request from the Burra Burra DC it was resolved to send them a copy of the petition objecting to the Market Square redevelopment, which had been sent to the Local Government Minister.
