Burra Waterworks.

A printed report stated these were in 1st class order at the start of the year and so I did not visit till early January when I found them in a filthy condition.  The engine was knocking and steam was wasted.  Mr Pryor claimed that everything was alright except for a little knocking of the crosshead pin.  I found that only three of the pumps were working and the engine was in a state of collapse.  After a report to the Waterworks Commission it was decided to get Mr Henderson to see what he could do with the engine.  He patched it up in 16 hours work.  On 5 February the engine completely broke down.  It was decided to take the cylinder out and send the piston, rod and cylinder to Adelaide – the cylinder to be rebored.

It returned on 17 February and was refixed by an engineer from town.  In the meantime the dayman and Mr Pryor overhauled the whole of the pumps and on 19 February pumping restarted.  Mr Pryor was then unable to follow his employment and Mr Bentley was engaged temporarily while applications for a qualified engineer were called.  After considerable delay Mr E.C. Sedgman was appointed from many applicants and he proved himself thoroughly acquainted with the management of the plant.  The Cornish boiler has given much trouble due to unskilled treatment of earlier engineers and in the near future a new boiler will be needed.  Early in the year it was decided concessions would have to be cancelled due to enormous leakage.  A thorough inspection was made of all services and meters and showed that not more than one in ten meters was registering.  Since then about 100 meters have been cleaned and replaced.  All doubtful meters are now being replaced and eventually I am sure we will be able to lower the water rate.  After interviewing the Commissioner and Hydraulic Engineer the former promised a rebate of £81 if we signed a lease for two years from 1 January 1904, though we can surrender the works at six months notice.  The expensive repairs have now reduced running costs considerably below last year’s.

[Figures are then given for expenditure which show that repairs cost £51-2-3, Wood £60-11-3, the Engineer £112-7-6 plus a £10 gift for Mr Pryor.]

Mr Hardy asked, that considering the heavy accusations made against Mr Pryor, had the Council received the Mayor’s report – Yes it had.

Mr Hardy then followed with several other questions including querying the extension of concessions to the Electro-Magnetic Co.  He also asked if the £10 to Mr Pryor was in lieu of a month’s notice.

The mayor said that was a mare’s nest.  Some three years ago Mr Pryor was temporarily appointed, but never confirmed by Council.  An accident to his leg some years ago appears to have now made him physically incapable of carrying on work and he was laid aside.  He has not asked to be reinstated and is not yet declared off the funds of the lodge.  In March a motion was carried that he be asked to resign and with the letter a promise of a gift of £10 was made.  The Council then sought the services of a capable engineer.

Mr Hardy – Didn’t the Council offer him £5 to resign?

Mayor: No.

[Mr Hardy then pursued questions on who cleaned and fixed the meters and why and who authorised it and how much it cost.]

Mr Crewes asked how many Councillors read the Waterworks lease before signing it.

Cr Cook did not recall seeing it or signing it.

Cr Lott read it.

Cr Roach & Cr Snell neither saw it nor signed it.

Mr Winnall asked if it was signed by a resolution of Council. – Yes.

Mr Crewes asked if the Commissioner had made signing it a condition of the £81 rebate. – Yes.

In reply to an inaudible question from T. Davis the Mayor denied there had been any ‘back door business’ done this year – there had been no ‘shinanikin’.

Mr Crewes objected to the Mayor’s emphasis on ‘this year’.

Mr Hardy thought there had been a lot of ‘shinnanikin’ in Council this year.

Mr Hardy asked if since Mr Sedgman’s appointment wasn’t young Harvey doing the work Mr Sedgman was appointed to do.

The mayor said Mr Sedgman had been busy repairing the machinery ever since he had been there and Harvey was doing as much for 3/- a day as Hardy would for 10/-.

Hardy – if the engineer signed the agreement to do the work he should do it.

Mayor – The likes of Mr Hardy would blight the prospects of Council ever getting a good man to do the job and it was nonsense for him to find fault with such a practical engineer as Mr Sedgman.  Ratepayers should put their foot down and stop such nonsensical talk.

The chair here intervened to stop personal remarks and to return to conducting business in a gentlemanly way.

Mr Hardy apologised to the meeting, but not to the Mayor.  He then launched into another tirade against the Mayor over the Waterworks in an attempt to prevent the meeting from adopting the report.  The report was adopted.

Cr Sangster said he was glad to be retiring.  He had voted for an end to Waterworks concessions and to appoint Mr Sedgman.  The Waterworks lease was too stringent and he was not present when it was signed and was surprised it had been.  Also a Council was foolish not to have appointed a joint inspector of meat with the District Council.  The town was poorly lighted and he hoped the new Council would give this attention.
