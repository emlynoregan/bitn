Burra High School Debating Society on Thursday 14 June [sic] held a debate.  [Given the previous report was 30 June and that 14 July was a Thursday this was an error for that date.]  The topic was: That it required more courage to fight in the last war than it did in the time of Henry V.  The pro team won narrowly 47 to 46.
