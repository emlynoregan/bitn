Mid-Northern High Schools Combined Sports were held on 3 September at Clare.  A bus, a lorry and seven cars took students to Clare, leaving at 9 a.m.  The lorry got bogged halfway between Hanson and Farrell’s Flat and there was a lengthy delay while it was extricated.  The journey continued at 11 a.m.  Results for Burra students are printed.  In the aggregate scores Kapunda led with 1075/6, followed by Burra 557/12, Riverton 51 and Clare 457/12.
