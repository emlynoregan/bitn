A Total Abstinence Meeting was held in Kooringa on 25 June in the Wesleyan schoolroom.  Over 150 sat down to tea, after which a platform was erected and on it assembled Rev. William Lowe and Messrs Osborne, Pearce, Trehare, Cotton, Wersley, Trestrail and Jeffery.  Rev. Lowe took the chair.

[The speeches of those on the platform are reported at some length.]

Twenty-nine names were added to the pledge book.
