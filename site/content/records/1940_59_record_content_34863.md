Accident/Obituary

Kenneth Johnson, seven year old son of Mr & Mrs Sid Johnson of Burra North died in a tragic accident on Friday.  He climbed onto the roof of the residence in search of a tennis ball.  While there his leg touched one of the lead-in wires of the electric supply.  He then evidently grasped the second wire and called out.  His brother Adrian tried to release him, but suffered a severe shock himself.  He then ran several hundred yards to the power house and got them to shut off the power.  It is said Adrianâ€™s rubber soled shoes saved him from serious injury.  Dr Steele tried for an hour to revive the stricken lad, but without success.  PC E. Weich prepared a report for the coroner, T.H. Woollacott who deemed an inquest unnecessary.  About ten years ago a son of Mr & Mrs W.R. Lee, formerly of Burra, met with a similar accident about ten years ago.  [Kenneth Sydney Johnson died 16 January 1948, Burra, aged 7.]
