Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal stands at $10,135.

The Chairman of the Board said despite the poor season the building project could not be postponed because of the poor state of the operating theatre, which is completely outdated and building should start in summer to minimise delays due to weather.  The appeal will officially close on 12 December.
