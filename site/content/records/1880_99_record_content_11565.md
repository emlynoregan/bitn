Changes.

The quality of the newsprint was bad in the second half of the year.

From 9 October the paper was published twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays instead of only on Wednesdays.

This saw the introduction of serial fiction and a lot more overseas, Australasian and regional items - not necessarily of great quality.  It did nothing for local coverage, which was at best the same spread over two issues, and may even have declined.

Essentially the former pages 2 & 3 were condensed onto page 2 and page 3 carried a condensed selection from the former literary supplement plus notices, especially Council notices and some small advertisements.

The lengthy and repeated articles and editorials on taxation issues and Land Acts etc. surely reflect the interests of the editor rather than those of most of his readers.  While an elite might have liked them, it is hard to imagine that they were widely read, given the literacy levels of the day.

Temperance issues occupy a significant amount of space.
