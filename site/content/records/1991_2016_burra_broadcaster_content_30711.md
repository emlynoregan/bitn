Burra Community Sports Club held its AGM.  Chairman Paul Wilson said the past year had largely been one of consolidation.  New sprinklers were being introduced.  A new fence on the southern boundary allows heavy vehicle access from Essex Street.  After ten years some repairs are needed to the complex and some fittings are now in need of replacement.  The netball/tennis building should be extended to give spectators greater protection from the weather.  The car park above the netball court has been endorsed by the Council for sealing and kerbing for several years, but the work is yet to be done.
