Burra Town Council, 18 January

The District Council of Burra advises it is approaching Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. about a combined District and Town animal pound.

A.J. & P.A. McBride are happy to donate the effigy of the miner [Johnnie Green] to the town.

The Fire Brigade Board complains that some fire plugs are covered – the problem according to the Overseer, is that over time roads have risen and the plugs need lifting.

Cr Woollacott was shocked at the newspaper report of his asking for work in ‘Mivviegizzie St [sic] at the bottom of “Cowdung Hill”’.  He did not think the name should appear in the paper.  He had merely used the term for identification, not knowing the correct name.  Some residents had objected to the term.

Council will negotiate with Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. about the question of a pound.

A decision on where to erect the miner’s effigy was deferred.

Cr Riggs suggested Sara’s Corner – to act as a ‘silent cop’ to direct traffic.  The new service station was ornamental and added to the safety of the road.

The Overseer said he had counted cars on the Aberdeen road on Friday at 84 cars per hour.

Cr Woollacott wanter a shelter shed erected on the road to Aberdeen.  Elderly people and women struggled along the road and had no place to rest.

Cr Riggs agreed and said it should come from the common fund and be placed between the Mine Bridge and the fountain, opposite the street light.  Carried.
