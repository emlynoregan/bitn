Letter from ‘Smith’ also on the Sudan question.  He condemns the effusions from the pulpits recently, based on less than a tithe of the information the Government had to make its decision and yet choosing to condemn them. What did Gordon do?  What was he asked to do?

Gordon advised that Zebehr Pasha, a notorious slave hunter, be made Gov. of Sudan.

The Government declined to appoint him - surely not a bungle.

Gordon asked for Turkish troops to garrison towns while he led British troops to ‘smash the Mahdi’. 

The Government replied it did not wish to conquer the Sudan.

Gordon was summoned to return.

For months he said he was perfectly safe, made expeditions up and down the Nile and claimed that 1,500 men would demolish the Mahdi, and if pressed he could secure his own safety.

When he finally realised he was in a serious position and asked for help it was practically impossible to provide it without terrible loss of life.

Could the relief have got there sooner by another route?  Perhaps, but the best advice available to the Government said no, and ‘I still think that the combined wisdom of the present Government of England is at least equal to that of any clergyman in South Australia, or to that of

Yours, &c.  SMITH’
