BBH Football Club

President David Kellock’s Report:

After several meetings in 1985 and negotiations, the amalgamation of Booborowie-Hallett and Burra Football Clubs came about and the first year of the BBH Club has been successful.  Membership stands at 169 members, more than both the two original clubs put together.  Players and officials from both clubs have worked together.  Congratulations to coaches Richard Riggs and Colin Hall for achieving premierships for the B Grade and the Senior Colts sides respectively.  The Junior Colts with Coach Robin Eberhard came 3rd.  The A Grade side with Coach John Hall achieved good comradeship and teamsmanship even if the premiership was not within their grasp this year.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary has continued their great work and the Social Club under President David Schell made a commendable profit of $12,160.38.  During the year $7,000 was spent on extra oval lighting. Complete sets of jumpers for all grades cost over $2,000 and medical supplies accounted for about $1,500.  [Thanks are also extended to a range of people.]
