New Year passed without any larrikinism this year.  The new year, century and month were ushered in by some with fireworks and singing etc.  Watchnight services were conducted.  New Yearâ€™s Day was boisterous and many intended excursions were cancelled.  The Burra Defence Rifle Club defeated teams from the Medical Staff Corps, Adelaide, and from Clare.
