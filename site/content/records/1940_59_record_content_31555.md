Burra Picture Show Proprietorship.  In answer to a question in Council recently the Clerk, Mr E.R. Davey said that the agreement between the present proprietor of the Burra Talkies and the Council did not expire until 1950.  Mr Woollacott said he would like to see the town take over the Picture Show because he saw that as a quicker way for the debt on the Town Hall to be liquidated.  This would have to be prepared for, because there would have to be licensed operators.  It was agreed that the current agreement be placed on the table at the next meeting.
