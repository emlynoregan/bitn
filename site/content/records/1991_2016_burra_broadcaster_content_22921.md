Regional Council of Goyder will increase rates by a total of 6% to bring in rate revenue of $2,027,381 in a gross budget of $4,292,611.  In the budget the Burra Office will be redeveloped to provide improved public access and a facility that meets occupational health and safety legislation.  $10,000 has been allocated to update the Development Plan.  It is hoped the new strategies introduced for waste management will be cost neutral.  $44,470 is provided for library and information services.   Capital Projects Funds and Sports & Recreation Projects Funds in each ward receive a percentage of rate revenue.  The Drum Master chemical drum collection has commenced.  $100,000 has been allocated to plague locust control which will be in part funded by savings from the introduction of the Emergency services Levy.    [Figures for expenditures on roads are printed.]
