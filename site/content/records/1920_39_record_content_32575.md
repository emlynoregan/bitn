William Way of Wallaroo is visiting Burra after an absence of 68 years.  He was born in Kooringa in 1852, his home being in Kangaroo St near the present home of O. Earle.  His father worked for the Smelting Works.  He clearly remembers the opening of the Black Bridge at Aberdeen and its christening with a bottle of wine and the firing of a shot.
