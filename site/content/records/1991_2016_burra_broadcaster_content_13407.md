Burra Paint ʼn’ Panel and Trevor Wall’s Burra Motor Services have combined with the establishment of Burra Auto Centre in premises next to the Burra ambulance Centre.  This will allow Trevor to expand and Tony Eldredge to develop his business with an area for a spray paint booth baking oven.  Petrol pumps are back to add to the service and there is also a windscreen replacement service and 24 hour towing.  [Photo.]
