Burra Printing Press

On Thursday 9 June a consultant from Gillingham Printers in Adelaide worked with the Burra National Trust members in sorting out and shifting material from the old Burra Record office.  Some interesting items came to light and will be displayed in the Civic Centre on Tuesday 21 June from 8 p.m.  The consultantâ€™s recommendations will be discussed and the future of the collection decided that night.  Donations have reached $3,245 towards the total of $6,000.
