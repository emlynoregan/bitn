Lucas Williams (5) was at Mt Bryan with his class on Friday morning to say thank you to the Variety Club of SA bashers for their generosity in donating money towards a sound filled system for BCS.  This will greatly assist Lucas, who has severe hearing loss in one ear, by eliminating background noise in the classroom.  Mrs Robinsonâ€™s R/Yr 1 class from BCS was at Mt Bryan to see the parade of cars travelling with the Variety Club of SA.  [Photo]
