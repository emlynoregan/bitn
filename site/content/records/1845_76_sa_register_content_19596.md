Kooringa News, 16 August

Accident/Obituary.  On Monday last 13 August Mr Thomas Gubbins was employed at the sawmill and crusher at the Burra Mine.  It was his duty to oil the machinery every morning and to save time he usually went through the raft-wheel of the crusher.  The machinery is put in motion by the overshot waterwheel driven by water from the engine.  Because of the rain on Saturday night it is believed the buckets had become full of water and the wheel was thus almost in motion.  It appears likely that the deceased trod on an arm of the wheel, which was enough to start the machinery.  He was found with his head crushed between an arm of the wheel and the floor and suspended with his feet nearly touching a beam.  The inquest found death by accident.

[Born 1810 Tavistock, Devonshire: died 13 August 1866 Kooringa aged 56.]
