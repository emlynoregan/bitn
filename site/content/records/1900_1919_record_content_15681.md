Non-payment of debts to businessmen has increased and now a group of them have formed a fund to finance the taking of debtors to court.  Last week a photographer took a man to court over the non-payment of 12/6 and by the time it was heard the debt had increased to £1-10-0.  It had been incurred by the man’s wife, who seemed quite unconcerned at the sentence of 10 days in gaol imposed on her husband.  At the last minute a friend came forward with the money.

[Page 5 adds details to the above as follows.]

Mrs George Lines with her mother had a dozen photographs taken after assuring the photographer of her ability and intention to pay for them.  She then intercepted each account as it arrived in the post and consigned them to the fire.  George Lines thus unknowingly ended up in the difficulties described.
