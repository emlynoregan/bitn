Burra Burra Races.  These were run last Wednesday and Thursday.  On Wednesday it was a holiday in the town with shops closing at 10 a.m.  After that time the road to the racecourse (1½ miles from town) was crammed with every available vehicle.  Upwards of 2,000 are estimated to have attended the first day.  It seemed every publican within 30 miles had a gaily decorated booth. There was a grandstand as well as a judges’ stand and weighing stand.  The band occupied the grandstand and the police arrangements were most excellent under the care of Sergeant Lamb and his men.  E.B. Gleeson was judge and Mr Hallack was the starter.

On Wednesday four races were run.  [Details are given.]

On Thursday another four races were run.  [Details are also printed.]

The third race on Wednesday was the Hack Race.  In the first heat Mr Hill’s Cherry was the winner.  And the second heat was won by Mr Warland’s Old Joe.  There was a protest against Old Joe on the grounds that he was not qualified to run, not having been within 15 miles of Kooringa on 25 October.  The stewards found he had been entered under a false name.  Cherry had come second in heat two, but had gone inside the post, making it difficult to decide the winner of the heat.  It was decided to re-run the race and this was done on the third day, Cherry coming in the easy winner.

Several other privately arranged races were run for saddles etc.
