Baldina Creek Irrigation.  The visit on Tuesday by the Hon. A. Catt, commissioner of Public Works, the Engineer-in-Chief, the Conservator of Water, F.W. Holder MP, and Mr Packard was to the part of the creek just beyond the Douglas crossing.  A weir 3’ high is suggested and the annual flow is reckoned at 200 million gallons and 20 x 10 acre blocks could be irrigated.  The cost is estimated at £3,000 to £4,000.  If successful the flood flow is at least another 200 million gallons and could allow for extension of the scheme.
