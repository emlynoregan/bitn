Post Office Closure.  Recently Helen Stockman asked when the Burra North Post Office Closed.  The former Burra Postmaster Brian Hastelow has determined that it was mid-1972 and Hanson post office closed at the same time.

[According to the research of Martin Walker in The Post, Telegraph & Telephone Offices of South Australia and the Northern Territory, 2004, the Burra North Post Office closed on 15 August 1973 and the Hanson Post Office closed on 28 June 1974 and this latter date is confirmed in an article in the Burra Record of 2 July 1974.]
