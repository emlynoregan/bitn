Characteristics of the 1914 Paper.

Page 1.	This was a mixture of large advertisements and news, though the ‘news’ was often articles of general interest rather than current affairs type news.  There was certainly no attempt to place the main stories of the week here.

Page 2.	Larger advertisements and notices with a few classified advertisements.  These occupy from half a page to about six columns and are followed by the news of the day.

Page 3.	A few larger advertisements and news.  There is thus quite a lot of space for news which is frequently given in great detail.  Patriotic meetings, sport and Council meetings all get a lot of space.  This was one of a number of years when the paper gave the buyer a lot to read each week.

Page 4.	Small advertisements: mostly local.  Some news was included here, but the amount varied greatly.  Sometimes what looks to be a news article is an advertisement in disguise.  News varies from about half a column to perhaps two columns.

In general the paper gave a detailed account of events in the town, particularly the patriotic events once the war started.

From the issue of 1 April an extra sheet was added as an insertion.  This took the form of a literary and general interest supplement.  It never carried advertisements or spill-over news and may well have been printed elsewhere as it is often on different paper from the rest of the publication.

It comprised a serialised novel, a short story, some poetry, often a children’s story and three columns devoted to women with fashion items, household hints and recipes.

Other articles of varying length were devoted to ‘Farm & Field’, ‘Science’, ‘Miscellaneous’ and ‘Odds and Ends’ [Jokes].  A column called ‘Items of Interest’ appeared sometimes

Numbering of issues in 1914

What would seem to be a practice of beginning a new volume each year is introduced, but this is an illusion: it holds for the start of 1914 and again in 1915, but breaks down in November 1915 and reverts to the usual irrational state of affairs in 1916.

The year began with Volume XXI Number 1875 on 7 January 1914.

And continued to Volume XXI Number 1925 on 23 December 1914.

Supplements 1914

Notes on the table.

a From 25 November the Miscellaneous column comprised mainly War Notes.

b The paper wasn’t published on 30 December, though the supplement is so dated: the microfilm for 6 January 1915 carries this with a hand corrected date.
