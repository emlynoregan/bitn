Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society AGM was held in the Lodge Room last Tuesday.  President James Thomas presided over a fair attendance.  (Miss L.E. Coglin was Secretary and Mr E.J. Davey was Treasurer.)  The society’s origins were a bequest of £500 from G.A. Gebhardt.  As only the interest can be used it was decided to seek further assistance from charitably-disposed friends.
