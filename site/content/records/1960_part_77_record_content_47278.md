Methodists from the Burra Circuit met in the Redruth Sunday School Hall on Sunday to consider the practical issues facing the local church.  The presence of two churches in Burra has been an issue since the 1957 Methodist Conference sanctioned the amalgamation of the Kooringa and Redruth Circuits.  It was now evident that enough people were convinced that a complete union in the circuit was needed and the discussion had to consider the closing down of one of the centres of worship.  64 people attended in the morning session and 50 in the afternoon.  The discussion resulted in four recommendations:

The church worship and Sunday school should be in one property and that should be the larger Burra [Kooringa] Church.

The other property would be the focus of all the fellowship groups â€“ for all business meetings, educational meetings, adult and youth groups and the guild meetings.

The surplus church (whichever was ultimately decided upon) should be offered to the Lutheran Church, should they desire to take control of it.

The Burra Guilds should unite.

Rev. Milton Edwards was pleased with the growing sense of unity and of strengthening ties within the circuit.

A Burra Boy Scout Troop came a step closer when 13 parents visited Clare Troop on Friday as observers.  A parent committee was formed afterwards to advance the cause: Chairman, Rev. Milton Edwards; Secretary, Peter Mengersen; Treasurer, Rob Mason; Group Scout Master, Brian Ashdown.  Gordon Webster and Bill Barker have expressed willingness to be Scout Masters.  The Committee would like to hear from those willing to lead a Scout Troop or Cub Pack.  Women Cub Leaders are most acceptable.  Two possibilities for Scout Rooms are the old Methodist property at Hanson or the Burra Salvation Army Citadel.
