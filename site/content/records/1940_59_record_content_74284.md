Burra Town Council

The area in front of the Burra School will be scarified in preparation for planting in autumn.

In response to a question from the Swimming Pool Committee they were advised that the Department of Works will install a purification well at the Post Office so that only clean water will drain across the main road towards the Burra Creek.

The hoarding near the Post Office will be removed as soon as possible.
