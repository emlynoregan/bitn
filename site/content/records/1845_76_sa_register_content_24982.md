On Christmas Eve Mr Moody’s china shop stood out.  Its decorations consisted of a miniature overshot waterwheel composed of white and gold china eggcups, turned by the water from a tiny fountain.   The wheel worked a revolving apparatus containing lighted lamps and surrounded by tasteful decorations.  It was very pretty and attracted a crowd of visitors all evening.
