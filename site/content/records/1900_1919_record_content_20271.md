Photograph.  There is a rare appearance of a photograph in the paper this issue.  It is of the roadster stallion Bellatrix, owned by Henry Roach of the Burra Mill.  There is a notice that he will travel the district for the 1907 season.  This is the valuable horse that had to be rescued after falling into an underground tank some 18 months ago.
