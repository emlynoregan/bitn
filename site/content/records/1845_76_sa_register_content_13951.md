It is desirable to amalgamate the office of Postmaster with the Telegraph Office.  The rent and a portion of the Postmasterâ€™s salary would be saved.  The Telegraph Office is centrally located for the surrounding townships and is convenient for miners, the majority of whom pass it going to and from work.
