Inquest/Obituary [There is quite a detailed report of the discovery of the body of William Smith and of the inquest that followed.  In essence as follows.]

Smith was a shepherd in the employ of Mr A. Barker of Baldina.  He was a single Englishman with no known friends or relations locally, though he spoke of a sister in Brisbane.  He had been sober while employed at Baldina, but had told Barker that he had previously been a heavy drinker in Victoria.  He left about Â£14 in wages.

On Monday he was found dead in his hut at Baldina and seemed to have been dead about 36 hours.  He was aged about 45 or 46.  When discovered his face was badly disfigured by vermin.  [Wild cats seem to have been suspected.]  The body was otherwise free from injury and Dr Mayne concluded that death was probably due to heart disease.  The jury returned verdict of death from natural causes.

[William Smith died 8 May 1864 at Baldina aged 46.]
