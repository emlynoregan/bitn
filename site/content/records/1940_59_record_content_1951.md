There needed to be anti-gas officers, people to look to repairs and to quench fires, to attend to casualties and to maintain communications.  All between 16 & 60 could be useful.  The committee did not think these things were going to be necessary, but they had to be prepared.

Dr Steele outlined what would be done for the injured in the event of an air raid.  First-aid posts would be established at Copperhouse, the Railway Station, The Oddfellows Hall and the Methodist Memorial Hall in Redruth for Burra North.  In Burra they would be at the CWA Rooms, the Salvation Army Hall, and The Methodist Sunday School Hall.  He called for National Conscription for the total war effort.

S. Hawker, President of the RSL called for universal training for war and much more, in a Â½ column speech.  H.J.B. Jennison moved the motions and called for a more enthusiastic support for the war effort.  G.H. Dow seconded and supported the motions.
