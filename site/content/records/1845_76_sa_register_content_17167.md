Kooringa News, 5 February

Two inquests were held at Canowie before Mr MacDermott SM on recent fires there.

The first fire on 18 January was extensive and destructive.

Thomas Goode.  Manager of Canowie Run.  The fire began on the north-eastern part of the run on Belaley Plains [sic: Belalie] where two well sinkers were at work.  About 60 square miles were burnt between 1.30 p.m. on 18 January and 8.30 a.m. on 19 January.  Probably it started from the well-sinking camp, though they had burnt an area 22 feet all round their fire as ordered.  The fire extended 16 miles north-south and destroyed about 360 sheep, 2 empty huts and 20-30 bush yards.  As well as the Canowie Run it burnt some 9 miles on the Booborowie Run.

John Toovey.  Well Sinker. Had cleared a space of at lest eight yards around our fire and built around it a shelter about three feet high with the material from the well.  Covered the fire when going to work.  Came up in the ascending bucket at about 2 p.m. and saw the grass on fire.  Believe a whirlwind caught up embers and blew them onto the grass.

The verdict was that the fire was accidentally caused without proof of culpable negligence on the part of any person.

The second inquest followed a fire on the same run at a place called Menowie on 29 January.
