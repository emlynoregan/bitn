Mr A. Riggs said the club did not want the Council to put the courts in order, but if they did so the club would be willing to pay.  The club deputation withdrew.

Cr Jeffery then said that as the club seemed satisfied and the season was now over, the matter could best be left to lie on the table.  Council agreed.

The Mayor produced plans for a swimming pool.  The estimated cost he put at £400.  Of this the Council would have to find £200 and some public spirited citizens the other half.  The Mayor saw the pool as a town asset and suggested that the waste water could be used to grow vegetables or lucerne, helping to make the operation profitable.  The water could be taken from the Paxton Square bore, which was a good permanent supply and would not need chlorinating.

Cr Jeffrey said the town was under an obligation to the Mayor for his work thus far and the baths would be a big asset to the town.

The Mayor proposed to have the excavating, grading and groundwork done by day labour.  Another idea was to have an engine driven by an electric motor.

Cr Jeffrey moved that a letter be written to the Burra Electric Supply Co. asking whether the electricity for a 5 h.p. motor would be a problem.  Carried.

Cr Dow supported the scheme, but said they had to be careful not to make themselves responsible for a large sum of money.  He thought a correct estimate of costs should be obtained.

The Mayor regarded his statement as definite in this regard.

Cr Dow said nothing before the Council showed just what the work would cost and in their present financial situation he would not be responsible for spending the ratepayers’ money without more details.

Ct Jennison agreed about costs.
