BCS.  Staff Profiles: Alan Roberts

I was appointed to BCS in term 2 to teach Senior Geography, Australian Studies, English and Society & Environment.  Burra is an interesting town for me because I have spent some time studying settlement history in SA and overseas.  I have recently taught at Port Pirie, Woodville and Seaton High Schools.  I have previously taught in Leicestershire and in the London Borough of Hackney.  I am living in Burra, though I retain a home in semaphore, which I visit at weekends.  [Photo.]
