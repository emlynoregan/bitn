South African War Memorial Service was held at the Rotunda last Sunday.

The troops, led by the Burra Coronation Band were in charge of Lieut. Killicoat & Lieut. Copley, were made up of the Australian Light Horse, Citizens Forces and Cadets and totalled in all about 70 men and officers.  Several men [unnamed] who served in the war attended in the crowd.  Rev. J.H. Nield, who had served as a chaplain in the war, gave an address, which is printed.  Of the collection of Â£8-13-0 half goes to the local hospital and half to maintaining war graves in South Africa.

In the evening a service was held in Kooringa Methodist Church.
