Burra Model Parliament.  Second Meeting.

P. Murrie was elected Premier; W. Anderson is Speaker, and G. Parks Clerk of the House.

The Ministry presents its policy next Tuesday.

Burra Town Council

The Mayor reports that the Commissioner replies that the Baldina scheme is to be reconsidered.

Cr Rabbich moved that the Aberdeen lamp be lit for a period of three months from this date.  Carried.

Cr Hardy, Cr Sampson, Cr Rabbich and Cr Butterworth supported a move to clear the rubbish blocking a watercourse near the sheep yards in Kooringa.

Crs Watt & O’Leary wanted legal advice first.

Council decided it did not feel justified in placing the town under the Sparrow Act unless the majority of ratepayers express such a desire by a public meeting or petition.  [The move would have involved the expense of appointing an inspector etc.]

Football.  A match will soon be arranged with Clare.

Sport.  Out-of-town reports on Victorian football, cricket, coursing, sculling, racing.

Mice.  The plague of mice has prompted numerous tall stories about mice, one of which is published.
