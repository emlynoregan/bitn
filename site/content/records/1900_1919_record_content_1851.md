Rev. W.G.M. Murphy added his best wishes and referred to the large and beautiful memorial window in the church which would ever remind them of Mr & Mrs McCulloch.

Mr W. West Sen. endorsed these remarks.

Mr McCulloch said he was glad to see so many friends present.  McCullochs had been associated with Burra for over 50 years – since his father had migrated.  He had left Perthshire in 1838.  He was offered the management of a sheep station by Mr Henry Dundas Murray, a son of Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre.  They came on the ship Orliana and landed at Holdfast Bay after a voyage of five months.  His father had married just before migrating.  They took their household good to Adelaide on a dray with two bullocks and pitched a tent on the block where Faulding’s Chemist now stands.  Mr Murray decided to go on to NSW and Tasmania before settling on a property.  McCulloch decided to take up a run on the Gilbert River in about 1842 and shortly after took up Elderotrilla Run.  Later they went to live at Gottlieb’s [Near Terowie] and so were in constant touch with Burra.  His father represented the Burra District [in Parliament] in 1867.  He, the speaker, had spent a very pleasant stay in the district as had Mrs McCulloch.  He still had an interest in runs in the north and would sometimes visit the Burra Market.  The new owner of Princess Royal, Mr Tennant, comes from New Zealand and intends to be a resident owner.  He hoped Mr Tennant might open some of the copper lodes on the property.

The meeting ended with Auld Lang Syne and God Save the Queen.
