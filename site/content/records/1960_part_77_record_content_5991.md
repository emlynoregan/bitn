Burra Basketball Club

At the AGMs of the two clubs it was found that reduced interest from older girls meant the town could field only one ‘A’ Grade team and two ‘B’ Grade teams in the North Eastern Association.  It has been decided to amalgamate Burra Rovers and Burra Comrades to form one club.

Elected: President, Mrs Dawn Broderick; Secretary & Treasurer, Miss Lorraine Baulderstone and Coach, Mrs L. Hirschausen.
