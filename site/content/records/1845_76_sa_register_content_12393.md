Kooringa News, 6 June

Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held today before J.W. Macdonald at the Miners’ Arms on the body of Alex. McDonald.  W. Pearce was foreman.  The body had been found in the creek leading from Queen Street to Chapel Street.  John Chirgwin said he had found the body at about 6.15 a.m. Sunday.  He called to Mr Drake, who was passing at the time, and together they turned the body over before one went for a doctor and the other for the police. The deceased was lying on his face with his mouth and nostrils full of sand.  Henry Drake gave corroborative evidence.  There were no signs of a struggle.

Martin Banin had been arrested on the information of James Rule. Both Banin and the deceased had been in Rule’s company early on the morning of McDonald’s death.  Henry Anderson said he had seen the deceased at about 1 or 2 a.m. at Anderson’s home. Banin and the deceased had not quarrelled.  Banin lodged with Anderson and did not leave when the deceased did.  Rule left about ten minutes later.

Dr L.J. Maurau said there were no marks of violence on the body, such as might be caused by a fall into the creek, which where the body was found was about 15 feet deep. He believed death was caused by a broken neck.

James Rule was called, but was so intoxicated that he was locked up.  Other witnesses agreed that Banin and the deceased were on good terms and that Banin had not left his lodgings that night.  Rules suspicions seem to be based only on the fact that upon seeing the body Banin had said that, ‘he had not done that’.

The verdict was of accidental death caused by falling over the bank of the creek while under the influence of liquor.

[The death is registered as Alexander McDonnell, died 5 June 1859, Kooringa Creek aged 28.]
