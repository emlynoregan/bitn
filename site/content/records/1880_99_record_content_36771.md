Burra History: Looking Backward, by Historian.

In 1855 the smelting works were an impressive set of buildings, but compared with a few years previously there was a state of inactivity through lack of labour.  Of the 19 furnaces capable of smelting 80-90 tons of rough copper per week only five were working, there not being enough men for the others and there was also a lack of fuel - the carting being too slow.  Steady men were offered 30/- to 35/- a week.  Some 6,000 tons of ore was awaiting treatment.  The company [check that this means the smelting company and not SAMA] at one time employed 1,000 men, but in 1855 only 200.  I heard that at one time 400 teams with 3,500 bullocks were employed.  In my time of writing (1855) the animals in use were principally mules - the smelting company owned c. 450 of them.  Ten of then worked in shafts were able in about eight days to take three tons of ore or copper to Port Wakefield and return with a like weight of coal.  Allowing for delays they managed the average three trips a month.  The company had twelve wagons weighing 18 cwt built on the ground and c. 50 more were imported from England.  The furnaces consumed about £120- £130 of coal a week.  Skilled labour was limited to the management of the fires and the drawing off the slag without wasting copper.  There were many Chilean labourers with their wives and families and also English, Welsh and Irish.  Some 120-130 tons of ore was being smelted yielding an average 23% copper.  Iron with manganese was used as a flux and was obtained from the Iron Mine some 10 miles away.  [At Ironmine]  They used many firebricks and manufactured them on the property using clay from the Chalk Cliffs.  So difficult was it to get labour that two wheelwrights were earning about 20/- a day.  The general manager had a large house (Now Mr Packard’s.)  From 1849 to the end of 1854 the company had smelted 7,590 tons of copper at an average value of £95 per ton and in 1855 the value was £120 a ton.  It had also shipped 21,000 tons of ore and used c. 27,000 tons of coal.  Between October 1850 and March 1851 about 10,300 tons of coal came from Port Wakefield and about 9,600 tons of ore went to Port Wakefield.
