Redruth Court, 4 September

Mrs Hall of the Kooringa Hotel was charged with supplying liquor after hours.  The evidence showed that the liquor in question was supplied by the barman without her knowledge and against her instructions and came not from the bar, but from the barman’s private supply in his bedroom, because he believed the buyer’s brother was ill and required some brandy.  The case was adjourned for the SM to get a ruling as to the legal position.
