William Hannaford writes re the naming of Sod Hut.  He arrived in the colony with bullocks in 1847 and came to Burra to cart copper to Port Adelaide.  He doesn’t believe the hotel got its name from men soddened by drink.  Before Dan O’Leary built the Sod Hut Hotel there was a sheep station in the Gully and it was there that the teamsters camped and it was there the strike occurred for a higher price to cart copper to Pt Adelaide.  It was there that the teams were stopped.  The old hut was built of pug and it was common to see 30-40 teams in camp.
