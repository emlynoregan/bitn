Tornado Hits District

During Christmas week Burra was subjected to a most unusual phenomenon.  Residents watched as an unusual cloud formation sped across the sky from the northwest.  Fortunately for the town the tornado touched earth some five miles east on Mr Rooke’s property.  It tore up fence posts, bushes and tussocks of grass.  On top at the heart of the tornado were black clouds and beneath that a layer of white and then a huge cloud of dust with the spiral below like a weaving elephant’s trunk.  This one, though frightening, was of short duration and did little damage.  Before and after it there was heavy thunder and deluges of rain.  One pastoral property reported 250 points of rain in 20-30 minutes.  Another received 5 inches and the flood damage to eastern properties will take 12 months to repair, though on the whole the damage is not extensive and the rain will give the whole country a grand start for the year.  On the western side of the town there was very little damage to farms, but damage to roads has been extensive.  The Burra-Morgan road was impassable and people going via Eudunda to Morgan were no better off and in one stretch 25 cars were bogged.
