Obituary.  The Kalgoorlie Miner of 14 September reports the funeral of the late George Sara, aged 64, who died the previous Wednesday.  Deceased was born in Perranwell, Cornwall and came to SA in 1848 when 21 years old.  About 8 or 9 years later he went to Kooringa carrying out many contracts as part of the firm of Sara & Dunstan.  Afterwards he went to Broken Hill and then to WA where for about two years he did a great deal in the building trade.  He came to Kalgoorlie about 7 years ago and since has put up many large buildings in and around Kalgoorlie.  Deceased had three brothers.  Thomas is in residence in Kalgoorlie and the other two are well-known identities in Pt Pirie and Broken Hill respectively.  His father Mr George Sara is still alive at Willunga, aged 90.
