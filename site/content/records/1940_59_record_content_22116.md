Burra Girl Disqualified from ‘Miss Australia’ Contest

Burra’s Pin Up Girl Mrs Lotus Twist was disqualified after being selected as one of the seven finalists on the ground she was born in Malaya and not Australia.  None of the forms that came to the local committees mentioned any such requirement, but apparently one in Adelaide Headquarters says entrants must be over 17 years of age, born of British parents and born in Australia.  It all seems ridiculous to allow a candidate to get to the position Mrs Twist reached before disqualifying her on such a technicality.  She was born to British parents and came to Australia aged twelve months.  Her father (Mr Bence) fought in WWI, her brother is serving with the RAAF in England and her husband, also serving with the RAAF has been missing for over two years.  We understand that rules need to be adhered to, but we consider that those rules should have received much greater publicity and could certainly have been improved.  Under the circumstances the supporting public should be informed how such an error in organisation occurred and suitable apologies made to Mrs Twist.
