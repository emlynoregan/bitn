Ulooloo Diggings.  Gainer’s and Simmons’ rush has not yet turned out according to prospects.  New ground has been opened about a miles west of Gainer’s, but the gold was not payable.  A few are still working on Coglin’s Creek, all of whom are making a living.  At present diggers number about 25.  There are two parties prospecting besides the Government party.
