SA Mining [Editorial]

[The editor begins by saying how important the mining interest has been in SA and how good it is that it is again doing so well.  The agricultural interest is also important, but an expanded mining interest would provide the population to be the market for that and that market would be even more rewarding than selling the wheat and flour to diggers in other colonies, just as a larger population would enable some of our wool to be manufactured locally to the advantage of all.  Mining was doing better in SA than it had at any time in the previous six years.  In that period only Burra Burra and Kapunda Mines have made a profit and even those two were closed for some of the period due to shortage of labour.  At the start of 1858 there were about 20 mines at work in SA.]

Since then Mr Chambers has begun to develop the copper discoveries at Mt Searle.  A new lode has been discovered on the royal Mining Co.’s property.  There is renewed activity in the Mt Barker, Strathalbyn and Bremer mining areas.  Now there is news from the SA Mining Association’s Pompurne Estate some 4 miles northwest of Clare.  Two men have been prospecting there for some time and we hear the results have prompted the Directors to take more energetic measures to exploit the property.  The English mails brings news of a rise in the copper price of £9-10-0 per ton.  This increases the value of produce on hand at the Burra Burra Co. by some £15,000.  News also comes of the migration of more miners from the west of England.  In short nothing can be more promising than the prospects at present before SA mining interests.
