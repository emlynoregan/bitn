Burra from 20,000 feet

Last week through the kind co-operation of Santos Ltd and Airlines of SA Mr R. Lockheed travelled as an observer on a Fokker Friendship flight to Moomba with a view to collecting information to be used in Georgraphy courses at BCS.  The flight path is a straight line from Adelaide to Moomba and passes almost directly over Burra township.  The morning flight had stratus clouds to obstruct the view, but the return flight offered excellent and uninterrupted views.  [Photo.]
