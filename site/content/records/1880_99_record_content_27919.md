Burra Town Council

A resolution to the Waterworks problem is needed urgently.  Cr O’Leary moved it be considered at a special meeting on Tuesday next at 7.30 p.m.

It was also resolved to proceed against all unpaid accounts and to cut off the water at empty houses.

The deferred discussion on a stock tax was resumed and after some preliminaries Cr O’Leary moved an amendment: ‘That in the opinion of this Council it would be against the best interest of the trade of Burra to tax the stock sold in the town.’

Cr Pearce pointed out that a move by the Mount Gambier Corporation to impose a stock tax had failed in the courts with costs against the Corporation.  Eventually after much discussion the votes were even and the Mayor cast his vote in favour of the amendment.
