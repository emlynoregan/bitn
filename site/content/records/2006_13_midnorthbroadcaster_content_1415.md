The Season.  Australia has had its driest August since records began in 1900.  The national average was just 6.2 mm for August.  Most crops in the Mid North are hanging on, but around Booleroo Centre, Willowie and Pt Germein crops are dying.  Pasture feed is also failing, with many farmers already feeding sheep hay and grain.
