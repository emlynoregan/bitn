Characteristics of the 1902 Paper

The paper began much as it had been in 1901.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: larger not local in origin.

Page 4.

Large advertisements and, as for 1901, patent medicines were a common subject.

There seems to have been a great demand for constipation pills and a concern for itchy piles.

There are smaller, but sustained, advertisements for Chamberlainâ€™s Colic and Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy.  One must feel for Mr C.B. Wingfield of Fair Play Mo. USA, who suffered chronic dysentery for 35 years before finding this cure!
