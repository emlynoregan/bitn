The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]

The tenth annual report of the SA Mining Association is of a more promising character than we have been able to print for some time.  Slowly, but surely the Mine is recovering from the effect of the exodus of the male population to the gold diggings in Victoria.  The water, which had been allowed to rise in the Mine, is now ‘forked’ and men are once more busy raising the ore.  The profit of their labour has been somewhat diminished by the need to remove mud that had collected in the levels while the mine was flooded.  But now we hope to hear of ore being raised without interruption.  As the Victorian goldfields are not nearly as tempting as they were in 1852, we need not fear a second stoppage of the works.  During the quarter just ended 4,128 tons of ore were raised, yielding 18% copper.  In the corresponding period last year the amount was 2,267 tons; the cost of which was about half the money obtained for it and from the resulting profit the 24th dividend was paid on 3 April.  The profit and loss statement shows a balance in favour of the Company of £27,420-9-1.  The Directors do not promise a dividend in the next half year, due to the difficulties of getting produce to market in the winter time.
