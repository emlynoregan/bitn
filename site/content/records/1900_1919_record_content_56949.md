Local Board of Health

The case with Lawn & Co. has been adjourned to 5 November.

Dr Ashton was granted registration of Heathmount Private Hospital.

There was a lot of discussion, continuing from previous discussion, on an application from S. Kellaway to have hospital fees waived for treatment of his child.  It was a messy situation with conflicting evidence and lax procedures and finally the costs were waived.
