A plan is being worked on with the District Council and the headmaster to level part of the old saleyards.  Plans are also in hand to build a bike shed and a luncheon shed.  Money is on hand for both.  Various items of equipment were purchased through the year for the school.  The Club also assisted in raising funds (£16-7-9) for the youth tour.  Two of the oldest teachers left during the year: Mr T.G. Corry and Miss V. Pearce.  A Christmas Party was held for students.

The balance in the bank is £168-18-6.
