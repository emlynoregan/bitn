Mr F. Richmond also left after a shorter stay.  He will be missed in musical circles and was Hon. Sec. of the local branch of the RSL, a member of the Bowling Club and a delegate to the Burra Football Assoc. from the Kooringa Football Club.  Both men have been bitten by the ‘land craze’ to take up properties.
