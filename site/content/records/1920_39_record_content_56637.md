Mongolata South.  Drives and crosscuts out from the bottom of the shaft 40 ft deep have opened a series of veins and though short patches show low values, most of the work has been in barren country.  Several veins in the workings from the tunnel level are said to carry up to 6 dwt and therefore it appears to be a better proposition to follow the best of these and to abandon the deeper workings, at least for now.
