Inquest/Obituary.

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at the Miners’ Arms at Kooringa on 17 July on the death of John Jeoffrey [sic] Pearce aged 16, the son of Jeffrey Pearce of Kooringa, carter.  Deceased was driving a cart laden with stone in Kooringa on 16 July.  As he put his hands on the shaft to get into the vehicle, he slipped and fell onto his back.  The wheel of the vehicle, containing some 2½ tons of stone, passed over his body.  Despite this the deceased got up and returned to his nearby home.  Mr Diplock of Copperhouse saw him get up after the wheel passed over him.  He described the accident to his father and was attended by Dr Dashwood, who held out no hopes of his recovery.  He died the following day.  The verdict was ‘Accidental death’.
