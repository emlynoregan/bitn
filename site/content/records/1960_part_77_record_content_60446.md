A conference was then held and it was decided that when the difference between the assays at the mine and those in Adelaide was greater than 30% the results would be averaged.  On the way home when Mr Chambers was driving the horses, he lost control.  Commissioner Dashwood made a grab for the reins and the horses swerved violently, turning the carriage over.  Later Thomas Burra sued for wrongful dismissal and obtained Â£1,500.
