Jazz in the Monster Mine Committee has made donations to three Burra organisations:

$1,500 will be shared among the Hospital Auxiliary, the Regional Art Gallery and the Lower north Leisure Activity Group.

The Committee spent money this year at the mine on electrical installations, which will reduce future hire costs, so profits should improve next year.
