‘Steel Beak’ writes again blaming Satan for the depression for having induced us to trade with America rather than Britain and seeing Wall St as the centre of a conspiracy to capture the world’s gold and enslave us all.  They have set the Labor Party against itself.  He sees little hope from the emergence of Mr Lyons’ United Party, which he portrays also as a tool of Wall St.

[The editor says that having explained so clearly what is wrong perhaps ‘Steel beak’ will now provide a remedy.]
