A total eclipse of the sun will be seen today in Adelaide.  It will begin at 12.35 p.m. and end at 8 minutes before sunset.  At the conjunction there will be a sort of darkness for about 15 minutes, ‘during which the best medium through which to observe the eclipsed luminary will be a piece of smoked glass’.  [A highly dangerous recommendation!]

Entertainment.  A phantasmagoria apparatus has arrived at Kooringa and all are anticipating an amusing and instructive exhibition.

[This was a form of magic lantern, capable of projecting images onto a screen and creating illusions with rapid changes of size and image.]

Prize Boxing is rife in Kooringa, with sums of £1 to £5 a-side being staked.  There are too few police to interfere in this brutalising amusement. After one such fight between ‘Paddy the Horse’ and ‘Scotchy’ some men of violence, miscalling themselves ‘miners’ got up a row with a few Aboriginals, one of whom received a blow that would have fractured a white man’s skull.  The Mine officers have discharged some of the principal movers of these fights, so prejudicial to their interests and to the public peace.  The Resident Magistrate Mr Lang suppressed one fight due to take place near his house.
