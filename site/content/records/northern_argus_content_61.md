A Public Meeting at Burra Civic Centre last Thursday decided a float would be built for the Jubilee 150 Procession in Adelaide on New Year’s Eve.  Nic Van Buuren was elected Chairman and Roger Boehm is the Secretary and Artistic Director.  [A committee is also listed.]  Plans are to build a replica of Morphett’s Pumphouse on a semi-trailer.  Support will be provided by miners walking with wheelbarrows, but ideas are still coming in.
