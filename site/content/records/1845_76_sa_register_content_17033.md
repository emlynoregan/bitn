Government Schools

In the last quarter of 1863 there were 247 schools connected with the Board of Education and 11,769 students – an increase of 20 schools, but only 352 scholars on the last quarter of 1862.  This is due to epidemics of sickness preventing children from attending.  Some of the illness itself may be due to the poorly ventilated schools and crowded conditions.

Nearly all the schools established in the past three years are in outlying districts.  The number of licensed teachers in Adelaide in 1858 was 38 and now it is 24.  The city schools remain, but they are no longer connected with the Board because the teachers were disinclined to reduce their charges as required and so threw up their licences.  It is thought there are about 8,000 more scholars at private schools.

The average stipend paid by the Board is £53-10-0 p.a.

Destitute scholars have increased from 913 to 1042.

Irregular attendance remains a problem.
