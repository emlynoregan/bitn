Northern & Yorke Agricultural Districts Integrated Natural Resource Management Committee – NYADINRM [!]  The investigative focus for this year will be on Burra Creek Catchment and Booborowie Valley ground water.  Getting baseline data is a significant problem and local memories, diaries, photos, etc. will be sought.  Site visits and surveys will be undertaken.

Friends of Burra Parks held its AGM 17 February.  Elected: President, Heidi Nicholson; Vice-President, Harvey Neal; Secretary, Ann Breeding; Safety Officer, Barry Wright; Publicity Officer, Sally Fieldhouse and Treasurer, Arthur Simpson (subject to his consent).

The meeting voted to donate $250 to Gluepot Reserve and to allocate $1,000 to a Weeds Workshop.

The Burra Parks include: Caroona Creek, Hopkins Creek, and the three Conservation Parks; Mokota, Pandappa and Redbanks.

The group had visited all and discussed possible projects with rangers.

For 2004 Redbanks was a focus because of its chequered history and variety of past users.

It was an early resting place for sheep on the stock rout to Burra from NSW as well as the north and northeast of SA – because of its permanent water.

Later its recreational oval was a focal point for the community for picnics and cricket matches at weekends.

Later still it was favoured by motor cycle riders and campers.

Now its significance for its fossil deposits and Aboriginal heritage is increasingly recognised.

In 2004 native grasses and trees were propagated and despite dry conditions the survival rate had been better than 60%.  The old oval had been revegetated and in the future walking trails will be upgraded and signage improved.  Further plantings are planned to be co-ordinated with pest plant control (horehound, pepper trees, artichokes and bamboo) and with feral animal control (foxes, rabbits, goats and hares.)

At Caroona a heritage hut will be repaired in 2005.
