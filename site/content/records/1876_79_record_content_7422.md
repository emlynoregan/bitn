The Market Square Well. Further clarification on the boring difficulties. When some hard obstruction was found in the well it was conjectured that it was a piece of broken tubing, but the boring cable failed to communicate anything definite by sound or feel as is usual. Since sometimes days passed without detecting the problem it was then thought that hard stones might be falling down from higher in the tube. About a month ago the obstruction appeared to have cleared and drilling continued for 2 to 3 weeks at about 40' per week till 194' was reached. Here the obstruction was worse than ever. It was then that a careful observation of a point about 19' from the top showed precisely where the broken piece came from. Some days were spent in a futile attempt to retrieve the piece and ultimately it was pushed aside and boring continued, but at 199'6" it was found that the bore was out of plumb and the ground was too hard to allow it to be straightened. At this point the cable broke with the tools attached and some 60' of it fell down the tube. They are now attempting to recover this. The orders from Adelaide are then to start a new bore some feet away with a 5½" diameter rather than the old 4½" size. This should make jamming of the tools less likely. This seems to be the best solution despite the probably loss of money to the company.
