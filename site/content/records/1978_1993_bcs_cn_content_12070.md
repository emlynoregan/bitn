Burra National Trust supplies a note outlining its position on the Market Square redevelopment plan.  They were not opposed to redevelopment provided there was sufficient consultation and advice from the relevant heritage bodies.  This does not mean support for the present plan because that had no heritage input.  The provision placed on the CEP grant that the work not proceed until approval of the Heritage Branch and the National Trust had been obtained would seem to be sufficient protection.
