‘Also a Frequent Traveller’ writes in response to ‘Frequent Traveller’ re the North-Eastern Mails.

‘I think the statements therein need great modification.  Perhaps I travel by Terry’s coaches more than any other man, and I most positively affirm that the finest teams to be got in South Australia could not keep the contract-time under the circumstances.  The roads and creeks on this line are in such a very bad state that they would almost baffle description.  No man could, in my opinion, do more to fulfil the obligations of the postal contract than the owner of these vehicles has done.’
