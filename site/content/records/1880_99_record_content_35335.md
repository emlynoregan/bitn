Redruth Wesleyan Church quarterly meeting was held a few days ago and income exceeded expenditure.  A committee was appointed to buy a trap for the use of local preachers.  Four houses are offered as suitable for a parsonage.  It was unanimously decided to buy that of Mr George Sara at Aberdeen, for Â£550.  Mr John Dunstan was elected lay representative at Conference.
