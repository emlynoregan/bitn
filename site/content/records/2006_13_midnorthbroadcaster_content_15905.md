Burra Creek.  After residents objected to the widespread us of pesticide the maintenance of the creek area is now in community hands.  Council proposed that the Burra CMC devise a management plan and this resulted in the formation of the Burra Revegetation Group.  Arrangements have been made with Council for a systematic slashing and reduced spraying of the area.  The group is still working out how to divide the responsibilities between it and the Council and for access to funding.  It is likely that the outcome will be cost saving for the Council and also result in a much nicer environment.
