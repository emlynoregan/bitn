‘Roseate Ribbon’ writes agreeing with the Federal Government’s wish to cut civil service pay only as a last resort.  Civil servants get a steady, but modest pay.  It does not go up in good years.  A civil servant can see his whole life laid out before him.  He is only better off in bad years.  In good years he falls behind, so the Government is right to see cuts in civil service pay as a last resort.
