Obituary.  Charles Goodwin Mayfield aged 17, eldest son of Mr & Mrs Henry Arnold Mayfield, was killed on Saturday morning 18 March from a fractured skull when thrown from his horse.  The horse seems to have fallen head first and probably struck the lad with its hoof in recovering.  [Born 14 March 1905 at Victor Harbor: died 18 March 1922 at Booborowie North.]
