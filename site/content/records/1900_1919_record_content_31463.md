Burra Automobile Club Morgan Trip.

About 20 cars assembled for a photo on Saturday 27 January.  They started from the garage about 10.30 a.m. and travelled via Aberdeen to ‘The Gums’ where refreshments were provided by Mrs Pearse and family.  At Morgan the cars were housed in Mr Landseer’s Store.  In the afternoon Burra defeated Morgan at cricket.  Morgan defeated Burra at tennis.  The visitors gave a concert in the evening and on Sunday visited New Era by steamer.  They returned on Monday with another stop at ‘The Gums’ and a pause at Baldina Church to get the cars together for the entry into Burra about noon.
