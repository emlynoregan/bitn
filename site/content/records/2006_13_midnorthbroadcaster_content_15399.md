AGL Energy Cube will be in Burra this weekend.  It is a custom-built inflatable marquee that will be set up in the staff car park at BCS.  The cube is touring the country as part of AGLâ€™s 175th Anniversary Regional Roadshow.  AGL mascots Timmy and Tina will show students and the community how to become energy savers through a fun interactive and visual performance.  Clare Primary students will visit on Friday and BCS students will take part on Monday.  It will be open to residents on Saturday from 9.30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
