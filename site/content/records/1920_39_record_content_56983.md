The State Centenary

Acting Premier Sir George Ritchie and the Director of the Tourist Bureau, Mr Victor H. Ryan, visited Burra on Thursday last.  They met local men in the Town Council Chamber concerning proposals to celebrate the State Centenary in country areas next year.  The proposals for the state celebrations were explained to the meeting.

His Worship welcomed the visitors, congratulated Sir George on his knighthood and for being Acting Premier and mentioned that Mr Ryan had been born in Thames St, Burra.  1936 would not only be the State Centenary, but also the Diamond Jubilee of the Town Council.  Burra’s role in the development of the state meant it could not allow the celebrations to pass without taking a prominent part in them.

The Town Council had set aside £100 to supplement private and Government contributions.  It had resolved to beautify the banks of the Burra Creek by planting suitable trees and hardy shrubs.  It had obtained from Mr Tom Wilkinson MSBSA (an old Burra boy, now in South Africa and late of the SA Forests Department) a valuable report on the most suitable trees and shrubs and where to plant them.

With some 50 men working under the Government’s rations-plus-cash scheme and with many others on the bread line, he urged Sir George to give a special grant to the town for the unemployed, in addition to the centenary grant.  He also wished to raise the matter of sealing the main road from either Kapunda or Tarlee as a suitable centenary project.

Cr Kellaway suggested the enlargement of the waterworks scheme as a suitable centenary project.

Sir George gave some general background to the conference.  He was able to say that the grant would not be so very large, but that the Centenary Committee would ensure that it got plenty of publicity and give whatever help was possible in other ways.

He then outlined the plans already in hand:

There would be a sporting carnival in Adelaide as a pre-cursor to the Olympic Games in Berlin and only representative who took part in Adelaide would be eligible for the Berlin Games.

An Empire Exhibition would be staged from March to May.

The Adelaide Show would be a Special Centenary Show.

A National Thanksgiving Service was planned.

A Flower festival would run in Adelaide from 9-16 October.

A Music Festival would be held.

There would be a Racing Carnival.

The eight days around 28 December would see a special carnival.

There would be a host of other sporting events and celebratory activities.

January and February had been set aside as the main time to organise for country events so they would not clash with either each other or the main city based events.

Sir George thought the idea of a beautification scheme for Burra combined with some sort of carnival to attract visitors to the town was a good concept.

He said it was the view of the Country Organisation Committee that it was in the interest of country towns to form a local Centenary Committee to arrange the local activities and to co-ordinate with the general program of the Executive Committee.  Indeed it was on the basis that there was such a local committee that Centenary Grants would be made available.  Any such grant would have to be subsidised £ for £ by the local Centenary Committee and would have to be spent on schemes entailing work for those presently unemployed.

It was usual for the local government body to initiate the formation of these local Centenary Committees.

Mr Ryan elaborated a little on this and said that activities approved by the Central Committee would receive more extensive publicity than ever before and the state would benefit from more extensive advertising than at any time in its history.

When it was suggested focussing Burra’s activities around the time of the Burra Show, Mr Ryan indicated that it would be difficult with so many other events approved for that period.  Sir George said 36 towns were already involved in planning activities.

Mr Bence thought that with no other large town in the district, Burra ought to get a larger grant of, say, £500 to enable a big affair to be staged here.  [The subsidy implications of this do not seem to have been discussed.]  Mr Ryan said there was one time period that might be possible; after the Royal Show and before 9 October, but the application for this time should be made quickly.
