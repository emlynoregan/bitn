BCS has 25 students in the senior agricultural program this year and most of them are girls.  Goats and cattle are being prepared for the Royal Adelaide Show.  The students recently went to Old Ashrose to swot up on sheep handling skills in preparation for the SA Merino Expo.  Next weekend they will also use their skills at the Mt Barker lamb competition.
