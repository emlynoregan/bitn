Arnold E. Trueman, Chairman of the Centenary Stage Show Committee writes in response to ‘Mother of Ten’. 

The Revue Co. through a series of unfortunate circumstances and possible misunderstandings found itself unable to supply an evening’s entertainment for Centenary Week as arranged.  At a meeting called by the remaining members of the group it was decided to disband the company and a committee was formed to present a Centenary Concert.  This was successfully accomplished under the direction of Mr Lindsay Thomas.  So, in response to ‘Mother of Ten’: no Dramatic Club was formed and the committee made no commitment for ‘continued shows’.
