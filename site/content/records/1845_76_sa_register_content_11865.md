Burra Institute: The Secretary responds to the complaint of 16 August.

There are as many books as £35 could purchase in England and nearly 100 that have been donated by friends.  A donation of £20 worth is daily expected from England.  This is all that the Committee has been able to expend.  An equal amount has been spent on periodicals.

The seating and tables may indeed be ‘shocking,’ but I cannot see how the Committee can remedy this until there is money in hand.

Perhaps the member’s letter will call the attention of the Legislature to the need to assist the Institute to engage someone, at least for a year or two, to organise the objects that it was originally designed to achieve.

The person residing in the Institute says that the fire has often been out because in the wet weather so few came to the Institute that he decided for a while to defer lighting it until a reader arrived.  This will not occur again.

If the complainant wishes to have lectures that are less missionary in tone, perhaps he will volunteer his services or be willing to donate greater funds.  Placing limits on what speakers may say would only further diminish the number of lectures.

At the approaching annual meeting no doubt the complainant will attend and express himself plainly and will be able to introduce more books, planed tables and chairs, a salaried librarian and will himself take up the thankless office of Secretary.
