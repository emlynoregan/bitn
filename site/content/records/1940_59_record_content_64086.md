Burra Telephone Exchange will have a new system operating from 14 June.  The new system makes two additional lines available to Adelaide and improves the volume and clarity of speech as well as speeding contact.  The new system is a three channel carrier system.  This enables four conversations simultaneously over one pair of aerial wires.  (As many as 17 conversations could be accommodated over one pair of wires.)  Five telephonists are employed at Burra, with three rostered for peak periods: 9 a.m. to noon and 6.30 to 9 p.m. Monday to Friday; 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday and 6 to 10 p.m. on Sunday.  They work a 39 hour week.  Burra Exchange is a switching station to Adelaide for the Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat exchanges and the parent station for the Rural Automatic Exchanges at Hanson and Gum Creek, which are locally automatic, but are connected manually through Burra for trunk calls.  Burra has 305 subscribers, plus party lines.  Booborowie has over 100, Mt Bryan 50, Hallett 90 and Farrell Flat 60.
