Flower Day will be held in Adelaide next Friday.  Don’t miss Burra’s entry if you’re there.  It is a scaled replica of the chimney, made by Charlie Griffiths and painted very cleverly by Margie Tiver.  It features wheat grown by Peter Stockman, wool lent by Ray Lloyd, a dry arrangement by Joyce Lloyd and Betty & Shirley Thamm.  Necessary printing was done by Tom Perry and stones were lent by Samin Ltd.  It will be located east of the south end of the Victoria Square Fountain.
