Burra Town Council.  His Worship the Mayor has seen Mr Jones, the Conservator of Water, who suggested the Council take back the Waterworks and that the Government would allow a considerable reduction in the interest.  He undertook to report on the question and would forward a request officially to the Council.

R. Snell requests permission to run wastewater from the swimming baths via a culvert across Quarry St and into the creek.

Trees are to be planted where previous ones have died and those in need of support are to be staked.
