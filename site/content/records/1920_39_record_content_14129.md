Birthday.  Mrs Emma Flower turned 80 on 25 September.  She was born at Bowden in 1844 and married Mr Malcolm Spence of Tothills Creek in 1862.  They had 4 children before Mr Spence died after 12 years. (All now deceased.)  She married W. J. Hill of Emu Flat who died in 1874* and had four children by him.  She remained a widow for 18 years before marrying James Flower in 1912. [The date 1874 is an error; presumably for 1894.]
