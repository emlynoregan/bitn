Historical Plaques

The Goyder Tourism Working Party has been granted $3,000 by SA175 through History SA to erect plaques at historic sites around Goyder.  The Council supported the application after the GTWP and the Burra History Group highlighted the need for improved signage.

Burra National Trust has been awarded an SA175 grant to co-ordinate a gathering of fire vehicles in Burra in October 2011.
