The Burra Assessment

The new assessment for the town has only risen by £329 to £14,039.  It was £8,117 in 1910 and peaked at £17,671 in 1939*.  During the depression years it dropped by nearly £4,000 and has never increased again to any extent.

[*This makes no sense, given that the depression years were the 1930s.  1939 is an error for 1929.]
