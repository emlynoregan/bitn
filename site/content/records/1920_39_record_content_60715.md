Rev. G.C. Hutchinson was farewelled at a meeting in the Methodist Lecture Hall on the evening of 7 April before his departure for Yorketown.

Senior Circuit Steward Mr J.A. Riggs said he was disappointed that Conference had not allowed Rev. Hutchinson another year at Kooringa.  That would probably have enabled him to be successful in his project of reducing a certain church debt.  Rev. Hutchinson had been particularly active in the Unemployment Relief Council, the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society and was a member of the Burra Primary School Council.

Mr Kellaway spoke for Church Stewards.

Miss Mavis Fairchild sang Life’s Lullaby.

Edgar Pearce was unable to come, but sent a letter of appreciation.

Miss Margaret Pearce spoke for the choir and Mr E.J. Davey for the Congregation.

Mr Milton Tiddy sang King of the Road, accompanied by Clem Davey.  Mrs T.W. Charlesworth’s recitations were well received.

Mr Alfred Riggs spoke for the Redruth Circuit and Mr John Drew for the staff and students of the Sunday school.  Arthur Riggs made the presentation of a wallet of notes.

Mrs Clem Pearce spoke for the Ladies’ Guild, thanking Mrs Hutchinson for her work and Miss Joyce Fairchild spoke for the YWCA members.  Miss (Nurse) Wright gave a humorous recitation.

[Rev. Hutchinson was also farewelled at Farrell Flat and at World’s End and the former is reported briefly while the latter is dealt with at length.]
