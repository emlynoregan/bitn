Local Court, Kooringa, 23 May

William R. Carmichael, surgeon, was charged by Dr Mayne with have stolen certain books left in his charge by Dr Lloyd, the former occupant of his house, and of having placed them in the hands of Messrs Binney Bros. for sale.

Case remanded to next Wednesday.

26 May

T.H. Mayne JP, surgeon, was charged with assault with intent by Mary Ann Holland.

Prosecutrix said that on 20 February Dr Carmichael had left her alone in the house.  She heard a step in the kitchen while she was in a bedroom.  When she left the bedroom Dr Mayne said he had seen Dr Carmichael leave for Redruth and had taken the opportunity to see her alone.  He asked whether Dr Carmichael had married a Mrs Johnston.  He kissed her and she had run out.  She went to the kitchen and he followed.  She then ran into the parlour, thinking to escape the house by the front door.  Before she could unlock the door Dr Mayne had caught her and dragged her into the bedroom.  She struggled, but was overpowered. (The actual attempted assault was then described.) She prevailed and sat crying on the edge of the bed.  Mayne asked her why she made such a noise, as the window was open.  She said it was not open, but a pane was broken.  She then went to the kitchen and after a while he followed.  He said she should not leave the Burra, but he would get a house for her there.  She said she did not care what he got for her; she would not stop with a married man.  She said she would go to her brother in Van Diemen’s Land.  He offered to get her anything she wanted, but she said she wanted nothing; she got all she wanted from her master.  He asked if she would come to him the following day if Dr Carmichael went out.  She said she would not.  He then said he would come every night when Dr Carmichael went to Kapunda the next week.  She said he should not and all the doors would be locked.  Dr Carmichael then came home and asked what was the matter.  She told him Dr Mayne had been very free in his manner.  She said her health was bad and she had no money or she would have prosecuted at that time.  When questioned by Dr Mayne she said she was living in prostitution with Dr Carmichael, but under a solemn promise of marriage.  Had a miscarriage 3 January and Dr Mayne attended.  She was aware Dr Mayne had brought a charge of felony against Dr Carmichael.  She was aware Mayne had written a note to Dr Carmichael to prevent his going to Karkulto.  She knew Dr Carmichael was negotiating with Dr Mayne for Dr Lloyd’s furniture, but she did not know the furniture could not be removed before it was paid for.  She said Mayne has sent a bill to Dr Carmichael and therefore could not stop the furniture; only sue for it.  In answer to a question she said that while in the kitchen Mayne had said he had always intended to become intimate with her from the first time he had seen her.

W.R. Carmichael said he had asked Dr Mayne on 21 February if he had been to his house and made free with his servant.  He told Mayne not to come there again.   Mayne had said ‘All right, all right’, but had appeared quite confused.  On a subsequent occasion Mayne had described it all as a skylark, merely to try her.  Later Mayne had asked him why he had spread the story and he had told Mayne that it was the prosecutrix who had done so and that she would not be dissuaded by him.  [Though Carmichael admitted telling some, including the landlord of a Kapunda Hotel.]

Augustus Johnson was sworn and said he had been told of the alleged incident by Dr Carmichael in the Miners’ Arms and later repeated the story at his home in the presence of the prosecutrix.

The prosecutrix agreed that it would be best not to say anything about it because it would prevent Dr Mayne using his influence on behalf of Dr Carmichael [in getting a position at the Karkulto Mine].

For the defence Andrew Thomas was sworn.  He heard that Dr Carmichael had circulated a story about Dr Mayne taking liberties with his servant and heard Corporal Bolus and James Pearce talk to Dr Carmichael about it, when he said there was no foundation for it and he was sorry the story had spread.

Corporal Bolus corroborated Thomas’s account.

John Goodfellow recalled Dr Carmichael returning from Kapunda, having gone there to see about his horses.  Goodfellow had taken a note from Mayne to Carmichael in consequence of the spread of the story.  Carmichael came over to Mayne’s at once and said there was no foundation for the report.  He said that he had not said anything about it to the Landlord of the Sir John Franklin in Kapunda.  Goodfellow swore that on both the 20 and 21 February he and Dr Mayne were out looking for a mare between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Goodfellow was Dr Mayne’s brother-in-law and he said he had been placed outside to hear what had been said [between Carmichael and Mayne].

His Worship dismissed the case.
