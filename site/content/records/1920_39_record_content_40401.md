Obituary.  William J.C. Ewins died 22 December in Adelaide where he had gone for treatment about a fortnight earlier.  He had long been a leading businessman in Burra.  He had started with Bath & Pearce in the premises now occupied by J. Allen.  Later his uncle Thomas Edwards (who had a draper’s shop where H. Jennison’s premises now stands) decided to retire and Mr Ewins’ father C.H. Ewins took it over and his son assisted him.  Subsequently Mr Ewins Sen. had the premises adjoining Mr F. Harris’s shop reconstructed and the firm moved to this more central location.  Mr W. Ewins took over on the death of his father [1914].  Mr Ewins served a term on the Town Council [December 1919-November 1924], was a member of various sporting clubs and Treasurer of AO Foresters Lodge.  He was born in England and migrated with his parents when a lad.  He married Louie, second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Harry Vivian of the Commercial Hotel.  There were four children of whom two survive: Eileen Mrs K. Chesters Sandland of Koo-owie and Mr Frank Ewins of Kooringa.  There is one grandson.  The eldest son Charles died some years ago [1919] and the other died in infancy.  Miss Rhoda Ewins and Lily Mrs Alf Shortridge of Adelaide are sisters and Jack Ewins of Adelaide is a brother.
