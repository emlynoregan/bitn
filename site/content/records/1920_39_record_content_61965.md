Council proposes a swimming pool for the town.  In my opinion this is absolutely necessary to keep out town up-to-date and I am asking for all assistance citizens can give.  Many towns smaller than Burra have pools.  We have a first class site, plenty of building materials and water.  The Council is very enthusiastic over this scheme.
