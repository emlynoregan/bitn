Talkies in Burra

The Institute was crowded last Saturday for the change over from silent films to talkies.  The Mayor opened the show from the stage.  Also present with him were G.E. Dane the local representative of the Theatregraph Co. and Mr Leslie Lester from Adelaide.  Mr Lester thanked the audience for 20 yearsâ€™ support for the company.  The show opened with a Gazett [sic] and the sound was very good and clear.  The first film was Ambassador Bill followed by Dangerous Years.
