‘A Frequent Traveller’ writes from Aberdeen on 1 July, complaining about the Northern Mail Service.

He says the Laura-Port Augusta-Blinman Mail is due in Aberdeen on Wednesday, but does not arrive till Friday.  Sometimes the guard arrives with the mail, but without the coach.  These have been common results for months.  The writer complains that the contractor is running an opposition coach on the north-eastern road thus depriving the route he has the mail contract for of sufficient horsepower.

‘The fact of the matter is that it is driving all the traffic away from this place to the Clare line, thus doing us a serious injury.’

‘I do not remember any time for a season that the Blinman contract has been carried on in such an unsatisfactory manner, and I fancy it must be the only line in the colony where the mail is always late.’
