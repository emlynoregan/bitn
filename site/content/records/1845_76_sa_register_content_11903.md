An Election Meeting was held on Saturday 4 September to hear the political views of Mr McEllister.  The meeting had not been widely advertised and it was 8 p.m. before about 40 people assembled and proceedings could begin.  Mr G. Leon was elected to the chair in the absence of any person who had been long in the town.

Mr McEllister’s main points:

He would resign at any time if requested to do so by one third of the electors.

He favoured law reform.

Supported Mr Torrens’ Real Property Act.

Was for free distillation.

Opposed large scale emigration and thought the present one ship a month was too much.

Supported railway expansion, favouring the route through the Gilbert Valley and liked the ides of an extension to Mount Remarkable.

Would support a rate to maintain roads beyond the District Councils.

Did not like land speculators, but thought it hard to prevent their operations.

He favoured the extension of education.

A motion declaring him a fit and proper person to be elected was carried without dissent and the quietest election meeting ever held in Burra was all over in about 20 minutes.
