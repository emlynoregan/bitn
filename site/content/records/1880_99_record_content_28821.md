Editorial on Land Legislation.

The writer is particularly critical of Acts, which have not achieved the main aim: that of seeing land settled and developed, not merely sold to raise revenue.  This applies especially to land sold in the 1870s.  The advice of the Surveyor-General (Goyder) and the Commission of 1867 was ignored.  The result has been to depopulate old areas, and injure pastoral areas that were not suitable for agriculture, but were subdivided for such.  ‘Many of them go so far as to declare that they could not make a living on their present holdings if they had them for nothing, and scores of families have left us for the other colonies.’

What has been done cannot now be undone, or easily mended.  ‘The holdings taken up for cultivation are far too small for grazing, and in many districts four families must leave and four homesteads be deserted to enable the fifth settler to get enough land to make a living.’  But what is to be done with the four?  The concessions so far have been applied very unevenly and unfairly.

He then proposes a system of perpetual lease.

[This 2¼-column leading article is a good example of Holder’s clear and sensible prose as well as of his handling of ideas.]
