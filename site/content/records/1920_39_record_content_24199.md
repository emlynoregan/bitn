The Angorichina TB Soldiers’ Car Appeal has reached its target.  The Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society recently decided on a Chevrolet Utility car at a cost of £202 and this has been fully subscribed by Burra & District.  The car will be a memorial to Signaller W.J. Davey whose widow organised the appeal.  Mr Davey was publicity officer for the society for several years.  The car will be formally handed over in Market Square on Saturday 1 October.
