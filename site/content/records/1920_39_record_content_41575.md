Burra Town Council, 18 April

J.B. Griffiths was granted permission to make additions to his buildings.

Drew & Crewes applied for licences for two petrol pumps in the street under new by-laws.  Granted at £1-1-0 per pump.  [The by-law provided for a fee of up to £10.]

H. Hill & Co. applied for a licence for a vehicle plying for hire.

Inspection of bridges revealed:

Bad timbers in the Kingston St Bridge

Footway bad on the Moorhead St [Morehead] Bridge [Redruth Bridge]

Continued observation needed at Finch’s Bridge [South of the cemetery]

Repairs needed at Cave’s Bridge [Snake Gully]

Concreting needed at the George St Bridge – a big job and perhaps metal would do for a time.  [This sounds more like George St Ford.]

A list of minor roadworks was approved.

Cr Bevan asked if Cr Button intended attending the Hospital Board.

The Mayor said it should be addressed in the Local Board of Health meeting.
