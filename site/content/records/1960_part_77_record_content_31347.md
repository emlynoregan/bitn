Burra High School

Thirty-two students and four teachers undertook a nine-day trip to Tasmania in the recent vacation.  They visited Launceston, Hobart, Zeehan, Port Arthur, Rosebery, Queenstown and Ulverstone.

They travelled to Melbourne by coach overnight and then flew to Launceston.  The next day they went by coach to Hobart for four days, which included a trip to Port Arthur.  They then went to the west coast to visit Queenstown, Zeehan, Rosebery and Savage River.
