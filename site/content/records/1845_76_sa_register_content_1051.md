I am confident these cost will bear scrutiny.  Surely the poor man should have sufficient in excess of these necessities as would clothe him and his family and give some little education to his children.  He cannot do this at the present rate of wages.  There are calls for the richer population to fund charity education.  Can the labourer be being paid too well when his children must be educated by charity?  Under these circumstances it is too bad to be mocked by men in the Legislative Council and to be told by the press of the dearth and scarcity of labour, but not a word about the high cost of rents nor the high price of fuel and every article of consumption.  During the past two year the cost of items which benefit the capitalist have increased by 100 to 150%, while wages have risen 10 to 15%, showing at what ratio the working man participates in the prosperity of the colony.
