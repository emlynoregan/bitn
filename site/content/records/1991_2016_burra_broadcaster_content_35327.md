Barker Homes Annual Report by Chairman Jock Duncan.

The homes had an operating loss of $1,192 for the year, due to not maintaining full occupancy towards the end of the financial year.  Cash reserves remained very sound.  Capital upgrades this year included a complete rebuild of a Chapel Street bathroom â€“ there is now one more to do.  In Pearse Row two units were repainted, re-curtained and re-carpeted.  [Other minor works are listed.]
