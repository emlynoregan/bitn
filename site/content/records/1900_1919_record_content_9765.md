Kooringa Methodist Church is having three new ceiling ventilators fitted to remove the hot air.  They are designed to allow air to flow upwards only and should eliminate the heat, which has oppressed congregations for 48 years.  It has also had acetylene gas installed.  A ‘Bradley’ generator will be constructed in a gas house under the trees at the rear of the vestry.  After running along the ridge with branches to various light fittings it will descend the eastern wall to light the lamp by the footpath.  The jets will be enclosed by opal globes.  24 double burner kerosene lamps will be replaced by 14 acetylene jets and the heat generated should be much less.  Scaffolding is by Mr Launder, assisted by Mr Griffiths.  Carpentry by John Pearce.  Ironwork by Mr Williams with acetylene engineers Mr Chapman of Adelaide and Mr Fisher of Kooringa.
