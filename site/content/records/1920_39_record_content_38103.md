‘Steel Beak’ writes a long letter in response to the Citizens League, supporting it in part, but afraid it has not placed God high enough on the agenda and seemingly not so sure that the gold standard is a good thing: ‘by means of the gold standard, currency controls work production and credit instead of work controlling currency.’

Rev. H. Stanley Jarvis was accorded a welcome social in the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall last Wednesday evening.  He was welcomed by Rev. F.J. Barnes of Redruth, E.J. Davey for the trustees, Clem Pearce for the Sunday school, the Mayor and J. Arthur Riggs on behalf of the stewards.
