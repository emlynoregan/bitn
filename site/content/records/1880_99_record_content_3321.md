Candidate Alexander Hay’s views: -

For land law reform to expand pastoral and farming use.

Believed in larger areas for farms since farmers cannot rely solely on wheat, but need to raise livestock and dairy cattle.

Was for free trade between the colonies and with overseas countries.

Against direct taxes on local producers of goods.

For railway extension.

For an improved harbour for Adelaide.

For more members of the Legislative Council and the division of the colony into electoral districts for the Legislative Council.
