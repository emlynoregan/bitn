The Bumper Quiz night for the Burra Railway Station drew a favourable crowd on Friday night and almost $2,000 was raised for the cause.  The following day the morning tea and tours of the station saw a stream of visitors keen to see the work being done.  Evidence of Roy Taplinâ€™s painstaking work was plain to see.

Pip Edson writes on behalf of the Friends of the Burra Railway Station to thank all who supported their effort at the Quiz Night and those who visited the station to see the developments there.  She reports that almost $2,000 was raised.
