Burra Burra Copper Co.  Some very slight effort is being made to raise some ore, but there is really little activity at the mine.  The pumping plant promised for mid-December has not yet appeared.  Copper prices are high enough to induce some action, but nothing much is done.  Some little development work has been done in shafts and about a dozen tributers are still at work.  Hope is wearing out.
