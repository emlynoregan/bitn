SA Mining Association half-yearly report

The position of the company’s affairs underwent no remarkable change in the early part of the half-year just ended, but towards its close the approach of spring and the continued attractiveness of the goldfields again tempted many men to abandon their work and so denuded the mine of labour as to render it impossible to carry on the usual mining operations without incurring serious loss.  The Directors consulted Mine Captains and others and determined to suspend work below the water level and allow water to rise until a sufficiency of labour can be procured.  Having first taken every practicable means to secure the safety of the Mine, the pumping engines were stopped on 1 October.  The water has now risen to within 24 fathoms of the surface without any accident occurring.  The powerful pumping engine at Schneider’s Shaft will speedily remove water from the Mine as soon as the arrival of a supply of labour will justify it.  In the meantime the remaining men will be employed working pitches in the dry and shallow levels.  In the last six months production of ore has been 2,363 tons, estimated to yield an average of 24%, equivalent to 567 tons of copper.  The works of the Patent Copper Company have been in active operation and the copper return shows the receipt from them of 1,203 tons of copper in the past half-year.  The ore in stock for both companies is sufficient to employ the furnaces for 12 months.  No interruption to the smelting works is anticipated.  The recent rise in the copper price while the company has large shipments afloat, combined with stock on hand, will greatly increase profits and partly compensate shareholders for the lack of labour.

Total profit for the last six months is £55,432-10-0, which added to profits of £61,307-14-7 derived from the preceding half year, gives a general gain of £116,740-4-10 in the year to 31 March 1851, of which £85,948-7-2 is as yet undivided.  At present there is a sum of £86,255 applicable to future dividends.

Since the AGM in April the Directors have paid two dividends of 100% and it is their intention, should no unforseen circumstances occur, to pay similar dividends in December and March next.  The number of men and boys employed on 30 September 1852 was 157 and since then has fallen to about 100.
