Burra Town Council.

A letter from Fred Martin, surveyor for Fire Insurance Companies, suggested the need for a Fire Brigade as at present the town possesses none despite there being a high pressure water service laid along the main streets.  The only fire hose in the town belongs to the Mines and that is not in the town.  It would cut town insurance premiums by £150 p.a.

Cr Sampson moved that a committee interview leading townspeople and the insurance companies with a view to forming a volunteer Fire Brigade.  Carried.

The Cricket Club is to be allowed to retain all gate money until the pitch is paid for.
