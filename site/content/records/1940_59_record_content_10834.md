Black-Out Trial

This was largely very successful.  A few people had light showing around curtains or blinds.  Some people seem to have simply turned out their lights.  It is advisable to have at least one room blacked out properly for use in extended periods of black-out.  Some people need to attend to skylights and fan lights.  The Burra North Siren appears to have been very successful.  A further trial may be held shortly from 7.30 to midnight.
