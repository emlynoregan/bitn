Sgt R. Woollacott writes from France 8 august, of life back from the trenches a little as well as in the front line.  The opposing lines were 600 to 800 yards apart where he was which saved the occupants from bombs and grenades.  To the left where he had previously been the trenches were close enough for bombs and grenades to be thrown and for badinage across the front.
