Accident.  Alfred Launer of Stone Hut Creek, Robertstown, has a road contract and was working at a quarry about half a mile from Koonoona Station last Thursday.  He was shaking the dust off a detonator preparatory to putting in a charge, when it exploded.  He lost three fingers of his left hand, injured his right hand and sustained facial cuts and other mutilations.  Despite these injuries and shock, he managed to run to Koonoona Station, arriving a little after 6 a.m.  Mr Glen Hawkes was up and drove him at once to Burra Hospital.
