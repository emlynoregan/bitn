Capt. Frank Hurley had requested that someone arrange a kangaroo hunt for inclusion in the talkie travelogues he is making for the Centenary Executive Committee.  Mr H. Byles of Kooringa says, ‘We have a regular hunt club down here.’  He says that about thirty or forty miles out, there are plenty of kangaroos.  ‘We got 23 over the weekend.  Mostly motor cars are used for chasing them.’ He said.  Capt. Hurley has indicated that he will try to take up the offer.
