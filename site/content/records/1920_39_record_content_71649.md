Basketball.  A general meeting on 13 July was held to discuss the fate of the Association.  Lack of interest by the public and lack of funds made them decide to go into recess for the rest of the season.  A final financial statement will be delivered to a general meeting later in the week.  Members in arrears are asked to pay up promptly to enable a general wind-up.  Main goal-throwers for the season:

J. Lynch	(White)	120	(76)

E. Scroop	(Red)	99	(6)

C. Baker	(Gold)	64	(16)

K. Moore	(White)	40	(14)

E. Fuss	(Red)	39	(15)

G. Kakoschke	(Black)	37	(10)

G. Ball	(Gold)	22

(Numbers in brackets indicate goals thrown while playing as a substitute in other teams.)
