Colin went on to acknowledge the efforts of Ian and Eva Auhl, the late Ann Perry, Shirley Thamm, Margaret Henderson, Di Day, Debbie Brown, Tess Hopkins, Chris McCabe, Cynthia Burnett and Roger Henderson for his belief in, and striving for such a special room.  He also thanked the bodies who had funded it.

Chris McCabe was then called upon to open the room in the absence of Ian Auhl who was prevented from attending by illness.  He read a speech prepared by Ian Auhl for the occasion.  Ian recalled the lack of library facilities when he had first come to Burra in the 1960s and referred to the marvellous Community Library now in place.  He too thanked those who had worked to bring together this collection of Burra’s History.

He said that when he had come to Burra in 1964 he knew nothing of its History except that he had been born here in 1914.  Though he had then written nothing, he was hooked on Burra from the moment he arrived.  He said he had told the story up to 1877 so there was plenty yet to research and more of the story to be told.  This history room is the starting place for that story.

Before Chris cut the ribbon to open the room, Roger Henderson, past Principal of BCS performed a short acknowledgement and read two citations to accompany framed photographs of Ian Auhl and Colin Fidock.

The opening of the room coincided with the ninth birthday of the Burra Community Library.
