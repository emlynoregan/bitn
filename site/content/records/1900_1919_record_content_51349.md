Sapper A.J. Fitzgerald, brother of Mrs G. Herbert is reported missing since 10 July.

[Oddly he is next reported to be a POW in the paper of 7 November 1917 and then to have been killed in action in November 1916 in the paper of 9 July 1919, but Army records more convincingly say he was killed in action 10 July 1917.]
