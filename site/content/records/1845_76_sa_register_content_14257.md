Kooringa News, 3 April

This has been a week of enjoyments; picnics, excursion parties, tea parties, shooting parties and cricket.  The weather has been very good.

On Sunday the Anniversary of the Wesleyan Sunday School was celebrated with special services.  The guest preacher was Rev. Spencer Williams of Norwood.  On Monday the teachers and students went in procession through the town and then gathered for tea and cakes.  The tea meeting that followed was very successful and the whole affair was the most interesting and successful Anniversary held in Kooringa.  The public meeting in the chapel was crowded.  Mr J. Paul chaired the meeting and the secretary J. Skews reported that there were 257 scholars and 50 teachers on the books and the school was flourishing.  On Monday morning Rev. Williams preached a sermon in Welsh for the benefit of the Welsh community here.

The election last Thursday was so quiet an affair that many here did not know of it until it was all over.  Only 72 exercised the franchise at the polling station at Kooringa, and coming one by one, they passed unobserved.  No one seemed to take the slightest interest in the matter.  Had the election been more local in character more interest might have been taken.  We may soon see if that is the case, as the involuntary resignation of Mr Lennon has created a vacancy in the representation of this district.  Already a requisition has called for Mr G.S. Kingston to stand and if Mr J.B. Neales is unsuccessful in the Upper House he is likely to be asked to stand in the Lower House for this district.

The return cricket match between Burra Burra & Hamilton came off on Easter Monday and drew a good crowd.  In the end Burra men were victorious by 144 runs:

Burra Burra 96 & 130 defeated Hamilton 47 & 35.

Rev. Ibbetson preached his farewell sermon last Sunday at St Mary’s.  At the formal farewell the following Monday he was presented with a purse of 50 sovereigns and the pupils of the Sunday school gave him a silver pencil case.

A young man named James Tucker has been committed for trail on the charge of raping a young girl aged five.
