Mr Chesterfield (overseer) and Mr Mullins (labourer) were working on Mr Gebhardtâ€™s house at Mt Bryan on Wednesday when a gust of wind moved scaffolding around a chimney and both men fell 25ft.  Mullins received slight concussion and cuts and bruises, but it is not likely he will be laid up.  Chesterfield was shaken with some cuts and bruises.  That they both survived with so little damage is amazing.
