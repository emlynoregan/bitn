The Ratepayers’ Meeting last week drew a disappointing 34 people.

The Chairman gave his report and said despite State and Federal Government discussion, there had been no change in local government’s reliance on the unpopular land rating system of finance.  A major expense in 1974-75 was the renovation of the Burra Swimming Pool.  Revenue from the Caravan Park was pleasing.  A project on hand was the tidying up of the Burra Creek, which will shortly fill with water.  At Burra North a REDS funded project will see six new tennis courts available for 1975-76.  Six other projects have been put to the REDS authorities.  The Burra Golf Course will be improved by the development of the new clubhouse.  State Government provided a grant of $12,450 towards this.

New Councillors for 1975-76 are:

Baldina Ward	A.A. Barker

Booborowie Ward	J.S .Hawker

Mt Bryan Ward	A.J. Gebhardt

Burra Town Ward	F.R. Ford

Re-elected Councillors are:

Burra Town Ward	R.B. Jennison

Hanson Ward	D.L .Lloyd

In the last fire season Council units attended more fires outside the district than in it.  The Farrell Flat fire truck has been replaced with a cab chassis from Council plant.

Service certificates were presented to Mal. Kellock and Harry Quinn.  Roy Jeffery was unable to be present.

Judge Ward then gave an address.

He agreed with the importance of recognising the service of Councillors, but said many Councils were grossly understaffed and at time job satisfaction was low.  Changing communities also required some changes to Council boundaries.  The main difficulty experienced by all Councils is funding.

One matter given some airing was a call by some ratepayers (supported by a petition) for part of the present Burra Burra Council to secede to Hallett.
