Letter.  Alan C.O. Hall writes suggesting that people did not attend the recent public meeting on Council amalgamations because Councillors have repeatedly said they will not take direction from ratepayers and so Burra will end up with Robertstown etc. regardless of the benefits of merging with Clare.
