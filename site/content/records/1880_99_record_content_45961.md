Mare’s Nest No. 2

The Burra correspondent to the Advertiser [W.H. Hardy] wired that paper on Friday that a man named Haggarty was admitted to the Burra Hospital on Thursday, having been sent from Waukaringa after a severe accident, and saying ‘he is progressing favourably.’

In fact he died on his way to Burra and was never admitted to the hospital alive.

[Obituary: registration details show Daniel Haggarty of Waukaringa (NSW) died 6 July 1892 aged 55 between Waukaringa and Yunta.]
