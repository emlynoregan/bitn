2.	Another would be so limited that only the Square would be served, apart from the water carts.  It would comprise simply tanks over the well in the Square.

3.	Then there is Mr Henderson’s scheme, which would seem to suit quite well.

4.	Finally there is an extension of the Aberdeen pipes.

This last scheme involves agreeing to the Government making 12½% on their outlay either by levying a rate, a Corporation payment, or private guarantee.  Besides this it is tacked onto the railway supply.

Now if a scheme can return 12½% to the Government it can do so for the Council, which can borrow at 6% and so make 6½% profit.  Moreover the Government does not get work done as cheaply as the Council so the cost to Council would be even less.  This would also remove the threat of a general rate being introduced.

Another plan available is for the Government to construct the scheme and then hand it over to the Council for local authorities to run at what profit they can get while paying the Government 3% of the cost of construction in year 1, 4%in the 2nd year and thereafter 5%.  This would remove the problem of obtaining the funds for construction.

The Council would have a say in the extent of the scheme and the working would be in their own hands.  This is the plan likely to be recommended by Government and a new well and tower could be provided between Kooringa and Aberdeen from which all portions of the town could be served.
