Three other returned of whom Rex has since died of malaria.  He was born at Terowie, when his mother died.  [Harriet Ann Brady nee White died 17 June 1893, just one month after the birth.]

[Ernest was a son by his second wife nee Ellen Adelaide Wood and one of the remaining two unnamed sons who served was Essington.]

He also has a photo of some 12 Burra Club members taken at the German School ground at the back of Roach’s Mill.  He says he did the ironwork for the home of Charles Drew on Limestone Hill for which F.W. Holder was the architect.  [The Editor adds that this was now the home of W.H. Sandland.  The reference is to ‘Heathmont’.]
