Burra Burra DC

It was resolved to continue with the proposal to have Redbanks Reserve dedicated under the care, management and control of the Council.

Burra Primary School Committee AGM elected: Chairman, D. Zanker and Secretary, K. White.

Retiring Chairman Darrell Field presented the 86th report.  In the past year the school was accepted as a participant in the Hallett and District Schools Association Sports Day and the school competed in 1963 and 1964.  This year has seen the building of the new toilet block and the fencing of the playing area between the school and the old Drill Hall, now the Postal Department Depot.  The retaining area south of the tennis courts and the paving of the rest of the school yard.  Sports Day on 25 October was very successful.  The Welfare Club ladies are doing magnificent work and this year they are putting down a cricket pitch on the new oval.
