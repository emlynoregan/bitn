Dr R.C. Heddle

Weiss arrived at Burra Hospital c. noon on 5 May.

Weiss said at about 12.40 that someone had been shot and someone was dead at Mr Phillips’ Station.

Weiss said he had been hurt in the foot.

Heddle and MC Sparrow went to ‘Studholme’ where he found Miss Mattner lying on a double bed with three wounds in the abdomen and apparently bleeding internally.

He found Lance Phillips lying face down and dead in a large pool of blood in the kitchen.

On X-raying Miss Mattner he found two pieces of metal in the abdomen that could have been broken pieces of bullet which he considered could have passed through another body.

Dr Heddle gave details of the post-mortem, which showed a bullet had entered the deceased’s back and passed through his chest.

Heddle also gave evidence about Weiss from a consultation with him in 1947 at Booborowie.

He had found a bullet wound in Weiss’s third right toe and a corresponding bullet hole in his shoe.
