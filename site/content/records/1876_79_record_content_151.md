[The article then follows the progress of the club at some length.]

The Acting Governor opened Parliament on 17 March and on 23 March the Premier introduced his policies.  He proposed narrow gauge railways from Pt Augusta north, and Gladstone to Jamestown and broad gauge extensions from Burra to Terowie and Kapunda to Morgan.  Contractors would be encouraged to import their own labour.  He proposed an income and property tax.

F.W. Holder became Leader of the Opposition, which included E. Lipsett, J. Drew, W. West, R. Sanders and P. Lane.

There was apparently a change of government because the article continues with a report of the Government headed by F. Holder  presenting its policy on 23 May.

Premier & Chief Secretary	F.W. Holder

Attorney General	[P.] Lane

Treasurer	[R.] Sanders

Commissioner of Crown Lands	[J?] Paull

Commissioner of Public Works	Mr Miller

Minister of Education	E. Lipsett

The proposals included better representation for the expanding areas of the Colony and the retirement of a third of the Legislative Council at each general election.  Railway proposals were similar in extent, but at broad gauge except for the Gladstone line.  A major proposal was for the construction of a new Outer Harbour for Adelaide.  This program would require a large loan and increased taxation, but the influx of population the works stimulated would ease the repayment burden.  He outlined the new tax proposals and some reform of Land Laws.
