Arrival of Mr Stuart at Kooringa

Kooringa 16 December 1862

Stuart has arrived at Kooringa and was enthusiastically greeted by a large crowd at the Post Office.  An address was presented to him.  Mr Stuart repeats that the route is quite practicable for stock.  The grass on the banks of the creeks and rivers which he saw was quite dry, proving that the floods would not have risen from recent rains, but that the water was permanent.  He had little or no rain during the trip, but was only one or two nights without water.  The part of the coast which he reached seemed to abound in harbours.

Telegram: Mr J. Chambers to Mr Finke

Kooringa, December 16, 6.30 p.m.

Stuart, Auld and self home by last train to-morrow.  Have reached the coast.  Party all well.
