Date Stamps.  New regulations requiring date stamping of short-life perishable foodstuffs [or as the paper says ‘footstuffs’] will come into force in 12 months time and will apply to all pre-packaged perishable foods with a life up to 90 days or less.  They will have to carry a date as to when they should be used.  Break and milk bottles will be exempt because of labelling problems.
