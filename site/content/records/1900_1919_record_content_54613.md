State Election.  Report in 3½ columns of the Farmers & Settlers’ Candidates in Burra.

Mr Pick spent his speech outlining his split from the Liberal Union and in running down the latter, though not without interruptions from time to time from Mr McDonald.

Mr O’Loughlin spoke in favour of the Todd River Scheme on Eyre Peninsula, attacked the Vaughan Government, opposed proposals for a deep water port at Pt Victor and strongly supported the Repurchase Act of 1897 to see large estates cut up for farming.  He did not believe in fewer MPs.

Mr Mills spoke passionately about the problems of new settlers faced with land tax and with hordes of rabbits from Crown Land.  The Farmers & Settlers’ Assoc. had stopped bulk handling from being introduced – it would have cost millions and taken 10 years to complete.  Instead they had gone for shelter sheds for grain – though the Government had been slow to erect them.  He was for better educational facilities in country areas and a whole list of other measures to assist farmers.  He was for the developmental railways on Eyre Peninsula and for the Todd River Scheme – it would be necessary to provide land for returning soldiers.
