Hon. R.L. Butler Premier of SA visited Burra in connection with the annual rally of the local branch of the Liberal Federation last Thursday.  In the evening he addressed a crowded audience at the Institute with M.A. Radford in the chair.

Hon. R.L. Butler:

He addressed the need of the Government to raise taxes and other charges because the state could not go on living with deficits.  The second year of the Labor Government produced a deficit of £800,000 and last year it was over £1,000,000.  On taking office they had an enquiry and found the finances were seriously wrong.  There was no alternative but to economise wherever possible.  The Government had had to borrow to meet liabilities.  Interest had increased by £60,000 p.a.  The Butler Government had cut expenditure by £300,000.  Primary producers were complaining of unfair treatment, but actually it was manufacturers that were hardest hit.  Company Tax in SA was 3/3 in the £ and in Victoria it was 1/4 and SA needed relief.  Even with increased rail freight charges and water rates the Government was not recovering costs.  Increasing wages and falling hours of work were the cause of increased unemployment.  Moonta Mines had closed due to costs of production.  Increased efficiency in the SAR had seen a reduction in labour needs.
