Notice.  Burra Burra Mines.  Carriers from the above mines, and others, are informed they may find constant employment for any number of drays they may care to put on the road, there being from 12,000 to 15,000 tons of ore now on the surface and large quantities coming to grass daily.

The bulk of the ore will be in bags and arrangements have been made to facilitate loading and unloading so that carriers may experience as little delay as possible.

The winter rate of cartage of £3 for 21 cwt will cease and the summer rate of £2-15-0 per 21 cwt will commence on 1 October.

Henry Ayers, Secretary.  7 September 1848.
