Dr Ashton then conveyed through Mr Hawkes that he would not attend until the resolution of 15 August 1913 was rescinded.

It was then that the matter was referred to the Chief Secretary, through a letter drafted by Mr Hawkes as already outlined.

A further effort to meet with the Doctors was made in July 1916, but nothing eventuated and on 14 December Mr Crewes reported that the committee had still been unable to arrange a meeting.

The matter was again referred to the Chief Secretary on 14 September 1916, saying a meeting with the Doctors had not been possible and the Board could not carry on the management under the present circumstances.

The Board had then let matters drift.

A full explanation was made through the Inspector General of Public Hospitals.

After we discharged Dr Ashton as a medical officer me did all he could to hamper us.  He sent a telegram to the Chief Secretary about patients not being admitted and to the Inspector General that we would not admit an indigent patient requiring observation.  When I rang him Dr Ashton said the patient’s name was Harrison and I knew Harrison was earning £7 or £8 per week and we could not admit such as an indigent patient.

Dr Ashton’s Dismissal.

The hospital was short staffed and a series of appendicitis cases were coming in.  The staff was overworked and having a difficult time.  The Matron asked if operations could be arranged for early morning or late afternoon to ease staffing arrangements.  Dr Ashton refused to be accommodating.  He would arrange an operation for 10, turn up at 11.45 and run through the dinner hour.  When Matron remonstrated with him he told her she was ‘Too damned tired.’

Nurse Fuss said ‘I won’t stop if Cr Ashton is going to contradict his orders the way he does.’

Mr Winnall said despite advertising it was impossible to get nurses and if the Matron were to leave they would have to close.  There was a cancer case and Dr Ashton said he would operate in the morning, but in the morning he changed his mind.  Winnall then took the decision to admit no more until staffing improved.  He wrote to Dr Ashton asking that he put his instruction to nurses in writing – the nurses had been frightened after the Riese case.  Dr Ashton refused to write instructions and we decided he had to go.  There have been cases where Dr Ashton has operated in an emergency.  We appointed him honorary surgeon so he could come in and give the anaesthetic or carry out the operation if necessary.

Dr Ashton asked: ‘You did not seriously expect me to treat wealthy people without any fees?’

Dr Morris said that he thought there had been a misunderstanding.

There was then a discussion about who paid fees and who did not.

In the Adelaide Hospital there were no private patients, so it was different.

The Chairman pointed out that there were clearly some misunderstandings and the doctor’s position with regards to private patients in the hospital needs to be made clear.

Mr Winnall then referred to a letter of Dr Ashton’s quoted by Mr Davey in his letter about lodges.  Dr Ashton says in it: ‘I am not disposed to undertake any operations until a proper guarantee is obtained that my instructions concerning the treatment of a patient will be carried out without alterations.’

We know of no occasion when this has not been done and the Matron says she knows of none either.

Dr Ashton continues [in the letter] ‘it is positively criminal to the patients to allow the whims of irresponsible persons to endanger the patients’ lives.’

We are charitable enough to assume that was directed at the Board rather than the nursing staff, where the accusation would be much more serious.  But this imputation must be wiped out before any reconciliation can be considered.  We have had difficulties since 1913 with Dr Ashton and he has refused to talk things over.  Now when the Matron and the nurses would leave us we were compelled to dispense with Dr Ashton’s services.

If you ask me to resign I am willing to go.  If my colleagues think there should be an enquiry, then there should be one.  With respect to the deputation, will you ask us to resign without an enquiry?

We ask for a proper investigation into the affair and that we not be asked to resign without a much fuller investigation than has been possible today.

Mr Warnes then spoke of Dr Ashton’s offer to settle the matter on a plot by the bridge, but was mostly concerned with expressing his disappointment with Mr Hawkes’ contribution to the debate after he resigned from the Board.  He adds little of substance to the story, but reminds us that Dr Ashton’s dismissal was carried with only Mr Crewes dissenting.

Dr Ashton contended that his whole dispute with the Board had been over his insistence that his patients should be properly cared for.  Lives depended on it.  He also referred to the incident with Mr Warnes in a rather ambiguous way: seeming to assert it both was and was not a proper challenge.

Dr Morris questioned Winnall on the refusal to admit patients.

Winnall said: Yes, only emergency cases, as Nurse Fuss had signalled her intention of leaving and the present staff would have been unable to cope with more patients at that time.

The Chairman (The Premier) considered they ought to be able to get together and talk and let the past go by.  The hospital is struggling and we must consider the interests of the patients.  A little forbearance and a strong desire to get the institution on a firm footing and you should be able to come to an understanding.

Mr Crewes said if the amendment at the public meeting had prevailed it would have covered that ground.  Mr Crewes had suggested at the next meeting that in lieu of Dr Ashton being discharged a letter should be sent to the doctor seeking a conference for the express purpose of putting the past behind them.  Dr Ashton to be reinstated and a guarantee that the rules of the institution should be carried out with respect to nurses and all other matters.

The Chairman said he was happy to give them a fortnight to settle matters themselves before taking further action.  If you cannot settle it ‘you will communicate with me and I will know what steps to take’.

Dr Morris said there were only two points of difference.

The Chairman said it was largely a question of temper:

‘I am not a judge in this case.  I have no power to give a verdict; I can only form my own opinion.’
