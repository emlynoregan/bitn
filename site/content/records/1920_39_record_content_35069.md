SA Wheat Producers Freedom Assoc.

A meeting of the local branch of the Association was held in the Institute on 5 August and attracted c. 50.  The Mayor took the chair and said that the meeting had been called to protest the Federal Budget’s heavy taxation and lack of retrenchment.

The speaker was Mr A.L. McEwin of Hart (near Blyth).  He outlined the problems facing the wheat industry where the producer was confronted with deflation, falling income and drought.  Over 4,000 of the 14,000 wheat producers were carrying on under drought relief.  Increased tax will be counterproductive.  Stringent economy is essential.  Wages and incomes must fall by 12½% to 15% to match reduced national income.  Government expenditure must fall as private income falls.  Problems for wheat farmers are that wheat prices are at the 1913 level, but costs of inputs have risen dramatically.  Plant has increased by 74%, material by 41% and labour by 95%.  The cost of production has therefore risen 22/- to 25/- per acre and taxes have risen per head of population 473%.  The resolution passed reflected the two points made by the Mayor in his introduction.
