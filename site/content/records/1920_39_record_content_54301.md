Some idiot whose behaviour passes all understanding let down the tyres of Mr Will Leeâ€™s bicycle while he was fighting the fire.

The firemen did a magnificent job and have created a great feeling of confidence.  A fire that was the biggest in the town for many years could easily have been a terrific conflagration.  Thanks are also due to the hydraulic engineer Mr Jim Isaac who started pumping as soon as he heard of the fire.

Police are interviewing witnesses and preparing a report for the coroner.
