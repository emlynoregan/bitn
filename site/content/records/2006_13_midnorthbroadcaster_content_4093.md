The Burra Show.  In excellent weather some 1,100 people attended the 130th Burra Show.

[Although it says the 130th show in fact it would be the 115th due to gaps in the sequence at several periods.]

The newly established Burra Merino State Shearing Championship was a major drawcard – prize money totalled $6,500.  There were no horse events due to equine influenza.  Yard dogs and dog obedience took place on the arena.  Barossa Helicopters offered four minute joy rides, giving show goers a terrific bird’s eye view of Burra.  A barbecue and entertainment after the show was also a success with many staying to enjoy the music of Tahlia Whitman, Mercia Manners & Trisha Wilson with the Paul O’Bryan Band with Ian List.
