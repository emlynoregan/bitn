One day last week the boiler cracked.  Mr Sedgman managed the situation successfully and a fitter Mr Johns came up from Adelaide and made repairs.  Yesterday afternoon a trial run showed that the patch held.  Another leak is evident and Mr Sedgman will have to manage it carefully to make it hold out till the Government takes over at the end of the month.
