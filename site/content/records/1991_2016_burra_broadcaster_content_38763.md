Burra Red Cross has an average 7.3 members attending for the 2012-13 year.  Altogether their efforts raised $4,230.70 for the year, of which $2,812.65 came from Red Cross Calling.  They have decided to place a group of rose bushes in the garden by the creek, accompanied by a relevant plaque to celebrate the branchâ€™s centenary in 2014.*  Jess Humphrys & Ben Tiver have agreed to enter their daughter in the Red Cross Baby Competition for 2013-14.

[*It was later decided to plant the roses in the kerbside garden in Commercial Street near the corner with Thames Street.]
