BCS.  Saltbush has at last been planted on Brewery Hill – some 5,800 plants in a 10 ha paddock in an alley planting design.  This has taken some time because it was not originally known that the Native Vegetation Act applied to the grassland to be disturbed – then rip lines had to be pre-marked so that they could be checked for pygmy bluetongue presence.  (None was found.)  [Further detail is provided.]
