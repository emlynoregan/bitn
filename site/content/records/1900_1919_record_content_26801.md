Mt Bryan is showing signs of prosperity and improvement.

Thirty years ago this was one of the busiest spots on the railway.  This was before the construction of the railway from Burra.  [Sic]

[This is rather confusing.  What the writer is attempting to say is that more than thirty years ago, before the extension of the railway north from Burra in 1878, this spot on the road north was very busy.]

It was a huge camping site for teamsters and others around the ‘Flat’, that area in the vicinity of the old District Council Chamber and not far from the old hotel that was some two miles north of the present town and which did remarkable business.  Several years passed in which Mt Bryan was a town in name only – though that name was kept in the news by the district’s high quality of merino sheep production.  Then wheat and hay production was introduced and the pastoral land became top-priced agricultural land.  The district became populated by prosperous producers and the township is now busier than ever.

There are now besides the railway station four or five stores, an hotel, many dwelling houses, school buildings, a new public hall, postal, telegraph and telephonic accommodation, a blacksmith shop and a group of wheat agents’ offices.  The Agricultural Bureau is well alive, as is the District Council.  There are Methodist, Anglican and Catholic Church services and an active Music & Dramatic Club and a literary society.  There are cricket, football and tennis clubs and other sporting bodies.  As well as being the centre of a cereal producing district, it remains well-known for producing some of the best merino sheep in Australia.
