Burra Anzac Sports & District Fete was a marvellous success on 19 April and the associated Queen Contest raised £700-19-6.  This was the 9th time the event had been run and it was more successful than ever.  The total proceeds must be in the vicinity of £1,000.  The event was held under the auspices of the RSL, but many organisations assisted, including the three Burra FFCF Groups and the Mt Bryan FFCF.  The weather was good and the cycle and horse tracks were in excellent condition.  The gate was £59, up £6 on 1940.  Some of SA’s champion cyclists attended: D. Toseland and the Thomas Bros. among them.  [Officials are listed and of personal interest, H.E. Fuss was Hon. Sec.]
