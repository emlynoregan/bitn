L.A. Morrison writes on the Burra Hospital situation in support of the call for action.  The Board members can presumably get a doctor from anywhere they wish or go anywhere for treatment – money is no object to a good many of them, but it is to the majority.  Recently my child was seriously ill and required an operation and had to be taken to town: ‘it is no thanks to the Board that I was in time or that she never died on the way there.  I know of several cases that have been sent away from here and the Burra Hospital is standing almost idle.’  It is time for action.
