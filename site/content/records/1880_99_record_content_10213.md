Temperance.  Last Tuesday Mr Howie of the blue Ribbon Army and Gospel Temperance Union addressed a large meeting at the Primitive Methodist Church, Redruth, and on Wednesday another at the Institute.  He said there was a public house for every 403 people in SA and spoke ‘condemning moderate drinking as the nursing mother of excess.’
