River Murray Floods

Six employees of the Hallett DC took three trucks and an overhead loader to Renmark on Thursday to help in the fight against rising flood water.

The Burra Mayor Mr Baulderstone and the Chairman of the DC Mr M. N. de Lucas have received a request from the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to open a local appeal for victims of the Murray floods.  They will officially do so in Market Square at the Rotunda at 4 p.m. Friday.

The CWA cake and biscuit appeal had an amazing response.  Cakes came in from CWA ladies at Black Springs, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan, Burra and Hanson, with only two days’ notice.  Mrs Radford and Mrs Gryst travelled ahead of DC trucks and plant on the way to help at Renmark.  At Morgan they picked up more from the Eastern People and the car boot and back compartment was loaded to capacity with hundreds of cakes.  They were met by Renmark’s Mayoress Mrs James and entertained at morning tea and lunch and shown the danger points in the town’s defences.
