Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata Gold Mining Syndicate says in the week ending 2 April the east crosscut advanced 5ft to 21ft.  The lode is 5ft wide carrying high values; portions show coarse and free gold.  180 bags are stacked on the surface and they will forward a 20 ton parcel next week to the Government battery.
