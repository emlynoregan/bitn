Robertstown Oval.  Robertstown now has a fine new football oval with 300 trees planted around it.  A farmer donated 12 acres of land and the district raised £1,000 last year to establish the oval and its necessary facilities.  A Queen Competition held recently raised £1,452 to write off the outstanding debt and leave a healthy balance.
