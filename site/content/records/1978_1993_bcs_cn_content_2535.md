Burra Civic Centre was officially opened by Mr Murray Hill, Minister for Local Government, last Friday.  Despite inclement weather about 200 local people attended.  The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Ray Jennison referred to many projects around Burra that were in need of Government finance and expertise.  He paid tribute to Burra National Trust and historian Mr Ian Auhl for creating a climate of awareness in Burra of the historic nature of the town.  In particular he referred to:

The upgrading of Paxton Square – a project requiring up to $350,000.  The Burra Burra DC has pledged $100,000 towards this.

Restoration of buildings on Council land in the Burra Mine area.  He announced that the Council had pledged $15,000 towards Stage 1 – the preservation of the Morphett Pump House.

The completion of the sealing of the Burra Spalding Road, then to be followed by the Burra-Morgan Road.

He spoke of the success of Council inspired projects like the Tourist Office and the damming of the Burra Creek.  The co-operation of the RSL was a major factor in establishing the Civic Centre.  The RSL was now assured of a home for the future and their maintenance responsibilities were minimal.  The project had proceeded on the basis of:

Mine Royalties	$118,000

Sale of the old Council Office	$35,000

Loan from Savings Bank of SA	$80,000

The President of the Local Government Association Mr Brian Andrews then spoke.

Mr Hill congratulated the Council on the excellent complex and spoke of his pleasure in supporting the Vesting of Land Bill, which passed ownership of Paxton Square to the Council.

Mr Hill commended Burra Community Spirit as evidenced for example in the Community Library.

Others present included: Mr Bruce Eastick MP, Mr Graham Gunn MP and Mr Laurence Wallis MP.

Thanks were expressed to D.J. Griffiths, the builder; A. Baulderstone for landscaping; T. Perry for Town Hall lighting for the luncheon; Len Bence for lending paintings; Stapleton & Co., Architects and to BCS Parents & Friends’ Association for catering and floral arrangements.
