Obituary.  Fanny Finch, wife of the late E.N. Finch, died 11 March at Kooringa aged 79.

Mrs E.N. Finch died after two days’ illness.  She was born at Burra 1 August 1852, the youngest daughter, Fanny, of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Pinch of Burra.  Her only sister is Mrs Josiah Thomas of Aberdeen and late of ‘Three Trees’ who is 81.  She married Mr Edwin N. Finch 24 June 1878 and they lived first at Springbank and then Mr Finch took extensive holdings and they moved to ‘Pencarrow’ estate on the northern side of ‘Three Trees’ and carried on grazing.  Mr Finch died 10 October 1921 and his widow moved to Kooringa to live.  Mrs Finch was a strong supporter of the Burra Show and a staunch Methodist.  In early married life she attended Kooringa Methodist Church, but on moving to ‘Pencarrow’ she attended Redruth Methodist Church and in late life again attended Kooringa Methodist Church.
