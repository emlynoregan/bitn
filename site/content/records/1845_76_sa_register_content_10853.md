Kooringa Court, 29 July, before J.W. Macdonald, SM

W. Tootell (‘a man of respectable appearance.’) was charged with unlawfully selling a mare.

Corporal G.R .Lowe said that he had received information that Tootell had sold a fill that did not belong to him.

Police Trooper Holloway told how he had arrested the accused at Kapunda and brought him back.

Tootell had told him that the mare belonged to Charles Bennett and that he had an authority from Mr Morley (Mr Chamber’s overseer) to sell her if she took bad on the road.  She did take bad and so he sold her to John Brenton for £20.  Prisoner said he had returned the authority to Mr Morley.  When arrested the prisoner has on him only £2-7-5½.

John Brenton said he had bought the iron-grey filly for £20.  Prisoner had showed him a receipt to the effect he had bought her from Mr Morley for £21, but the mare was not branded as described in the receipt – a fact Brenton said he could not see in the dark and only noticed the next morning.

Tootell said – The filly was brought over by Mr Morley from Charles Bennett for me to break in.  I left the station and went as far as Kanyaka with cattle where I applied to Mr Morley (the overseer) to take the cattle from me.  He said there was no one there to take the cattle and I had to take them 40 miles to Yangtrie.  There was no one sent there to take the cattle and I refused to go further.  [He then described the arrangements for continuing with the horse with the authority to do as he wished with her in the event of an accident.]

He was remanded for the evidence of Mr Boord and Mr Morley, but admitted to bail, himself in £50 and one surety for £25.
