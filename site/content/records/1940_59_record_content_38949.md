Accident.  At about 12.20 a.m. on Tuesday a car driven by Mr Colin Lloyd, with Mr Don Allen as a passenger, crashed into a telephone pole near the Burra Electric Supply Co.â€™s power station.  The car apparently skidded on gravel after Mr Lloyd had been dazzled by oncoming lights.  Mr Allen escaped with some abrasions, but Mr Lloyd had stitches inserted in a cut to his forehead.
