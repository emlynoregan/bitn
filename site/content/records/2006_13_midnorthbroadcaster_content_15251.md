When Susan and Raymond were chairman/president and secretary of the Burra Branch they faced the same problem we face to day in relation to Kotz Cottage and that is the lack of funds needed to restore and maintain it.  In Burra the Trust maintains the Redruth Gaol, the Police House, the Police Lockup, the old Court House, the Bon Accord Cottage, The Bon Accord Fire Engine Museum, The Bon Accord Engine Shed, The Dugouts and the Market Square Museum.  Some paid guides and maintenance staff are employed on very limited hours.  Government Grants, while available for some specific purposes, are in amounts not suitable for the scale of building restoration required at Kotz Cottage.  Given our very limited income some cuts had to be made and unfortunately Kotz Cottage is one of them.  We would welcome any constructive criticism and any suggestions re the saving of the cottage.
