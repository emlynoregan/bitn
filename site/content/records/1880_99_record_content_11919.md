Editorial on the transition 1883-84.

‘We live fast, and especially in these new lands every year has for individuals and for communities immense results either of happiness or ill.’

‘upon the experience of the past we stand making history at a very rapid rate.’

He saw himself in a society on the brink of great changes, of an end to tyranny and injustice and the dawning of an age of greatness, truth and prosperity.

1883 closed with impending war between France and China and in Africa fanaticism so far triumphant under the banner of El Mahdi.

1883 saw the first steps in Australia towards federation and the prominence of the annexation policy.  In SA the year was characterised by severe depression and ended with a good harvest.  In Burra 1883 began with the destruction by fire of four of the newest business premises.  These have been rebuilt.  The last event has been the adoption of a waterworks scheme for the town.  In politics it is taxation and the land question that have dominated the year.  The Intercolonial railway is in hand and the Jubilee Exhibition is in prospect and the Federated Australasia question will continue.
