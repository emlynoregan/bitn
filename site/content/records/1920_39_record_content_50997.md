Solomon Williams: Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s.  (Continued)

I lived in one of the huts in the creek over 80 years ago and the number alive who can say this must now be very small.  People lived there from choice and necessity.  In the 1850s wages were very low.  I am told the dwellings were made quite comfortable, being cool in summer and warm in winter.  The colony was very young and luxuries and even necessities were scarce.  My parents arrived in Burra early in 1847 when I was under six months old and at first we lived on the Mine property for three or four years until a Mining Co. fiat forbade miners from living on the Mine site.  My earliest memories are of this house on the hillside above the blacksmith’s shop.  Here I first saw and gathered native violets.  We then went to a newly dug hut in the creek vacated by a man who went to the Victorian gold diggings.  My father also caught the gold bug and went to Victoria.  Our hut had two rooms, lime-washed and with recesses either side of the chimney as shelving.  It was under the bank south of Mitchell Flat.  I could indicate the place within a few feet, as I often saw it in later years.  There was a barricade in front made of long firewood banked with earth in an attempt to protect us from flood.  We were ejected by flood waters, but I do not remember out tragic exit when my mother had to climb the bank against rushing water and carrying a baby.  A younger brother and I must have been removed by an uncle who lived on the bank, before water entered the hut.

I have many times seen the flood marks covering the lime-wash around the rooms, two or three feet up.  There was a hole high up in the side of the chimney breast and I was told that was where out little hoard of money was truly banked and then plastered over and lime-wash applied to appear the same as all the rest of the wall.  We moved to a house near the bank on the north side of Mitchell’s Flat belonging to ‘Uncle’ John Magor.  While there I attended a school kept by ‘Uncle’ John Pellew.  He was a cripple using crutches to get around and wore an old-fashioned black beaver hat.

In a later flood a boy named Reed was drowned.  He lived in a row of brick cottages in Thames St and slipped into the smaller creek at the back of the house and was carried into the main creek.  His body was found near the slaughterhouse some days later.  There were many fine gums along the creek, but they were felled by order of the Mining Co. because it was said they were being killed by the copper contamination from the Mine water.  Walter Way had the contract for this.  Dust storms were prevalent some seasons creating some very dark and dusty days.  Whirlwinds were also common and sometimes three or more could be seen at a time sweeping across the town and carrying away any light material.  Huge flocks of shell parrots passed through in migration, numbering hundreds of thousands.

Boys commonly built bonfires on midwinter night and old greasy bones, rags and other inflammable materials were collected in advance.  The boys ran from fire to fire waving fire sticks and singing the slogan: ‘Hip hip hooray, midsummer day is passing away.’  When the fires burnt low boys would jump over them.  Some boys indulged in smoking, but cigarettes were not known, so they smoked brown paper and cane and used the leaves of the native tobacco that grew on the hills.  It spread out on the ground and the leaves were about three inches long and serrated and the underside was white.

The fired cleared away a lot of rubbish, but the smell on a still night was a great nuisance and the police would sometimes take action to suppress the fires.  One year Corporal Collins arrived at one of our fires and the boys all scattered, but I and my brother had to put it out.
