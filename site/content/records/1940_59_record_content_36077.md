Burra Town Council, Cr. T.H. Woollacott advised he had completed the specifications for altering two rooms at the Town Hall.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the work done for the town by the late Mr Ernest F. Marston.

Legal advice is to be sought over whether the five year lease to Kooringa Tennis Club required the sanction of ratepayers.

It was decided that the new siren for grass fires be erected between the Town Hall and the Post Office.

It was resolved to write a letter of complaint to the Education Department re the state of the school yard.
