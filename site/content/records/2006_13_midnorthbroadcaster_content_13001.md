In Waihi 62% of the population has an annual income of $20,000 or less.  For the entire region this figure is 43%.  In the town only 7% earn over $50,000, while for the region this figure is 17%.  The region has 5.3% unemployment, while Waihi has 8.2%.  The mine seems to have done little for real estate either.  The average house price in the Coromandel region is $415,110 and in Waihi it is $307,000 with about 200 houses for sale in the town.  Several houses in Waihi have disappeared into the ground and several others are deemed to unsafe to live in.

Mr Reilly asserts that ‘there is money in the mine…and that money is for Burra’.  This is not correct.  Any money in the mine will be for Phoenix Copper and a few of their stakeholders, Mr Reilly included.  There will be a few short term jobs created – Phoenix themselves give only a five-year lifespan for Burra operations.  After that Burra would be left with no new jobs, no mine and no money, just one hell of a mess to clean up.

We wholeheartedly support Phoenix Copper in their ventures in the region, but mining must not commence in Burra or in any other residential area.  Burra needs to find a way of progressing that does not rely on the destruction of the town.

Mr Koutsantonis at a meeting in Burra on 17 August said there was no way that he would allow mining in the Burra Mine pit.  It is disappointing that this announcement hasn’t received more publicity.
