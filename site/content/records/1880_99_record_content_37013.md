Burra Town Council

The Mayor reports that the Commissioner replies that the Baldina scheme is to be reconsidered.

Cr Rabbich moved that the Aberdeen lamp be lit for a period of three months from this date.  Carried.

Cr Hardy, Cr Sampson, Cr Rabbich and Cr Butterworth supported a move to clear the rubbish blocking a watercourse near the sheep yards in Kooringa.

Crs Watt & O’Leary wanted legal advice first.

Council decided it did not feel justified in placing the town under the Sparrow Act unless the majority of ratepayers express such a desire by a public meeting or petition.  [The move would have involved the expense of appointing an inspector etc.]
