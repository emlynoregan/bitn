Mr H.G. Scholz, an ex-Eudunda Councillor has enquired about the cost of changing to postal elections for Council.  Steve Kerrigan, CEO of Goyder Council has answered:

The cost of the postal ballot was $7,895.

The cost of the election using polling booths as previously would have been $7,533.

The cost of an election if booths were reduced in number to just four would be $5,943.

He felt that the extra cost was well justified by the significantly higher turn-out of voters.
