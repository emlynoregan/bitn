The Mayor said the Woollacott Scheme (to dam the creek and build an oval) would be put to ratepayers for approval.

No estimates of costs of this or any other proposal had so far been made.

The Mayor was not sure that costs for the Woollacott Scheme or for the Victoria Park Improvement Scheme could be got ready for Election Day.

Cr Kellaway said the hospital would soon be appealing to the public for Â£7,000 for its building scheme, so it would not be wise to ask for more for some time.

Cr Kellaway moved approval be given to the Victoria Park Scheme, as any other scheme was long term.

Cr carpenter seconded, as the Woollacott Scheme was expensive and they had enough on their plates with the Town Hall Debt.

The Mayor asked why it should go ahead when Council or ratepayers had not decided yet on a Memorial Scheme.  While not actually opposed, he did not want to give them carte blanche at the moment.

Cr Carpenter said all they wanted to do at present was to get the oval ready for the next season.

There was considerable debate about the sources of finance and fear of the Council becoming involved in a debt, but eventually the motion was carried 5 votes to 1.
