Obituary.  Mrs Agnes Lihou died at the residence of her daughter Mrs E. Bass on Wednesday 13 June.  She had been suffering from pleurisy, but had made a good recovery when she died suddenly.  She was 79 and had been born at sea in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope during the voyage of her parents Mr & Mrs Ferguson from Scotland to Australia.  The family lived first at Brisbane, but most of her youth was spent in Victoria where she married Henry Lihou on 28 July 1873.  In 1882 the couple and their young family came to Burra where they spent the rest of their lives.  Mrs Lihou spent her life devoted to her children and then her grandchildren â€“ sewing and mending and taking a great interest in their sports.  Mr Lihou died many years ago [1903].  Of a family of nine, five daughters and two sons survive: Mesdames J. McVicars (Victoria), George Lawn (Adelaide), E. Bass (Kooringa), E. Wohling (Kooringa), F. Symons (Broken Hill), and Messrs Thomas & Lionel Lihou of Olary.  There are 20 grandchildren & 2 great-grandchildren.
