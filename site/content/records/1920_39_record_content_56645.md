Mr R. Anderson has carried out some shallow prospecting on the block of ground south of Threadgold’s.  The outcropping reef striking north-south and dipping west has been exposed for a length of 40 ft and to a depth of 10-12 ft.  Private assays are said to report 12 dwt to 2 oz per ton.  Deeper sinking and driving have yet to be done to form any opinion as to the continuity of length and values.
