C.A. Fuss reports on his visit to Paull’s Consolidated Mine.

He arrived at the mine on 2 December.  The erection of the large concentrating plant was being carried out and was almost completed.  Crushing operations should begin at the end of January.  A good supply of water in the main shaft at a depth of 300ft is expected to be sufficient for the mine’s needs.  The mine is looking well and should give good returns when the machinery starts.  Considerable attention has been given to the installation of a slime plant in the near future which should be independent of the vanners that will be attached to the present concentrating plant.  The contract for sinking No. 2 shaft to 150ft has been completed.  Another contract has been let for a drive to enable stoping to be carried out more efficiently.  The main and No. 2 shaft are to be fitted with cages to facilitate hauling ore.  The plant has the capacity for handling c. 100 tons a day.  Mr M. May is supervising the erection.
