Peter Andrews, environmental pioneer, will deliver a seminar on Natural Sequence Farming – Beyond ‘Australian Story’ at Baldina Station on 5 July.  His radical ideas have often been dismissed, but he says he has identified a sequence of natural landscape repair processes that allow land to be self-sustaining and naturally resilient over hundreds of thousands of years of climatic extremes.  He achieved greater public awareness following the July 2005 broadcast of ‘Australian Story’, which told his tale.
