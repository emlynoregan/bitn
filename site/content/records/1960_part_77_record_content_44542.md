Burra Primary School Parents Meeting was held 3 March.  Over 40 parents and teachers attended. T. Moreland was elected Chairman for 1969 with L. Moore as Secretary.  R. Moreland as retiring Chairman reported on 1968.  The additional fire hydrant should be installed during March.  Sports day on 19 April was a great success, as was the swimming carnival.  Mrs Rayner spoke on Arbor Day.  The access path near Tattersall’s seems to have fallen by the wayside, with so far no action from the Public Buildings Department.  I believe the Department will acquire Mrs Sara’s house on Smelts Road as accommodation.  (Mr & Mrs Lannan are presently living there.)
