‘Ajax’ writes a critique of the term of Mayor T.W. Wilkinson in the form of an open letter to him.  It is highly critical and in places particularly personal with references to his physical appearance.  At best it condemns with faint praise and in places is insulting.

‘Of course, your natural irritable disposition would largely account for this.’

‘As a chairman, you are prone to be much too one-sided, with a wish to jump at conclusions before those over whom you preside are ready for the end.’

You cannot be accused of running the whole show, but at times ‘you gobbled holus-bolus unknown to your Council’.

‘Society can scarcely be displeased with your decisions as Chief Magistrate during the year, because you have generally taken good care to abstain from that position.  I can quite understand this, from the fact that banquets and liquor-ups in general are not in your line.’

‘Ajax’ thinks he did too much of the tree planting and at a cost in excess of what could be comfortably borne.

[Taken overall it is an article with an uneasy tone which at times seems to be trying for humour, but is too personal and unpleasant for this to survive.]
