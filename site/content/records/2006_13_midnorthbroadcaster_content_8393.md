Burra Railway Station.  The future of this historic building depends on the success of applications for Federal Government funding and volunteer labour by the local community according to Pip Edson, the spokesperson for the Friends of the Burra Railway Station.  She has been somewhat heartened by a meeting with Dr Claire Smith of the Archaeology Dept. of Flinders University.  Pip has also held discussions with representatives of the indigenous custodians of the land, Vincent Copley and Vincent Branson of the Ngadjuri people, with a view to its becoming an interpretive centre for the history of Burra prior to the arrival of white people.  This would see the site combine a palaeontology display with indigenous people displays and perhaps a bush tucker restaurant.   The Premier, Mike Rann, recently visited the station and expressed an interest in moves to conserve the station.  The building has long been neglected and but for the efforts of Peter Harvey and Roger Cross in securing the lease through the Burra Regional Art Gallery, little would have been done to conserve one of Burraâ€™s more important buildings.  It would never have been allowed to decay as it has, if it had been located in the centre of the town.  The Friends of the Burra Railway Station need volunteers at working bees to combat weeds, help tidy the site and prepare the building for painting.
