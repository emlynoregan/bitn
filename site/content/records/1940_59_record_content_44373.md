Demobilised Soldiers’ Assoc. held its AGM 28 January at the Club Rooms.  President L.L. Fiebig presided and 12 members attended.  The election of officers was deferred due to a lack of the willing.  L.L. Fiebig wishes to retire due to business commitments.  A.C. Heinrich after two years on the executive would also like to retire.  The Association is financially sound.  Membership remains small despite there being about 80 eligible people excluding RSL & AFA members.  To be eligible you had to have been attested for service and served at least 30 days, with an honourable discharge from RAN, RAAF, MM, MN, VDC or NAP.
