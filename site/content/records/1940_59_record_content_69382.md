Booborowie Institute.  Tenders are called for the new cloak rooms, supper room and kitchen.  Tenders are also called for the purchase of the engine and generator used to light the hall, now that it is connected to the ETSA supply.  The barley on the ‘Anama’ block has germinated and is looking well.
