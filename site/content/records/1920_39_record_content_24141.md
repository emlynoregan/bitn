Joy-Rider.  Last Friday night someone stole the car of Mr Gordon Leech of the Broken Hill Branch of the Bank of NSW from outside the Burra Hotel.  The car was driven to Aberdeen where it failed to take Sara’s corner, sliced a length of kerbing from the footpath and collided with a tree about a foot in diameter, wrenching it out of the ground by the roots.  Considerable damage was done to the car.  The driver got away undetected.
