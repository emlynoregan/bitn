Kooringa News, 1 August

We are again threatened with another exodus in the form of a somewhat extensive migration to the recently discovered mine on Yorke’s Peninsula.  While it may not at present be of so alarming a character as that associated with the Snowy River Rush, it is likely to prove more lasting and inevitable.  This has been caused by the arrival here of Captain Hughes, who has engaged a number of miners to proceed to Yorke’s Peninsula to test the richness of that locality.  If the undertaking turns out well doubtless many more will follow and there will be a partial desertion of the miners here, unless equal inducements be offered.

The streets here have been busy with the number of drays engaged in carting firewood to the Smelting Works and those conveying stocks of stores to the sheep stations.  Roads are in a passable state due to the recent fine weather.
