Burra Regional Art Gallery reports a successful year.  At the AGM on 24 October Chairman Peter Harvey reported that some 14 exhibitions had been staged in the gallery and the Town Hall.  Attendance had risen with visits of 5,951 adults and 1,435 children.  This has been possible through the support of many volunteers.  The exhibitions have features a wide diversity.  With no operational funding, the gallery relies on commission from sales and donations.  Sales have been modest and the support of friends is being sought.  The gallery is seeking state funding to enable the installation of air conditioning for the Bence and Gill Rooms and for humidity control mechanisms.  [Some of the exhibitions are then referred to.]
