Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held at the local court house on 29 May on the body of Robert Patterson before J.W. Macdonald, Special Magistrate.

Dr Mayne said that he had been called to see deceased on 29 May at Nankivell’s, but on the way met someone bringing him back in a cart.  He was dead.  He had an extensive wound under the left war and one under the chin on the right side.  Both might have been inflicted by the hoof of a shod horse.  He was bleeding from the nose and ears and I concluded he had a fractured skull, which I believe to have been the cause of death.  He had a similar accident about nine months ago.  My impression is he fell from the horse.  A kick would not have made him bleed from the nose and ears.

George Brant said: the deceased came to me on the Teatree Flat.  He brought the Mine horses up the Gulf Road.  I am employed at the Mine.  We went to Fry’s to have a drink.  Afterwards we both went towards the road.  I was ahead and he made his horse go fast to catch up.  His horse came to a bit of a pit and he fell off.  He held the bridle and the horse dragged him about six feet.  I saw blood coming out of his ears.  I stopped about five minutes to see if he breathed.  [He then describes getting help and a cart etc. and the generally quiet nature of the horse when not teased.  Alice Fry then gave largely corroborative evidence.]

Alice Fry said: the horse was much too strong for the boy.

Thomas Bentley said he knew the horse and it was a quiet one.  He had ridden it himself and regularly worked in the whim.  [Bentley said he was employed in the Company stables.]

The verdict was accidental death caused by a fall from a horse.
