Kerosene.  So far this summer there have been at least eight cases of kerosene poisoning in Burra.  More will occur as long as people leave bottles of it around where children can obtain it easily.  Despite representations against the practice kerosene is still being bottled in old drink bottles, sometimes with the original labels still attached.  As long as this goes on the risk of serious consequences remains.
