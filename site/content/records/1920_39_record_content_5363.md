Football.  The premiership match was played at Farrell’s Flat Oval on Saturday.  A good crowd made the journey and a well-filled special train ran from Burra and more joined at Hanson – estimated to be about 250 in all.  The gate was £21-19-0.  The ground was in fair condition, but the game was generally a poor exhibition of football.

Aberdeen	1.0	2.3	3.4	7.5	(47)

Kooringa	2.3	2.4	3.7	3.7	(25)
