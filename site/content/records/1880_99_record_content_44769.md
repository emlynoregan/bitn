Accidents.

[Perhaps Lines?]

On Friday a young daughter of Thomas Turner, c. 4 years old, [Ethel May was b. 12 June 1888] fell out of a swinging boat and broke her thigh.

Boys are continually walking over the iron [arch] girders of the Kingston St Bridge and on Thursday one fell from the top.  Fortunately he fell onto the street and was not hurt.  The drop the other side was c. 40’.

W.A Rabbich fell into a cellar on Tuesday and dislocated a shoulder.
