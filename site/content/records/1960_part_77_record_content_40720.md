John McDouall Stuart.  An Article by Mr Ian Auhl requested by the PMG Department, Canberra.

On 25 July 1860 John McDouall Stuart, in his third attempt to cross Australia, reached the north coast some 50 miles east of the present site of Darwin.  After raising the flag etc. he and his party set out on the 2,500 mile journey to Adelaide.  Four months later on 27th December they reached the edge of settlement at Mt Margaret Station, west of Lake Eyre.  A month later they reached Mt Remarkable and caught the mail coach to Burra.  Burra had the most northerly telegraph station in SA in 1862.  Stuart was anxious to let the world know that he had accomplished his task.  In Adelaide anxiety was being felt for his safety after not hearing from him for almost a year.  When the coach reached Kooringa at about 6 p.m. on 16 December Stuart sent the telegram:

John McDouall Stuart, Commander of the South Australian Northern Exploring Expedition, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.

Kooringa, Dec. 16th 1862

‘Through you I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition.  Party all well.  I will be in town by the evening train tomorrow.’

This was followed by a second telegram by Chambers at 6.30 p.m. on the same afternoon.

Dec. 16th Kooringa

Telegram to Mr Finke from Mr Chambers.

‘Stuart, Auld and self home by last train tomorrow.  Party all well!’

The Register correspondent reported Stuart was greeted by a large crowd and presented with an address.

The last train referred to in Chamber’s telegram was from Kapunda, then the northern terminus and about 50 miles from both Adelaide and Burra.  Register correspondent again reported next day that Stuart had arrived accompanied by Mr Auld and his party, Capt. McKay of Mt Deception and Mr John Chambers.  Mr Stuart was enthusiastically received by a large crowd.  He appeared in a very low condition, having suffered from scurvy for a great part of the trip and alighted from the coach with difficulty.  Mr W.H. Wilkinson read the address.

[The address is printed together with Stuart’s reply.]

The correspondent also reported Stuart’s departure by the Adelaide Mail for the city.  Another large crowd assembled and another address was read and presented to Stuart.  Mr McDermott SM read this address.  He and Mr Mayne JP and Mr J.B. Anderson JP had escorted the explorer from his room in the hotel to the Mail bus.  Nine carts full of people followed the Mail bus for about three miles, where they gave three hearty cheers before returning to Kooringa.

[The address read by McDermott is also printed.]
