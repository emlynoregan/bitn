Burra Motel Complex has received the approval of the SA Planning Commission.  The application was submitted by Tim Carter Pty Ltd of Peterborough and negotiations commenced in May 1986.  Three other sites in Burra were rejected by the Heritage Branch on environmental reasons.  Mr Carter has indicated that the proposal will proceed as soon as possible.  Council has long believed the town needs a motel and restaurant.  The development is valued at about $1.9 million.
