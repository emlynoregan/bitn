Weather.  The last week produced some very rough weather.  As we went to press last week we were experiencing one of the worst of dust storms and after a lull on Wednesday morning it returned in almost as severe a form and continued till Friday night when about 15 points of rain began to fall, continuing into Saturday.  Strong wind and rain continued over the weekend with rain, hail, sleet and a little snow.  By 9 a.m. Monday 46 points had fallen.

To the east the pastoral country has been experiencing the worst dusts storms for many years.  Last Tuesday 24 September the dust was so dense that in many homesteads it was impossible to see folk standing in the same room, to say nothing of its blinding and choking nature.  At Mallett after the event everything had to be taken outside and the walls and ceilings washed down.  Residents there quite expected the curtains to tear away from the curtain rods so great was the weight of dust adhering to them and caught in the folds.  Many places had sheds unroofed and other damage done.  Herbage has been badly affected.  Rainfall there has been minimal with Koomooloo reporting 8 points and Sturt Vale 9 points.

In the agricultural country damage from the dust storms was also reported.  E.W. Hawker & Sons of North Booborowie lost the roof from their lucerne shed when it was lifted into the air and dropped onto the nearby chain road completely blocking it.  At Koonoona a cottage roof was lifted 50ft and carried 150 yards away.  A.T. McWater’s chaff house at Mt Bryan suffered a similar fate.  Burra was somewhat protected by the surrounding hills, but large tree branches were brought down and only prompt action saved some roofs.

Snow

Mt Bryan, Hallett and areas to the north were treated to a heavy snow storm with deposits about 2½ inches deep.  Sunday was the third coldest day for the year and the coldest in September.  At Willalo snow on Sunday began about 7 a.m. and fell for c. 2½ hours in large flakes.  The hills were thickly covered and wheat crops 6 inches high disappeared under it.  The minimum depth of snow was 3 inches and was the heaviest fall ever seen in the district.
