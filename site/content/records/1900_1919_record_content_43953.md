Redruth Police Court.

Gustav Kuchenmeister sued James Edward Donaghy for the balance of:

£28-4-3 for labour and work done, £30 for the loss of two horses, £95 for the depreciation in value of 19 horses at £5 a head and £60 for loss of contract profit.

The ground were alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, or breach of warranty.

There was a counter-claim for £70 for breach of contract.  The details are extensive and extend for over 2¾ columns.  The bench eventually gave judgement for the plaintiff for £13-7-2 and for the counter-claim of £70 with no costs on the £13-7-2, but costs on the counter-claim of £70 and plaintiff was non-suited on most aspects of his claim.
