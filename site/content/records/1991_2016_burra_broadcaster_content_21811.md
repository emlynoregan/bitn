Kooringa Masonic Lodge celebrated 150 years of Freemasonry in Burra on Friday 18 February.  About 200 people saw the re-enactment of the Consecration and Constitution of the Kooringa Lodge.  The MW Grand Master John Stone conducted the ceremony.  A former resident of Burra, the RW Bro. Rev. Alan Beames was the Acting Grand Chaplain.  RW Bro. Dave Thomas and W. Bro. Max Rayner were presented with a 5-year bar to their 50 year jewel by the MW Grand Master.  They had joined the Masonic Lodge in 1944 and 1945 respectively.    Following the ceremony there was a dinner at the Town Hall catered for by the ladies of the Sporting Complex.  Souvenir glasses and a history book were sold.  Copies of the book were presented to the Grand Master and to Councillor Colleen Woodgate for the Burra Community Library.
