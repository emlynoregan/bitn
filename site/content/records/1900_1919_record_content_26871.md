Burra Shopping

A number of businesses are breaking the agreement to close at 9 p.m. on Saturdays and are staying open until 10 p.m. or even later.  It has been suggested that trading should cease at 6 p.m. on Saturdays, as on other days of the week or out of consideration for the assistants and others, to keep open on Wednesdays and close on Saturdays at 1 p.m.  More will surely be heard on this.
