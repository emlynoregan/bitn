Burra’s Future was discussed at a public meeting last week.  Mr Harry Dowling, Yorke Peninsula Tourist Officer, gave a talk on what had been done there.  Group discussions followed.  Some of the recommendations:

Tourism should be encouraged

Historic aspects of the town should be restored or developed

Tourism would aid employment

A tourist officer should be appointed

Cottage industries could be encouraged

Community involvement was thought necessary

Non tourist areas of the economy must also be encouraged

An over reliance on tourism was not a good thing

Johnny Green was suggested as a logo

A souvenir range needs to be developed

Present facilities need to be upgraded

The creek area in Burra needs development

Burra could also be encouraged as a retirement centre

Tourism is a third mainstay after agriculture and mining (though the prospect of mining has been doubtful, it is perhaps a bit better after recent developments.  It was seen as a short term benefit; perhaps 10-15 years.)

A District Progress Association was suggested

The standard of accommodation needed improving even more than supplying more of it.

A residence and kiosk on the caravan park was suggested

The sealing of access roads to the town was seen as a basic need

Most groups saw tourism as important, but as only part of the town’s future.  Serving the agricultural community must remain a core activity.  One group saw tourism as having a minor role.
