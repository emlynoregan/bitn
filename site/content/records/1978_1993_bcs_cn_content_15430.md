Burra Burra DC

The Director of the CFS has announced that the CFS Board is to allocate a new vehicle to be housed in a suitable location in the Baldina Area at no cost to the Burra Burra DC.  The Burra District Fire Fighting Association has also recommended to Council that three new Hino 4 x 4 two thousand litre appliances, fully equipped, be funded by Council as the CFS Board would contribute 70% of the capital cost.  Council subsequently resolved to contribute $60,000 towards the cost of the vehicles by borrowing the sum by debenture loan over 5 years.   The approximate value of the four appliances is $336,000.  The appliances subsidised by Council will be located at Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan and Burra town areas and they are expected to be available by late April or May 1988.  Present appliances will then be sold by tender either complete or with equipment tendered for separately.
