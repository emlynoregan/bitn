Obituary.  Mrs Emma Ida Emily Rooke died 25 November.  She was born at Bagot’s Well near Kapunda in 1867 and was the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs E. Kiekebusche.  When quite young the family came to Baldina Plains at the property now owned by Mr E. McWaters where they remained for many years.  On 16 July 1891 she married Johann G. Rooke and they took up residence some four miles west of the old homestead.  Later they moved to their present home at ‘Baldina’.  Her health began to fail about three years ago.  She is survived by a husband, three daughters and three sons: Hedwig Mrs W. Davis (England), Dorothea Mrs A. Bruce (Burra), Wanda Mrs R.
