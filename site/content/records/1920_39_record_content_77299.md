Burra Red Cross Circle met on 5 December.  They resolved to send £10-10-0 for Christmas Cheer with half to go to Keswick Hospital and half to Angorichina Hostel.  The Circle decided to form a Trench Comforts Fund in which all officers of the Red Cross will hold equivalent positions.  The two societies will keep separate accounts.  Donations to the Red Cross so far have reached £126-14-8.  The branch has 74 members with an average attendance of about 30, with many more working at home.
