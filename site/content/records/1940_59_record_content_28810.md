Burra Bowling & Croquet Clubs

The season was opened last Saturday.  Mrs F. Kellock, as President of the Croquet Club hit the first ball and Dr Steele rolled the first ball for the season and also presented a shield, which he said he had won in 
Consistency Tournaments and hoped they could find a use for it.

Dr Steele is an old member of the club and would soon be leaving the town.  [His speech is reported.]
