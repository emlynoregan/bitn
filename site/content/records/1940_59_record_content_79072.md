Obituary.  Herbert T. Heinrich, grazier of Oulnina Park near Mannahill, died suddenly in Adelaide 29 August when he was returning from a trip to Darwin.  He was born at Baldina in 1892, the youngest son of the ten children of the late Wilhelm and Anna Heinrich of Dutton’s Trough, World’s End.  He was educated at Point Pass Immanuel Lutheran College and at Kyre College, Unley.  (Now Scotch College.)  He joined the SA Education Department and taught at Qualco, Mannahill, Pt Vincent and Sturt Street Schools until he retired from the Department in 1920 with failing eyesight.  He began farming at Rocky Dale near crystal Brook.  Eight years later he bought Oulnina Park, thirteen miles southwest of Mannahill, which he occupied and managed with success until his death, although totally blind for the last 28 years.  At Mannahill he worked to establish the Soldiers’ Memorial Playground, the Kenworthy Memorial Park and Plant Regeneration Reserve and the Tennis Club.  He is survived by his widow, Mrs Mildred M. Heinrich of Oulnina Park and two children: Mr Felvis T. Heinrich (Eringa Park, Olary) and Mrs B.A. Burdon (Pt Pirie).  There are five grandchildren.

[Herbert Theodor Heinrich born 18 September 1892 Baldina: died 29 August 1957 Adelaide, residence Oulnina Park.]
