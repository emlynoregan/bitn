Obituary.  Thomas Hastie was born near Glasgow in 1826, where he was engaged in farming.  He arrived in SA on the Shackmexon in January 1853 and worked as a farmhand near Gumeracha and then at Angaston and Dempsey Vale and then as a partner with George Mellor at Tanunda before buying a farm at South Rhine*.  He first arrived in Burra shortly after the mines were discovered and carted copper ore to Pt Adelaide.  He acquired a farm at Ironmine and after retiring from farming visited England with his wife in 1883.  He had a shrewd knowledge of farming and stock and was a man of high principles.

[*The Hundred of South Rhine was renamed Hundred of Jutland on 10 January 1918.  The sequence of events listed above seems a little odd.  1853 is 8 years after the mine started and the carting statements do not fit well with the farming statements for Barossa Valley areas. His retirement is suggested at age 57, which is possible, but rather young given that his health apparently allowed him to live to 84.  I would suggest treating this account with caution.]
