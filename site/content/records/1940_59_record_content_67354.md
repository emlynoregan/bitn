Golf.  It is a number of years since golf has been played at Hallett.  Last year a couple of enthusiasts pertly cleared the links and made good use of them.  Despite their disuse the links are in quite good order and could easily be put into playing order.  It is expected a meeting will soon be called on this subject.
