Letter.  Graham Whetstone writes questioning the positive response to the Princess Royal feedlot.  He is seriously concerned about water use.  He says each 1,000 cattle require a minimum of 6,000 litres of water per day and so 4,000 cattle would need about a quarter of a million litres per day – plus the sheep and grapes.

[Something seems amiss here.  Multiplying the number of cattle by four should multiply their requirements for water by four, to 24,000 litres rather than the 250,000 suggested.  Also Princess Royal grapes were earlier reputed to be non-irrigated – had that changed?]
