Burra Show was held on Saturday in perfect weather.  Gate takings of $486 were up on the previous year and overall entries of 2527 were just under the 1967 record. Secretary Miss Judy Beinke had arrangements well in hand.  There were 900 entries in Horse-in-Action.  The opening was performed by Mr E.C. Allen MP.

[In his speech Mr Allen referred to activities at the Burra Mine.  He said drilling there had revealed approximately 3.4 million tons of ore, which could be mined by open cut, though there remained the problem of separating the copper from the rock.  At present they can recover 60%, but 80% is needed to make it a payable proposition and work on a process is continuing.  Id they are successful the Mine should employ 35-50 men directly for approximately 10 years.  This would be a great boost for Burra economically.]

Industrial stands were filled to capacity.

Sideshows were both more numerous and more varied than in past years.

Flower entries were down, but standards were maintained.

Needlework entries were well up with a good juvenile section, but the CWA section only had two entries.  The standard was very good.

School Displays were pleasing with entries from Burra High and Burra Primary Schools, Burra Kindergarten, Leighton, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan and St Joseph’s Convent.

Art entries were down and the standard was not particularly high. Some sections were poorly represented.

Budgerigars were of a good standard and bantams a creditable display.

Poultry entries were not high, but included some nice birds.

The pigeon section was a big improvement on 1967.

The cooking standard was down.

Grain and fodder entries were good, but few.

Goats were of an exceptionally high standard.

Sheep entries were down, but quality was good.

Fruit and vegetable entries were few, but of good quality.

Flowers were good for late in the season, especially in pelargoniums, fuchsias, poppies, cinerarias, stocks and anemones.

Floral Art was good, with the flowers fresh and of excellent quality.

Horses-in-Action produced very high standard jumping.  Novelty events were keenly contested.
