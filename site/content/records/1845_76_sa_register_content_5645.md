Mining in South Australia from the Correspondent of the London Mining Journal.

I have not written for some time, since it would hardly be worth the postage to repeat at intervals that the Burra Burra was going on as usual and that none of the other mines were doing anything worth mentioning.

[The writer suggests that in the general run of mines in SA a bit of surface scratching is done and if shiploads of malachite and red oxide are not uncovered above the watertable the place is abandoned.]

As for the Burra Burra: the lode is being cut in undiminished richness at the 40 fathom at 40-50% richness.  Ayers’ Shaft has reached the 40 fathom level and they are driving on lode. (Kingston’s North Lode)  The ground in the 40th requires a good deal of timbering and the uneasiness of shareholders saw shares changing hands at £142 when news was received that they had struck the lode.  Shares immediately rose to £160.  This news was also reassuring for Messrs Schneider & Co.  In the past sic months 622 tons of copper have been delivered to the Burra Burra Company and that with only about half of the smelting furnaces at work.  This will materially reduce the cartage costs for ore.

The pumping engine is a beautiful piece of machinery, but she works more than half power and the sooner the 15 inch lifts replace the 11 inch the better.  Even now the water in the 30 fathom level is running like a mill race.

There are facilities for washing ore following the natural declivity of the ground southwards towards the creek and part of the water is lifted by the engine house from which an aqueduct [launder] leads it to a large tank affording a stream to the workings on the northwest side towards the Bon Accord property.  When the crushing engine is at work a great saving will be effected and much orey ground will then be able to be raised at a paying price, which it would not now pay to reduce by ‘bucking’.  [To buck is to steep in an alkaline lye.]

Another drawing engine is soon expected and the Directors are contemplating sending for another powerful pump engine.

The agreement with the Patent Copper Company is for them to be supplied with 30,000 tons of ore annually, if it is raised, but the Burra Burra Company remains free to dispose of ores above 35% as they see fit.  The ore has turned out to be unexpectedly rich and, after it is washed, much above 35%.  Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Co. says the clause in the agreement refers to the ores before washing, but the Burra Burra Directors say it refers to ores after washing and have sold 1,500 tons to Mr Penny’s smelting works at Apoinga and 200 tons to the Yatala works at higher prices than Mr Walters would give.  The Patent Copper Co. has rented a piece of ground at Port Adelaide where a wharf is being formed to receive coal and the ore they ship to England and it is said they intend to erect furnaces there.  They also have barges of their own to take coal to Port Wakefield, which is only 25 miles from the Burra Burra over a level plain and to bring down all the copper in return.

The Government has laid out the town of Port Wakefield, which will be offered for sale next month, together with waterfront strips 400 ft wide on which wharves may be erected.

Messrs Schneider’s Swansea Works are receiving ore from their branch here.  It works this way.  Mr Walters, instead of keeping his portion of the copper metal, gives all of it to the Burra Burra Company, in anticipation of ore, taking, in fact, ore in payment for their share of the copper.  This is a double advantage to the Patent Copper Company; it enables them to furnish the Burra Burra Company with the full quantity of the copper they stipulated to deliver the first year, notwithstanding that their furnaces are but half complete, but it also furnished a supply of the rich Burra Burra ores to the Swansea works without having to compete with other smelters for its purchase.  Mr Walters has shown his reputation to be fully justified by his achievement in setting up the works with all the difficulties entailed in operating in a country where everything had to be created for such a novel undertaking and that at a place 100 miles into the interior.

The Yatala Smelting-works near Port Adelaide were built at a cost of £8,000, where the hot blast principle is applied by a small steam engine, are advertised to be sold by auction; want of capital is said to be the cause.  The proprietors profess to be able to smelt at a cost of £10 per ton of copper with a profit.  Yatala copper is favourably reported on from India and China.

Messrs Penny’s smelting-works at Apoinga, 20 miles south of Burra Burra are completed.  They lie in well wooded country, but the supply of ore is as yet irregular.  Should the Emu Plains deposits prove to be great they may do well, though the Patent Copper Company might then erect furnaces there themselves.

Another small smelter is working on the Bremer, in the Mt Barker district.  They have an agreement with the South Australian Company to smelt their ores from the Kanmantoo Mine for two years on terms which, it is said, pays the smelters very well.  [Continued 24 January.]
