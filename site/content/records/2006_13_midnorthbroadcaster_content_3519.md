Tony Thorogood is heading overseas on a 2007 Churchill Fellowship to study cider making culture and traditions overseas.  He is writing a book and needs to do more research to complete it.  He will visit Sachsenhausen in Germany, Hereford and Somerset in England and Northern Spain, Brittany & Normandy in France and then New England.  Tony and his wife Susan opened their cider cellar in Burra in 1999 and have over 1,000 trees with about 60 types of apples.  The fellowship is worth c. $20,000 to $30,000.
