Anzac Day was commemorated in Burra with a Dawn Service at the War Memorial, officiated by Rev. Michael Hillier.   More than 200 people attended.  This year a new memorial was dedicated, listing the burial or memorial places of those local WWI soldiers who died in the service during the war.  The project represents the research of Dr Roger cross, with assistance of the Burra History Group and the Burra RSL.
