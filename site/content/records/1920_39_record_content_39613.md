A Benefit Concert was held at Mt Bryan East Methodist Church on 3 October to aid Mr Henry Tralaggan who is in hospital with a nervous breakdown after struggling for years with drought.  James Thomas of Aberdeen was the chairman.  After returning from the front Mr Tralaggan took land through the Repatriation Department at Kulpara where his wife and family now live.  A substantial cheque has been sent to Mrs Tralaggan.
