Rain.  Floods around Adelaide on Monday cut rail links with Yorke Peninsula and the north.  9 miles from Adelaide the rails were under 4-6 ft of water for about ¾ mile.  The last train from Henley Beach reached the city at 8.30 a.m. and trams could run only to Torrensville.  [Henley Beach Rd line.]  The Hindmarsh brickyards were inundated and £3,000 damage was done.  Falls in the Adelaide Hills were over 3 inches and at Tea Tree Gully 4.2 inches fell.
