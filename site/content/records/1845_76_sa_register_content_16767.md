Kooringa News, 2 September

Accident.  J. Kellaway received some bruises in a fall of earth at the Mine.

Mr Box, our auctioneer, held a cattle sale at the Hotel saleyards last week.  Medium cows ranged from £4-10-0 to £5.

Redruth Wesleyan Chapel held its Anniversary services last Sunday.  Mr H. Jolly of Mintaro preached two powerful sermons.  The tea meeting on Monday was largely attended.

Next Monday evening at the Institute Mr E.L. Grundy will deliver a lecture on Duties of the Present Age and of Posterity.

The weather has been rough for some time.  As a result more water has come down the creek than for all the winter.  The roads are fearful for passengers by either of the mails.
