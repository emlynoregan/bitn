Burra Town Council, 6 February

Council approved in principle a proposal from the Camera Club for making the back rooms of the Town Hall into a suitable small meeting room and an agreement is to be drawn up for Council to consider at its next meeting.

It was proposed that the land adjacent to the Town Hall be made available for the erection of an ambulance building.  Consideration was deferred.
