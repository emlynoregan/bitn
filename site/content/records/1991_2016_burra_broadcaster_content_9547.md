Burra’s Future

A joint meeting was held of Burra Traders’ Association, Burra Burra DC, the Main Street Committee & Burra Residents & Ratepayers’ Association.  The main aim was to discuss key points in the report by Vincent Bourke, aimed at restoring a sense of community and increasing avenues of communication between the Council and the community – perhaps the need for something like a Burra Progress Association.  This was seen as particularly pertinent in the face of a possible loss of an independent Burra Burra DC and a winding up of the Main Street Committee.  A number of ideas were floated:

Promotion of more conferences and enhancement of facilities for same

A light industrial zone to encourage more businesses in Burra

Encouragement of home-based industries

The expansion of the school to agricultural college status

Ongoing cultural activities and a craft centre

The establishment of a retirement village

A permaculture centre

A mushroom farm in the Unicorn Brewery Cellars

The greening of Burra

Development of ecotourism at Redbanks

Devise on major event each year

Produce a visitors’ guide to the town and district

A meeting will be held in March to decide how best to proceed.
