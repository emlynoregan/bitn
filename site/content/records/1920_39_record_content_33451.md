Last year’s allocations based on length of road and footpaths he deemed unfair, as among other objections it failed to take into account East Ward’s numerous bridges.  In the last two years actual amounts spent had been East Ward £651, North Ward £663 and West Ward £520, while the actual rates collected were East Ward £1,866, North Ward £1,319 and West Ward £1,389.  North Ward had also had a local road put in order from the Main Road funds – at not less than £275.
