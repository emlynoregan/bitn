The Burra School Yard is rough, hilly and stony and dangerous for youngsters to play on.  Accidents have been frequent despite supervision.  Burra parents have spent hundreds of pounds on doctorsâ€™ fees as a result of injuries.  Departmental promises to improve matters over the years have not been kept.  In a short space of time the following accidents are examples of the problem:

Peter Bown	broken arm

Leith Pederick	broken arm

Valerie Allen	badly injured knee
