Burra Races

Despite a good track, good facilities and trophies that were magnificent, the races on Wednesday last were not well supported by owners and trainers and the public generally failed to attend.  The weather was ideal and the track and surroundings were in excellent condition.  The Club consequently suffered a considerable loss.

Fire destroyed c. 300 acres of feed and half a mile of fencing on Wednesday afternoon on Koonoona property near the old Sod Hut Hotel.  It seems to have been caused by a cigarette butt or match.

PMG advises that from 22 March there will be three additional phone circuits between Burra and Clare.

Koonoona Stud celebrates its centenary with its annual Field Day on Thursday. It was founded by Hon. Walter Duffield and Mr T.S. Porter with 50 selected ewes from ‘Hill River’ and rams from Mount Crawford.  It remained in the same ownership till 1875 when Mr Porter retired and was replaced by Col. F. Makin.  When Mr Duffield died in 1880 the trustees of the estate administered the property till 1918, when it was sold to the beneficiaries and the then manager, Mr W.G .Hawkes.  The name was changed then to Koonoona Proprietors.  Mr Hawkes retired in 1930 and his son, Mr Glen Hawkes, acquired an interest as Managing Director, which position he held till his death in 1961.  The present Managing Director is Mr R.K. Pearse, who first came to Koonoona in 1938 as a jackeroo and returned as manager in 1952.  The present overseer is Mr R. Osborne.  The first Field Day (then called an Inspection Day) was held in 1946.  Koonoona was the first SA stud to fly rams to the Sydney Sheep Show and the first SA stud to sell a ram in Sydney for 1,000 guineas.  Since 1910 it has been a closed stud, producing a particularly even type of sheep that have proved their worth in all states and New Zealand with a reputation for heavy wool cutting ability.  It comprises 22,600 acres and presently carries 16,000 sheep.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  Since the report last week Mr R. Fuss says the major credit for improvements in the Flower Pavilion must go to Mrs Sid Scroop for fixing valances to the tables, assisted by Mr Scroop.
