The Burra Show

The day began fine and a large number of cars and horse drawn vehicles were at the ground by the 11 a.m. opening.  Sheep put in an appearance after an absence of six years and the district stud sheep were there en masse – over 120 of them.  Rain was heavy in the afternoon from 3 p.m., just when the highlight of the show for many, the horses in action, was scheduled.  This was very disappointing.  Much of the overall success of the show was due to the untiring work of the President I.J. Warnes and the Secretary L.H. Foote.  The gate was almost double that of 1922 and attendance was estimated at 5,000.  Membership was up 33%.  Agriculture and dairying displays were excellent.  The flowers were less extensive that in some years.  The Saddleworth Brass Band played through the day.  Sideshows were as popular as ever.

The Governor and Lady Bridges spent an hour inspecting exhibits.  School children formed a guard of honour.  At 1 p.m. the Vice-Regal party was entertained at lunch.  Mr Warnes’ speech is reported in almost ½ column and the Governor’s reply at similar length.
