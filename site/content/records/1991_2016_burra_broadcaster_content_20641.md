Bon Accord Mine Buildings are 140 years old this year.  It is therefore fitting that National Trust members chose that location for their Christmas get-together last Friday night.  The Bon Accord site was originally purchased by speculators from Scotland in 1846.  Mining operations went on for three years, but were abandoned in 1849.  They were recommenced in 1858, but no ore body was ever found and mining ceased in 1862.  Despite the adjacent Monster Mine paying at one stage 800% dividends, the Bon Accord venture was a failure.  Some good did come from the enterprise; from 1908-1966* Burraâ€™s town water supply came from the Bon Accord Shaft, before a pipeline from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline took over.

[Note that these dates are incorrect.  From 1878-1908 water for the town was drawn from a shaft on the Bon Accord site that straddled the boundary with Linkson Street.  In 1908 operations were shifted to the main shaft and it is this operation that is referred to above.]
