Burra Police Court, 16 June

Wilbur Frank Cook was charged with the theft of a gold wristlet watch, a fur rug, kitbag and shaving outfit belonging to Edwin George Kellock at Woolamba Station on 10 June.  The accused arrived at Woolamba Station with a woman in a V-8 coupe and asked for a loaf of bread.  Kellock said they didnâ€™t sell bread, but asked him in for breakfast.  The accused asked the way to Mulga Hill.  He asked Kellock if he had read any papers in the week or knew of the hold-up at Braemar.  Kellock said no.  A few minutes after the accused drove off Kellock and his brother Archie and an employee named Fuss left to go fencing.  When they returned for lunch at 12.30 he found the articles mentioned above were missing, along with a 4-gallon tin of petrol.  He motored into Burra to report the theft.  Detective E.L. Francis of Adelaide confronted the accused at Sturt Vale on 15 June.  The accused admitted having taken the items.  He had returned after Kellock had gone fencing and found the back door open.  He was remanded to Adelaide for sentencing.
