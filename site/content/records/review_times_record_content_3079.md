A Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting on Thursday last at the Burra Civic Centre was attended by about 100 people.

Chairman J. Hawker said the Council’s financial position was well within accepted levels, but would require careful watching.  The loan situation was about average compared with other councils.  The Secretary General of the Local Government Association Mr J. Hullick affirmed these statements.  Loans of 26 or 27% of the rate revenue are very much the state average, he said.  Mr Hawker said he would like to change the Council’s rating system in 1987-88.  A significant proportion of Burra is on the minimum rate.  The rural area is subsidising the town area.  As the Local Government Act required a change to ward boundaries to more equal representation of electors, so too should there be an equalising of rates, he said.  Mr Baker suggested that the proposed changes would result in people allowing their property to run down.  Mr McGuiness raised the issue of rural roads.  Mr Hawker said there were problems with rural roads, but some roads had to get priority, not just bits and pieces.  Mr Tebbett said he could not see how this situation would improve with less money spent on roads in 1985-86 compared with 1984-85.  Mr Hawker said this reflected Government policy.  The State has said it will not give out anything for rural arterial roads next year.  The Councillors have tried very hard to get outside money, but Mr Hawker said he was very apprehensive about the forthcoming financial situation.  Mrs Dewhirst questioned whether the Supplementary Development Plan would continue to be an obstacle to installing tiled roofs in the town.  Mrs Baker said they were moving towards a socialist society and thought it frightening.  She saw the examples of Market Square, the supplementary Development Plan and the proposed rating changes as an erosion of the public voice in a democratic country.  Mr Hawker said that electors could call for a poll before any change to the rating system was introduced.  Mrs Dewhirst was concerned about the amount of unauthorised development in the town and wondered whether the Supplementary Development Plan would be as laxly enforced.  Mr Hawker said those who did not act within the law would ultimately face litigation.  Mrs Tennant asked whether the Council was aware of the petition against the Market Square redevelopment.  Mr Hawker said he had been informed it was circulating, but that it was addressed to the Minister for Local Government and the petition was never lodged with the Council.  Mr Denton said many people had signed it because they were concerned by the level of Council debt and thought that by stopping Market Square they would ease the financial position.  Mr Hawker said that as Chairman he ultimately accepted what happened in Council.  He thought it was time to bury the controversy.  Former Mayor Mr Ted Baulderstone also called for reconciliation.  He revived the tradition of calling for a vote of thanks to the Council at the end of the meeting.  He said it was difficult in Council to do what people want all the time.  He hoped the perturbing split in the town over the past few weeks could be healed.  The meeting ended with applause.
