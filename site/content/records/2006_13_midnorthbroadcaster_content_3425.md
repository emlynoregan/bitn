Burra Town Hall

Burra Community Development Program has been granted $10,000 for Burra Ward Capital Project Fund to assist in refurbishment of the Burra Town Hall toilets.  The grant will enable a new disabled toilet area to be established and the other toilets to be upgraded.  Roy Taplin, a retired painter, has volunteered his time to renovations of the Town Hall and is now turning to the old kitchen behind the stage.  ‘Roy is going to save most of it and just modernise it so it can be used again.’ Ms Satchell said.*

Over the years usage of the hall has declined and it is hoped that people will be encouraged to look at the beautiful hall and that new pamphlets will encourage its use for weddings and special occasions.  The Town Hall offers excellent kitchen facilities and a large entertainment area.  It is open daily, showing a display of historical photographs of Burra.

[*This is nonsense.  The old kitchen is off to one side of the stage and there was never any intention to restore it for use.  It is a museum display.  The article misspells Meredith Satchell’s name as Satchel and several times calls her Margaret.  In Edition No. 798, 4 July 2007, page 2 the journalist Courtney Alderson writes to apologise to Meredith Satchell for the misprinting of her name last week, correcting Meredith, but persisting with Satchel.]
