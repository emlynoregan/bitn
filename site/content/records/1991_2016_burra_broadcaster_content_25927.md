Goyder Council in conjunction with the Mid Murray Council is seeking funds to seal the Bower to The Gums road.  The idea is to make the route from Murray Bridge to Port Pirie pass along this road as an alternative Highway 1 for heavy vehicles.  It would enable them to bypass Adelaide and only be 25 km longer.
