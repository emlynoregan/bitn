Salvation Army.  On Easter Monday 24 members and friends of the Salvation Army travelled to Clare on a coach drawn by four horses.  Near Clare the brake failed to act and the coach ran onto the pole horses that swerved, snapping the pole off short.  The coach was upset and fell against a post, which stopped it from falling down an embankment.  The passengers were thrown out, but surprisingly no bones were broken, though Mr Smith of Copperhouse sustained a crushed leg and others were very seriously bruised, while some escaped with a shaking and bruises.  Notwithstanding the accident they were pelted with potatoes as they marched down the street.
