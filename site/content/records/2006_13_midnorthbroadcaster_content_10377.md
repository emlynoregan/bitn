Jim Dunstan of the Mid North Wind Farm Group writes continuing the argument against wind farm development in populated area.  He considers that regardless of their efficiency or their good or bad effect on the environment, it is an unnecessary gamble with out health and well-being.  Once in place they will not be removed and yet we may find in a yearâ€™s time they are detrimental.  Australia is a big place and their location in populated areas is the issue.
