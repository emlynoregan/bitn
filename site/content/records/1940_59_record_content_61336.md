Obituary.  Otto Adolph Tschirn, (63) a farmer and postal attendant of Brady Creek, died at Burra Hospital on Wednesday following a double shooting at his home on Tuesday.  Police responded to the report of a shot being fired at his home and Constable N. Wakefield of Eudunda found Mrs Mary Pauline Tschirn, the deceasedâ€™s wife wandering along a nearby road in a dazed state, with her face covered in blood.  She underwent an operation at Eudunda Hospital and is now said to be in a satisfactory condition.  Mr Tschirn was found on the floor of his home, unconscious, with a.33 revolver nearby.  He was taken to Burra Hospital where he died the following morning.  Two sons, William Oswald and Norman Leslie Tschirn, were contacted by the police and took their mother to the Eudunda hospital.  [Born 20 April 1891 Robertstown: died 18 November 1953 Burra, residence Brady Creek.]
