Burra Town Council, 17 March at District Council Chambers.

It was resolved that the footbridge be closed and notices be placed on it.

[Information on its replacement bridge in 91, 25 (2), 1 July 1969, page 2, indicates that the bridge in question was in across the Burra Creek in Bridge Street near the Bowling Green.]

The Mayor said the Town Hall ceiling needed renovation.

Tenders are to be called for the Oval fence.

Tenders were accepted from L.A. Beinke for electrical work at the Town Hall, from D.T. Jacka & Co. for panelling in the foyer and a ticket box and from Matthews Emporium for carpets.
