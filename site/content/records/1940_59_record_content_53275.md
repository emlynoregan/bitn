Burra Burra DC, 7 January

Robertstown DC thanked the Council for repairs to Main Road 45.  [The Adelaide Road.]

SAR advises that the royalty on stone from the Railway Quarry would be increased from 1 January.

The Minister of Railways says a railway crossing just north of the Mt Bryan Station Yard would be very undesirable, but the Railways Commissioner would be willing to make a contribution to a new road on the eastern side of the line from Mt Bryan East Road, to the township.

Council resolved to submit, through Mr Hawker, an estimate of the cost of the road, with a request for an increase in the proposed contribution.

Council took delivery of the ‘W’ Speed Patrol Grader from the Berri DC on 13 December.
