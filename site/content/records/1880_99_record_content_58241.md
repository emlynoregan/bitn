Editorial on The Absurdity of Absurdities.

Cr Hardy must be condemned for his wrangling in connection with the new assessment.  Hardy has badgered the Council for two years to get a new assessment.  At last they agreed and Mr Bartholomæus was the successful tenderer.  He had scarcely begun his work when it became known that Cr Hardy was for some reason terribly enraged and rushed into print condemning the assessor and his work.  The assessor than had an uncomfortable time from some ratepayers as Cr Hardy had poisoned their minds against him.  Hardy was severely reprimanded.  Now that the assessment is completed the same Councillor who wept for it is now weeping to have it rejected and says he doesn’t care if it is thrown away: ‘the wonder to us is that he has not been thrown away instead of the money long before this’.  If the Council does not accept the assessment it will have none.  It can refer it back to the assessor for correction, but the assessor has the final word on that.  If Cr Hardy has the town’s interests at heart he will try to pacify the ratepayers rather than add fuel to the fire.

World’s End Creamery has to date treated 14,430 gallons.  The greater part of the cream is sent to Broken Hill and Adelaide as well as finding a ready sale here.

St Joseph’s Fancy Fair was very fairly attended and the proceeds were satisfactory.

Baldina Plains Private School went on a picnic to Mr Arnold’s paddock on Monday in commemoration of the annual examination.  All kinds of sport were indulged in, though the weather was most unpleasant.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church had a visit from Rev. J. Nairn on Friday.  He preached in the afternoon and in the evening delivered his popular lecture on Tam o’ Jack’s Lad, the Lancashire miner.  He will return at Christmas time for a week.

The anniversary services were held on Sunday 6 October and Rev. H. Wilkinson of Terowie officiated.  The afternoon service of song was The Christian Voyage.  The public tea on Monday was only moderately patronised.
