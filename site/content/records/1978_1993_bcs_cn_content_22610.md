Barry Wright

I am 49 and married to Maureen and have been a resident of Burra for eight years at 1 Young Street.  In pre-Burra days I travelled extensively as a professional wool-classer in SA, NSW, Victoria and WA, often managing shearing teams for a contractor.  I worked a small alluvial gold mine in the far north of SA and worked as a station hand for two years.  I have jointly produced and published a very successful book on navigational charts of the River Murray and through this have had dealings with various tourist areas.  I have an understanding of the problems and benefits of tourism.  Since coming to Burra in April 1983, when I purchased a wool buying business, Maureen and I have renovated the old Sara’s building and established the business of Sara’s Secondhand Goods and Chattels in Burra North.  I have been actively involved in the Burra National Trust, served on the Copper Festival Committee and am Chairman of the Town Hall Committee and am also an active member of the Burra Traders’ Association. In 1987 we purchased Tiver’s Row of cottages in Truro Street, which I am currently renovating.  Through the National Trust I have been actively involved in heritage and planning decisions.  I believe the above experiences will be of value to the town and district if I am elected to Council.
