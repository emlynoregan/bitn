Obituary.  C. Dunemann of Terowie died aged 41, at Terowie.  He was born in Burra and spent most of his life here.  He went to Terowie and started a butcherâ€™s business there with his brother.  About 8 years ago they stopped that and the deceased became a pastoralist and diligent member of the Terowie District Council.  His parents survive him at Copperhouse.

[Charles Augustus William Dunemann died 7 April 1898 aged 41, but birth apparently not registered.]
