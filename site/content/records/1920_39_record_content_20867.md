Burra Hospital Board

£35 worth of new furniture was bought for the Matron’s room, as the old furniture was smashed.  Mr Warnes thought the old furniture had been abused and regretted approving the expenditure of up to £50.  Salaries of single certificated nurses have been set at £125 and of double certificated nurses at £130 to £140.
