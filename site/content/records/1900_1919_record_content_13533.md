Obituary.  Mr Thomas Ford of Oakbank Station was found dead in his home there, 120 miles from Burra.  Mr Charles Klaffus who is employed there saw him alive at 6 p.m. on 4 April, when he appeared to be well.  When he returned half an hour later Ford appeared to have knocked off for tea, but on going into the house sometime later Klaffus found Ford lying on his bed dead.  Klaffus sent a young boy named Wilsdon to the residence of Frank Ford, the deceased manâ€™s brother, some 40 miles away.  Frank informed Samuel Ford, another brother, who was 25 miles further on.  Frank Ford then collected the body and brought it into Burra in a trap, arriving about 5.30 p.m. on Thursday.  Mr Ford had only just sold the station to J. Tennant and was out there mustering cattle and winding up affairs.  He had intended to have a good rest after that, as his heart had been troubling him for some months.  He was the second son of Joe Ford and his siblings are: Samuel (at the Lagoon), Frank (Burra), John (Blackwater Holes), Elisha (Hindmarsh), Mrs W. Symons (Broken Hill), Mrs Thomas Rogers (Burra) & Miss Ford at home.  He leaves a wife, one son and a daughter (Mrs H.W. Tiver of Aberdeen).  [Died 4 April 1905 aged 66.]
