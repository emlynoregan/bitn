Kooringa Wesleyan Church quarterly meeting on 20 September was conducted by the President of the Conference, Rev. W.A. Langsford.  The membership at 112 was down 8 over the quarter due to deaths and removals.  Income was Â£13 less than expenditure.  Sunday schools were satisfactory.  A plan was brought forward for the immediate union of the three Methodist bodies in the town which would involve the closure of the Primitive Methodist and Bible Christian Churches in Kooringa with the congregations worshipping at the Wesleyan Church, the work of which would for the time being be carried on by the Primitive Methodist and Bible Christian ministers.  The plan was approved and passed on to the other churches for consideration and approval.

It was resolved to request the 1899 Conference to carry out forthwith the permanent union of the various Burra circuits according to the plan agreed to last year, with some minor variations.  In accordance with this plan the Rev. W.G. Clarke was invited to become Superintendent of the circuit next year.  The meeting expressed its sympathy with the idea of a Century Thanksgiving Fund.
