Arthur Von Tossau ‘The Poster King’ and his company gave a most enjoyable entertainment to a fair house at the Institute on Monday.  Von Tossau draws amazing quick sketches.  Miss Dollie Neven, UK’s greatest soubrette, pleased and Charles Moody sang great comic songs.  Dolly and Arthur Thalia caused merriment with their lightning sketches.  Herr Johnson played the piano and it all ended with the farce The Fellow that Looks Like Me.
