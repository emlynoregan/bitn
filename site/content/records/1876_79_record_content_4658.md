Redruth Local Court 23 Aug. 
Thomas Kerr was charged with stealing a flask of brandy at Opie’s Hotel on the 22 instant. Mr Opie deposed that the prisoner was in the bar when the witness was called to by a person and left the bar briefly. On his return the prisoner was just leaving the inside of the counter and a flask of brandy was missed and found on the prisoner. 21 days in jail. 
Rheder v. T. Richardson. Rheder was walking in the square when Richardson hailed him and asked him if he was going to settle an account. They went to the hotel and after some discussion Richardson tore up the account, came round the bar, collared the plaintiff and put him into the road. Rheder says he did not swear in the bar, nor was otherwise abusive. Defendant did not hurt him. Defendant could not get the barmaid, who saw it all, to give evidence as Mrs Richardson was ill and the maid couldn’t leave the bar. Fined 11- + 10/- costs. Counter claim of Richardson v. Rheder for abusive language was dismissed.
