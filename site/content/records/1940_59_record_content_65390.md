Mr & Mrs W. Butler’s Golden Wedding celebrations are covered in a 1-column report.  The couple lived at Belton in their young days and at Carrieton and Yongala, where they were married in 1904.  Mr Butler had gone to Broken Hill in 1897 and worked underground in the mine and was also an engineer and electric motor driver on South Mine for several years and a motor driver for the Zinc Corporation.  He left Broken Hill in 1916 for Whyalla and worked as a fireman on the B & W boilers and as condenser plant attendant and also as a switchboard attendant and engine driver in the powerhouse.  He was first president of the Broken Hill sub-branch of the Federated Engine Drivers and of the Firemen’s Assoc. at Whyalla.  He left Whyalla in 1922 with his family and they have since lived at Hornsdale, Booborowie, Copperhouse and Burra.
