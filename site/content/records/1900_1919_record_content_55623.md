Burra Cheer-up Soc. AGM was held 28 May with E.W. Crewes presiding.

This year there were only 20 socials for soldiers and most of these were welcome home socials.  Only 47 Cheer-up parcels were given out this year and five nurses received fountain pens: sisters Hatherly, Roach, Armstrong, McWaters & Morris.

We have sent Lady Brown 99 pairs of socks and various other articles and many of our members send private parcels.

On 1 June we had the sweet stall at the Red Cross Fete and on 5 June we sent £30-2-6 to the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut to help entertain 700 returning soldiers and another £20 similarly at a later date. In June also £30 went to the League of Loyal Women to provide comforts for soldiers and sailors.

£25 was raised towards a piano for our room at the Rifle Match Day on 25 June.  On 6 July Violet Day was successful despite bad weather and the same month we paid for 100 Christmas boxes to be sent through the League of Loyal Women.  £20 went to the SA Auxiliary Tobacco Fund.  That month also saw a thank you social for Mr J. Pearce, who supplies our room and a Frolic was held in aid of the Piano Fund.

In August £30 went to provide Christmas boxes via the Army Nurses Association and £30 for Christmas puddings for the troops.  A Girls’ Frolic aided our sweets stall, which raised £40 on Australia Day.  A Birthday Button Day on 30 November and a special gift stall raised £150 for The Hut.  Cases of cake and fruit went to Keswick Military Hospital for Christmas.  In January £50 went to the Trench Comforts Fund.  £10 was sent to the Children’s Patriotic Carnival in April.

A horse was given to a returned soldier, otherwise stranded in Burra.  We sent three large hams to The Hut for the Anzac Day luncheon.  Altogether donations were over £400 for various patriotic purposes.

The Ladies’ band was a great feature of the year.

Their first appearance in Adelaide was on Violet Day 29 June 1917 and was very successful.

Their second was at the Commercial Travellers’ Carnival at Adelaide Oval on 27 October 1917.

The third was at the Seaside Trip to Semaphore combined with a recruiting meeting at Bowman’s Arcade and an afternoon’s program at Keswick Hospital.

Three other invitations to Adelaide have had to be refused up to 15 May 1918; since when there has been a visit.

The band also visited patriotic functions at Peterborough, Robertstown, Farrell’s Flat, Hanson, Leighton, Mt Bryan, Booborowie and in Burra for Violet Day, Australia Day, Navy Day, etc.  Reluctantly they had to refuse two invitations to Clare and two to Pt Pirie and also invitations to Gawler, Saddleworth, Hallett, Spalding and World’s End.

The band owes much to Mr I.J. Warnes who has donated a large sum of money for instruments and has financed two trips to Morgan.  There are several other generous donors we cannot mention individually.  Thanks are also due to other bands who have lent music.  The principal reason for the band was to greet returning soldiers at the station.  Almost all have been so greeted unless they came by the midday train.  Many other people are thanked for their support of the society in various ways.
