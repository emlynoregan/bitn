Illuminated Address to Sir Henry Ayers.

C.D. Wilkinson has handed us a photographic copy of the address given to Sir Henry Ayers by the people of Burra on 26 September 1894.  Of the 28 men who signed it only W.G. Hawkes survives and of them only he and D.J. O’Leary did not wear beards.  The wording of the address is printed.
