Hallett Community will remember the boys who enlisted in WWII by adding their names to the present public honour roll.  Plaques have been prepared and are nearly ready to be added to the Monument in the Soldiers’ Garden.  Memorial gates will also be erected at the entrance to the park and recreation ground.
