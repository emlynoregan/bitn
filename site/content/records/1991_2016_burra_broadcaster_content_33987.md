BCS.  Heating in the Redruth Building has been patched up enough for this winter, but Principal Rob Knight says the school has experienced heating and cooling problems for many of the last ten years â€“ mostly because the plants are worn out.  They are some 25 years old.  In 2003 BCS received c. $150,000 to help address this problem, but so far little has been done.  The matter was raised with DECS executives last week.
