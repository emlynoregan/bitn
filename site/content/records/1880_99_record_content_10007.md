The Oddfellows’ demonstration yesterday came off well in every way and though the morning was rather cold and moist the afternoon was delightful.  The evening entertainment was also very well attended.  Mr Lester, the ventriloquist, greatly pleased the audience and the Amateur Dramatic Society did well.  About 40 gathered between 9 & 10 o’clock and marched to the hospital from where wagons and trollies took them to the ground about six miles from town.  The distance did however, result in only a moderate attendance of the public.

The program of events was well run.  (The pig with a greasy tail event was won by T. Hall. [Halls?])  Kicking the football was won by A. Lott.

The main event was the Burra Handicap of three races over 150, 220 & 440 yards. (Prizes were £6, £3 & £1)

150 yds, Mahon & Lott dead heat with G. Parks 3rd

220 yds, J.E. Petherick 1st, G. Parks 2nd, Mahon 3rd

440 yds, J.E. Petherick 1st, Mahon 2nd, G. Parks 3rd

Overall J.E. Petherick 1st, Mahon (from Seven Hills) 2nd, Lott & Parks equal 3rd
