Burra Burra DC, 22 April.

A deputation was received from Mt Bryan Emergency Fire Service with a proposal to the Council for supplying a Fire Fighting Pump and Truck to the Mt Bryan Fire Service.  Council then decided to apply for a subsidy of £600 on the purchase of a truck and for the allotment of a suitable truck.

Detective Sgt D.A. O’Malley of Pt Pirie, whose district covers this area, has been transferred to Elizabeth.  He will be replaced at Pt Pirie by Detective Sgt R. McCallum from Glenelg.
