Anzac Commemoration Service.  There was a good attendance at the memorial in Market Square last Sunday 20 April and returned soldiers were well represented.  Mr H.G. Oates was unavoidably absent, but Lieut. L.M. Gordon took charge of the men who formed a hollow square on the north side of the monument.  The Boy Scouts also attended.  Mr M.W. Bednall took charge of the service and Rev. E. Lawson gave the address.  The weather was windy and dusty and rain started to fall which hastened the conclusion somewhat.  Mr J. Murison played the Last Post and Reveille.
