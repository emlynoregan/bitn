‘Inquisitive’ writes on Burra and its inhabitants, as an outsider.

Why do Kooringa people speak of The Burra when referring to the place?  It only makes sense if followed by the word ‘Mine.’

[He then goes on to puzzle over the lack of information on Burra in gazetteers etc., but the plentiful references to Redruth, Aberdeen, Kooringa and ‘other peculiarly named places all included in ‘the Burra’ as locals term it.  And yet how is a stranger to know that?]

If an inquisitive stranger takes up Boothby’s Directory for 1869, wherein there is reliable information on important places in SA, surely he will find Burra (Town and District), in a similar way to Kapunda (Town and District), but no; there is no ‘Burra.’

[The writer then elaborates on the importance of names and the inconvenience and disadvantages arising from the confusion caused by there being no town of Burra – especially as now there was a Corporation of Burra.]

I, 3 (4), 21 July 1876, page 2 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 4 on the microfilm.]
