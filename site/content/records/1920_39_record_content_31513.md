Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held into the death of Lloyd Tolley at Burra Court House on 26 July before M.A. Radford JP.

Andrew Tennant gave evidence of seeing the body by the car and after an adjournment to visit the site Dr Steele gave evidence too of seeing the body at the site with the car upside-down close to a fence on the left hand side of the road.  After examination of the body in the hospital at 12.30 a.m. [sic: possibly p.m.] he decided death was due to suffocation due to compression of the chest.  He believed Wells, the driver, was perfectly sober.

[The evidence as reported then becomes difficult to follow with the date of the accident and that of the day before are both given as 21 July in some places, but with Dr Steele giving the date of the accident as the 20th.  The lack of a.m. & p.m. is also confusing.  The sequence of events appears to be:

Owen Smythe spent the afternoon of Saturday 20th with Tolley and when Smythe had mentioned catching the train to Burra Tolley offered to drive him up.  (At c. 5 p.m.)

They engaged Harold William Wells to drive them from the Pirie St stand in Adelaide and left for Burra about 10.30 p.m., arriving there about 3.15 a.m. on Sunday morning 21 July.

In half an hour they had two small wines at the Burra Hotel and started back for Adelaide about 3.30 a.m.

At Stony Gap the car hit a big bump, swerved left and overturned.]

Wells said he had not been speeding.  There were three passengers in the back seat.  Wells said that after the accident Tolley was behind the front seat, but nothing seemed to be pressing on him.  Wells thought he had been killed instantly.

There is then further evidence of actions relating to the accident and of Wellsâ€™ eyesight.  He said the only alcohol he had was a small whiskey given to him after the accident by Mr Tennant.
