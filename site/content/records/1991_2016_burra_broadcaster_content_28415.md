Advertorial.  Stockman Electronics 10th Birthday

Tim Stockman’s interest in electronics started as a hobby when he was in Years 3 & 4 at school.

On leaving school he worked for IBM in Sydney for six months.

He then studied Electronic Engineering at University.

On 26 August 1992 Tim set up Stockman Electronics to assist him through his studies.

He soon outgrew a room at his parents’ house and gave up university as the business grew.

In 1993 he entered the Nescafe Big Break Awards, with a focus on innovative electronic devices for agriculture and won $20,000 to develop his ideas.

In 1995 he released his first product; the TMAC (Telemetry Monitoring and Control) Mark 1 – the first tank monitor to ‘talk’.

In 1996 he had to move from his first workshop to a bigger one.

After five years he opened a shop in Market Square and the business grew.

By 1999 his business covered an area from Jamestown to Eudunda and its firs staff member, Damien Brak, joined him.

Last Christmas he moved again to larger premises in Sara’s Building at Burra North.  (The old Burra North Post Office.)
