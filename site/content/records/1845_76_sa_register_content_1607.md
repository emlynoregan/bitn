South Australian Mining

The editor reviews the state of South Australian mining.

Since the Burra Burra Mine was purchased in 1845 over £80,000 has been paid to the Government for mineral lands, but none except perhaps the SA Co.’s is now paying expenses.  While much of it may eventually be profitable, it is debateable whether this sum of money could not have been better invested in other employments, giving speedier and less uncertain returns for the colony and the investors.  Mines that pay their expenses from the start are very much the exception and yet purchasers of mineral lands seem to have been assuming it was common.  Too large a proportion of the limited colonial capital has been invested in mineral lands.  If they were held by English capitalists and a sum equal to that devoted to their acquisition was now devoted to their development we have no reason to believe they would not prove safe and profitable investments.  But much damage has been done to individuals who, in the absence of immediate returns, have had to sell at low prices.  Others must be content to allow their capital to lie unproductive for an indefinite period.  The withdrawal of so large a sum as £80,000 from the available capital in the colony cannot but adversely affect property values and investment in other areas of the economy.
