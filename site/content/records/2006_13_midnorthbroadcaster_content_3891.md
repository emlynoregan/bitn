Peter Harvey arrived in Burra eleven years ago, a week before the opening of the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  He says that acting as Director of the Gallery has been very rewarding, but he is looking forward to moving to Tasmania.  He has seen the gallery persevere with presenting art of all sorts, including sculpture, art jewellery, glass sculptures, metal works, etc.  He said it all depended on a great group of people.  Forty-one volunteers allow it to be open every day except Christmas Day.  It is team work that makes it such a success.  The hanging team of about six is also very important.  There has also been a close association with the Burra Art Group.  Mr & Mrs Harvey leave in October to reside in Tasmania on 68 acres, 70% of which is native vegetation.  Mr Harvey said the tenth anniversary of the gallery in 2006 had been a highlight.  He was made an Honorary Life Member of the Gallery on 30 August.  [Photo.]
