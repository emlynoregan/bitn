His Excellency also attended the Kooringa Masonic Lodge as Grand Master of the Freemasons Lodge of South Australia – the first time the Kooringa Lodge has been visited by a Grand Master.

In the afternoon Lady Muriel met members of the Red Cross and Fighting Forces Comfort Fund groups in the Burra Institute, along with members of the VSD and Transport Members.  The hall was decorated with an exquisite floral display and displays of the various groups’ work were inspected by Lady Muriel.  [Details of this are printed.]

The Mayor entertained the Governor and Lady Muriel at dinner at the Burra Hotel at 6.45 p.m.

[The toasts are printed.]

The Civic Ball in aid of Red Cross funds was a great success.  The Vice-Regal party arrived at 8.30 and went to the dais, after which the National Anthem was sung and then patrons filed past their Excellencies and shook hands.  After a brief period of chatting the Vice-Regal party then departed and dancing proceeded. [The dresses of those attending are then described.]

A buffet supper was provided and the proceeds of the evening exceeded £30.
