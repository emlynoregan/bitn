Burra Caravan Park

Burra Burra DC has applied for a subsidy on an extra Caravan Park to be located opposite the existing park on the other side of the creek.  With the increasing number of tourists an extension of existing facilities is necessary.  The proposed new facility would cost about $8,000, of which half should be granted as a subsidy.  This would allow powered sites for twenty vans with toilets, showers etc.  This is an increase of 50% on the present facility.  Camp sites for twenty tents with the possibility of at least ten more power points on the northern end if necessary.  In the twelve months to 30 June the number of ‘caravan days’ has doubled on the previous year to bring in the fees of $1,365.
