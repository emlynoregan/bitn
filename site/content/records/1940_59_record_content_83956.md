Burra High School Speech Night was held in the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday evening.  Mr P.H. Quirke MP gave the address as guest speaker.  He urged education as the way to counter the march to progress of the ‘hordes of the lands north of Australia’.

The Mayor Mr Baulderstone presented Mr Jeffery with a silver tea pot as a farewell gift.  Other presentations followed.  The second half of the program was devoted to items by the students.

Mr Jeffery’s Headmaster’s Report

The school opened the year with an enrolment of 90 comprising 47 girls and 43 boys.  This was a record for Burra High School.  During the year the enrolment reached 94and next year is expected to reach 100, due not only to more students coming on, but to greater numbers staying longer.  No staff changes occurred this year.  In public exams in 1957, sixteen sat for the Intermediate and 14 gained a full certificate.  Three sat for Leaving and with supplementary examinations, two gained certificates.  Max Lockett, Laurence Tattersall and Pam Kowald each gained 8 Intermediate subjects and Max Lockett won the A.B. Riggs Prize.  On his Leaving Exam results Lloyd Goss was deemed Dux of the School for 1957.  This year 17 sat for Intermediate and 6 for Leaving. Unfortunately Tommy Burns, a new arrival from Scotland, took ill just before the exams and was unable to sit.  Some recent past scholars are doing well at their further studies.  Robert Bourman, Jill Lucas and Pam Kowald are doing well at Teachers’ College and University.  Marie Voumard gained a credit in recent Nurses’ Examinations.

Sport continues to be an important part of school life.  The annual sports on the Burra Oval this year were very successful.

Boys’ Senior Cup	Laurence Tattersall

Girls’ Senior Cup	Betty Launer

Boys’ Junior Cup	David stockman

Girls’ Junior Cup	Joy Kakoschke

Burra was not very successful in the Mid Northern High Schools Sports against the much bigger schools.  Next year a system of handicapping will be introduced in an effort the make the contest more even.

The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. has again given good service to the school.  After several years of service Mrs Reg. Ellis resigned as President and was replaced by Mrs Darrell Field.  Mrs Ross Day took on the duties of Secretary and Mrs Binks-Williams continued as Treasurer.  The high School Council under the leadership of Mr H. Jennison with Mr Cockrum as Secretary has continued their good work for the school.

Two new rooms were added to the school buildings at the start of the year.  One is used as a classroom and the other is divided to make a staff room and a separate girls’ rest room.  This has permitted freer movement of classes and easier school organisation.  The senior school visited Adelaide for the Queen Mother’s visit.  The Leaving and Intermediate classes visited Pt Pirie and surrounding districts on their annual Geography excursion.  Religious instruction has continued throughout the year.  The usual Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies were observed.  Mr Jim Battye represented the local branch of the RSL at the Remembrance Day ceremony.

It is with great pleasure that I can say that swimming facilities are now available to our boys and girls.  Mrs Jeffery and myself thank you all for your esteemed co-operation during our five years of service in Burra and District.  Special thanks to all those who held executive positions in the various school bodies and especially I would like to mention Mr Jennison for many years Chairman of the High School Council and Mrs Ellis, Past President of the P. & F. Association.  Thanks are also due to the loyal members of my staff and to the Headmaster of the Primary School, Mr Kies.

[The reporter found the lack of any suitable backdrop at the Town Hall to be a serious distraction and the stage without any covering of the unsightly ceiling and lighting effects, left a lot to be desired.  The Town Hall improvements have not gone far enough.]
