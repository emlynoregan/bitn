Editorial on Things Municipal.

The slaughterhouse question is the major issue to be resolved.  Until the Act is amended the whole question will remain unresolved.  Finance is the next problem.  The sanitary state of the town is satisfactory.  Some better lighting is desirable.  Some further tree planting is required.  If we had an increasing instead of a decreasing population we would have more money to command for works.
