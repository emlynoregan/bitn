Henry Hamilton Douglas was suspected of stealing the collection box from the Burra Hospital a few weeks ago, but the charge was dismissed due to insufficient evidence.

He was shot in the hip by Mr Belcher at Georgetown, in the act of robbing the latter’s shop, and has subsequently died in the Port Pirie Hospital.
