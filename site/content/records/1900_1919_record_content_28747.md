James H. Isaac writes complaining that good road metal is hard to break at the various quarries and tenderers are so keen to get work that they are offering prices that yield an income below the minimum Government wage.  The present price of 2/3 per yard is too low and he hopes the Councillors will not accept the lowest tender.
