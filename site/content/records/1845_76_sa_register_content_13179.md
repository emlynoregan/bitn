‘A Burra Elector’ writes from Kooringa 2 April re the election.

A recent communication from your Kooringa correspondent contains the following extraordinary statement:

‘The result [i.e. the return by an overwhelming majority of Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon] is regarded with much regret by the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community, who cannot but see the evil of sending men to Parliament merely because they happen to possess a popular species of oratory which wins the public ear, or because they profess political opinions in accordance with the views of the majority.’

May I ask on what authority he asserts ‘the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community’ regards the results with regret and sees the evil of sending men into Parliament who possess the qualification acknowledged by your correspondent?  The paragraph I have quoted is an insult to the electors of Kooringa in inferring that three-fourths of them are not sober-minded or thinking men.
