Nick Brooks, Burra Merchandise Manager for Elders was recently talking to a Burra client who had just returned after working for two months as a mine manager in Senegal. He said the company there was looking for a better deal on fencing.  Nick jokingly suggested they ask Elders to quote, which they did and they won the deal.  He has since had a lot to learn about the complexity of sending four container loads or 70 tonnes of fencing material overseas.  He says that next time it will be easy.  Most of the fencing was supplied by the Australian company Waratah.
