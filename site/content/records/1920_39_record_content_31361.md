The Editor writes on the series by Frank Treloar which was based on old books left in the Mine Office and from a diary kept by his father and other sources.  There is an idea of having the material printed in pamphlet form and we would be pleased to hear of anyone interested in having a copy and who would be willing to subscribe to the cost.  Any old photos of the mine would be welcomed for inclusion.
