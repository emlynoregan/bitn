Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting (Continued from last week.)

The Town Hall has not deteriorated and in the past twelve months 100 chairs have been purchased and the main aisle and stairways have been carpeted.  Through a legacy it was possible to completely redecorate the stage.  Overall the pictures have held their own despite television and they are still doing a wonderful job towards the finances.

On the health front the collection of refuse is more satisfactory than in the past.

The ambulance service is running smoothly.

The Mayor expressed his concern of the way that he and other Councillors in business have been penalised for doing ‘something for nothing’ in the Council.  He had been in business in Burra for 30 years and in Council for 15.  He expressed bitterness at the attitude of the people concerned, but whatever he did in Council would not affect him in the future as he was retiring from his Market Square business on 30 June.  He expressed concern at the lack of interest in Council elections.  On numerous occasions ratepayers had not even arranged to see that their ward was represented.  He expressed his thanks to the retiring Councillors.

[There were apparently many questions posed and answered, but not reported in the paper.]

Mr H.J.B. Jennison moved the vote of thanks to the Mayor, Mayoress and Councillors and said it was a thankless job.
