Burra Town Council, 18 June

M.A. McIntosh, Minister of Public Works, advises that approval has been given to lay new and larger water mains in Market Square and Commercial Street, to serve the shopping centre and the Burra Hospital where water supply is inadequate.  The cost of material is estimated at £2,350.  The work is to be done when materials and labour are available.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. was given permission to cut back trees in Morehead St that are interfering with light mains.

The estimated cost of the Fire Station for 12 months is £621.

The Stockowners’ Assoc. draws attention to the problem of noxious weeds, especially horehound and onion weed.  Council will co-operate in their elimination.
