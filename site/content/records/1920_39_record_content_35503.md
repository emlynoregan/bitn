J.S.R. Oborn head teacher of Burra Public School writes saying that there are poorly nourished children at the school.  For the past two weeks he has been receiving contributions of food, mainly soup and as a result has been able to supply lunch to up to 30 a day.  He appeals to people willing to supply two gallons of soup once a month.  Twenty people would allow 30 children to be fed five days a week with a cup of soup.
