Prior Family Reunion.  Recently the children of the late James & Jane Prior gathered for the first time for five years.  James arrived from Cornwall in the early 1850s.  Mrs Prior, nee Jane Rasdell, came from Belfast and worked at the original Burra Hotel (now the hospital).  The reunion of their children took place at Mr Collins’s ‘Billamori’.  There is a photograph of Mrs C.A. Collins of ‘Billamori’ via Cowra NSW (aged 74), Mrs John Honan of Hallett (aged 71), Mr E. Prior of Hallett (aged 66) and Mr E.T. Prior of Copperhouse (aged 69).
