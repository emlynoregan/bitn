Joseph Flower turns 84 on 9 March.  He was born in 1842 in Somersetshire near Bath & Wells, and is the eldest surviving son of Mr & Mrs James Flower.  He migrated to Australia in 1854 with the family in the ship David Malcolm.  They went first to work at the Reedbeds near Adelaide for Joseph Johnson and from there to Port Gawler (Buckland Park) where his father took up land.  In 1859 they came to Stony Gap 12 miles south of Burra where they engaged in farming, grazing and carting and also worked in the Burra Mines.  He held the property from his father’s death until 1912 when he retired.  He recalls seeing as many as 50 to 60 bullock teams in a row on the Adelaide road with 50 bullocks to a team carting bagged or smelted ore from the English & Australian Smelting Co. to Pt Adelaide.  Ore in its raw state was used as ballast for boats going to England.  The company afterwards sold the bullocks for £100 a team and bought mules.  The company’s commonage was the old Gum Creek Station.  And in those days one could get about 100 square miles of commonage for £5 p.a.  George Williams later bought Gum Creek and then exchanged it for a holding at Parnaroo with a Mr Peters.  Dr Browne bought the whole of the Booborowie Sheep Run for £18 and a team of bullocks from Malcolm McDonald who was later killed by the Blacks.  When he arrived in Burra the mines had been going 8 or 9 years, but still the hill where the hospital is was covered with beautiful pines and other hills had mallee and scrub except the Bald Hill (Brewery Paddock) on which trees have never grown.  There were large trees along the Burra Creek.  He currently lives with his eldest son at ‘Braefoot’.  He was twice married and there are 10 children; four sons and six daughters: James (Braefoot), William (Tambleup WA), Joseph (Canowie Belt), Frank (Near Balaklava), Mrs George Parker (Leighton), Mrs M. Jeffery (Porter’s Lagoon), Mrs C. Heinrich (Sturt Vale), Mrs Cavanagh (Near Balaklava) & Mrs J. Phillips (Waterloo).
