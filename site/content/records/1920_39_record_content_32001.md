Sheep showed a further increase and the quality did not reflect the harsh conditions of the year.

Fleece wool exhibits took the whole length of the building and were of an excellent character.

Pigs were few in number.

Implements and cars were well represented and of great interest.

Vegetables were down due to the season, but of good quality.  B. Opperman & W. Moxham dominated the prizes.

Fruit as usual was poorly represented.  Clare exhibitors were absent and instead D. & E. Armstrong of Waikerie did well in apples and oranges, though Mrs H. Swift from P. & A. McBride’s ‘Wooltana’ Station beat them for lemons.

Flowers were fair considering the dust storms, late season and high winds.

Cookery was of a high standard.

Fancy Work was very good and Miss Bentley did particularly well.

Photography & Art were fairly well represented.

School Class work was better displayed than ever and there were many entries from the district schools as well as Burra.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss is listed as a judge in Flowers, but apparently was not an exhibitor, as he does not appear among the prize winners.]
