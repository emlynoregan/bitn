A Letter to the Editor calls for the enthusiasm for a Burra swimming pool to be reignited.  The writer suggests the site be the Drill Hall and saddling paddock.  The Hall would be ideal for showers, locker rooms etc. and conveniences are already installed.  The saddling paddock could be excavated for the pool.

‘With Army training revolutioned ti is [sic] extremely doubtful whether our local Drill Hall will ever be used again.’
