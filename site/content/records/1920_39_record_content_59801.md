Ray Brown of Redruth aged 4½ was going on a message with his sister aged 7 when he was frightened by some sheep and in running off blindly he fell into a dam in Baker’s paddock.  His sister tried to save him, but was unable due to the boggy bank.  Her screams attracted Mr W.E. Hodge, who waded in waist deep and reached the boy.  Mr Thomas Turner and his daughter Miss Hilda Turner also arrived and the latter waded in and took the limp body as Mr Hodge neared the bank.  They then managed to resuscitate the boy, who at first appeared to be dead.  Dr Stevens arrived and Ray was taken to the hospital.  Mr Hodge, who suffers from heart trouble, was forced to go home to bed to recover from the strain.
