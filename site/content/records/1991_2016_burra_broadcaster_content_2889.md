The BCS Boarding House has been chosen as the Event of the Year for Australia Day.  The need for a larger boarding facility arose when BCS attracted more students requiring board than was available.  Burra is seen as a good place for outback students to receive a good education with caring staff in a school with excellent buildings and library and other facilities.

With the sanction of the School Council a sub-committee was set up to explore possibilities and negotiations began to see if the vacant nurses’ quarters could be used.  The Hospital Board was agreeable and a lease was signed.  The next step was to refurbish the quarters.  On a Saturday before school began, a working bee was held and many people turned up to arrange furniture and organise rooms.  The children arrived on the Sunday.  The Uniting Church Op Shop made a donation to enable the purchase of linen and furniture and the Isolated Children’s Parents’ Association also gave a donation and so did the Eastern Districts’ Progress Association and the Variety Club.  Other individuals gave donations and school staff volunteered to help with homework sessions.  A DEET Hostel grant for a building extension became available.  The Burra Burra DC agreed to apply on behalf of the boarding facility for the grant for a much needed dining room, kitchen and bathrooms.  The application was successful and the Council received $128,000.  The work has all been done by local tradesmen – Rob Jacka and local sub-contractors.  The Council also made a donation of $5,000 to help establish the boarding house.  The future of the facility looks bright.  Bookings have been received for places up to 2005 and next year it will be filled to capacity.
