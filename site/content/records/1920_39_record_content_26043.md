Vandals created havoc on Saturday evening.  They tore down gates at St Mary’s Parish Hall and broke the top off the tank, wasting the water for the school there.  Paintwork was scratched and marred.  Seats from the postmaster’s verandah were thrown into the creek.  A culvert was dragged up and willows along the creek have been destroyed.
