‘Diamond Drill’ writes on who found the Mongolata Gold.  He takes issue with references to the role of W.J. Richards.  He disputes that he has done more than all the other prospectors, saying the Pexton Bros. have put in splendid work and Curlew and Baldina have also done much and the writer feels sure Mr Richards would blush at the suggestion he has done more – perhaps Mr Morgan meant he had done more than the Government.
