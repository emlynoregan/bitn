CFS & SES joined forces recently in a joint Road Crash Rescue Course.  Both services and the MFS deliver the same service in these situations.  The course began with theory on Friday night and on Saturday and Sunday cars were skilfully demolished by hydraulic cutters and spreaders.    Due to wet weather the practical components of the course were moved inside to Andy McBride’s truck yards main shed at Burra North. Each trainee was introduced to the various tools required in rescue before the group was divided into teams for a series of rescue scenarios.  Everyone had to handle the heavy hydraulic equipment regardless of size, height or age and by the end their brisk steps had become a lethargic shuffle and lifting even a water bottle was a struggle.  CFS officers Any Thomas and Tom Quin kept up the food supplies.  Sunday’s activities focussed on the use of reciprocating saws capable of cutting through both glass and metal.  The last road crash scenario had each team having to extract a casualty from a crash safely in 45 minutes.  By the end each trainee was deemed competent.  The two agencies worked well together.  The course was headed by CFS state training officer Corey-jay ‘CJ’ Frazer.  [Photo]
