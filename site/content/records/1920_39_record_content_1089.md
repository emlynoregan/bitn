Aberdeen Football Club.  On Friday 19 March Mr J.H. Gallagher, President of the Aberdeen Football Club entertained fully 100 guests at the Royal exchange Hotel, catered for by R. Hales and staff.  Mr C. A. Fuss took the chair.  Such a dinner had been promised for some time, but it had been delayed. The invitation was extended to all the district’s footballers.  Some expressed the feeling that Mt Bryan and Hallett would be best with a united team.  Toasts and comments are reported in almost 1½ columns.
