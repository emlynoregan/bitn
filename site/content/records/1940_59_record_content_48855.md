Burra Town Council, 8 January

Superannuation considerations were deferred.

A Broken Hill City representative will wait on the Minister and stress the importance to SA of a good highway to Broken Hill.

Peterborough Council will also make representations on the Broken Hill Road.

Council will top dress Aberdeen Tennis Clubâ€™s No. 2 Court.

The Burra Choral Society advises that the SA Symphony Orchestra cannot visit Burra till 1952, so the matter has been deferred for the present.

The Minister of works advises that supplying Burra with water from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline cannot be justified at present.

Council resolved that a letter be written in reply disassociating itself from previous Councils in this matter and urging Burra be connected with Murray water as soon as materials and labour allowed.

Davies Motor Co. applied for permission to erect a kerbside petrol pump in Commercial St.  Approved.

Information is to be sought from the E & WS Department about the cost and time involved in laying a new pipeline to Victoria Park.
