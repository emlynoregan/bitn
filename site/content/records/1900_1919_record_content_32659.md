Theft.  A pair of horses and a buggy were stolen from the residence of Mrs Phillips of North Booborowie and driven south.  They were left at Manoora.  The thief is believed to have bought a train ticket for Adelaide.  It is thought he may have been a young man named Houstan, who was locked up in the Redruth cells for the theft of rabbit skins, but was freed by someone on Sunday night.
