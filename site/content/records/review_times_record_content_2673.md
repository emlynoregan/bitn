Mr Allan Dwyer, the District Clerk, will leave soon for Broken Hill where he has been appointed Deputy Clerk.  Council Chairman Mr Hawker said Mr Dwyer was an outstanding accounting and fianancial expert who had brought a range of skills to the job that would not normally be found in a town clerk in SA.  Mr Dwyer had done much in the organising of the Barrow Push to Clare this weekend and the one to Broken Hill in January 1986.
