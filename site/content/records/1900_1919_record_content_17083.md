Pumping operations have been suspended. There was not 50ft of water in the pool and we have been proved correct when we said the bottom would be reached before 23ft of water had been pumped out.  Slush is causing trouble for the pump.  The contractors say they were engaged to pump and will not undertake to dig a shaft in the centre of the pool to enable the water to be lowered below the 50ft level.  It is just as well to have stopped now, as the management have no fixed policy to carry out and to drive anywhere without getting under the old workings displays no ingenuity or knowledge of mining in Burra.  One thing that could be done is to pump from Graves’ Shaft, but we think it best to dispose of the company at once and not disappoint shareholders further.  Tributers who fixed their jigs on the embankment at considerable trouble have had to abandon them on account of the suspension of pumping operations.
