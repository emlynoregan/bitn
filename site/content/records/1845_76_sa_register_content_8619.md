1853 in Retrospect

From a commercial and social point of view 1853 provided more cause for congratulation that any previous one.  There can be no doubts of the ultimate prosperity of the colony.  The drainage of labour and capital at the start of 1852, to the goldfields in the neighbouring colony led to serious fears of a monetary crisis.  Business stagnated, property values depreciated and houses and shops were shut up.  Able-bodied labourers, mechanics, artisans, tradesmen and merchants were leaving every day in such numbers as to threaten the depopulation of the colony.  Banks were being reduced to insolvency.  Steps were taken which proved entirely successful and through the skilful management of the Government the impending crisis was averted.  Prosperity and social order now reign.  The Bill to establish a Parliament in SA has been sent to England last November and is expected to return with the Imperial sanction within six months from now.  Several other measures of importance have passed the Legislative Council: the Postal Bill, the Bill for the more effectual Administration of Justice in the Supreme Court and several others.  The Murray has been opened for navigation and already considerable wool trade have flowed from NSW and Victoria to SA, with provisions flowing the other way.  50 steam vessels have arrived at Port Adelaide during the year and upwards of 300 sailing vessels.  The transmission of information from England has been reduced to about 68 days.  This is expected to be about halved when large steam vessels now being built, come into service.

During 1853 about 20,000 arrived in the colony and about 11,000 departed.  The excess of arrivals over departures has grown in the second half of the year.  218,398 acres of Crown land were sold in the year for £298,557.  The Overland Gold Escort brought in 99,113 oz of gold, valued at £390,000.  The escort has now been discontinued, but arrangements have been made with the Victorian Government for the transmission of gold from Victoria by sea.

Another sign of progress has been the passage of the District Councils Act and 20 District Councils have been called into operation during the year.  There is a large amount of wealth lying in the coffers of the Banks this can be used for private and public works when labour can be procured.  The deposits represent about £20 per head of the entire population, a state of affairs scarcely to be found in the world beyond the limits of the Australian colonies.
