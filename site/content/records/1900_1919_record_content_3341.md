Kooringa Court.

Berno Frederick [sic: but probably Beno Isaac Frederick born 29 March 1882 at Copperhouse to August & Maria.] was charged with being the alleged father of the unborn child of Maud Lines, a girl at the Redruth Reformatory and under the age of 18 years.  James Gray, Inspector for the State Children’s council asked for maintenance and confinement expenses.  As it happened the pregnancy could not be confirmed and the case was dismissed.

William McDonald was charged with being the father of the unborn child of Charlotte Sarah Campbell, living in Kooringa with Mrs Goldsworthy.  M-C Jemison said that when told that ‘Lottie Goldsworthy’ was in trouble McDonald said ‘others have been there as well as me’ and refused to sign any order for expenses.  In court McDonald denied any wrong doing with the girl absolutely and denied he had admitted anything to M-C Jemison.  Others gave evidence that she was frequently out with other young men and wore ‘a very short dress – nearly up to her knees’.  The case was dismissed with costs against the State School Council of £3-6-6.

[The editor rather primly says that the report has been trimmed from three columns to about ⅔ column by deleting ‘the choicest language’.]
