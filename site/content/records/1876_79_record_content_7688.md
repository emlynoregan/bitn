Letter to Editor.

A complaint about the Municipal elections. On 19 November Mr Geake was proposed and 2"d at a meeting as a proper person to represent South Ward. Mr Ridgway said he would oppose Mr Geake's election and he went to Mr Geake and borrowed the book of the laws of the Corporation, whereupon Mr Geake withdrew from the election and South Ward lost the services of an upright, honest and straightforward man. Had Cr Ridgway let his opposition be known sooner we would have had a chance to nominate someone who knew more about municipal affairs than Mr Lewis does. `I wonder Mr Editor if Councillor Ridgway were weighed in the balance if he would be found wanting.

I am Sir, &c.,

ONE WHO THINKS HE WOULD

Burra, December 1, 1879.'
