Mr Dick Barratt, son of Mr & Mrs D. Barratt of the Royal Exchange Hotel, is presently in Burra Hospital after stopping a bolting horse on Wednesday.  It was attached to a bakerâ€™s cart and was heading down Morehead Street.  Having grasped the reins he had almost brought it to a halt when it decided to run over the kerb onto the footpath.  Mr Barratt tripped and wrenched his arms and knee badly.  [Not the same horse as stopped by Mr Marsh.]
