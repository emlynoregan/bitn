Cr Killicoat asked if the Council would object to a monument there.  The first three soldiers to die were from Aberdeen and it was the intention to place a monument there in best Place.

Cr Lane said, though this was a worthy idea other men had fallen also and it was the intention of Burra & District to erect a monument to all.

The Mayor said there was the nucleus of a fund to erect a monument in Market Square.  He would prefer a single monument for all and would not subscribe to one that was for Kooringa boys only.

Ct Killicoat said that personally he would not subscribe to a separate monument to any great extent.  His brother had died, but he intended to place a memorial window in the church.
