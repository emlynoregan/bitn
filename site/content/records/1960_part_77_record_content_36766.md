Burra Golf Associates held its AGM on 4 October.  President Mrs T. Padbury reported on a very satisfactory year.  The Zone 36 Open Day on 6 June was enjoyable, though with not as many entries as hoped for.  A profit of $33 resulted.  Our own open day 29 June also saw a pleasing profit of $58.  Congratulations are extended to Club Champion Mrs Nicholls, ‘B’ Grade Champion Mrs Wuttke and ‘C’ Grade Champion Miss Lines.  Two thefts during the year of items accumulated over the years were disappointing, but these have been replaced and members reimbursed from the insurance company.  An electric stove and twelve new chairs have been added.  Elected were: President, Mrs M. Nicholls; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames R. Wuttke & E. Jeffery; Captain Mrs D. Field; Vice-Captain, Mrs L. Braendler; Treasurer, Mrs H. Crump & Secretary, Mrs F.H. Reed.
