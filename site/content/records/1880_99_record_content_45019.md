The Stace Comedy Co. did not attract a large audience on Monday, but those present thoroughly enjoyed the show.  By popular demand they performed the old favourite Hans the Boatman instead of the advertised show.

Though he is not named in the Record it seems clear that W.H. Hardy had written an anonymous scathing review of the Stace Comedy Co.’s production somewhere of The Widow and sent it to the Jamestown Review.  In it he says it ‘was nothing more or less than a vulgar leg show’.  The letter was not published, but was shown to Mr Stacy by the proprietor, Mr Lake.  Mr Stacy made his feelings known in an interval in the Burra performance and an actress confronted ‘one of the residents of Burra’ on Monday afternoon at his place of work.  She proceeded to tell him what she thought in resounding sentence after sentence and when told to clear out said, ‘I will when I am ready, and if the counter wasn’t between you and me I would tear your l- out.’

She asked if he believed in God and when he said no she said ‘I thought you didn’t, you are one of William’s sort, I can see the inhuman fiend in your mouth.’
