Burra Town Council. Meeting of 17 Jan.

The balance sheet for 1880 is published.

Inter alia it shows receipts of £23-7-0 for the sale of closed streets.

Slaughterhouse fees amounted to £21-7-0.

Cr Lockyer said the footbridge at the back of the Burra Hotel needed lengthening to make it safer for school children.

Cr Dunstan moved a tree-planting rate of 1½d in the £.  Cr Rabbich 2nd and Cr Sampson opposed.  It would bring in £76 and this could hardly be evenly distributed.  In the South Ward the leaseholders would not wish to increase the value of SAMA’s property at their own cost.  The Mayor was personally in favour, but opposed on behalf of the leaseholders.  The voting saw Dunstan, Rabbich & Lewis for and Batchelor, Lockyer & Sampson against.  It was then lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Jeffrey Pearse won the tender for the work on Market Street. (£385)

Dr Brummitt wrote saying that if his property were to be damaged by the cutting down of the road he would apply for compensation.

SAMA wrote to say that the Council could make a road past Bewley’s land as required.

F. Clark & Sons wrote saying they would resume tubing and boring the well at once.

A turnstile is to be erected at the western end of the Bridge St footbridge.
