Mr W.S. Murray was given a smoke social recently in the Hallett Hall Supper room when over 40 gentlemen farewelled him on the eve of his departure to live in the city.  In the past he had been captain of the local cricket team and had taken a polo team to Broken Hill.  He had had a connection with almost every organisation that worked for the good of the town.  He was a Councillor on the Booborowie DC for 20 years and became a foundation member of the enlarged Hallett DC and was Chairman for the last 3 or 4 years.  In reply Mr Murray gave an interesting talk on the Hallett he knew from 1902 to the present.
