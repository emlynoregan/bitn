Burra Institute AGM 18 January.  Only three subscribers and the committee attended.

The year 1926 had seen alterations to the stage and the addition of dressing rooms and lavatory accommodation.  The stage was enlarged by 13et making the present depth from front curtain to back wall 23 ft 10ins.  There is now a side entrance to an enclosed kitchen on the south side and a stairway leading to dressing rooms.  The work was carried out by T.H. Woollacott and J.E. Pearce at a cost of £1,299-14-0.  New scenery was painted by Mr Churchill of New York for £90 and a new blue silk poplin curtain hung on the tab principle.  The kitchen was enclosed on the south side and extended by a long underground passage, fitted with a table and also a servery through the wall to the supper room.  The stage can be screened to serve as a supper room and stage at the same time.  The opera Les Cloches de Corneville on 15 & 16 December was the first performance after the alterations.  This was produced by the Institute Opera Classes under the direction of G.E. Dane.  The hall was crowded each night and the takings were about £165.

At December 1925 there were 6,417 books in the library and at 31 December 1926 there were 6,503.  (+520 and – 434)  Membership overall dropped by 7.  There is a debit in the bank deposits of £22-14-2.  [The alterations also involved a loan of £3,000.]

Mr A.A. Davey, librarian, was thanked for his excellent services.

Elected were President, F.T. Sara; Vice-President, Guy Tiddy; Treasurer, J.H. Bryant & Hon Sec. E.J. Harris.
