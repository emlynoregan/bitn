Soldiers’ Aid Society. Sandbag making continues.  The fund stands at £137-8-3.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

A sandbag class has been formed in conjunction with the Soldiers’ Aid Society.  We have been sending handkerchiefs and washers away and require mittens.

Pte S. Bishop could not be at our last social, but Captain Chaplain Nield gave our gift to him at his farewell at Hanson.

Sgt Woollacott’s last letter dated 12 Sep. describes a rather idyllic break from the fighting in a picturesque valley with a small river.

A letter from E. Ridgway tells how Sgt Woollacott was killed when struck by a large piece of shell on 28 Sep. and died peacefully soon after.

Pte C.D. Hunt writes from Fulham Military Hospital, Hammersmith, where he is recovering from dysentery.  He writes of outings to various London sight like the zoo, Marble Arch, St Paul’s, Westminster Abbey and the Underground.  He also saw the effects of a German air raid.
