After a number of failed attempts to beautify and complete the surroundings of the monument another meeting was called last week.  A plan for the scheme has been on display in our window.  Mr Crewes made an appeal on Friday 13 July in the street for the funds to complete the scheme.  The Mayor presided.  The Mayor thought that not less than £500 was needed, rather than the £450 estimated.  He hoped that now the Honour Roll was completed this final stage of the memorial would receive support.

Mr Crewes recalled the gathering in 1915 when news came through that the first of the boys had gone ‘west’, having been killed at Gallipoli.  The Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund had then been started.  He said that at least £2,000 would be needed and this had been reached when the war ended.  He believed the total cost of the memorial was £3,300 and though it was admirable it was incomplete and its enclosure etc. even if it cost £500, what was that in comparison with what the boys had done.

‘Let us not be weary in well doing.’  In a few days of canvassing he reckoned he has promises of between £100 & £200, which was encouraging.
