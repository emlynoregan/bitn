Obituary.  Mrs Roy Voumard died at Burra Hospital on 7 April aged 38 as a result of heart trouble and other complications.  She was born Esther Gertrude Nieman, daughter of Mr Nieman of Copperhouse.  She is survived by her husband and only child, Miss Nancy Voumard.  She married Mr Voumard on his return from active service abroad and they lived at Copperhouse where she took a great part in the community.  She was the organist and member of the Methodist Church for many years and on the School Committee until forced by ill health to relinquish such roles.  Twelve months ago, assisted by her daughter, she took over the Copperhouse Post Office.  She is also survived by a mother, three sisters and a brother: Mrs Newman (Victoria), Mrs Bilney (Adelaide), Mrs Harry Baynes (Booborowie) and Mr Fred Nieman (Hallett).  [Born 6 August 1897 Copperhouse.]
