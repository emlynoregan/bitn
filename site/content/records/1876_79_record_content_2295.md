Bridge: There was a report that there had been half a dozen accidents in a week at the footbridge behind the Miners' Arms.  In the most serious Mr. W. Parker fell on a broken bottle and almost severed two fingers. Several muddy baptisms were also reported. [The descriptions suggest a single plank without handrail and of course without any lighting at night.] Also a letter in support of same from W. Parker saying he was now unable to work for 5 or 6 weeks.
