Soldiers’ Farewelled

At the Burra Institute on 23 December 1940 presentations were made to eight more of the Burra & District soldiers.  A great gathering of residents and a number of visiting servicemen assembled.  The guests were:

Sapper W. Kearns (SA Champion heavy-weight lifter) 	Pte B. Woods

Sgt Alan Penrose	Sgt L. Quinn (‘Lofty’ – at 6 ft 8½ ins)

Pte Robert Lee	Pte Ken Walker

Cpl Gil Builder	Pte A. Tassie

On the platform A.D. McDonald MP, Dr D. Steele, Rev. N. Usher, Messrs S.C. Genders & M. de N. Lucas with Pte Clem Davey at the piano.  After the National Anthem and the Song of Australia, Mr G.H. Dollman sang Sons of the Sea.  The Mayor voiced his appreciation of the attendance and wished all the best for Christmas and the New Year.  He introduced Dr Steele who gave a patriotic speech, supported by Rev. Usher.  Mrs Max Pearce sang There’ll Always be an England and Star of Bethlehem.  Then Mr Genders spoke for the RSL supported by Mr Lucas.  Sapper Kearns sang Silver hair and heart of gold.  Community singing followed and Mr Dollman sang Tell all tonight.  Mrs Frank Marston then presented each soldier with a small parcel of woollies etc. and the Mayor made a presentation of a wrist watch.  The soldiers responded briefly.  Pte Builder was more eloquent in praise of the efforts of the FFCF and said their efforts were greatly appreciated.  Boys in camp from WA and Victoria were also loud in praise of the Cheer-Up Hut, as there was nothing comparable in their home states.  Mr McDonald MP moved the vote of appreciation for the organisers and the evening ended with the singing of the National Anthem and three cheers for King, Empire and Soldiers.
