NSW Goldfields

From the Bathurst Free Press of 18 July:

Bathurst has again gone mad with gold fever.  On Sunday it was whispered about that Dr Kerr had found a hundredweight of gold.  The writer took this as a wild story, but the next day a tandem driven by Mr W.H. Suttor, Dr Kerrâ€™s brother-in-law, drew up with two massive pieces of the precious metal.  Soon 150 people were present and the pieces were handed around.  A square tin box in the vehicle held the rest of the hundredweight of gold.  The tandem set off for the Union Bank where the weighing revealed the two pieces at 6 lb 4 oz 1 dwt and 6 lb 13 dwt, besides which were 16 drafts of 5 lb 4 oz each, making in all 102 lb 9 oz 5 dwt; added to that Dr Kerr has retained upwards of 3 lb as specimens so the total weight of the discovery would be 106 lb recovered from the earth at the one time.  [The retails of the discovery are then recounted.]
