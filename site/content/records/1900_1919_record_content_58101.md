a weir across Burra Creek

an isolation ward at Burra Hospital

He quite liked a statue, but was not sure it would be well received in outside districts.

Cr C.T. McWaters was not prepared to vote, but leaned towards a central monument.

Cr A.E. McWaters was also not prepared to decide yet, but leant towards a central monument, though each district would have to be represented on the executive and be duly represented at the opening etc.

Cr Warnes & Cr McWaters complained that they never got invitations to activities in Burra as official representatives of the DCs.  Cr McWaters thought that if a monument was erected specific places on it needed to be allotted to each district.  If a garden was to be maintained each district should have its own plot.

Cr Pearse favoured a lasting memorial – something like the memorial on North Terrace.  Trees in a few years would be just trees.

Cr Kellock would like to see unity.

Cr Thomas favoured a central monument: in 50 years small memorials would be neglected and dilapidated.  He favoured allocating each district its proper proportion and its proper representation on the executive.  He hoped for no split – he had heard that even one of Burra’s own Wards wanted its own memorial.  Nothing worthy could be done if they all split.

Cr Warnes did not think it fitting to raise funds on Peace Day.

The Mayor said there were to be three Peace Days: one of thanksgiving, one of rejoicing and one for the children.  He thought it a most suitable day to ask for donations.

Cr Warnes thought there should be a Memorial Day.

Cr Radford said that concerning the lack of official invitations to District Councils that the Burra Town Council had nothing to do with that – it was a matter in the hands of the various patriotic societies.

Cr Warnes said the patriotic bodies never recognised the districts and as President of several district bodies he could say no official invitations ever reached them.  He believed there would be better support for tree plantings or an isolation ward.  He had been asked personally, never officially to functions.

Mr Crewes said: On how many occasions have the outside districts gone on their own?  If the idea they were not valued was prevalent he was sorry: it was not the slightest intent of any patriotic body

not to give the district due recognition.

Cr Warnes said Leighton had decided to have Peace Day at home, but he was prepared to advocate something in Burra if a scheme came forward that the district people could support.  For a piece of statuary it would be difficult to get support.

Cr Kellock said public meetings were essential.

Cr A.E. McWaters said people might easily choose a small local memorial option.

Cr McWaters said that at World’s End they had decided to spend £100 on a memorial and at one meeting £60-£70 was subscribed.

Mr Crewes thought it would be a shame if the district’s names were not inscribed on the Burra Memorial.

Cr Thomas believed Burra people would be agreeable and anxious to give the districts representation.

Cr Pearse was averse to a number of memorials.  Local Honour Rolls would perpetuate local memories.  His firm had promised 50 guineas and would double it if necessary for a central memorial.

The final decision was:

That a suitable monument be erected in Burra by Burra & District.

That the Corporation & each DC be asked to appoint two delegates to form an executive committee.
