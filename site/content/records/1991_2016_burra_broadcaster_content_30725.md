The Effluent Ponds

At present the southern ponds are being made into one large pond, to be separated from the northern area, which will become four smaller ponds.  A liner will be laid in the larger pond, where the treatment cycle begins, before the effluent is pumped through the remaining four ponds.  Council is looking for a customer to use the end product.
