Health Report.

For the year there were 13 cases of diphtheria, 8 of tuberculosis, 40 of measles, 3 of typhoid and 3 of erysipelas.  The measles & diphtheria coincided with statewide outbreaks.  The Board of Health started with a debit of £94-19-8, but with no serious outbreaks of disease we have reduced the debt to £6-15-0.
