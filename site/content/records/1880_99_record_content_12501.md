The Local Board of Health will visit the place and make orders accordingly.

Captain Bonel [Bonnell] writes to say that he did not claim that there were no backsliders at Moonta when he left, but that there had been none for three months.

W.H. Hardy writes making the same point and saying there are ‘so many prejudiced minds against the Salvation Army here’.
