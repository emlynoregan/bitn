The one-page single-sided supplement is entirely devoted to the production at the Institute of:

Les Cloches de Cornville

‘A Wonderfully Successful Production.’

This was produced at the Institute 15 & 16 December 1926.  The chorus work was of a very high order and the soloists had clear enunciation and good tone and expression.  Mr G.E. Dane directed.  Recent additions to the stage and rear of the hall aided greatly.

M.V. Churchill, scenic artist of New York USA, painted the scenery.

In the process of a very favourable review all the instrumental and solo vocal performers are listed.

The company adjourned after the event to J. Allen’s café for a dainty supper.
