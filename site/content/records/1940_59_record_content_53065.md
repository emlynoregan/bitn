Burra Choral Society presented a fine concert at the Town Hall on Wednesday 5 December.  More than 200 attended despite the hot weather.  Excerpts from Messiah were presented.  Locals were assisted by four of Adelaideâ€™s leading soloists: Gwen Collett (contralto), Mary Hepenstall (soprano), William Harrison (bass) and Neville Hicks (tenor.)  A fine performance drew spontaneous and generous applause.
