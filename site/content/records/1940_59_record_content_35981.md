Burra Town Council and Sunday Sport

At a recent Town Council meeting Cr S.J. Woollacott moved Sunday Sport be prohibited on Burra Parklands.  He said if Sunday Sport were allowed it would have a devastating effect on the welfare of the community.  Permitting tennis meant the Council would have to permit other sports and that would be a licence to people to desecrate the Sabbath.  Nations that desecrate the Sabbath become a decadent people.  People living near the Burra North Tennis Courts objected to play on Sunday.  [He lived just across the street.]  These people possibly paid the highest rates in town, while many of those playing were not ratepayers at all.  He said that Cr Marston had suggested a poll of ratepayers, but that was a very expensive option and had not been necessary for any of the other 30 By-Laws, so why throw the onus onto the people this time?

After some discussion Cr T.H. Woollacott seconded the motion.

Cr Baulderstone said that in many ways he was in favour of such a By-Law, but he would prefer it to be decided by ratepayer poll.  He asked if the ratepayers could overturn a decision on the law by a later poll and was told they could not.

Cr Bevan asked if a poll would be costly.  The Mayor said it would not be very costly if run in conjunction with the annual elections, but such a poll would not be binding on the Council.

Cr Marston said that the Football Club played on Victoria Park, which was Council property, not parkland.  The football clubs asked for permission to play each season and the Council could, if it wished, prevent football being played there on Sunday if they so stipulated when granting permission.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said he would challenge anyone to find organised sport on Sunday in SA.  He could not see much harm in a couple of boys and girls playing a game on Sundays, but organised sport was different.  He had been able to stop it for fifteen years while he was Mayor and could not see any difference between then and now.

Cr Baulderstone asked why a By-Law was necessary if the Council could stop football on Sundays at Victoria Park and also refuse to lease the land at Burra North to the Aberdeen Tennis Club if it wanted to play on Sundays.

The Mayor said that the Council could not stop the football and Cr Marston said it could.

Cr Lee wanted a poll.

Cr Bevan moved the motion be put and Cr Marston seconded.

When the motion was put Cr Baulderstone refused to vote on it.  Cr Woollacott said Cr Baulderstone had to vote according to the Act.

Cr Baulderstone moved an amendment that the matter be adjourned until it was clear what powers the Council had over its own property as opposed to the parklands.  This was not seconded and lapsed.

Cr Baulderstone again refused to vote and the notice of motion was lost with Crs S.J. & T.H. Woollacott voting in favour and Crs Lee, Marston and Bevan against.
