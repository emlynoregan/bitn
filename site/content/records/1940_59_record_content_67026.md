N. Hiles Pearce writes in memory of the late J.J. Parker.  He appreciated Mr Parker’s help as a salaried officer of the Burra DC for the 15 years that Mr Pearce was Chairman.  Mr Parker was, he says, a kind and generous man and Pearce well remembers the excellent midday meals he so often shared with the family on Council days.  He was truly one to whom the hackneyed phrase, ‘one of nature’s gentlemen’ could aptly be applied.
