The Cornish Association of Victoria will commence the Overland Gold “Cornish Convoy” on Monday, tracing the overland routes from SA to the Victorian goldfields in the 1850s.  They are particularly interested in tracing routes taken by Burra miners who departed for the goldfields in great numbers.  The overland journey took six to eight weeks and covered a distance of some 720 km.  The group of about 20 people in 12 vehicles will arrive in Burra about midday for a quick lunch before meeting with the Burra History Group at the Town Hall and will then depart via the old Adelaide Road to Sod Hut, Black Springs and Marrabel and on to Kapunda for the evening.
