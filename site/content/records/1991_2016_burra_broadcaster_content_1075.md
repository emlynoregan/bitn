Farrell Flat Silo was forced to close last Wednesday on 20 January.  At the start of the season much of the wheat coming in was downgraded to GP or seed grade.  General Manager of SACBH said the state could expect to have about Â¾ of the harvest downgraded to GP or seed category.  Up to last week 1 million tonnes had been delivered in SA and 54% had been segregated as feed and another 27% was GP1 or GP2.  At Farrell Flat the silo manager, Jimmy Winters, last week said he had taken in over 9,000 tonnes of wheat and only 10% had been downgraded.  Because of this exceptional harvest in the region one 7,000 tonne cell of downgraded wheat had to be emptied in order to take more ASW.  14 local men helped to purge the cell in one day; putting in 93 man-hours.  The weekend rain put an end to the good fortune and any wheat not harvested by now would pretty well be ruined.
