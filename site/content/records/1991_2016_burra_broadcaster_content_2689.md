The copper-gold concentrate roaster was immobilised in October when part of its roof gave way and fell into the internal workings.  Since then the company has carried out extensive maintenance, but a decision to spend money on upgrading the plant has been deferred till middle or late January according the General Manager Mark Woodhead.

Those improvements are required to reduce the cost of copper raw material used in producing copper oxide, in order to remain competitive with copper prices at a seven year low.  The copper concentrate treatment plant is most profitable when copper prices are good, but at present with prices low and requests for money from other areas of the Parent group’s operations, obtaining funds for the upgrade has given the board a difficult decision.  Any decision to downgrade or suspend operations would have serious implications for district employment.  The production of copper oxide, the company’s core product line would not be affected should concentrate treatment be suspended.

The Season.  The crops in the district this year are generally up in both yield and quality, with only isolated areas showing frost or hail damage.  Harvest seems to be a week or so later this year.   Canola has done well and if barley prices remain low more will turn to canola next season.
