Burra Defence Rifle Club.  There is a more complete account of the trip to Pt Pirie.  They departed by train on Saturday evening, and changed to narrow gauge at Terowie.  At Petersburg a sumptuous spread was provided by the President, W.B. Page.  They reached Pt Pirie at 4.45 a.m. and had breakfast at Knapman’s Hotel followed by a morning tour of the smelting and refining works.  In the afternoon there was boating and a drive to the hills etc.  On Monday the match took from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. and Pt Pirie defeated Burra 716 to 695.  Last Wednesday the local match resulted in a win to A. Bennetts 89 from J. Reed 82 and R.D. Pascoe 80.
