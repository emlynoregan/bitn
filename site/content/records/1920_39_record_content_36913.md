Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk reported at the last meeting that a member of Council had been making rash statements about the manner in which the Councilâ€™s books were being kept.  He presented a balance sheet and was only too willing to show Councillors the true position at any time.

The Mayor asked if any Councillor had made remarks similar to those referred to, but there was no response.
