State Elections

Sitting Member Mr A.D. McDonald (LCL) has said he will be retiring from active politics at the next election.

So far three people have indicated they will contest the LCL plebiscite for endorsement for the seat:

Mr M. de N. Lucas (Hanson-Burra)

Mr N. Jamieson (Canowie)

Mr J. Gilfillan (Jamestown)

Mr Lucas has lived at Hanson for 13 years as a farmer.  He unsuccessfully sought LCL endorsement for the seat of Light in about 1938.  In the war he enlisted in the AIF and served in the northern waters of Australia.
