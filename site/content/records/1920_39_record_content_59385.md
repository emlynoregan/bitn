Weather.  Last Friday night a severe thunderstorm struck Burra at about 2 a.m.  At the post office the measure was 31 points, but at A.L. Kellockâ€™s, just past the Burra Hospital, 75 points fell, while Clem Pearce and Frank Harris recorded 48 points, though Frank Reed got only 12.  Little rain fell to the west, but to the east falls were varied, but heavy: Koomooloo 40, Woolgangi 117, Pine Valley 140, Oakbank 38, Sturt Vale 214, Braemar 81 and The Gums 21 points.  Sunday was fine, but more rain fell on Monday with further falls for example: Oakbank 58 points, Sturt Vale 96, Koomooloo 35, Woolgangi 30 and Pine Valley 97.

Rain continued through Monday with The Gums recording another 60 points.

This morning (Tuesday) Burra was enveloped in a thick fog and the weather is still mild with rain looking likely.
