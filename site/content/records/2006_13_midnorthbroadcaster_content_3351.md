Country Hospitals are due for change following a recent Government announcement.  The new arrangements aim at a three tier system to allow country patients treatment closer to home while improving safety and quality of treatment.  Four new general hospitals are to be developed at Pt Lincoln, Whyalla, Berri and Mt Gambier â€“ none of them very close to Mid North Patients.  The second level is called Local Integrated Health Services, providing low level acute, primary and residential aged care services.  The third level is Small Communities Health Services, providing primary health care and basic emergency care.  As yet the impact on Mid North hospitals is unclear, but residents in Burra, Eudunda and Kapunda fear services in their hospitals will be downgraded.  Small town hospitals are going to be staffed mainly by nurses and have only aged, minor trauma and overnight observation beds.  They are expected to lose surgery facilities, anaesthetics, obstetrics and emergency services.  Kapunda Doctor Max van Dissel said he would leave country practice if obstetrics and surgery were stripped from the hospital.  Both Kapunda and Eudunda would be without a GP if he were forced to leave.
