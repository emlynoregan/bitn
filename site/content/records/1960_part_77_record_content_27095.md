Cricket.  The Mokota Cricket Association honoured its new life members at a dinner in the Booborowie Hotel on 1 December.  Life Membership was conferred on Messrs Kitch Miller, Ken Deer, Bill Ashby, Ken Gill and A.L. Collins.  President J. McMahon presided. Mr Ken Deer was Association secretary and a long term player.  Kitch Miller played in the early matches and in Association teams, including a game on the Adelaide Oval when the Queen visited and met the players in 1954.  Mr Bill Ashby had a long association with the game as an administrator.  He was wicket keeper in Association matches for a long time.  Ken Gill was a fine batsman for Spalding and the first to score a double century in carnival matches in Adelaide and held the record for an opening partnership of 236.  Under his captaincy Mokota won three successive carnivals from 1953-55.  A.L. Collins made many centuries and his astute handling of the Mt Bryan team kept them on top for many years.
