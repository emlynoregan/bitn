East Bungaree Field Day was held in perfect weather on 2 April under G. Stanley Hawker (Managing Director), Mr Charles O’Connor (Manager) and Mr Harry Robinson (Overseer).  Over 300 people came to see 400 two-tooth rams. The four-tooth rams were also very attractive and 26 were sold with the top price 750 guineas and another for 450 guineas.
