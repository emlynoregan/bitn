St Mary’s Anglican Church

After years of discussion a big transfer of area from the Diocese of Adelaide to the Diocese of Willochra will take place on 1 April 1967.  The result will treble the number of priests and communicants in the Diocese of Willochra.  The enlarged Diocese will cover over 75% of SA, but will have less than 10% of the state’s population.  The area includes Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas, the Mid North and North of SA.  The occasion will be marked in Burra by a special service on 7 April to which leaders of all Christian denominations are invited.  The Bishop of Willochra Dr T. Jones will be tendered a Liturgical Reception in St Mary’s and Dr J.V. Peters will play the organ.  He has composed a special Introit to be used and the Quire of St Nicholas is coming from Adelaide to lead the singing.
