Railway Extension to the Northeast

On 16 September a deputation waited on the Commissioner of Public Works, with whom was the Engineer-in-Chief, H.C. Mais, with reference to railway communications in the northeast.

Mr Rounsevell read a petition with upwards of 300 signatures.  While pleased at the Government’s interest in railway extensions in the northeast, the petitioners wished to impress upon them the necessity of immediately taking in hand the construction of a railway because not only was the transportation of wool important, but as soon as the railway reached Yarcowie a great deal more land would be brought under cultivation.  They did not press for Burra over the Farrell’s Flat for the point of departure for the new line, as the surveyors took the line in either case to Yarcowie.

Mr Faulkner said that in view of the awful condition of the road between Yarcowie and Burra the settlers had had to put their hands into their pockets to make the road passable.  The road was worse now than when deputations had waited on the Government in the past.  A commercial traveller had had his horse smothered on the line and over 30 horses had been required to get one wagon through a particular part.  Because of the road farmers were compelled to send their produce directly after harvest at a lower price, rather than wait till they could get a higher price later on.  The extension of the railway would make a difference of 3d a bushel.  The traffic was very great and the deputation came not to embarrass the Government, but to strengthen their hand.

Mr Down pointed out that the road required constant attention.

Mr Matty said the section between Mt Bryan and Willogoleeche was particularly bad.  The previous month he had been bogged with a wagon for five days, although he had 18 horses attached.  The shafts were broken and the goods had to be brought in on another wagon.  A couple of hours’ rain made the road quite impassable.  Mr Rees endorsed these arguments and stressed also the need for postal and telegraphic communication to Yarcowie and Terowie.

Mr Hannaford said metal roads should not be constructed where railways were intended.  The late Central Road Board had not been able to make the road passable for want of sufficient money.

The Commissioner of Public Works, Mr West-Erskine, endorsed the need to increase the facilities for the transport of produce to market from the northeast.  He thought they should agree that the Government had lost no time in acting when its condition had been brought before them.  The Government could not make bricks without straw and until they had the legal funds and the legislative sanction to proceed, they could not construct the railway.  He assured them that as soon as possible railway extension would be undertaken, and while he could not say which line would receive priority, but rapid settlement in the area would warrant the Government in losing no unnecessary time.
