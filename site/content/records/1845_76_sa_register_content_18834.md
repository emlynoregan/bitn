Central Road Board

The Board decided to hear a deputation from Mr H. Dawson & Messrs Jones & Murphy concerning the road to Burra.  Mr Jones said he had been requested by a public meeting at Black Springs to urge the advantages of the middle road.  Apart from arguments about opening up agricultural land, teamsters from the northwest invariably made use of the middle road when carting wool to Kapunda.  Sheep farmers, commercial travellers and others preferred the middle road. Vested interests in the old road must give way to the public good.

Mr Murphy of Steelton made a similar case.

Mr H. Dawson called attention to the water supply along the middle road.

Mr Everard then proposed the middle road or the No. 6 line be adopted.

Mr Kelly seconded this and Mr McEwin supported the proposal as did Mr Sutherland.  Mr Hallett said his first inclination had been to support the original road via Apoinga, but after consideration and given that neither line of road had been defined, he now supported the middle road.  The Chairman agreed and so the proposal was carried unanimously.

Parliament had voted Â£5,000 for the road from Springfield to Black Springs and the surveyor was instructed to proceed.
