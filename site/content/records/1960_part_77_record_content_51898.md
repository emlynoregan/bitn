T.G. Perry District Clerk writes:

I have heard of vocal opposition to the Council proposals to improve accommodation for administration.  There is a real need to keep records safer and in a fireproof facility.  Opposing to the proposal is to oppose Councillors who have been elected to attend to the ratepayers’ affairs – not the clerk or office staff.  Councillors presently meet in very cramped quarters.  [He then lists the proposed changes.]

I suggest that those who consider the move to be progressive make their views known and also suggest that Councillors are ready to hear words of encouragement because they quite often hear words of criticism.  The details of the scheme are available at the Council Office.
