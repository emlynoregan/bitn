Obituary.  Mr Max Morton of Redruth died suddenly after a very short illness aged 67.  He had had a long interest in the children of the town, in the Methodist Church and in sport.  He was born in Burra and lived here most of his life, but for a few years at Pt Wakefield as a blacksmith.  About 40 years ago he married Mabel Dunhill.  In partnership with Clem Sampson he set up business as a blacksmith on the site now occupied by Mr Aldam’s garage and it was only about three years ago that he gave up the site and the arduous tasks of a smithy.  In sport Max Morton was a keen participant in football, tennis and on the running track.  He was a keen supporter long after he gave up participating.  He was a judge at the last High School Sports Day and was a great organiser of picnics and social evenings for the young of the town.  The Redruth Children’s Playground was one of his projects and he spent many hours making toys for children to be placed in fetes or as gifts.  He was keenly involved with the Methodist Church and was for a short term Circuit Steward.  He was more closely involved with the Sunday school, being Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent for over 30 years, for much of that time in partnership with his brother-in-law Mr Dunhill.  He served long and well as a local preacher, beginning over 40 years ago at Pt Wakefield and was on the Redruth Circuit Plan when he died.  He is survived by his wife and children: Thelma (Mrs Reg. Black of Wallaroo), Bob (of Qantas Airways, Sydney), Bruce (of Lightburn’s, Adelaide) and Max (of SAR Stock Department, Adelaide.)  Another son, Clarence, accidentally drowned as a small child.  [Maxwell John Morton born 16 April 1885 Aberdeen: died 29 July 1952 Burra, residence Burra North.]
