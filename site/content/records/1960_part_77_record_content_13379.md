The Burra Show was held last Saturday when rain, hail and wind lowered the attendance, but entries were a record at 2,500.  Brigadier J.G. McKinna, the SA Commissioner of Police, was unable to open the show as had been planned, due to a foot injury.  The task fell to Mr Brian Riggs, President of the Northern Agricultural Show Societies’ Association.  Gate takings were down between £80 and £100, at £141.  Considering the weather the patronage was pleasing.  Voluntary workers had greatly improved facilities and the lining and painting of the President’s Room, Secretary’s Office and the Flower Pavilion are noted.  The list of prize winners is continued on pages 3 and 5.
