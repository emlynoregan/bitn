Burra Town Council, Monday.

E.J. Harris is to build in Chapel St and he writes to have a fence removed from the road around the plantation.

The Overseer estimates the cost of a footbridge at the Mine Bridge would be c. £21.

An East Ward deputation wants a street lamp in Kingston St near Mr Davey’s.

Cr McWaters said the light near the Recreation Reserve seemed useless, but Cr Lane said it served a dozen residents.

The deed of gift of Paxton Square to the Corporation from the Hon. J. Lewis for the housing of deserving poor was read.  The property is to be vested in the Hon. J. Lewis and the Mayor of the Corporation.  A committee comprising the Town’s ministers, Hon. J. Lewis and the Mayor will control the property and select inmates with the power to set such a rent as is needed for maintenance and power to expel on a week’s notice without reason.

Cr McBride thought it might become a liability.

The Town Clerk said the rents were c. £70 p.a.  He thought a Health Officer’s inspection would see half the cottages condemned.  On taking over the property the Council would lose £13 p.a. in rates.

The council resolved to inspect the property.

The Burra Burra Coppermining Co. in liquidation advised that in future the Council would have to occupy the rubbish depot on one month’s notice as the property was for sale.

The Council resolved to buy a horse and dray and do its own scavenging.  The position of scavenger is to be advertised at 9/- per day for 6 days a week.
