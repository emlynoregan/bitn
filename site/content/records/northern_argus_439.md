Market Square

A petition with 570 signatures has called for a halt to any further installation of electricity poles in Market Square and for postponement of redevelopment work until an artistâ€™s impression has been published in the press and a public meeting held to discuss proposals.

The petition was organised by Burra National Trust and presented to Council by its President Mrs Maureen Wright.  For some years the Council has had plans to underground the electricity, improve traffic flow and redesign parking.  Although plans have been publicised they did not clearly show the position and design of the new lightin poles.  The type of light pole has created concern.  The standard goose-neck poles were deemed unsuitable for a heritage town and their position on proposed protuberances has also roused concern.  In presenting the petition Mrs Wright spoke about Burra as a Heritage Town and urged the Council to reconsider the pole choice.  Mr John Modra of the Highways Department spoke outlining the accepted standards and stressed that the safety factor.  The funding arrangements were also outlined.  Council accepted the petition and will discuss the situation at its executive meeting early this week.  Meanwhile undergrounding of power lines is proceeding as there was general consensus that this was desirable.  Other work has been halted.

Plans were also produced at the meeting for the proposed Burra North deviation or Ludgvan Street Bypass.  The Highways Department hopes to proceed with that project in the next financial year.  [1986-87]
