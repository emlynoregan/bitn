South Australians at Mt Alexander

A large meeting of South Australians was held at Mt Alexander on 29 March.  G.M. Waterhouse, the Member for East Torrens, took the chair.  The object was to petition the SA Government to continue the Overland Gold Escort and the Overland Mail to the diggings from Adelaide.  Mr Waterhouse was cheered on arriving.  He said the recent arrival of Captain Tolmer was an experimental trip.  It had been done to improve the deplorable economic state of affairs that had fallen on SA like an avalanche due to the gold discoveries and it now behoved all SA diggers to support the move.  The Government had been negotiating with the mail contractor ‘Jemmy’ Chambers with respect to an overland mail service.  The Chairman felt that the Government would establish an overland mail route as soon as it was demonstrated to be practical.  Mr H. Mildred then moved the continuation of the Overland Gold Escort.  Mr Nathan Hailes seconded.  In doing so he also alluded to the very unreliable nature of sea mails to SA.  Many letters had not been delivered and many of those contained money.  The resolutions being passed, a petition was drafted soliciting their implementation.  [The text of the petition to the Governor is printed.]
