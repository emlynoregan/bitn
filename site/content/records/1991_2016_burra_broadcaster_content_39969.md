The Inaugural Burra AGL Country Music Festival went off very well at the Burra Showgrounds 14-16 November.  Despite cold and wet conditions a crowd in excess of 600 ventured to the site and were entertained by high quality singers and musicians.  Live music resonated through the town on Friday afternoon.  On Friday night about 150 witnessed the start of three days of music, with artists including the Heartland Band, Melody Fever, Michael Muchow, Shane Johnson and Sandra Humphries.  The headline act was The Borderers, fronted by Dublin born Alex and husband, Glasgow born Jim Paterson.  On Saturday there was the Talent Quest.  Here the senior winners was Lionel Campbell of Murray Bridge and the junior winner was Tyler Paterson of Pt Pirie.

The Yacht Races were held in the afternoon.  Music continued at the Showgrounds from 5 p.m., with Emcee Gina Timms, a vocal power-house from Tasmania.  Temperatures dropped and rain intensified for a while, but later subsided and revellers re-joined the dance floor.  Highlights of the night were Sandra Humphries and guitarist Henry Czerwonka, Tracey Rains, Nathaniel O’Brien, Gina Timms and the Claypan Band.

On Sunday morning a sermon by Rev. Darren Lovell preceded an inspiring Gospel Show, followed by more country music and dancing through the afternoon.  Festival Committee Member and Secretary of Country Music SA, Karen O’Brien said there had been a lot of positive feedback and they were looking forward to doing it again.
