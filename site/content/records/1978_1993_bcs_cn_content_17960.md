Burra Australia day Citizen of the Year Awards

Len & Susan Hentschke were joint winners this year.  The citations for them emphasised their work in the Senior Citizens Club and their enduring interest in the KESAB Tidy Towns Competition.  Len was the inaugural Chairman of Senior Citizens in Burra and has spent six of nine years as a member in that position.  Sue has been a staunch member for this period.  The couple has spent countless hours planting, watering and weeding the beautiful gardens thay and other senior citizens have created on the banks of the Burra creek.  Another KESAB project has been the creating and maintenance of a garden area opposite Burra Hospital.  Both are dedicated members of the Lutheran Church and they helped in erecting the Nativity Scene in Market Square each year.  They have attended the Day Care Centre and give talks and demonstrations when requested at BCS.  Their favourite topic is old fashioned sausage making.  Len was Councillor for the Bright Ward for the Robertstown Council for fifteen years and was given a service award when he retired to live in Burra.  Sue’s other interests included eight years as a member of the CWA.  The couple have three daughters and spent many years farming at World’s End before retiring to Burra.  Sue’s interests include knitting, reading, gardening and caring for the sick and elderly.  Len’s interests also include helping others.
