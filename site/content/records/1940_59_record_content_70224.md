Booborowie Institute.  Subject to approval by the subscribers the committee has accepted the tender of E.J. Affolter & Son of £6,475-10-0 for the addition of two cloak rooms, a supper room and bio room to the Institute.  The other tender from a city firm was much higher.  Funds on hand are about £4,500 and enquiries are being made for bank finance.  The barley crop is growing rapidly and it was decided to take out fire and hail insurance.  It is hoped the crop will realise about £1,000.  The electric light engine was sold to Mr G.R. Shattock for £82-10-0.  The Younger Set has donated £50.

A special meeting of subscribers approved the above.  It is thought that since the contract does not included lighting or furnishing and possible stage improvements, a further £1,000 may be needed.  The State Bank cannot grant a loan, but the Bank of Adelaide is expected to grant a short term loan of £2,000.
