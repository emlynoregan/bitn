The Oval.  The proposal for accommodation at the oval is quite different from that of Alex. Harris’s offer, which was rejected a short time ago.  Parallels should not be drawn.  This time the Show Society is offering £30 and we understand that the Friendly Societies’ Demonstration Committee would add £10.  In the interests of the town it is to be hoped Council will give it serious and impartial consideration.
