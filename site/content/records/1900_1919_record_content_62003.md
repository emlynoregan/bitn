RSL will hold a social evening in the Burra Institute early in November.  The frivolities Concert Party of Peterborough offered to give a concert in aid of the club in November and this was gratefully accepted.  The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. will provide the annual dinner for the Returned Soldiers’ Assoc.
