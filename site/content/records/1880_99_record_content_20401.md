The Fighting Council

The Thin-skinned Council

The You Scratch My Back and I’ll Scratch Yours Council

Letter from W.H. Hardy expressing amazement that such contempt for moral principle should persist as is shown by Cr Ridgway’s decision to withdraw his resignation or by Cr Tiver’s determination to stand again.  Such hypocrisy is beneath contempt.

Letter from ‘One of the unemployed’ condemning the employment of just eight men by Council.  If £50 is to be expended every unemployed ratepayer should have a chance, or the work let by tender and be shared out fairly.
