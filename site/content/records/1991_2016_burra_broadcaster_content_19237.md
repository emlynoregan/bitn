Goyder Council is talking the potential of the Y2K problems.  All the Council systems are being checked to see that the change from ’99 to ’00 does not cause any computer malfunctions.  The most serious problem would potentially be with the STEDS system.  A malfunction there could cause effluent to back up and overflow in houses closest to the creek.
