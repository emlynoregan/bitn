Letter from ‘Square Dinkum’ of Hallett re the Burra Football Association and umpires.  [A lengthy, but clear and interestingly written letter.]

The Association calls for applications for umpires at so much per match, home and away.

All umpires declare their services are available.

When one shows his discontent he is fired instead of being told to fulfil his contract.

Having dismissed one umpire for favouring a home team, they then have but one left for two matches at the same time.

They then appoint a Terowie man to umpire a Terowie game.

The Hallett team leaves at half time on account of disgraceful favouritism.

Because the protest from the Hallett Captain does not comply with the exact letter of the rules it is dismissed as informal: witnesses were bundled out and the match awarded to Terowie.

One umpire was dismissed for favouritism and the other given their eternal blessing for the very same offence.

Hallett delegates must get the lid off and let in a little pure air.
