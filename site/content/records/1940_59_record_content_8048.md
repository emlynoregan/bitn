Lieut. D.H. Killicoat has retired from his job in the military at Wayville and returned to civilian life.

Sgt Tom Halls has, we are told, been chosen to represent SA on the recruiting stunt.  He has recently returned from Tobruk, where he had been in some stiff corners.

Pte Fred Collins has ‘also hit the long trail’.  He was a cowboy at ‘The Gums’ Station for a couple of years and his family lives at Gulnare.

Mr & Mrs N. Hiles Pearse, late of ‘The Gums’, have bought a house on Payneham Road and will shortly be moving in.
