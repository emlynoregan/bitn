A good deal of bickering then followed.

Cr Dow said he was against organised Sunday sport, but was also against an interdict on any section of the community having personal recreation as they desire.

Cr Kellaway suggested a notice of motion for next meeting concerning the sale of the land.

The Mayor couldnâ€™t see how that would help the carnival.

Cr Kellaway said it would save a lot of hullabaloo if Council moved to suspend the agreement.  He favoured allowing play on Good Friday.  The motion was lost.

Cr Kellaway then moved that Council would have no objection to the carnival being carried on as arranged on Kooringa courts.  Cr Dow seconded, remarking that this had the same effect as his motion.  This was carried unanimously.
