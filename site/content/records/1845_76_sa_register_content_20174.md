Fires at Kooringa

A serious fire occurred at the Burra Hotel on Friday night 25 January.  The whole of the stables, Mr Williamsâ€™ malthouse and contents, a buggy, a valuable horse and a quantity of fodder were destroyed.  It was a hot boisterous night and the alarm was raised a little before 11 p.m.  The strong wind, the inflammable nature of the building and the absence of water or a fire engine made fighting the fire futile.  It is amazing that the nearby wooden brewery building escaped due to the wind direction.

An inquest was held the next day before Mr MacDermott SM with Mr Lane as foreman of the jury.  William Hayward ostler described his duties in the stable that night.  A Chinaman named John gave the alarm at about 10.40 p.m.

Haywood did not smoke, smoking was not allowed in the stables and he had seen no one about the place smoking.  William Kimball gave corroborative evidence.  He had seen several boys walking from the brewery to the hotel.  J.G. Lamb landlord of the hotel said he did not believe he had an enemy in Burra.  He spoke to five boys in the stable yard (aged 12-14), reprimanded them and said he thought they had started the fire.
