Numbers from 348 to 354 repeat a series used in 1896 and for this series the number in round brackets indicates the number of times it was used in Volume XV to the 20 December 1899 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.

348 (3) [2, 1896]

349 (1)

350 (8) [7, 1896]

351 (2) [1, 1896]

352 (3) [2, 1896]

353 (3) [2, 1896]

354 (5) [1, 1895]

The series then begins using numbers not previously used and runs fairly regularly from 355 to 397, although the following irregularities do occur:

355, 384 & 395 are used twice (the second use of 384 sits irregularly between 386 & 388)

356, 363, 376, 377, 378 & 387 are not used.

The jump from 375 to 379 occurred when the ‘6’ destined to make up 376 was placed upside-down to read 379.
