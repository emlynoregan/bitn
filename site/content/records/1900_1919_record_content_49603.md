Burra Town Council.

Lamplighter W.S. Pryor applied for 6d more per lamp.  [Making an extra 7/6 a week for lighting the 15 lamps in Kooringa.]  A decision was deferred.

The Municipal Association wrote asking if the Council was in favour of compelling vehicles to carry a red tail light at night.  They were not.

A letter of sympathy was sent to Cr Radford.

Burra Cheer-up Society held a social on Saturday afternoon, 17 February, to welcome the Grand Camp Concert Party.

Pte Bert Sandland was present on his farewell leave.

Ptes C. Bartholomaeus & w. Nankivell were present, but were not on their long leave.

A phot of Pte W.J. Quinn has been received.
