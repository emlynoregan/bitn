Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary on Easter Monday.  At 2 p.m. about 300 assembled including children and adults and marched through the town.  The children’s dress was good, plain and neat.  Tea was taken in the open air.  At 5 p.m. 300 friends of the institution took tea in the chapel, after which John Boots presided at a public meeting, in the unavoidable absence of the Rev. Lowe.  Several addresses on the importance of the institution’s work were delivered and on the role of Sunday schools in general.  The event resulted in taking £33-0-0; £11-7-6 from the sale of tickets and £21-12-6 from subscriptions.  It is about three years since the school was established and it now has c. 280 pupils and 40 teachers.
