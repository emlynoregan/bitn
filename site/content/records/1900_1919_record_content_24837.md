Mr James Thomas has been obliged to resign as curator and sexton of the Kooringa Cemetery.  He is one of the oldest residents and oldest council employee.  He is aged 78 and was born in the Parish of Ludgrun in Cornwall, coming to SA in the Isle of Finnet reaching Pt Adelaide on 23 October 1854 after a three month voyage.  He was employed at the Burra Mine until it closed and has been in charge of the Burra Cemetery for nearly thirty years.
