Mr Miller said the greatest changes during the last 8 years that he had worked for Burra had been in getting people onto the land and he hoped a major scheme for increased settlement would soon be brought about on Eyre Peninsula, where the land was even better than around Pinnaroo.  The opening of new country would probably obviate the need for compulsory purchase.  The Booleroo Centre and Angaston railways helped this closer settlement.  He then mentioned the Pekina creek water scheme.  He believed in a progressive land tax.  The federal Government should take over the Northern Territory.  It was dangerous to have such a large area lying idle.  An interjector suggested that the ‘Japs’ might ‘collar it’.
