Hallett Institute.  The old institute was erected in 1879 and although enlarged has become too small for the needs of the community.  A scheme for a new one was launched some months ago and the new one to be built in the Main St will be of two storeys and more in keeping with needs.  The foundation stone was laid 28 November by Miss L.M. Melrose accompanied by her father Sir John Melrose and her brother Mr A.J. Melrose of Mintaro.  The architects are Messrs Davies, Wooldridge & Council.  P. Findlay is the mason in charge.  Mr T.E. Richards re-laid the stone from the old Institute.  Tea was taken at the old Institute.  The cost of the new building is expected to be c. £5,000.  £2,500 has been collected.  Sir John had been the originator of the scheme and offered £500.  A concert was held in the evening.  Proceeds of the whole effort were £112.  [Details extend for c. 1½ columns.]
