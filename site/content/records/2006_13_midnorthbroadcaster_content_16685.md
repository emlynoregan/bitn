The NSW-based passenger train the Southern Aurora visited Peterborough on Anzac Day.  The famous train ran its last scheduled Sydney/Melbourne service on 2 August 1986.  Most of the carriages then passed to the Australian railway Historical Society (ACT Division) and NSW Rail transport Museum.  They have since operated them on tours.  After an overnight stay in Peterborough the train proceeded to Pt Augusta.
