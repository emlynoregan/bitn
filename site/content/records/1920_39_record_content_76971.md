Obituary.  Rev. James Albert Horace Andrews died at Burra Hospital on 31 October after a short sudden illness [aged 50].  He was born in West Wallsend NSW, the son of the late William Andrews.  At an early age he went to Broken Hill with his parents and stayed there until entering the ministry in 1911.  He went to the late Dr Torr’s Training Home and was ordained in March 1917 at Kent Town Methodist Church.  He married Vivien Budge of Gladstone on 4 April 1917 and worked in the following Methodist Circuits:

SA – Morgan, Mt Gambier, Unley, Renmark, Terowie, Moonta Mines & Solomontown

WA – Katanning, Subiaco & Kalgoorlie

Returned to SA in 1935 and worked at Gawler before coming to the Burra-Redruth Circuit.

He became a Freemason in 1919.  He was a dedicated worker in town affairs wherever he was posted and a lover of books, music, flowers and art.  The children of the parish held a special place in his heart.  He enjoyed golf, tennis and bowls.  He leaves a widow and one son, Deane.
