The Mayor’s Annual Report.

The Mayor completed his third consecutive year of service and announced that he would not run again.  [He had also served for the year 1883-84.]

23 ordinary and 4 special meetings had been held.

Crs were Dunn, Lockyer, Pederson, Sampson, West & Winnall.

The average attendance at meetings was lower this year than in any recent one – perhaps reflecting the generally unexciting nature of business.

The year began with a credit balance of £14-17-6 and now there is one of £23-2-0 compared with £42-2-8 at the same time last year.  This will have been expended by 31 December and East Ward will be in deficit.  The rates amounted to £366-14-10, about £36 less than last year, and the Government subsidy was £105-17-9.

Public works took up £190-10-0, an increase of £20-12-0 and £210 went for bond redemption and interest.  This marks the end of the town’s bonded debt which had existed since 1879 and at one time amounted to £2,700 and on which interest over the years had amounted to £709.  This has allowed the reduction in the town rate to 11d and a further reduction will be possible in the New Year.  The rateable value of the town for 1898 is £8,645, down £14-9-0.  A breakdown of expenditure by Wards follows.
