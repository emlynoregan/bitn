Messrs Ian Tiver & Roger Nutt welcomed persons interested in inspecting the shearing of their fine wool ‘Merryville’ sheep for the first time on Friday 17 October.  The sheep have been in the district for twelve months.  Mr Tiver and Mr Nutt bought 300 ewes of pure ‘Merryville’ blood twelve months ago to introduce fine wool Merino sheep to their Hallett properties.  The wool was a remarkably attractive clean staple with very little variation in the staple of 70’s quality wool.  The ewes averaged 10 lbs of wool from Mr Nutt and Ian Tiver expected about a pound less from his, due to a harder time through winter.  The beautiful handling wool is brighter and softer than their own type of wool and everyone was interested to see that such wool could be grown in country with an average rainfall of c. 16.5 inches.  [Further details are given in an article of c. 1¼ columns.]
