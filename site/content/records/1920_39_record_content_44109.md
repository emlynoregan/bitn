St Mary’s Day School has received a good report from the Diocesan Board of Education.  Miss Gall is commended for maintaining standards despite such small numbers.  She has resigned for next year to take a position nearer her own home and has not yet been replaced.  If the school continues it may be as a kindergarten.
