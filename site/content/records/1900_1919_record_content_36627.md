Early Closing Act meeting, Burra Institute Tuesday last.

Mr Crewes said they had a petition with 802 signatures favouring bringing the town and surrounding areas under the Act.  Legal advice now was that only the Corporation and the surrounding DC residents were eligible to sign.  They were thus back to square one and he had heard that a counter-petition had about 500 signatures.

Mr McLaren moved that a fresh petition be started to bring the Corporation and the DC of Burra under the Act.  Carried.

Communications will be made with Mt Bryan, Hallett & Farrell’s Flat to keep them informed.
