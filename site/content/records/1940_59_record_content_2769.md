The Assoc. was opposed to the Government levy on travelling stock to control noxious weeds, which was to be subsidised £ for £.  They felt it would be like the subsidy to DCs for grasshopper control, which after one year was withdrawn, though they were sure in this case the levy would remain.  I.J. Warnes reported on the year’s activities.  This was the 49th AGM of the District Committee.  He was also re-elected as President and was congratulated by Mr J. Keith Angas, the State President, on having been President for 29 years.  Other congratulations followed.  The branch’s only other President had been Mr W. Killicoat.  Much of the work done in the early days by the local President was now done by Central Executive.  The first [SA] President of the Assoc. was the Hon. J.H. Angas for 1890-91 and J. Keith Angas was his grandson.
