A Nature Field Day at Mt Bryan has been organised for 13 October by the Nature Conservation Society of SA, Trees for Life, Greening Australia and the WWFâ€™s SA Temperate Grassland Project.  The workshop will concentrate on management of grasslands by landowners in the morning, including weed management and pulse grazing.  In the afternoon there will be a visit to Mt Cone grassland and at least one other site near Burra.  People will be introduced to the diversity of species here and hear about weed control and the pygmy blue tongue lizard.
