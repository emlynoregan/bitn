BCS.  The 2004 Year 12 students achieved significantly better results than those achieved in the past five years.  There were 25 Year 12 students and 48 & of the subject grades were A or B and only 9% were unsatisfactory.  There were 16 individual A grades compared with only 1 in 2003.  A new approach, with a strong student discipline policy and closer monitoring of student progress has made a difference.
