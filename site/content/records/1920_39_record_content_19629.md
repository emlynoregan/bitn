Redruth Court

Three young men were charged with offensive behaviour at the Institute during the pictures on Saturday night last.  They had taken in and consumed a bottle of wine and began to smoke and make a disturbance.  One charge was dismissed, but one was fined £2-10-0 + costs and the other 30/- + costs.
