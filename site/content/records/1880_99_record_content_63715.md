Editorial on the ‘uncalled for action of Mounted-Constable Jemison in a recent case in which a young girl was cruelly brought before the Redruth Court to answer a charge of indecent language’ [The details of the case are then covered.]  At one point when Mr Packard, for Gully, asked Jemison if the people standing by heard the girl speak the constable replied sarcastically ‘Find out; I don’t know.’

This was disrespectful to both the counsel and the court.  Jemison acted indiscreetly when he spoke to the girl a second time, having neither the right nor the need to do so.  It was apparently the reference to his ‘fat legs’ that prompted his later action.  All because she ‘is always speaking to someone in the centre of the footpath’.  We do not support a petition to have the constable moved.  ‘If a child does wrong it is not sent away, but kept at home and taught right from wrong.’
