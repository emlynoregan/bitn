The program aims to maintain the economic health of the town while preserving its heritage.  The community of Burra is crucial to the process.  The community will be asked what it wants Burra to develop, what is needed to ensure Burra remains a great place to live, how it should look and how it is desired to project the town to visitors.  This vision of the future will be the yardstick against which development and marketing will be assessed.
