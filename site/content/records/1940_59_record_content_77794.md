Burra Town Council, 20 May

Cr White moved that the required action be taken to close an area of Bridge St West 33 ft by 306 links, from Thames Street end and that the same be sold to the Burra Bowling Club for Â£5.  It was carried with the proviso that the corners be cut back not less than five feet along each boundary to permit access to the tennis court area.
