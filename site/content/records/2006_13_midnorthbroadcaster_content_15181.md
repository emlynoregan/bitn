TRUenergy will appeal against the local council’s decision to reject planning approval for the Stony Gap wind Farm development.  The proposed $300 million development would be located 125 km [sic] north of Adelaide near Burra.  [Burra is c. 155 km from Adelaide in a straight line]  It would provide 123 MW of energy to power the equivalent of more than 75,000 homes each year.  TRUenergy will appeal to the SA Environment, Resources and Development Court. Cameron Garnsworthy for the company said they believe the development met all state planning requirements and this view was supported by the Goyder Regional Council’s independent planning consultant, who recommended the development should proceed.
