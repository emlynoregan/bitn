The season is still poor and it is thought hardly a load of wheat will be brought in from World’s End and Baldina – recovery of seed wheat will be as much as ever they will get.  Things are little better towards Black Springs and across to Robertstown and Point Pass.  Things are somewhat better towards the west of the town.
