Cricket.  A meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on Thursday to re-form the Burra Association.  Teams were Kooringa, Mt Bryan, Hallett & Booborowie.  The rules of the 1913 Burra Association were adopted, except for two.  E. Jackson was elected Secretary & Treasurer.  It was decided Farrell’s Flat was too inconvenient to include because of the travel arrangements.  I.J. Warnes will be asked to become President.
