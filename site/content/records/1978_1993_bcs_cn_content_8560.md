The Howell Family

A letter to the Copper festival Committee from Edward (Teddy) Howell of Sydney, told of his grandfather James Howell who arrived in Burra in 1859.  He was superintendent of the Burra Burra Copper Mine and Teddy’s father, Edwin Gilbert Howell, was born in Burra in 1860.  Mr Howell and his brother intend to visit Burra for the Copper Festival.  Some senior citizens may remember Teddy Howell co-starring at the Theatre Royal with Jessie Mathews in a play called Janus or in Oliver at Her Majesty’s.  He also played ‘Fred’ and ‘Mr Sproggins’ in the radio serial Fred & Maggie & Everybody, which ran on radio station 5DN for many years.  More recently he has appeared on TV in episodes of A Country Practice as ‘Bert Griffiths’ and as the old man ‘Ginger’ with his dog ‘Carpenter’. 

[James Burgess Howell and his wife Rebecca nee Gilburt appear to have had only one child registered as born in SA; Edwin Gilburt Howell born at Kooringa 10 June 1860.]
