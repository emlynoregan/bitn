Editorial on the Distressed Selectors.  The failure of the crops in the north and north-east, beyond Goyder’s Line, now shows the controversial line ‘is pretty accurately laid down’, there may be plenty of good land beyond it, but the rainfall is so uncertain that it is in no one’s interest for it to be thrown open to settlement.  We must face that our agriculture can no longer be extended.  There must be ‘a turning back of the tide of settlement’.  As for those who have been lured into such settlements ‘no temporary assistance or partial relief will do more than delay the evil day, and that nothing short of cancelling the agreements will do.
