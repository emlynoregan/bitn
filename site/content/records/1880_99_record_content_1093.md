Editorial on The address in Reply in the SA Parliament.  Apparently the Address in Reply in the House of Assembly was a farcical affair by John Rounsevell, the Member for Gumeracha, and a small part of his speech is printed.  It is described as ‘a most absurd speech’, but also as a ‘characteristic speech’.
