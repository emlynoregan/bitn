Weather.  In the last week there has been high wind and two heavy dust storms, but on Saturday steady soaking rain fell.  The dust has been worse to the east where some homesteads reported removing a wheelbarrow of dirt per room.  Some sheep have been weighed down by the weight of the dust followed by the rain.  At Mt Bryan East 120 points caused a medium flow in Dust Hole Creek.  Weekend falls in the agricultural areas varied from 46 points at Booborowie to 80 at Hallett.  Burra recorded 64 points.  Eastern falls were more varied: Quondong 32 points, Balah 26, Braemar 55, Woolgangi 40, J. Oates [Poonunda] 101, Hogback 68 and Old Koomooloo 26.
