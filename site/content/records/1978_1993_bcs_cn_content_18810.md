St Mary’s.  A very wild stray cat sought sanctuary in the church on the Monday of the long weekend, causing the building to be temporarily closed.  He was eventually caught after considerable difficulty in the Historic Room.  Sampson, as he has been named, is gradually being tamed with good food and TLC.
