The Burra Railway

A report is printed from the SA Register of 6 January 1869 from a local reporter at Burra.

The railway works here are well advanced and could be completed ahead of contract.  Much curiosity is expressed regarding the site of the proposed terminus.  Four places are discussed:

Paxton Square, Kooringa.

The Courthouse allotments at Redruth.

An allotment near the Smelting Works on the Burra Survey, Redruth.

The Bon Accord Mine.

The arguments for and against each are:

Paxton Square is in the Township of Kooringa and a station here would increase property values, (the town is the property of the SA Mining Association) but against it is the cost of £20,000 to £40,000 to build bridges over the Burra and Welsh Creeks and in the cuttings and embankments, given that such expenditure would not increase the income by a single shilling.
