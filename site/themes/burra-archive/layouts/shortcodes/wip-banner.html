  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">This site is an early public preview. We are gradually importing Eric Fuss’s full archive into a searchable format. At present, the database includes four source documents:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>SA Register (1845–1876)</strong> — early Adelaide coverage before a local paper.</li>
    <li><strong>The Record Series (1876–1879)</strong> — the first years of the local newspaper.</li>
    <li><strong>The Record Series (1880–1899)</strong> — late 19th-century local reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Northern Argus (1985–1987)</strong> — regional coverage overlapping with local items.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">More publications and years are being processed and will appear here soon.</p>
