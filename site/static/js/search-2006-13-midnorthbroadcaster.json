      "content": "Burra Residents at a Public Meeting last Wednesday night gave the Goyder Council a clear message that it was unacceptable to proceed with plans to redevelop Market Square and Best Place.  The Council called the meeting to gauge opinion before the final decision to continue or abandon the project was made at the Council meeting on 16 May.  The plans involved major changes in Market Square, including the establishment of a major car parking area in the Town’s main street, a more direct traffic route and a slight repositioning of the rotunda to allow widening of the main road.  Planning Officer John Brak explained that the plans had been made possible by a grant of monies from Planning SA and the monies were specifically for projects that rejuvenated regional centres, increased local income from tourism and reclaimed space from traffic, roads and car parks.\n\nAfter public consultation in September 2004 Council had consultants Hames Sharley outline master plans and by July last year final engineering plans were completed by K.B.R. Consulting.\n\nAn estimated 170 people attended and many spoke against the plans after being told the finer details, particularly concerning costs.  So far about $90,000 had been spent.  CEO Steve Kerrigan said the predicted cost was $1,330,000 with 50% met by a Planning SA Grant, 50% from the Council and township – 25% by town ratepayers and 25% by the rest of the Goyder area.  This would mean a projected rate rise of $43.50 a year over the next 20 years.  Considerations raised included:\n\nCost.\n\nChanges to parking with seven car parking spaces lost between Commercial Street Corner and Gaslight [Mt Pleasant Rd.] and a total loss of 13 spaces.\n\nPaul Wilson said there was more to Burra’s retail area than Market Square – why wasn’t the whole area involved?\n\nOthers looked to the state of footpaths and gutters in dangerous disrepair and questioned the Council’s priorities.\n\nHow would Landmark be able to unload stock with the removal of the parking space currently used, to allow for a wider two-way road?  A Council spokesperson said there would be room (with trucks backing in from Thames St) and that the changes had been engineered for traffic safety.  The movement of the rotunda would make the room needed.\n\nBrian Christie asked whether B-double trucks could make the turn into Market Street from Commercial Street in the event of the bypass being blocked.\n\nMaureen Wright questioned the whole consultation process – fine tuning details now being discussed should have been sorted out long ago.\n\nThe Council Chairman said that it was not often that they got the chance for a 50-50 subsidy.\n\nThym Bitter and Geraldine Smedley moved that the project be discontinued and after much discussion the motion was carried with a huge majority.\n\nMost Burra Ward Councillors indicated that although this decision was not binding on them, they would vote with the feelings of the community.\n\nAt the Council meeting on Tuesday a motion was carried against the plan to redevelop Market Square and Best Place.

      "content": "Burra Passport\n\nLast week the National Trust presented the Goyder Council with a proposal to simplify the administration of the Burra Heritage Passport.  It proposes to revamp the current lease of heritage sites from the Council to the National Trust.  Council is asked to consider handing management and administration of all Burra heritage sites to the National Trust and for the National Trust to be fully responsible for the passport product and the management of all its income.  30% of passport income would go to the maintenance of Council owned sites and 30% to National Trust sites.  10% would go in marketing and promotion and 5% for administration and infrastructure.  The remaining 25% would cover commission, grant applications and other opportunities.  Appropriate boundaries for Council sites would need to be defined (the local rubbish dump is currently attached to the National Trust’s lease).  The National Trust hopes for a solution within a few months.  Concerns have since been raised regarding the Burra Visitor Centre’s role and capacity within the National Trust scheme.  Since 2003 the Centre has been run by BRTBA and has been the sole sales outlet for the Burra Passport Product.  The national Trust’s proposal would see it remain a major player in tourism, but not necessarily the sole outlet for the Passport.  Manager Andrew Glen was concerned about the financial implications for the Visitor Centre and the future administration of the Passport Product – where would commissions on the Passport go?  Burra Visitor Board of Management Chairman, Brenton Greenslade said the Centre operated on a break-even budget.  BRTBA is also concerned and is happy with the present management of Passport sales.  Another worry is that regional tourism in SA has seen a 20% fall this year.  BRTBA took over the Centre in 2003 when the National Trust decided not to renew its lease.

He is thrilled to be back, setting up a new IT business.  He and his newly wedded wife Angela will front Regional ITAssist, offering hardware, consulting, service and support.  David completed a Certificate III in Information Technology at TAFE and then undertook a Diploma in Information Technology.\n\nThe Barker family has been in the district since 1839, when they bought the Burra Hotel.  In 1847 they donated it to the community and it became the Burra Hospital, while the family bought Baldina Station.\n\n[These last two sentences are largely fiction.  Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia states that Alfred Barker arrived in SA on the brig Rapid along with Colonel Light 21 August 1836.  In 1841 he overlanded cattle from NSW and in the 1840s he was in partnership with W.G. Field in the Yankalilla area to the south of Adelaide.  Field died in 1852 and it was about then that the family came north.\n\nThe Burra Hotel operated from 1846 till 1876.   Alfred Barker was the licensee from 1852-58.  Ownership of the site would have resided with the SA Mining Association.  After running the Burra Hotel Alfred Barker purchased the lease on 33 square miles of country at Baldina from James Humphrey.  As far as the Burra hospital is concerned, when the Burra Hotel lease expired in 1876 the community negotiated the purchase of the freehold from the SA Mining Association for conversion of the building to a hospital and unusually for the Association it agreed to sell the freehold to the Burra Town Council.  Council approved payment in July 1877 of £583-10-8 including interest.\n\nSee:\n\nBurra News & Northern Mail 12 January 1877, Page 1.l I5 David Barker Angela Alfred Barker W.G.

The early impressionists got away from detail and produced a style Len Loves.  When he taught oil painting, he would give students a brief look at a painting and then ask them to go away and paint it – they would have only an impression of the image to fall back upon.\n\nWatercolour is Mr Bence’s first preference, but it is difficult and requires great care, as a single mistake screws up the work.  Painting in oils is more relaxing – mistakes can be scraped off and corrected.  His favourite subjects have been landscapes in Italy and France, but he also loved Burra scenes and its lovely bluestone buildings.  About 30 years ago he sold the Drew & Crewes Building in Commercial Street and he and his wife Muriel then ran a gallery in a cottage on Bridge Terrace [in Paxton Square].  At that time it was in poor condition and without electricity – but they did well for some years.  He enjoys sketching outdoors, rather than from photographs.  Painting has been an occupation and a hobby and he says you needed to view it as a job to be done, even if at times you didn’t feel like it.

Changes have included repositioning the back wall of the hall to give more room in the foyer, a new floor [surface] for the entrance and repainting the walls and ceiling of the foyer and the walls of the main hall and its ceiling rose[s].  The old design on the presidiums [sic: for proscenium] will be reproduced and the floor of the main hall will be painted.  The refurbished hall will have an official re-opening in October.  Volunteers show visitors around the hall with about 1,530 visitors since June 20062.\n\nIn the future it is hoped to make the old projector rom available for visitors.  The Town Hall Committee and Burra History Group has made a large collection of photographs available for viewing and for sale in the supper room.\n\n[Photograph of Meredith Satchell of the Burra Town Hall Committee and of Roy Taplin at work.\n\n1 The original hall was built in 1857 and this part is represented today by the foyer.

As well as an important habitat for native wildlife and vegetation between the rounded hills of Burra and the eastern rangelands, the area has been in the news of late for its megafauna heritage, with fossils of the giant kangaroo and diprotodon.  On 28 September there will be special displays of native wildlife, plants and Australian megafauna, with experts in those fields stationed around the ‘oval’ area.  Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University, a specialist in megafauna, will be among those on hand.

Flinders University associate professor Rod Wells and Aaron Cumens from Adelaide University explained some recent discoveries.  The fossils here are particularly well preserved.  The latest Diprotodon fossil was of a teenaged specimen, which is rare.  The first reported discoveries of a Diprotodon were along Baldina Creek in 1889.  Since then seven localities have yielded finds of Diprotodons as well as a Tasmanian tiger.  The fossil discoveries add a different potential source of tourist development for the district.

Jessie grew up on the family farm near World’s End and walked two miles to the local school, where she studied with 25 other students to grade 7.  She then worked on the farm, enjoying riding her horse, mustering and drafting sheep.  She loved playing tennis at World’s End and dances at Robertstown and Point Pass – to the tunes on an accordion.\n\nOn 9 November 1932 she married Ted Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  She still keeps up with activities on the farm ‘Curburra’, which since Ted’s death in 1962 has been managed by Daphne and Peter Mengersen.  Jessie always enjoyed clearance sales and shearing time, when she would cook a roast and four veg.  She was always a most hospitable person and visitors always got a cup of tea and a welcome.  When her father had one of the few cars at World’s End she would drive people to the doctor or into the town, so it became known as the World’s End Taxi.  One of her greatest accomplishments was buying land from the Warnes, Woollacott and Villis families and seeing it paid off.  Some of the film Breaker Morant was shot on her property in 1979 and Jessie was an extra.  She said her century might be due to good clean living, no alcohol, dancing, friendship and hard work, but with a mother who lived to 90 and her father to well over that, it could have been in the genes.

Three years later Barry Read found one on his 80 acre property neighbouring Princess Royal.  Since then a ‘Recovery Team’ has been working to ensure the population of the lizard was stabilised.  Sir David said he was thrilled to be involved in the Bluetongue cause.  Professor Mike Bull of Flinders University is also working with the ‘Recovery Team’.  The recovery process seems to be doing well, with the numbers of the lizard rising.  Barry Read has established a sanctuary where he first found the reptile in 1995.  Local landowner Chris Reed said he had changed his land management practice to minimise any impact on the Bluetongues, but it was no chore to do so.  Mr Reed said numbers in the Mid North are now thought to be c. 5,000.\n\n[Photo of Sir David Attenborough with Anthony Thorogood and of the lizards.] Sir David Attenborough Barry Read Professor Mike Bull Chris Reed Anthony Thorogood Mr Reed Mid North Marion Princess Royal environment conservation wildlife species recovery",

Convenors praised the town on its successful and strategic promotion of its history.  The symposium aimed to draw attention to the gap in Burra’s tourism – its local indigenous heritage – the Ngadjuri people, who lived in the region.\n\nVincent Copley of the Ngadjuri Heritage Committee explained that awareness was their aim.  Stephen Kerrigan (Council CEO) represented the Goyder Council and said Council had been discussing the possibilities of a historical display with the Ngadjuri.

Some residents are concerned about nutrients entering the Burra Creek and about smells after rain and a southeast wind.  The construction of a further effluent dam has been a hot topic of late.  Asset manager, Trevor Wood, says the new dam is part of the total project Council has been working on for years.  Water leaving the ponds is tested regularly to ensure it is of a quality suitable for specific agricultural irrigation purposes.  The Burra lagoons were constructed in 2003 and recently Council became aware that treated water entering Burra Creek may have led to an algal bloom.  Testing proved this not to be the cause.  To ensure strict compliance with the health and environment guidelines, the new dam was being constructed. A re-use irrigation system is being considered and possibly a wetland area on the cemetery extension allotment.

They designed special shoes (i.e. some roughly shaped tin plates) to provide stability [having the effect of snow shoes].  Half way out they found fence posts, suggesting that the lagoon had been fenced in half at some time.  The trek took about 1½ hours.  In 1876 the founder of Spalding, William Lunn and a friend drowned in the lagoon while duck shooting.\n\nIn 1926 a syndicate placed a 16 ft clinker-built boat on the lagoon and hired it out for 2/6 an hour or 6d on Sundays and public holidays.  In 1927 it was christened The Swan by Mrs Atkins and a single plank jetty was erected.  A second boat was called The Gull.  A regatta was held for some years around Australia Day with such events as bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel and a 440 yard swim.  Laurel Neill recalled thousands attending.  But the water level fell and by 1937 salt scraped from the surface was being sold.  The lake filled again in the 1950s and water skiing became popular.  Peter Caddy brought a team from Barmera and the Australian Water Ski Championships* were held on Porter’s Lagoon in the mid 1950s.

It focused on the risk the development might have on the water course as a resource.  The decision relied, he said, on anecdotal evidence of ground water levels and creek flow and not on evidence from observation wells.  The ERDC said the site itself was an appropriate land use and a feedlot would not cause a nuisance by reason of dust, noise and appearance and arrangements for run-off and disposal of waste were satisfactory and were unlikely to pollute ground or surface water.\n\nMr Whetstone cited the feedlot in Clare, where more than 5,000 cattle resulted in creek pollution and smell.  He was not against a feedlot; the issue was its location.\n\nIt is understood that prior to an application being lodges, a feedlot was up and running and according to Goyder Council planner, Mr John Brak, it was a case of processing the application as soon as possible.\n\nThe latest judgement in the case, in response to Mr Rowe’s second appeal has again rejected the application on the grounds that water use from the Burra Creek is unsustainable.

The new arrangements aim at a three tier system to allow country patients treatment closer to home while improving safety and quality of treatment.

The second level is called Local Integrated Health Services, providing low level acute, primary and residential aged care services.  The third level is Small Communities Health Services, providing primary health care and basic emergency care.  As yet the impact on Mid North hospitals is unclear, but residents in Burra, Eudunda and Kapunda fear services in their hospitals will be downgraded.  Small town hospitals are going to be staffed mainly by nurses and have only aged, minor trauma and overnight observation beds.

The recovery team was founded in 1993 when Pigmy Bluetongues were first rediscovered near Burra.  The team lapsed due to lack of funding, but was restarted in 2004.  Threatened Fauna Ecologist Julie Schofield said the lizards had some fascinating features:\n\nThey eat insects\n\nThey are very territorial\n\nFemales are longer that males and can carry two babies at a time\n\nThe mother cares for the young for some time – unusual for lizards\n\nThe recovery team is monitoring several populations to learn more and is attempting to get a certain number of populations under a heritage-conservation agreement, which involves liaising with landowners and making them aware of the lizard’s requirements.  BCS has a population on its property.  Mapping populations is another aim.  Their fragmented population makes them critically endangered.\n\n[Photo of a Pigmy Bluetongue and one of Julie Schofield.] Julie Schofield Marion Burra fauna conservation endangered environment",

Rooms are booked through to 2013 and 2008 sees rooms filled to a maximum with 14 students already enrolled and five on the waiting list.  BCS staff are seeking interested community members to think about taking boarders.  The boarding house opened in 1993 to provide a place for children who have to travel long distances for their education.  The two storey facility caters for 14 students with nine rooms available.  Girls are accommodated upstairs and boys downstairs.  Most students come from isolated pastoral areas.  A live-in supervisor is responsible for day to day running of the hostel and the care of students.  BCS principal Jim Low puts much of the success of the venture down to Michelle Cooper, who has been the supervisor or ‘House mum’ for four years.  There are no plans to expand the size of the operation. Jim Low Michelle Cooper Goyder House Burra education boarding school community",

      "content": "Rosemary Ros, Burra History Website designer from Raleigh, NC, USA, writes also expressing concern over the false impression created by the article about Burra’s online presence.  She is an Australian living in North Carolina and she says that in July 2004 she began researching her husband’s family history.  From the US she found the Burra Visitor Information Centre’s website and a very helpful information office (Rowena Wilson), who put her in touch with Meredith Satchell, who provided a great deal of information and assistance.  In thanks Rosemary says she established a website for Meredith’s B & B operation (www.birhccottageburra.com).  Some information on Burra was added and by October 2004 the site was attracting interest.  In the first year it averaged 2,000 hits per month and in the last four months the figure was 8,500 per month.  This led to the establishment of a website for Burra history (www.burrahistory.info), which was available in January 2005 and moved to its present domain in March 2005.  This site has expanded beyond local history to become an avenue for people pursuing their own family history.  In January 2006 a section was added to give the Burra Town Hall online visibility.  This site now averages over 44,000 hits per month, with an average 50,780 per month in the last four months, compared with over 19,000 per month in 2005.\n\nThis might serve to educate on the true history of Burra’s online presence, which had most assuredly commenced long before the introduction of the Burra Burra Heritage website of 19 July 2007.

Prior to 1966 it was two separate blocks.\n\nBlock A was owned by James Waters 1875 to 1883.\n\nBlock B was owned by James Williams White 1877 to 1906.\n\nThe blocks were merged in 1966.

      "content": "Waste Management will be a major cost as Goyder Council improves its processes.  The closure of landfill sites and extra travel distances for dumping could see rates double.  While landfill in low rainfall and isolated areas is very cost effective, the Council has been forced to close all landfill sites and meet the cost of capping them.  Waste will have to be transported to a site outside of the region at considerable cost.  The Solid Waste Levy will also increase.  Expressions of interest from private operators have now been sought.  The current annual cost to operate the regional waste collection scheme is in excess of $113,000 and this has meant the Council could minimise its costs to a recovery rate of $80 per household.  But with the need for higher capital expenditure of $210,000 in 2007-08 and a similar sum in 2008-09 along with changed management processes, a far greater contribution from ratepayers will be required.  Council is supported by Zero Waste and the EPA, but the funds available from Zero Waster to help Councils with infrastructure costs are inadequate.  Council thinks more of the Solid Waste Levy should go to Zero Waste for the next 3-5 years than to the EPA. Goyder Council  waste management council infrastructure finance",

He farms 1,200 pigs, but is struggling with high feed grain prices, pig meat imports, low returns and previous labour shortages.  Grain prices have almost doubled recently, but costs cannot be passed on.  About 70% of the cost for some piggeries is in feed and any movement in feed prices therefore can greatly add to costs.  Since they are now only getting about $2 a kilo for their pigs they are hardly making anything on them.  Another problem is his reliance on bore water and its relatively high salinity, which reduces the conception rate in pigs.  Salt content of ground water has nearly doubled in the past ten years.  The biggest competitors are Holland and Canada which export frozen pig meat.  [Photo.] Bill Stockman Burra Holland Canada agriculture piggeries economy water",

The club had booked out Paxton Square and other accommodation.  The club was formed in 1983 for people over 50 with a common interest in motorcycles.

Mrs O’Connor would like to know if anyone is interested in saving the hall because if no one cares she won’t bother fighting for it.  Burra Girl Guides went into recess for a year due to low numbers, but if the hall is closed Mrs O’Connor says she will not resume in 2008.  After 14 years as District Leader she needed a break.

Halloween is an American phenomenon that we could well do without.\n\n‘How can one possibly estimate the percentage of haunted houses in Burra?  Well I can.  My estimate is far more accurate, scientific, reliable and credible.  None.’\n\nHe then tells the history of the Kooringa Hotel site.\n\nThe early building on the site was a Congregational Church and later a Welsh Chapel.  It became a Church of England Grammar School in 1864 – conducted on principles similar to the Collegiate College of St Peter in Adelaide.  It closed in 1873.  It was demolished in 1884 and the stone stored at the Unicorn Brewery, whose owners then built the Kooringa Hotel on the site.  In 1912 the stone was used in the new residence for the Primary School Headmaster.\n\n‘The Kooringa Hotel [is] a grand hotel that doesn’t need a ghost to promote it.’ Julian Ratcliffe Burra Kooringa Hotel Unicorn Brewery Adelaide letter history ghosts local history",

Nemerous people directed questions and voiced concerns to the panel made up of Mayor Peter Mattey, CEO Steve Kerrigan and Finance Manager, Bill Mader.\n\nThere was great concern over the future of the square and demands for clarification of Council’s ‘Futures Report’.  The cottages are currently leased to Maswood Pty Ltd and this lease expires on 31 August 2008.  Council’s figures show that maintenance costs have outstripped income and the cottages are in desperate need of renovation.  The Council is considering:\n\nA management arrangement.\n\nA long term lease.\n\nComplete sale of the Heritage Listed site.\n\nThe Council wished to get an idea of what should happen from a community point of view.  Would the community for instance be prepared to pay a levy on Council rates to assist in the renovation?  The upgrade was expected to cost at least $800,000 over five years.\n\nSeveral of the speakers expressed disapproval of the Council’s maintenance of the cottages.  Helen Stockman said that many grants had been received to assist the cottages, which are important to Burra.  Paul Wilson put forward a motion that was carried, to form a committee to investigate the operation and running of the cottages.  Salt damp is a major maintenance problem.

Business Manager Tanya Sexton said every effort was made to revitalise the Burra Group before deciding to sell the hall.  The hall was in a dilapidated state and a large amount of money would have had to be spent on it to rectify the problems.  She said Guides still could be re-opened in Burra.  A similar thing happened to the Scouts, but they continued.  Mrs O’Connor said that she had looked forward to resuming local Guides in 2008, but with the sale of the hall, they would not be re-instated in Burra.

This method sees the injection of a naturally occurring protein between the hind legs, which encourages a break in the wool follicles.  The sheep are covered with a body-hugging nylon net to contain the wool. After 28 days the net is pulled off, along with the fleece, to reveal a perfectly shorn sheep.  The lambs are a lot less stressed and no special treatment is needed afterwards.  The method is both cost and labour efficient.  If grower and buyer have settled on clip parameters and price, the wool can be baled while still in the nets and sent to the processor.  A number of farmers locally have begun to use the Bioclip method. Adrian Cook BCS students Farrell Flat agriculture shearing Bioclip animal welfare wool processing",

Many people have ancestors who spent time in Burra and much of her work is concerned with helping those researching their family history.  The History Group has established a display of historic photographs in the Town Hall and keeping it open every day acts as great publicity both for the town and the hall as a community facility available for hire.  Ms Satchell’s paternal great-grandfather settled in the farming district here in the 1870s.  Ms Satchell said the honour of Burra Citizen of the Year was very humbling given the number of people who volunteer their time in so many ways and she saw it more as a way of promoting Burra’s history.

The plans for the future of the cottages have been evoked by the expiration of the Heritage Facility Agreement held by Maswood Pty Ltd, which occurs on 31 August 2008.  Council says the income raised is continually in deficit of the costs of desperately needed renovations and upkeep.  The Mayor says occupancy rates are sliding and revenues are not increasing.  The committee reports that it needs access to current accurate information on operating costs, but privacy of the business dealing of the current managers’ operations makes this impossible.\n\nThe Council rent is minimal, but would require around 10% minimal occupancy.\n\nSeveral possibilities are being considered, including a long term lease.\n\nThe committee has raised several concerns regarding the need for accurate information, especially the need to gain access to actual operating costs of maintaining the cottages.  But the manager of properties and facilities Mike Fretwell suggested an educated guess would have to suffice as access to all costs were part of the private business dealings of the current manager’s operations.\n\nAnother option was to let four or five of the cottages on a permanent basis to the Burra based diving school as regular accommodation for their students.  Occupancy of the cottages has been minimal even in months deemed popular by tourists.\n\nThe committee has been granted an extension of time to the end of April to make its recommendations.  The delay has been due to the need to examine the primarily confidential Heritage Facility Agreement.  This was undertaken last Thursday.  They will next meet on 19 February and may then need to meet fortnightly to meet the deadline. Mike Fretwell Maswood Pty Ltd the Mayor Paxton Square Burra heritage council property tourism",

In 2006 the Burra Regional Art Gallery secured a lease on the building in the hopes of transforming it into a mega-fauna inspired Palaeontology Museum, but at present without funding this is not feasible.  A structural assessment of the building is needed, because although the stonework is sound, the woodwork is not.  The Director of the SA Museum is supportive.  The station was erected in 1883 to replace a wooden structure of 1870.  Rail services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988 and the station has since deteriorated.  Its situation has now become critical.\n\n[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect.  Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986.

      "content": "Burra National Trust held another general meeting on Tuesday night at the Burra Town Hall.  Over 50 (mainly members) attended.  Chris Reed was elected chairman for the night.  He explained that a meeting had been called due to the reluctance of the Burra Branch Committee to convene a general meeting.  The purpose was to discuss National Trust Burra affairs and the Passport.  He insisted the meeting be conducted in an open and transparent manner and that the outcome should indicate a clear path forward.\n\nHe reviewed the meeting of 21 February at the Court House, which had an unsatisfactory outcome.  He established that the committee had not taken notice of the concerns of the rank and file members and long term residents concerning the proposed changes to the Burra Passport made by the committee.  The Regional Council of Goyder has received a draft Memorandum of Understanding from National Trust SA to promote and develop the Burra Passport in its present form.  The Council is ready to sign, pending the outcome of this meeting.\n\nNational Trust SA Council Members also attended and they took minutes and recommendations back to the SA National Trust Council meeting held last Thursday.\n\nThat meeting passed the following recommendations:\n\nMaintenance reports in respect of Goyder Council properties leased to the National Trust be provided to the State Office by the Burra Branch and then forwarded to Goyder Council.\n\nGlenys Carse, Chairman of the Regions’ & Branches’ Committee become a member of the Burra Branch sub-committee and a member of the Burra Branch who is not a member of the Burra Branch Committee join the sub-committee, having been chosen by votes of branch members.\n\nBurra Branch Sub-Committee report to National Trust SA Council by 17 May 2008 on recommendations for contractual arrangements for the Burra Passport.\n\nArrangements based on the most recent leases and sales agency agreements remain in place until new arrangements are endorsed, except that the National Trust be released from maintenance obligations for Council owned sites for the period for which the Goyder Council has retained its share of the Passport income.\n\nChris Reed has recommended that a further general meeting be called as soon as possible to elect a member to the sub-committee.

Life in Cold Blood is the first documentary to show footage of the pigmy bluetongue lizards in their burrows, including mothers and their young.  The level of parental care shown by them is unusual in reptiles.  The lizard is a small brown skink about 10 cm long and was thought to be extinct for decades until one was discovered in the stomach of a brown snake in 1992.  A search subsequently found several small colonies across the Mid North and so far 24 colonies have been found from Auburn to Peterborough.

She grew up on the land and attended World's End School and Methodist Church.  She left school finishing her Primary education and gaining her QC at 14.  She worked on her parents' property and her life on the land was Jessie's greatest love, riding her horse (often bareback) over the hills mustering sheep, fencing etc.  As long as Jessie was outdoors she was happy.  She played tennis, joined the district's social activities; there were many social gatherings at the Burra Creek.  Jessie also loved dancing and would ride her horse to a friend's place, get in the dray and go to dances in the district.  On her return she would mount her horse and head for home.  In November of 1932 Jessie married Edmund Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church, Burra and honeymooned at Broken Hill.  On their return they settled on a property at Baldina east of Burra.  There she worked with her husband milking cows, farming and sheep work.  Ted died in 1962 and Jessie continued to live and work on her property with help when she needed it.  She was a very hard working determined woman, who would not let anything or anyone beat her.  Jessie's parents, Sam and Liz Finch returned to Burra.  With failing health, Jessie brought her parents to her home and cared for them.  Liz died in June 1961 aged 82.  With the help of friends, she cared for her father until he was hospitalised.  He died in 1963 aged 90.  With help Jessie continued working hard, loading bales of hay on her ute, feeding her sheep, checking her dams, windmills and fences almost daily.  Driving her ute around her paddocks was her great love.  Jessie would skin and cut up kangaroos to feed her dogs and cats, make a dog cake every week and feed her cats bread and milk.  She was always there to help out her neighbours.  The kettle was always on the boil and a meal on the table for all who called.  Jessie Rooke was a true, hard-working, honest and trusting woman of the land she loved so passionately.’ Jessie May Rooke Elizabeth Finch Samuel Finch Edmund Rooke Ted Sam Finch Liz Finch World's End World's End School Kooringa Methodist Church Burra Broken Hill Baldina death obituary rural life",

It had its origins in 1997 when John & Suzy Tilley offered the use of ‘Petherton’ to raise funds for the restoration of Sir Hubert Wilkins' homestead.  Over the next five years the natural amphitheatre of the old orchard at ‘Petherton’ was the setting for ever growing audiences.  The profits exceeded $20,000.  When the restoration was completed the venue moved to the open cut at the Burra Mine with the permission of the National Trust who lease the site, the Goyder Council sho own it and Adchem who own the access to the Mine Pool.  It has since been a bi-annual event, but organisers now feel that with 50% of patrons being first time visitors, it could become annual.  Profits could go towards reconstruction of the buddle pits near the resited Peacock’s Chimney.  Another possible project would be the rebuilding of the boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s Engine House, as an interpretive centre.  AGL are keen to commit to sponsorship and the event is planned to run again next February.

If so, who is the faceless architect of this scheme?  A properly informed rethink of this plan is urgently needed before it is set in concrete.  The country hospital is a vital part of the fabric of a town.  They have been so through good years and bad.  In an outbreak of disease or an epidemic the local level is best at handling it.  The presence of a hospital does much to influence decisions to relocate to a country town.  The city hospital system is overloaded, so why increase pressure on it by bringing in country people who could be treated locally?  Why destroy a system that works?  The proposal would increase reliance on the very expensive helicopter retrieval service.  The Burra Hospital is on the list of proposed closures.  It serves a town with an enormous amount of heavy traffic passing through and accidents are not unusual.  There is an increase in wind farm activity and mining, with attendant possible accidents.  It lies west of a vast area of sparsely populated pastoral land where people are exposed to hazardous situations and have often been saved by the presence of a local hospital.  The Government wastes its money on dumb non-essential staff.  Essentials must come first and country hospitals are essential.  They and their allied services must be retained.

Approximately 450 people attended and 13 young bands competed with three headline and supporting acts.  The profit is still being collated, but is likely to be just over $3,000, which will go towards to running costs of Rob Fest 09.\n\nOn 15 May four YAC members and I were involved in filming a DVD for the Office of Youth for the Local Government Association and we received the assistance of the Goyder CEO, John Brak, and of the BCS Principal, Jim Lowe.  An aim of the project was to look at what facilities and initiatives are available for young people and to find out why so many are leaving country areas.  YAC also assisted with the Emergency Risk Management mail-out.  YAC holds an elective at BCS on Friday afternoons to survey and work on ideas and initiatives for youth in the area.

He made a career of shearing sheep by travelling all over the state, but said the season had now dropped to eight months from eleven.  Expenses in living away from home range from $20 to $35 a day so no one is keen to work away in contract sheds.  Fewer young people are taking up the job.  Roustabouts are even harder to find.  It is hard physical work and not well paid.  There is no holiday or sick pay or a guaranteed weekly income.  The money is very appealing for young workers, but when they get older they can earn better wages.  To keep men on the job you need to find them jobs when work is short.  Mr O’ Bryan started at 16 and became a gun shearer, going from 40 wethers a day to 200 or more.  His best was 333. Shane O’Bryan Mr O’ Bryan Burra industry shearing employment",

      "content": "The Arrival of the Talbot Car in July has prompted the Burra History Group to gather some information on the journey and those involved.  Mr Aunger (1878-1953) has a Burra connection.  As early as June 1900 he visited Burra and won a 2 mile cycle race and by 1907 he was famous as a champion cyclist.  In 1910 Murray Aunger Ltd of Adelaide established a branch garage in Burra that operated until he left the company in 1917.  In this period (c. 1913) he built the body of a Newton Bennett car for Dr J.I. Sangster [Jnr] of Burra.  The doctor died soon after taking delivery of it and Mr C.B. Warnes purchased it and used it for pulling scrub at Woolgangi.  Les Warnes and his brother Charley are nephews of C.B. Warnes and recall using the vehicle for rabbit shooting expeditions.  The car passed to Les in 1936 when he was 14.  It was then used as a farm working vehicle, though in 1940 he drove it to Adelaide for a veteran car rally.  The car was restored by Ian Tilbrook of Adelaide in 1970.  The foot brake operates on the tail shaft, which means braking is minimal.\n\n[Photo of Les Warnes and the car outside Burra Town Hall.]\n\nThe Talbot will be in Burra on 3 & 4 July.

The photos and some other documents were handed to Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group.  Meredith then set about finding out what she could of the journey.  Essington Lewis had two directors of BHP as companions; Harold Darling and Walter Duncan and a friend Robert Meares, who was later a director.  Even though the journey had been done before, it was still rare to see cars in Central Australia and supplies of petrol had to be sent on ahead.  For the journey two six cylinder Dort cars were prepared and modified to cope with rough roads and sandy patches.  The Burra History Group has organised a display in the Burra Town Hall of the photographs of the cars along with pictures of some of the homesteads on the route and of the terrain.

      "content": "Leo Robinson: An interesting life.\n\nAt 16 Leo moved from Adelaide to Lilydale Station near Broken Hill, but after two years with sheep decided he would like to try his hand at cattle.\n\nIn 1952 on a visit to Adelaide, he approached Sir Sidney Kidman’s office and was offered a job on Glengyle Station, north of Birdsville, to be part of a four man team driving 900 head of cattle from Durrie Station near Birdsville to Marree.  The team utilised 30-40 horses to ride and to carry supplies as packhorses.  The five week trip in November and December averaged about 10 miles [16 km] a day.  Each man had a bedroll and each undertook night shifts of 2½ to 3 hours watching the cattle to prevent them from straying.  Artesian water from bores was relied upon en route for all needs.  These bores were thirty miles [48 km] apart, meaning the cattle would go two days without water and making them hard to handle when they eventually smelt the next supply.  Firewood was very scarce and its lack gave the cook an excuse to feed them on salted meat and damper – yabbies from dams were an occasional treat.  Mulka Store halfway down the track was the only shop and it provided luxuries like tobacco and Kraft cheese.  From Marree the cattle were railed to Adelaide.  Leo undertook many trips down the Birdsville Track in the 1950s.  He also worked on stations when anything up to 30 men would be employed, where now the property is run by only two.  After his first trip Leo returned to Adelaide for Christmas and returned north by hitching a ride with legendary mailman Tom Kruse.

It has been a common practice as a way to reduce the incidence of fly-strike on Merino sheep.\n\nA US-based animal rights organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has campaigned against it as cruel and inhumane.\n\nThe campaign threatened the livelihood of wool producers and the entire wool industry in Australia.\n\nThe Australian Wool & Sheep Industry Task Force has decided to phase out the practice by 2010.\n\nInformation sessions in the area have been well attended.\n\nOne alternative being used is fly-strike chips.  These are attached to the skin normally removed by mulesing and restrict the blood flow.  This causes the skin to wither.  It and the biodegradable chips then fall off in a couple of weeks.\n\n[The process is named after J.H.W. Mules an Australian farmer who died in 1946.

He stresses that no decision had been made on the future of the Burra Caravan Park.  While the park is presently financially sustainable, there is increasing pressure to upgrade the facilities.  It is therefore responsible to review its operations.  The seeking of expressions of interest in transferring the business and assets from the Council is part of that review.  (The sale of the land is not included.)  Council had adopted a recommendation from the Paxton Square Cottages Community Committee to move to short term rental to maximise income once existing arrangements had expired on 31 August 2008.  This resulted in the employment of an on-site manager to operate the cottages for short term rental on the Council’s behalf from 1 September 2008 to 30 June 2009.  The Council will be in abetter position to assess the sustainability of the cottages early in 2009 and will consult with the Community prior to making any decision.

Concern was greatest about Paxton Square Cottages and it became clear that there had been a lack of communication between the Council and the community on that issue.  The transparency of the way the Council was handling the Burra Caravan Park issues was also questioned by a number of people.  Mr Mattey was quick to answer many of the questions.  There was popular support for ongoing public consultation.\n\nHelen Szuty considered it had been a constructive and productive night, though she was not confident that the community had really been heard.

      "content": "Burra Cycling Race\n\nHeld every year since 1907 except for gaps during WWI, WWII and the early 1950s.  The first race from Burra to Adelaide of 110 miles ended at the City Baths (Adelaide Festival Theatre site).  In the early years Burra to Adelaide races alternated with Adelaide to Burra races.  With the advent of traffic lights in the city the race could no longer terminate there and other courses were devised, finishing at Uley Road, Elizabeth, but again traffic conditions forced further change and since 1985 loops starting and finishing in Burra have been devised.  The 100 km 2008 Megafert Burra Classic was won by Reuben Menaud-Young.\n\n[This article is a mixture of incorrect and misleading statements.  I have not done the research needed for a definitive description of the history of the event, but a few points from reports in the Burra Record will indicate some of the problems in accepting the above.\n\n1.  In 1947 the Burra Mayor is reported as saying that he hoped that some day the race would be run from Adelaide to Burra – perhaps in the following year.  He would hardly be saying that if the race had been alternating its direction from ‘the early years’.  There was a period from 1948 when a roughly alternating pattern emerged.\n\n2.  There were gaps during WWI & WWI – though not for all of the war years.\n\n3.  There was a significant gap between 1925 and 1933 when the race was replaced by routes that did not include Burra, as listed (with winners) below:\n\n1925\tC. Hutton\t(96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1926\tH. Opperman\t(96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1927\tF. Arthur\t(108 miles: Kapunda-Waterloo-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1928\tA. Smith\t(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1929\tH. Opperman\t(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1930\tF. Kennewell\t(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)\n\n1931\tA. James\n\n1932\tK. Synnett\t(155 miles: Adelaide-Kadina-Pt Pirie)\n\n1933\tJ. Ryan\t\t(60 miles: Adelaide-Templers-Adelaide)\n\n4.  In the 1950s the picture is more complex.  The race was held 1950-52 and in 1953 the Burra-Adelaide race was stage three of the three-day ‘Advertiser Tour’.  In 1954 & 1955 The ‘Advertiser Tour’ passed through Burra, but the local paper’s report suggests it was not a Burra-Adelaide race.  The Adelaide-Burra event was revived in 1956 by the Goodwood Cycling Club.  The Norwood Club’s involvement came rather later.\n\n5.  The finishing point in or near Adelaide did not just move to Elizabeth when traffic lights appeared in the city centre.  Work is needed on this, but it had a number of finishing points – one Burra Record report has an end point at the Windmill Hotel at Enfield and another ended at Modbury.\n\n6.  A bit of research could probably establish the routes and winners and very likely the times and distances too, but until this is done we will just have to beware of accepting unchecked reports.] Reuben Menaud-Young C.

Her chance meeting with Eric Fuss resulted in endless hours of joint effort on town and family history.  Meredith started a small website, which soon attracted questions from people with family connections to Burra and the district.  One such enquiry came from Rosemary Ros, now living in North Carolina.  She wanted some information on the Pearce Family of Pearce’s Building in Commercial Street.  She was so grateful for the help received that she offered to set up a new website for The Burra History Group.  This now provides information on a broad range of topics and is an invaluable research tool, especially for those living interstate or overseas.  Eric Fuss has been summarising every copy of the Burra Record from 1876 to 1976 [actually 1977].  So far the years 1876-1956 have been noted [except for a few years for which the hard copy is missing] and the years 1876-1940 have been published on a CD – equivalent to some 5,000 A4 pages.  The Burra History Group appreciates any photo or document from the past so that it can be preserved digitally.  Meredith is currently collecting photographs on Burra’s servicemen and women.  Since 2005 the Burra History Group has maintained an extensive display of historical photographs in the refurbished Burra Town Hall and this is open free to the public.  In 2007 with a grant from the Goyder Council they purchased a computer to aid family history research and to store all relevant records/documents and photographs they could find.  The group strives to preserve Burra’s history for generations to come.

The Cornwall & West Devon Site was World Heritage Listed in 2006.\n\nAbandoned Mines Project senior geologist Greg Drew said such recognition would bring tangible socio-economic benefits to the region.

National listing is a necessary first step.  After that national government support would be necessary.  A Mining Heritage Working Party has been set up.

      "content": "Supporters  of World Heritage Listing for the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape have approached the SA Heritage Council, which is now preparing a nomination to have the Sa Cornish Mining Site – incorporating Burra & Moonta Mines – on the National Heritage Listing with the view of then proceeding to the World Heritage Tentative List.  The Cornwall & West Devon Site was World Heritage Listed in 2006.\n\nAbandoned Mines Project senior geologist Greg Drew said such recognition would bring tangible socio-economic benefits to the region.  It would draw conservation funding and international tourism.  The ultimate aim is to have a Transnational World Heritage Listing including Cornwall-West Devon, South Australia, Mexico, Spain and South Africa; all of which have Cornish mining sites.  National listing is a necessary first step.  After that national government support would be necessary.  A Mining Heritage Working Party has been set up.  Heritage officials will visit Burra and Moonta Mines 3-4 November and community meetings will be included.  Keynote speakers will be two English experts on Cornish mining heritage:\n\nProfessor Phillip Payton, Professor of Cornish & Australian Studies and Director of the Institute of Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter.\n\nBarry Gamble from the Cornwall County Council.

      "content": "Burra’s Unicorn Brewery has been revived after a 106 year absence and will soon be quenching the thirst of Burra, Adelaide and SA drinkers generally.  The original brewery was established as the Unicorn Brewery in 1873 by William Banks and closed in 1902 under the ownership of the Walkerville Brewery, when strict licensing laws spelt the end of many of SA’s independent breweries.  The new company will produce a Classic Pale Ale (5% alcohol) and a Miners’ XXX Stour (6.2% alcohol), with three other varieties to be added soon.  The beer will be available in bottles and on tap at Burra hotels and elsewhere across the state.  The company occupies offices in part of the original buildings and will use the bluestone cellars for functions and events.  The beer is currently being made in Sydney and Adelaide, but the management is assessing sites for building its own brewery.  In its heyday the old brewery supplied beer to a wide area of SA, transporting it by rail throughout the Mid North and to Broken Hill.\n\nCelebrations to mark the re-establishment will be held on Sunday 16 November and will include a street parade starting at 11.15 a.m. and ending at the old brewery cellars, where the official opening ceremony will take place.  A highlight will be the Unicorn Brewery’s team of Clydesdale horses.  The SA Pipes and Drums will lead the parade with Highland Dancers, followed by floats and other groups and a district band.  The SA Pipes and Drums will hold a concert in the Town Hall on Friday at 7.40 p.m. After the opening, fine ales and stout will be available, along with wines and soft drinks.  Food will also be available in the Burra Creek picnic area.\n\nThe Season.  The outlook is grim after a promising start.  Six weeks ago it grew dry and now there is no subsoil moisture.  Canola has also been adversely affected by high winds.  Many crops are being cut for hay, although it is really too early, but there is no chance now of further improvement.  In addition fertilizer costs have at least trebled.

A Goyder Heritage grant of $1,000 paid for paint, but the results come from the thousands of dollars of in-kind volunteer labour.  The Burra History Group members have organised the remounting and framing of photographs of ten of the town’s former mayors, which now add historic interest to the room.  The remaining mayors’ photographs will be added in due course.  The old lodge room has seen the addition of a display of lodge regalia and an early town streetlamp, donated by Bob Perry of ‘Gaslight’, for which Roy Taplin made a replica lamp post.  Chairperson Meredith Satchell said that there had been 7,686 visitors for the year and they had donated $3,311.  Many of them were interstate visitors.

Brewery Director Jason Watters then led a majestic white ‘unicorn’.  [Photo.]\n\nAt the Brewery Rev. Michael Hillier blessed the unicorn, the people and the brewery.  Rowan Ramsey Federal MP for Grey then declared the Unicorn Brewery open and the crowd then enjoyed the beer, food and the rest of the day’s activities.  There was a barbecue and pancakes in the adjacent picnic area.\n\nAccording to Mr Watters the low carb ‘Horny Blonde’ was popular with all, but especially the ladies.  Men were somewhat more drawn to the Miners XXX Stout.  Unicorn Pale Ale, he said, was more of a favourite with drinkers from the urban area.  Sales exceeded expectations and the firm donated a carton of beer to be auctioned to raise funds for the McGuiness/McDermott Foundation for Children with Cancer.

Pip Edson, as chairperson of the Burra Regional Art Gallery writes urging support for the spending of a recently allocated $100,000 from the federal government’s Regional & Local Community Infrastructure Program, on upgrading the exteriors of the Burra Town Hall and Regional Art Gallery, to enhance what are already two magnificent historically significant buildings.  A 1978 plan contemplated landscaped and planted areas and access roads.  Consultants in 2003 proposed a plan for loading and disabled access.  Neither plan has been implemented, and the completion of these ideas would fall well within the guidelines of the Infrastructure Program.  Roy Taplin’s work in painting and renovation amounts to $65,440 of in-kind input, so the $100,000 of federal funding seems a fair return for the preservation of the buildings and grounds for the enjoyment of future generations.

An appeal is made for photographs, especially of the period after 1975.  They would be kept only briefly for scanning and then returned.

After completing his apprenticeship and working at the shop for more than five years he and Mel went to Canada where his love and expert ability in handling horses saw him spend time on a working cattle ranch outside Calgary.  Missing the warmer weather and with Mel pregnant with their son, Cash, the couple returned to Burra.  Casey became an accredited crane driver and was working for Clare Crane Hire when he heard that Gary McPhee had sold his Clare store.  He approached Gary about the possibility of buying the Burra store.  The couple are determined to maintain the long tradition of a high quality meat store that has been an institution in the mid-north for more than 22 years.  As well as acquiring the business Casey has taken on the training of third year apprentice Cameron Daniels and first year apprentice Rory Muir.  Gary & his wife Joanne have eased the new owners into the job over the last few months and the official transfer took place from 12 January.

The Burra hotel has traditionally hosted a rock ’n’ roll dance on the Friday before the main event on Saturday.  Publican Bill Overell says they still intend to have a live band that night and they hope locals will support the event.  The hotel has for some time had a live band every Friday, but rising costs for bands and lack of patronage have seen this now cut to a fortnightly show and if things don’t improve the whole issue of live music will have to be reconsidered.

      "content": "Notice.  A full page notice carrying the logo of the Regional Council of Goyder and carrying the Council’s name boldly across the bottom lists the seven proposed resolutions from the Ratepayers Action Group for the forthcoming ‘Meeting of Electors’\n\nIssue 1 related to rates.  It was concerned about the high level of rates generally and the disparity across the different towns, and called for a general review of rates, especially for Hallett in the light of the wind farm development.  Generally wanted more transparency and objected to the proposal to seek heavier fines for late payment of rates.\n\nIssue 2 related to Paxton Square and contained a complex list of clauses aimed generally at keeping the cottages in public ownership, securing their preservation and development as a community asset in the tourist industry.\n\nIssue 3 concerned Burra Caravan Park.  The general desire here was to preserve and maintain the existing park with its ideal location and that any proposal to develop another park should be in addition.  Overflow could be accommodated at the Burra Showgrounds.   It also lists desirable upgrading at the caravan site.\n\nIssue 4 was the Burra Swimming Pool.  The resolution asks that Council acknowledge it is a valuable community asset that must be maintained and improved.\n\nIssue 5 related to Council transparency and accountability.  This sought to see the Mayor and Deputy Mayor abandon this title on the grounds that it incorrectly implies that the office is elected by ratepayers generally.  There is a general call for better communication, more active engagement with ratepayers, better and more timely availability of papers, minutes etc.  The call in general applies as much to Council staff as to Councillors.  [Much more detail of course in the lengthy motion.]\n\nIssue 6 about Goyder Sports & Community Centre.  The general thrust was against this going ahead, but if it were to proceed then only after very clear and valid approval from Eudunda Ward ratepayers and with careful provisos to ensure that any subsequent liabilities fall on the Eudunda Ward – even if subsequently ward structures aru changed or abolished.\n\nIssue 7 concerned Representation Review.  The request here was that the 2005 Representation Review and background documents be made publicly available and the SA Electoral Commission audit the Council Roll to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.\n\n[The resolutions are very detailed and take up most of the page in fine print.]\n\n[The apparent attribution of this notice to the Regional Council of Goyder was a gross error on the part of the paper.  They attempted to undo the damage by a letter drop to homes almost immediately and, of course, by an apology in the next issue.  The responsibility for the notice should have been attributed to the Regional Council of Goyder Ratepayers Action Group.] Regional Council of Goyder Ratepayers Action Group Paxton Square Hallett Burra Burra Showgrounds Eudunda Ward SA Electoral Commission council rates representation review community transparency development",

In December 2007 he found a shed that was previously used by the old Highways Department and after nine months of red tape and supporting phone calls district ranger to the new owners, the Department of Environment and Heritage, a five year lease was arranged.  Donations and a grant from the Community Benefits SA Program, Regional Council of Goyder and a Seniors Grant enabled the shed to open for business.  Assistance with paper work was given by leisure activities co-ordinator Verna Saunders and by John Monten, both of Lower North Health.  John assisted with securing the grants and in supplying occupational health and safety equipment.  Some of the activities to be carried out will be woodwork, metal work, painting and restoration of furniture and some electrical and computing help.  There are currently 23 members.  So far the shed has made toilet surrounds for Jazz in the Monster Mine, two plinths for the Burra Art Gallery and some large-scale wooden toys.

In view of the extensive work it has done at Eudunda in the recycling and re-use of treated waste water from the sewage treatment plant onto the oval, gardens and in the future onto the golf course, it was agreed to the introduction of a similar project for Burra.  Council asset manager Trevor Wood says Burra has about 15 megalitres available annually from its treatment system.   Designs are being prepared for a filter and chlorination system so the water can then be pumped through a pipeline to irrigate the oval, caravan park gardens, Market Square lawns and gardens and other areas as they become available.  As an interim measure bore water will be piped to Market Square next week to enable lawns to be better watered and better managed.  This will be replaced with recycled water when it becomes available. Trevor Wood Burra Eudunda Market Square infrastructure water council environment",

Nine of the historic trees will be taken out, having been assessed as unable to recover.  The decision has not been taken lightly and time was given to see if they would regrow.  Some people are allergic to the fine hairs in their seeds, so the continued planting of this species has not been recommended by the Landscape architects commissioned in 2005 to oversee the Council’s street tree program.  The existing trees in Morehead St have been there for about 60 years.  It is proposed to replace the nine trees with Kurrajongs.  Pruning of other dead branches will also be done and further removals may be necessary where recovery is unsuccessful.

He had died following a heart attack the previous week aged 57.  He had played junior football at Redhill and then played for North Adelaide.  In the SANFL he played 220 games and took part in North’s premierships in 1971 & 1972. He was then captain for two seasons and won the best & fairest awards in 1974 & 1977.  Throughout his SANFL career Barry travelled each week from the family property at Koolunga for training and the matches.  After retiring from North Adelaide in 1981 he played briefly for the Proprietary Football Club Pt Pirie before becoming playing coach of Brinkworth/Yacka in its final year 1984.  He was the playing mentor for Brinkworth/Yacka/Spalding for the two years it existed.  When the Brinkworth/Spalding/Redhill club was formed in 1987 he became its coach, retiring in 1994 after seeing them to four premierships.

There were guided tours on both Saturday and Sunday, starting in the foyer of the Goyder Council office, which houses an exhibition of fossilised bones from the Diprotodon supplied by the SA Museum.  National Parks & Wildlife Ranger, Kate Burton, gave a brief explanation of what they could expect to see before participants joined the bus.  At Red Banks Adelaide palaeontologist Aaron Camens explained the importance of the Red Banks site and what work had been carried out to date.  At the dig site visitors could see amateur and professional archaeologists working to find the remaining bones needed to complete the skeletal remains of a Diprotodon.    The diprotodon was Australia’s largest marsupial, living in the Burra area a mere 10,000 years ago.  They weighed in at one to two tonnes and stood two metres tall and three metres long.   They are so named because they had two distinctive tusk-like incisors: di (two), proto (front) and don (tooth).  They were well adapted to grinding up coarse tough foliage.  They are believed to have eaten 100 to 150 kg of vegetation a day.  They died out about 60,000 years ago.

There are places in the street where trees have already died and not been replaced.  Additional mature trees could be planted to fill these gaps.    Street trees improve amenity, contribute to higher property values and provide habitat for birds and native animals such as possums.  It is commendable that the council’s heritage advisor was consulted.  All that remains is for the local affected residents to be consulted.

As well as the competing bands the audience heard last year’s winners The Secret Game and the Adelaide band Granny Flat.  Second place went to Strike X and there was an encouragement award for Clare band Best Before.

The elected members of the Goyder Council will now have to decide what form of any community centre will be constructed.  The planning for the $8.3 million dollar centre has cost many thousands of dollars.  The rejection occurred at a meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey at which two questions were put to the Eudunda residents:\n\nDo the Eudunda Ward electors approve of a Council loan or loans up to $2.5 million to assist in the cost of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre and\n\nDo the Eudunda Ward electors approve the reimbursement to Council by way of a levy on the future Eudunda Ward rates, of any financial shortfall, if any, in the construction and operation of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre?\n\nMr Mattey acknowledged the hard work put in by the Eudunda Community Business & Tourism Committee (EC-BaT) and gave a balanced approach to the issue.  Then several people voiced their opinions for or against.  After an amendment requesting a secret ballot was passed it took more than an hour to conduct the proceedings.  A total of 292 voted with the results:\n\nQuestion 1: 140 yes, 151 no and 1 informal.\n\nQuestion2: 103 yes, 186 no and 3 informal.\n\n[Photo of meeting and of Ratepayers Action Group (RAG) spokesperson, Helen Szuty]\n\nRAG spokesperson, Helen Szuty, said the group was happy with the democratic process as the meeting.  She could not respond to questions about RAG at the meeting because she was not a Eudunda Ward elector, but stressed that Rag was in the process of becoming incorporated and welcomed members from all over the Goyder Council area.  She hoped that ECBaT would not be discouraged by the result, but would work to achieve more modest upgrades to community facilities.

Damage to his brain resulted in blurry vision and a very slight speech delay, but he is expected to make a full recovery after a further 12 months of rehabilitation.  Many members of the Burra Brigade, along with crew members who were on deployment at the time of the accident, were present at the Burra CFS Station to welcome Mr Kleinig home, together with CFS chief Officer Euan Ferguson and CFS Volunteers Assoc. CEO, Wendy Shirley.  A scheduled media conference drew a contingent of cameras, recorders and journalists from various networks.  Mr Kleinig said the actual events were more of an ordeal for his family, as he could not remember anything from about two hours before the accident.  Fellow members Ross Haustorfer from Terowie and Geoff Millard from Georgetown said the burnt-out tree that struck Mr Kleinig was about eight inches around, but stood up to eight feet off the ground.  Mr Kleinig thanked all those who had rescued him on the day and the medical professionals who had since provided care as well as all the well-wishers who had sent cards etc.  Mr Kleinig had been bed-ridden for quite a while and is still recovering strength and fitness.  He looks forward to gradually taking his place in the brigade as is health allows.  He was part of the last wave of SA CFS volunteers deployed in Victoria.

The National Bank on Market Street and the Bon Accord Mine Buildings are 150 years old this year.  The Burra History Group will mark the occasion with a photographic display in the Town Hall from 22 to 31 May, open daily.  On Saturday the Burra Branch of the National Trust will stage a free family day at the Bon Accord Mine Buildings.  The first bank in Burra was a temporary branch of the National Bank which opened in 1859.  Before then payment at the Mine was by money orders.  The bank still trades in Burra from its premises erected in 1862 to a Georgian design, possibly by Edmund Wright.  It reflects the prosperity of the mining town at the time and cost the then substantial sum of $3,000.\n\nThe Bon Accord Mine site contains buildings from two different eras representing very different functions: coper mining and the town water supply.  The Bon Accord Mine site was acquired in 1846 by speculators from Aberdeen, Scotland.  Despite hopes that the Burra Mine’s rich lodes would persist to the north, no ore was discovered and by 1849 mining had been abandoned.  Another attempt was made in 1858 and in 1859 mine offices, a blacksmith’s forge, a carpenter’s shop and a manager’s residence were erected.  These buildings survive.  This mining venture also failed and work was stopped in 1862.  Between 1884 and 1905 the town’s water supply was obtained from one of the Bon Accord Mine’s shafts.  From 1905 the pumping of water moved to the mine’s main shaft and buildings in wood and corrugated iron were erected there.  This remained the town’s water supply till 1966 when Burra was connected to the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline at Hanson and was supplied with River Murray water.  Since 1977 the Bon Accord Mine Site has been owned by the National Trust and now houses a mining display and the manager’s residence is available as visitor accommodation.\n\n[Photo of National Bank building in Market St taken in about 1890.\n\nAnd a photo of one of the Bon Accord Mine buildings.]\n\nThe paper also reports the Burra Record’s article from 4 November 1958 on the Centenary of the National Bank and the 99th anniversary of its establishment in Burra.  The Advertiser of 6 May 1859 page 3 reported that the opening of the National Bank in Burra had been a great success and had improved the circulation of money in Burra.  Cash had replaced the money orders from the mine and the smelting works.  It was reported that nearly all the principal tradespersons had transferred their accounts and savings to the bank.  The affability of the manager has also tended to the success of the ‘Little Bank’.

It will officially be launched by Professor David Walker of Deakin University at the Burra Town Hall on 8 June.  Professor Walker says the fascinating history of Burra is beautifully told in the text and photographs assembled by Eric Fuss and Meredith Satchell.  While the book does the old town proud their history tells a larger story of settlement, adaptation to hard climate and historical change.  Prof. Walker described it as a visual treat and a pleasure to read.    Meredith Satchell, President of the Burra History Group, said that Ian Auhl’s popular Burra & District, a Pictorial Memoir, first published 34 years ago, is now out of print and this is the first book of the type to be printed since then.  If it were not for the generosity of the District Council of Goyder, the Burra Visitor Centre, The Burra branch of the National Trust, the Burra Community Library and two individual donors the History Group would not have been able to fund the first print run of 200.  The 246 page book with 64 in colour is in A$ format and sells for $50 [sic: error for $55.]\n\n[Photo of the compilers.] Professor David Walker Eric Fuss Meredith Satchell Ian Auhl Burra Burra Town Hall Deakin University publication history community book launch",

It will be the fourth AGL wind farm in the area after Hallett 1 at Brown Hill, Hallett 2 at Mt Bryan and the 63 turbines planned for Stage 4 at North Brown Hill.  There was a public meeting on the issue at Hallett Town Hall on Thursday and 71 written submissions were also received.  Of the submissions 23 were in favour and 45 against, with 3 being neutral.  The company QED was asked by Council to prepare an independent planning assessment.  It reported that while the development satisfied many planning provisions it did not warrant favourable consideration by the DAP because of significant visual impact.  Other negative impacts would be the lowering of property values, constantly flashing red lights at night and the construction of new overhead power lines.  Many also gave strong support to the concept.  Landowners involved, Tony & Kathi Sumner and David & Jo Gebhardt, were supporters of the development.  The final decision of the committee was made behind closed doors, a decision questioned by Mayor and Hallett Ward Councillor Peter Mattey, who also reminded the panel that its decision would have to be defended by sitting members of Council.

She arrived from England in 1876 on the Oaklands where she served as a nurse for passengers.  Instead of returning to England as planned, she agreed to go to Burra where a trained nurse was required.  She arrived to very primitive conditions with the hospital was a converted hotel.  Her first meal was served on the end of the kitchen table from a tin plate and pannikin, while the cook washed up on the other end of the table.  An early achievement was the use of china for staff and patients.  Domestic arrangements were crude, with waste materials thrown into a disused shaft on the hospital grounds.  When she first arrived she was disturbed by the constant noise of the stamps (ore crushers) but this did not last long, as the mine closed soon after her arrival.  Little surgical equipment was available and when an emergency arose and a saw was needed the kitchen meat saw was used to amputate a man’s leg.  Operations took place on the old bar counter.    When a typhoid epidemic broke out during the building of the railway to Terowie patients were so numerous that beds were made up on the floor of the old bar.  Gradually the situation improved.  The bar became the women’s ward and the long room became the men’s ward.  Smaller rooms were used for domestic purposes.  After two years Nurse Watson decided not to return to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in England, where she had been trained, but instead to marry C.C. Williams of Burra.  A short time after her marriage the Burra Hospital purchased its first surgical instruments and Dr Brummitt came and took her to see them. Alice Peak Gertrude Williams Catherine Watson C.C.

Each trainee was introduced to the various tools required in rescue before the group was divided into teams for a series of rescue scenarios.  Everyone had to handle the heavy hydraulic equipment regardless of size, height or age and by the end their brisk steps had become a lethargic shuffle and lifting even a water bottle was a struggle.

To celebrate this event Burra History Group has set up a display of historic photos and information on the postal services in the district over the years.  A postal service to Burra began in 1846 with the office then being the accountant’s office at the Burra Mine.  The town got a fine post office building in 1861, now the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The present Burra Post Office was built in 1960.  The local staff joined in the spirit of the bicentenary by dressing up in period costume for a day.

Group spokesperson, Helen Szuty said they were seeking discussion concerning the council’s consultation process on the document.  Many issues were discussed at Meetings of Electors and fifty resolutions were carried at the Burra Ward Meeting of Electors, she said.  At last Tuesday’s meeting Councillors spent 40 minutes discussing issues contained in a budget summary and then resolved not to conduct a rate review and to develop a Burra Caravan and Camping Park Plan.\n\nSuch a plan already exists as part of a wider plan adopted in 2004.  Council fulfilled the minimum public consultation requirements of the Local Government Act and its own Public Consultation Policy, hearing a presentation on the business plan by herself and Des Woolley.  Ms Szuty said she raised a number of matters which required further explanation for adequate comprehension and recommended that Councillors defer adoption of the Annual Business Plan until issues raised at Meetings of Electors could be included.  There had been no discussion in Council of the matters raised.  Minutes say the presentations were ‘heard’.  The Local Government Act 1999 requires they be ‘considered’.  The RAG remains dissatisfied at the Council’s response.\n\nCouncil CEO said that the Council had exceeded its own Public Consultation Policy by advertising in four papers and on the Council website with respect to matter.  Copies of the draft Annual Business Plan were available at the Burra & Eudunda offices for 25 days prior to the meeting, rather than the minimum 7 days.  Interested people were invited to attend the council meeting to ask questions and make submissions relating to the plan or to make written submissions relating to it.  No written submissions were received and only two verbal submissions were received at the meeting and those were considered prior to the adoption of the plan.

      "content": "Dulcie (Tiny) Hill nee Bourman is approaching her 95th birthday [on 11 July] and will celebrate the occasion with a small gathering of family and friends.  She credits good living, hard work and a positive attitude for her longevity.  Mrs Hill was born in Ayers St, Burra in a house built by her father.  She was one in a family of five sisters.  She left school aged 13 in order to earn a wage, going to work for Mr & Mrs Marsden at the Burra Record as proof reader and office girl.  She stayed there until the great depression when staff had to be cut.  Tiny was lucky to get a job with Arthur Bence of Bence’s Limited, [drapers and clothiers.]  She said entertainment at the time was sport, choir and local dances.  It was through the Methodist choir that she met her future husband, Johnny Hill.  She was married in 1937 at the Methodist Church and had a daughter, Mary [in 1951.]  The family’s joy was tragically cut short when Mary was killed in a traffic accident in Market Square when just seven years old.  Mr Hill’s tailor shop achieved a high reputation around the state and the couple worked hard both at their business and in community service.  Mrs Hill also recalls the social occasions around the piano in the home of friends around the town.  Bridge was another popular pastime.  Johnny used to play weekly with the butcher, the barber, the publican and the Catholic priest, Mrs Hill recalled.  Mr Hill died some 30 years ago, [actually in 1982] since when Mrs Hill has continued to help others.  A three month overseas trip when she was 70 is a highlight of her life and the holiday of a lifetime.  She relocated to the Chapel Street cottages five years ago and says she has never been happier, with very caring neighbours.

Federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage & the Arts, Peter Garrett, last week announced the Australian Cornish Mining Heritage Site (ACMHS), comprising the Burra & Moonta Mines State Heritage Areas, has been included in the 2009 Finalised Priority Assessment List.  State Environment and Conservation Minister, Jay Weatherill, welcomed the move.  The assessment follows an approach from proponents of the world heritage listing of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape and the South Australian Heritage Council last October, who processed and prepared the nomination for the ACMHS.  The ACMHS contains two areas declared under the SA Heritage Legislation: the Moonta Mines State Heritage Area declared in 1984 and the Burra State Heritage Area declared in 1994.  Both sites have been managed as heritage places under state planning legislation and have active management regimes established by local branches of the National Trust and their local councils.  The ACMHS was formed by extensive 19th century and early 20th century mining operations and contains five distinctively Cornish engine houses, one of the largest concentrations anywhere outside Cornwall.  The site also features a number of other buildings, some in ruins and others intact.  The two adjacent towns contain further elements of Cornish settlement in house forms and institutions such as Methodist Churches and lodge buildings.  Their rich history already forms an important part of their tourism appeal.  National and International listing would add to that tourism potential.  The department for the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will now prepare an assessment on the ACMHS for consideration by the Heritage Council.  It is expected to be completed by June 2011.

Country Health SA and Lower North Health services director Gary Stewart said the trial program for people with cardiac or respiratory problems has been successful and will continue.  The program focuses on physical activity to assist with rehabilitation.  Previously this had involved travel to Clare or Adelaide.  Funding had been by CHSA, but now Burra has access to Multi-Purpose Service funding.  This decision will involve a reduction of one bed in hospital capacity, but this could be reactivated if required.  There is also the opportunity to upgrade the accommodation for some of the nursing home patients, to give better access to bathrooms and toilet facilities.  These improvements will not compromise the number of beds available and are a great outcome.  Darryl Venning, who is a member of the Local Health Advisory Council, has convened the first of a series of local meetings to discuss the present and future health service needs of the Burra Community.  He said many people did not realise Burra Hospital has access to many allied health services, such as mental health, podiatry, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  Speech therapists and opticians come to Burra and work out of the hospital, so it is important that we use what services we have so they can be retained.

The plan was presented by Chris Reed and developed by a group of Burra residents.  It aims to develop the Council-owned tourism assets and bring them under the umbrella of a community-based board.  The current situation shows no strategic direction for such assets as Paxton Square, the Burra Caravan Park, Morphett’s Engine House and the Brewery Cellars.  The assets also suffer from a fragmented approach to long term maintenance.  This has not been helped by Council amalgamation, which has tended to disengage the local community.  The proposal would see the management of the above assets and the Burra Visitor Centre centralised to the old Bible Christian Chapel and controlled by a ‘Burra Foundation’.  This body would then seek investment across government, private and corporate sectors.  Long term lease arrangements for the properties would be established and an appointment process for the board would be set up.  A more sustainable management program for the town’s tourism assets would be developed.  A public meeting of ratepayers would ensure members of the community were able to express their views and to be informed.  There is a need to solve the problem of the outstanding $200,000 debt on Paxton Square Cottages, as the Burra Community Group would not accept responsibility for its repayment.\n Chris Reed Burra Community Group Paxton Square Burra Caravan Park Morphett’s Engine House Brewery Cellars Burra Visitor Centre old Bible Christian Chapel Burra tourism council management debt",

      "content": "Burra Railway Station.  The future of this historic building depends on the success of applications for Federal Government funding and volunteer labour by the local community according to Pip Edson, the spokesperson for the Friends of the Burra Railway Station.  She has been somewhat heartened by a meeting with Dr Claire Smith of the Archaeology Dept. of Flinders University.  Pip has also held discussions with representatives of the indigenous custodians of the land, Vincent Copley and Vincent Branson of the Ngadjuri people, with a view to its becoming an interpretive centre for the history of Burra prior to the arrival of white people.  This would see the site combine a palaeontology display with indigenous people displays and perhaps a bush tucker restaurant.   The Premier, Mike Rann, recently visited the station and expressed an interest in moves to conserve the station.  The building has long been neglected and but for the efforts of Peter Harvey and Roger Cross in securing the lease through the Burra Regional Art Gallery, little would have been done to conserve one of Burra’s more important buildings.  It would never have been allowed to decay as it has, if it had been located in the centre of the town.  The Friends of the Burra Railway Station need volunteers at working bees to combat weeds, help tidy the site and prepare the building for painting.\n\n[Photo of Pip Edson at the Burra Railway Station.] Pip Edson Dr Claire Smith Vincent Copley Vincent Branson Mike Rann Peter Harvey Roger Cross Burra Railway Station Burra heritage conservation volunteers indigenous",

With the help of a crane local tradesmen first removed the cross and the existing timber platform from inside the church tower.  They then installed the first of three section fabricated at Ashmore Engineering, Farrell Flat.  The first piece was a six metre tall base, which fits inside the tower.  Some slight adjustments had to be made to the second stage, which is the transition section from tower to spire.  This delayed operations, which were then completed on Thursday when the spire itself went on relatively easily.  Finally the cross was fitted on top of the spire and secured thought the centre of the structure.  The spire stands about 4.1 metres has been absent for about 40 years.  The original spire was sheet iron on timber and is believed to have been in place for about 60 years.\n\n[Actually St Joseph’s seems to have had a spire from its construction in 1874; at least the earliest photographs from the late 1870s show it with one, though whether this spire was the same one throughout is unknown.]  Father Quin is glad to see the architectural integrity of the building restored and says the parishioners have been quite excited and pleased with its return.  It also looks particularly good when floodlit at night.  He praised the work of Adrian Smith and team at Ashmore engineering and thanked Paul Wilson and his crew for removing the existing material from the tower.\n\nFather Laurie Quinn is pictured in front of the church with Elaine Keogh and Angie Webster.

      "content": "CWA’s 80th Birthday\n\nMary Warnes was a young girl from the city when she married Isaac Warnes [in 1900] and went to live at Koomooloo Station.  Her sister married Thomas William Warnes [at the end of 1900] and lived at Old Koomooloo, some 7 miles away.  They were quite isolated in the days before telephones and with horse transport.  Once a week the sisters rode bicycles to a point about halfway between the two homesteads and had a couple of hours chat over a cup of tea.  This was Mrs Warnes’ only contact with another woman.  Years later the family moved to their ‘inside’ property ‘Wahroonga’ some 12 miles from Burra  and Mrs Warnes thought about making the life of the outback woman less isolated.  At a National Council of Women’s meeting in 1926 Mrs Warnes learnt what had been done in other states by the opening up of women’s rest rooms and this became her goal – a ROOM IN Burra where country wives could rest and relax, tend the baby, make a cup of tea and meet and chat with others on their infrequent trips into town.  In November 1926 Mrs Warnes formed the Burra Country Women’s Service Assoc.  This first organisation at Burra became the first branch of what evolved into the SA Country Women’s Association.    An Adelaide branch with a rest room above a city store followed in 1928.  Other branches followed.  Mrs Warnes served as the State President 1929-41.  In WWII was very active in patriotic activities, notably in providing meals to troops trains in transit from the south to Darwin via Quorn and Alice Springs.  It was also the official camouflage net supplier to the Australian Army.  Other activities of the CWA have included setting up retirement homes at Clare and Quorn, the establishment of hostels and a holiday cottage service.  From the 1960s a changing economy saw more country women taking up paid employment.  SACWA membership fell from 14,500 to fewer than 4,000 in 2000.  Increasing regulation also saw the organisation relinquish many of its accommodation services.  It retains its central headquarters and a hostel and remains as an advocate for country women and their families.  It continues in the 21st century to provide relief in times of recession and natural disasters.  It supports local communities, the Royal Flying doctor Service, funds cancer research and lobbies for better support for the education of country students.  The CWA Café at the Adelaide Royal Show made $48,000 profit last year and Lauke’s scone mix and recipe book are its main fund raisers.  Locally, in 2007, along with many other small branches, the Burra branch in the SACWA Goyder Group closed.  The Southern Goyder Group has since been forced to amalgamate with the former Mt Remarkable Group to form the Frome Group with only eight branches remaining – Orroroo, Morchard, Wilmington, Yunta, Yongala, Jamestown, Booleroo Centre and Murraytown.  The Frome Group is holding a Show Day at Morchard on 19 October.

This was also the occasion for the granting of life membership to Pat and Bob Greet for their many years of service as secretary and assistant secretary.  Both have given countless hours to the maintenance of the showgrounds and to setting up for the show and cleaning up afterwards.  President David Thamm was very pleased to present the life memberships.  As well as the exhibits, the rides were particularly popular. The Ali Baba ride and the V8 simulator car proved especially attractive.  About 20 cars were involved in the ute and car competition along with a static display exhibited by Les Warnes and Roger Cross.  The AGL Min North Shearing Championship was a strong drawcard and reigning Open Champion Daryl Andriske from Blyth successfully defended his title.  The sheep dog trials were enjoyed and the Horses in Action continued a fine tradition.\n\n[Photo of Jordan Quinn, Prince of the Show 2009.] Professor Michael Tyler Pat Greet Bob Greet David Thamm Les Warnes Roger Cross Daryl Andriske Jordan Quinn Burra University of Adelaide Blyth event show competition awards community",

Dress-up clothes have been placed there and have provided many people, both young and old, with some fun and memorable photographs.  The kitchen has been painted and a new floor covering laid.  The Burra Masonic Lodge honour board of former Worshipful Masters has been placed in the History Room.  The hall is open to the public most days from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. [When not booked for functions.]  The Hall could use some more volunteers to welcome visitors when it is open, so anyone with a spare two hours a week would be appreciated.

Members of the National Trust and the Regional Council of Goyder gathered for the occasion.  [National Trust Chairman,] Paul Marsson arrived with the plaque and the material to make it adhere to the stone.  The stone was first erected in 1977 by the National Trust and the site was chosen for its proximity to the place where Thomas Pickett’s shepherd’s hut stood on Diprose Creek, Basin Farm. Pickett’s discovery of copper ore led to the establishment of the Burra Mine in 1845.  Little is known of him except that he was a shepherd and bullock driver and by 1842 was working for William Robinson of Gum Creek Station.  He was barely rewarded for his discovery and it was only after an appeal from the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel that the Mining Association agreed to fund his funeral expenses.

Those making an appearance included Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, John Waters and Charles Tingwell.  Many locals also made an appearance.  The event will also pay tribute to Edward Woodward, who played the lead role of Harry Morant, and who died last week.  The event has been organised by Paul Marsson and Neil Nicholson of the Burra National Trust together with BRTBA.  The film was directed by Bruce Beresford and scooped 10 awards at the 1980 AFI awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  The audience will be treated to a dinner of spit roasted lamb with salad and dessert and Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group has prepared a slideshow presentation of images taken during the filming.  Market Square featured in the film and the whole production helped to put Burra on the tourist map.  Now 107 years after the Morant and Handcock were executed Jim Unkles, a lawyer with 30 years’ experience in military legal matters, has lodged petitions with the House of Representatives and the British Crown for a review of the convictions and sentences.  Lieutenants Morant and Handcock were found guilty of murdering Boer prisoners of war and shot in Pretoria 27 February 1902.  Unkles considers significant errors in the legal proceedings make the convictions and sentences unsafe.  Justice demands a review of the trials, the convictions and the sentences.

      "content": "Burra Tourism\n\nIt has been an exceptional year for Burra tourism.  The Burra Visitor Centre has been filled to capacity on most days in the tourist season.  Burra Heritage Passport sales have increased and hits on www.visitburra.com have reached almost 10,000 per month.  Since March 2009 accommodation sales have gone through the roof with more than double the bookings for March and July than for the same months the previous year.  Burra businesses stand to benefit either directly of indirectly from the influx and Burra residents enjoy a wider range of goods and services than would otherwise be available.  There is a clear need to upgrade the Burra Visitor Centre.  A larger centre would make it possible for clients to browse the information on offer.  The present site cannot provide for more space and has at times become uncomfortable overcrowded.  More shelving would make local produce more readily available also.  It is imperative to have space for visitors to browse the internet for local and regional tourist information.  Parking for coaches and caravans is also a problem.  The Goyder Council is considering the issue and a solution cannot reasonably be long delayed.\n\n[Photo of current Burra Visitor Centre.]  Burra Burra Visitor Centre Goyder Council tourism infrastructure community",

      "content": "Adchem has announced a project to reduce its environmental footprint in 2010.  The company has received a $550,000 Federal Government Grant and will put this towards a $2.45 million project to install a two stage reverse osmosis waste-water treatment plant.  This will allow reduction of CO2 emissions by 10% from the recycling of waste process water with a 55% reduction in the use of mains water and improvements in the efficiency of steam generation.  The higher quality water will allow improved efficiency in boiler operation and steam production.  In 2008 a trial of a reverse osmosis plant was run for about $100,000 and the process was proved feasible.  Once fully operational the plant will generate up to 500,000 litres of high quality water per day for use in boilers, cooling towers and general process needs.   The amount of mine pool water used will also be reduced by about 70%.  The project will see the construction of two 160 x 120 m lined evaporation ponds with a total area of 3.84 ha.\n\nThe Adchem plant was originally built in 1969 and was then designed to process copper ore from the Burra Mine.  Since 1993 the business has been owned by Ausminco Pty Ltd.  It currently employs 49 people and operates a hydro-metallurgical process to convert copper raw materials to high purity chemical products.  Today it operates the world’s largest single production facility for cupric oxide and basic cupric carbonate; producing annually 6,000 to 9,000 tonnes of cupric oxide and 1,000 to 3,000 tonnes of basic copper carbonate.  The project is not expected to see a change in employment or production levels. Ausminco Pty Ltd Adchem plant Burra Mine environment industry water treatment mining",

      "content": "The Anglican Church of St Edmund at Booborowie was officially closed with a special service on 7 February.  Rev. Michael Hillier of Burra delivered the closure document to the final congregation.  Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill, Bishop of Willochra, presided at the service.  Mary Shattock, who had been the organist for many years, presided at the organ for the last time.  The foundation stone of the church was laid by Mrs A. Affolter in 1923 and the church, built to seat 80, was dedicated 20 July 1924.  Before that services had been held in private homes and Booborowie Hall.  Additions to the chancel and vestry were dedicated in 1928 and the church was finally consecrated on 8 November 1929.  [See Burra Record of 27 November 1929.]  The church has not been used for a number of years, but it was thought appropriate that there be a final service of Evensong.  After that a short ceremony of secularisation concluded with the Bishop extinguishing the altar candles and carrying the altar cross from the building.  The furnishings have been removed and the building has been sold, to become a home.  On 6 February 1960 George and Anne Williams of Booborowie were married there and so celebrated their golden wedding the day before the final service.  They spent the last few weeks preparing the building for the service.  After the service the congregation adjourned to the Booborowie Hall Supper Room for a shared tea.\n\n[Photos of Rev.

They also allege a significant impact on character and landscape quality, and potential to impact on natural heritage.  They also fear excessive noise.  Local farmer, Andy Thomas alleges he and his family have suffered various health issues including sleep deprivation since the erection of the turbines behind his property at Mt Bryan.

The announcement was made by the Minister for Conservation and Environment, Jay Weatherill in front of a number of community members including members of the ‘Save Burra Railway Station Action Group’, Regional Council of Goyder CEO, John Brak and the Labor candidate for Stuart, Sean Holden.  If re-elected the government would immediately transfer the funds to the Goyder Council to help the Action Group to conduct the restoration.  Mr Weatherill visited the site last year.  It is intended that the restored building will be redeveloped as a palaeontology and archaeology museum and would showcase remains of mega fauna discovered at the nearby Redbanks Conservation Park.  A research and educational centre there would also promote local Ngadjuri culture.  The Burra Railway Station is a State Heritage place on the SA Heritage Register, situated within the Burra State Heritage Area.  It was built in 1883 to replace an earlier wooden structure.  The railway line dates from 1870.  The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988.\n\n[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect.  Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986.  The last grain trains ran for the 1998-99 harvest in January 1999.  The last passenger train was an ARHS special steam train on 19 September 1992.  The line does not seem to have been officially closed.  ARG ran the last movement on the line when it sent a light engine to Burra 12 March 2004.  The line beyond Burra was taken up 1992-93.  In 2010 the rails were still in place, though not serviceable, as far as Burra Station.]\n\n[Photo: Save the Burra Railway Station Action Group member Roger Cross, Minister for Environment and Conservation, Jay Weatherill, Group spokesperson Pip Edson and Labor candidate for Stuart, Sean Holden, at the Burra Railway Station last Thursday.] Jay Weatherill John Brak Sean Holden Roger Cross Pip Edson Burra Railway Station Redbanks Conservation Park Burra State Heritage Area Burra heritage conservation restoration government grant museum",

The on property display attracted about 80 local and interstate visitors.  The Stud has bases in Mt Bryan with senior principal Glan Lines and at Keith with son Justin and brother Haydn.  The stud was established at Yarcowie in 1885 by John Ayers Lines with son George Glanville Lines later transferring the stud to Mt Bryan in 1916.  Rail transport was then booming and rams were easily distributed to many wool growing areas.  In 1926 George acquired land near Booborowie, which had been part of the Old Canowie Station.  In 1946 Lance Lines, an industrial chemist by profession, took over the running of Gum Hill where the interest in measuring wool and meat saw a new stud policy evolve – let the sheep stand up [to] the rigours of nature.  Feed efficiency trials at Waite institute in the 1980s showed Gum Hill’s sheep out performed other SA sheep.\n\n[Several photographs including one of Lance Lines AM 1915-2009 and one of the sheep sent to the 1946 Adelaide Show.] Glan Lines Justin Haydn John Ayers Lines George Glanville Lines Lance Lines Gum Hill Stud Mt Bryan Keith Yarcowie Booborowie Old Canowie Station Adelaide Waite institute agriculture history stud sheep",

A player needed to have played three games to qualify for inclusion.  Burra had assumed that his inclusion in a game called off on account of heat would count as a game, in the same way that one that is washed out would count.  The Assoc. ruled him ineligible.  Burra then had to play in the preliminary final to win a place in the grand final and also forfeit the home ground advantage.

Fundraising efforts realised $5,600.  The regional Council of Goyder provided $3,000 through the Capital Fund, $5,000 through the Sport & Recreation Fund and $3,000 from Ward Funds.  AGL gave a Community Fund Grant of $7,500.  Donations from around the district raised the rest.  The ride-on mower received funding from the Dept. of Families, Housing, Community Service and Indigenous Affairs with a grant of $2,990.  The tractor will be ‘put to good use maintaining grasses and other potential hazards’.  [Perhaps reducing other hazards?]  The Progress Association has done much for the small town since 1992.  The old railway yards have been beautified.  Toilets have been erected.  There is a new fire shed and the radio tower was transferred.  A sheltered barbecue area was formed with a gazebo with seating, mini golf and the planting of hundreds of plants.  Playground equipment from the former school was transferred to the roadside area after the school closed in 2001.  The area is used by locals for community events as well as by passing travellers.  There are plans for the development of the East Terrace ‘meeting house’, which was formerly the Mt Bryan Tennis Club.  It was repaired late in 2009 and is used for association meetings.  A shed has been erected to house equipment and it is intended to rehabilitate the tennis courts and mark them for multi-purpose use.  It is intended to create a recreation area there away from the highway for local children to use.  The small group of 11 people currently can be proud of its achievements.

A group visited three quilt exhibitions in the Barossa during the Vintage festival.  The exhibition in May was a great success.  The People’s Choice award went to Pauline Miller again and everyone was shocked and saddened by her unexpected death in February 2010.  In May we received a cheque for $4,500 from the principal of the local school, who had applied for a community grant on our behalf, to further our involvement in supporting local charities.  A retreat to Camp Willochra at Melrose was another enjoyable weekend at the end of May.  A wonderful Christmas dinner at the home of Judy and David Miller concluded the year.  Funds from the raffled quilt at the exhibition went to the Motor Neurone Disease Organisation.\n\nThe Burra Quilters Group is a very active organisation with members from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Farrell Flat, Clare and Sturtvale Station.  As well as making quilts for their own pleasure, they make quilts for charity. One recently completed for the Burra Hospital Auxiliary will be raffled at the 2010 Melbourne Cup Luncheon.  Today they group is hosting the Biggest Quilting Bee with proceeds going to the Cancer Council in conjunction with the Biggest Morning Tea.

      "content": "AGL’s Hallett 2 Wind Farm was opened on Saturday by the Premier Mike Rann with about 160 people attending on a very cold and windy occasion.  Hallett 2 has been generating since last year.  Mr Rann said more than $2 billion had now been invested in wind farms, which by the end of the year will contribute 1000 MW to the power grid.  This places SA ahead of its target to have 20% of its electricity powered from renewable sources by 2014 and on target for 33% by 2020.  He said wind farms were good for the environment and generated jobs and economic activity in regional communities.  AGL managing director said community support was a key factor for successful wind farm development.  He estimated that more than $2 million had been injected into the local economy and some 200 local people had worked on the project’s construction.  All service technicians at Hallett 1 & 2 are locals he said.  Lasting benefits to the community would also come from the community funds established for each wind farm project.\n\n[Photo of, from left: Shaneal O’Bryan, Amy Dolphin, Grace Piggott, AGL CEO Michael Fraser, Hallett 2 project manager Adam Mackett, Declan Bowditch, Premier Mike Rann, Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP for Stuart, Peter Mattey Mayor of Goyder, & landowner Bill Gebhardt under turbine number 25.]\n\nWind Farm Protestors also attended the opening of Hallett 2.

      "content": "Phoenix Copper Exploration is causing some unease with their proposed exploration within the Burra Mine Reserve.  The proposed exploration will include the Burra Mines Historic site and the Burra Smelter site1, which are the centre of the township.  Concerns are centred around the removal or lifting of the Heritage status2, which was put in place to protect the site from mining.  Another concern, which has been highlighted by local stakeholders is the hydrology of the region, with fears that the pit of the Monster Mine would be de-watered.3  Last week the managing director of Phoenix Copper, Paul Dowd, met with representative of various committees in Burra, including the Regional Council of Goyder, National Trust and heritage Advisor Douglas Alexander, in a discussion of the proposed exploration and the company’s aspirations.  News of the exploration has been slowly trickling through to the community, with many residents unsure of exactly what is proposed.  National Trust representative Paul Marsson circulated an open letter last week outlining concerns with the proposal, which echo the concerns of many Burra residents.  Specifically the concerns are that the exploration is proposed for the Mine Reserve, which holds Heritage status and which lies in the centre of the town.  Mr Dowd has responded to the open letter to the Mid North Broadcaster (see page 2) stating the company’s intentions and refuting Mr Marsson’s assertions.  He says the company intends to work closely with stakeholders and leave little or no footprint.  He believes the prospect of mining would enhance Burra’s tourism with the modern offering comparison with the untouched heritage mining sites adjacent.  The Regional Council of Goyder has requested an open forum to be attended by Mr Dowd and the interested public and a meeting has been arranged in the Burra Town Hall 5 July at 7.30 p.m. Phoenix Copper Paul Dowd Paul Marsson Douglas Alexander Regional Council of Goyder Burra Mine Reserve Burra Mines Historic site Burra Smelter site Monster Mine Burra Burra Town Hall mining heritage environment hydrology community meeting",

And this was from a relatively shallow mine with a maximum depth of 600 ft compared with 3,000 ft at Wallaroo.  In 1851 Burra was the largest inland centre in Australia with a population of about 5,000 people.\n\nAt one stage Burra had five hairdressers, four chemists, 17 hotels1, surgeons and a host of other flourishing businesses.  Were it not for Norm Foster, who crossed the floor of Parliament, Roxby Downs may still be waiting for approval, denying SA billions of dollars in earnings.  There is nothing to say Burra can’t be as successful.  Without productive industry in Burra it will continue to decline, young people will leave for employment and businesses and services will be extinguished.

The proposed Board will take over the role of the existing Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee.  About 35 people attended the meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey and attended by John Brak (Goyder CEO) and Councillors Reilly, Bradley, Mosey and Gill.  Council took over direct control of the cottages in September 2008 and employed Juanita Queissner as manager.  The Operations Committee was also set up.  Membership of the new board will comprise seven representatives and one elected member of the Regional Council of Goyder.  While representatives from the Burra area are favoured anyone living within the Council area may apply.  Another person may be recommended by the committee and approved by Council.  Members would be appointed for three years and would manage, operate and maintain the cottages on behalf of the Council.\n\nGoyder Council discussed the application by Phoenix Copper to have the Burra Mine Reserve lifted and reports on the proposal made by the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee, at their meeting on 22 June.  The diversity of opinion from the elected members led to the decision to gauge public opinion before making a submission to PIRSA on the matter.  This will be done at a meeting to be held on 5 July at the Burra Town Hall.\n\nPIRSA has extended invitations to stakeholders to make submissions on the proposal by Phoenix Copper Ltd to lift the Burra Monster Mine Reserve.  The area was reserved from the operative provisions of the Mining Act 1971 on 10 March 1988 to provide protection to the historic mining heritage and currently precludes any access for mineral exploration or mining within the reserve.  Following this consultation a recommendation will be prepared for the Minister for Mineral Resources Development on whether the Reserve should be varied to allow the granting of an Exploration licence.  The Phoenix Copper proposal can be downloaded from the web.  Submissions must reach the Mining Registrar, Minerals and Energy Resources Division, PIRSA, GPO Box 1671, Adelaide or email junesse.martin@ sa.gov.au by 8 July, 2010.

Questions were repeatedly asked about what would happen if significant copper discoveries led to mining development.  Some people were strongly opposed to the proposition and others were clearly excited by the development prospects it offered.  Former PIRSA senior geologist and author spoke for the National Trust and expressed his belief that successful exploration would inevitably be followed by mining and that could not but damage Burra’s heritage, the chances of World Heritage listing and tourism.  The Burra History Group also voiced its opposition in the cause of preserving the town’s authentic heritage.  A local landowner expressed the concerns of a number of people about the effect of mining on the water table and the users of bores in the area.  Mr Dowd said there was no intention to dewater the mine for exploration and before any mining a detailed water management plan would be implemented.  He also again assured people that the preservation of mining heritage was paramount.  The initial testing program would involve five test holes and take about three months.  If the results were unsuccessful they would have to reconsider any further activity, but if the initial results were promising then testing 300 m beneath the mine would follow and that could take up to two years.  Mark Parnell (Greens) MLC spoke for the Ratepayers Action Group and said only 5% of the state was closed to mineral exploration and mining and amendments to the Mining Act were being debated next week and they would consider special places to be off limits to mining.  Maybe Burra needs to be on that list.  Other people spoke up in the almost three hours of discussion and many expressed the need for progress, growth and economic development to keep the town alive and provide employment.  A show of hands at the end of the night indicated a 60/40 split with 60% in favour of the exploration proposal.\n\n[Photos include on page 1 a shot of the Town Hall gathering during the meeting.

Former PIRSA senior geologist and author spoke for the National Trust and expressed his belief that successful exploration would inevitably be followed by mining and that could not but damage Burra’s heritage, the chances of World Heritage listing and tourism.  The Burra History Group also voiced its opposition in the cause of preserving the town’s authentic heritage.  A local landowner expressed the concerns of a number of people about the effect of mining on the water table and the users of bores in the area.  Mr Dowd said there was no intention to dewater the mine for exploration and before any mining a detailed water management plan would be implemented.  He also again assured people that the preservation of mining heritage was paramount.  The initial testing program would involve five test holes and take about three months.  If the results were unsuccessful they would have to reconsider any further activity, but if the initial results were promising then testing 300 m beneath the mine would follow and that could take up to two years.  Mark Parnell (Greens) MLC spoke for the Ratepayers Action Group and said only 5% of the state was closed to mineral exploration and mining and amendments to the Mining Act were being debated next week and they would consider special places to be off limits to mining.  Maybe Burra needs to be on that list.  Other people spoke up in the almost three hours of discussion and many expressed the need for progress, growth and economic development to keep the town alive and provide employment.  A show of hands at the end of the night indicated a 60/40 split with 60% in favour of the exploration proposal.\n\n[Photos include on page 1 a shot of the Town Hall gathering during the meeting.

In the past 30 years many country towns have had is tough and suffered a declining population.  Burra has held up very well and this is largely due to the citizens in the 60s and 70s who saw that Burra’s heritage could promote tourism.  At the centre of this was its Cornish mining heritage and the Burra Mine Reserve established in 1988.  Burra is now being considered for World Heritage listing, which has huge potential for the future.  Over 25,000 visitors pass through the Visitor Centre and over 12,000 purchase the Passport Key to demonstrate its marketability.  Visitors bring dollars into the town.  Many local businesses would not survive without this influx.  A publican has stated that 80% of meals are served to visitors.  Antique stores, coffee shops, restaurants, service stations and banks would not be here but for visitors.  It is part of the SA Government’s Strategic Plan to increase visitor numbers and lengthen their stay.  Exploration and mining outside of Burra may indeed bring benefits to the town, but let us not sacrifice the long term prosperity of our town for what is likely to be short term gain.  And let us not forget that Phoenix Copper’s main interests are its shareholders.  Please let us not disparage the value of heritage and tourism in Burra.

      "content": "Burra Sale Yards have been sold, marking the end of an era.  Sheep numbers have decline form more than 200 million in the 1970s when the saleyards were built to about 70 million today.  This has contributed to the drop in the number of smaller rural markets and the concentration on larger regional markets, such as at Jamestown in the Mid North.  Clients of Elders have been going to Jamestown for the past five to eight years and there have been no sales in Burra since October 2007, and that was only a small affair in the morning before a Jamestown sale.  At the peak Burra had monthly markets except in January and at times there were two a month.  There was a time when the Burra market attracted buyers from all over the state and from Victoria.  In the 1970s and 1980s everyone had lambs and sold them at the local market.  Young and older ewes were sold in October and wethers and lambs in November.  The largest number of sheep yarded at the Burra sale yards was for the Elders Centenary on Wednesday 25 November 1987, which was about 25,000.  Dressed in period costume Tom Rogers, who was State Livestock Manager for Elders.  He auctioned the first lot in pound shillings and pence.\n\n[Photos of:\n\nThe sale yards at their peak in the 1970s and 1980s\n\nTom Rogers dressed accordingly at the Elders Centenary sale in 1987\n\nSheep at the sale of 25November 1987.]\n\n[Note.  This article is misleading in some of its statements.  It is true that the saleyards in their latest configuration date from 1972, but Elders saleyards on this site were much older, as the reference to Elders Centenary Sale suggests.  The story of sheep sales at Burra North is complicated by the variety of agents and companies involved, but the Elders’ story starts on the site with their new yards being used for the first time on 25 November 1887, when they had a yarding of 25,000 sheep and 300 cattle.  The following year Elders Wool and Produce Co. was reorganised as Elder, Smith & Co. and the first sale under this name was on 27 July 1888 with just 4,350 sheep and 15 cattle.  In 1891 Sara & Dunstan completely reconstructed the saleyards for Elders and the new yards were opened 15 October 1891 with a yarding of 25,174 sheep.  In the late 1880s and early 1890s Elders were yarding over 200,000 sheep a year.  Shakes & Lewis were handling almost as many and others somewhat fewer, but an annual turnover in excess of half a million sheep was being recorded.  A series of dry years from 1892 saw numbers plummet, but the peak sale in SA was recorded on 27 September 1895 when Elders at their Bon Accord sale yarded 44,000 sheep and sold 36,000 of them along with 750 head of cattle.  In 1972 the old timber yards were replaced with the metal fencing that has just been sold.\n\nSee report in the Burra Record 15 February 1972, page 1.] Tom Rogers Elders Sara & Dunstan Shakes & Lewis Burra Jamestown Burra North Bon Accord SA Victoria sale yards sheep agriculture history market",

RAG blames the Council for doing little to emphasize the economic benefits of tourism to the community and the international importance of ‘The Burra Charter’.

Director Martin Phillips said they had been operating in Burra for the past ten years.  Dewatering of the mine area would mean a complete closure of the facility.  The school is on of only three commercial accredited occupational diver training organisations on the Australian mainland.  They maintain an ongoing supply of certified divers for the State’s aquaculture sector.  It arose when accident rates from recreationally trained divers caused WorkCover costs to rise.  Port Lincoln was initially chosen as the site, but a variety of problems, including sharks, prompted the move to an inland body of water with a more predictable and controlled environment.  There were two suitable sites in SA, but the other, Mt Gambier’s Blue Lake, was controlled by SA Water and was unavailable.  Property in Port Lincoln was sold and the move to Burra was made at considerable expense.  In recent times a process of infrastructure expansion has been undertaken, which would be largely complete within twelve months.  If the reserve status of the area were to be lifted their expansion plans would immediately have to be stopped.  They were poised to become an export industry with the potential to continue for many years.  The provision of services to international students has begun and is likely to grow.  The centre co-exists very well with the heritage aspects of the mine site.  UTCSA has observed widely fluctuating water levels, especially in summer, which suggests the aquifer is under stress and this would have implications for surrounding water users in the event of the dewatering of the pool.

      "content": "Burra Railway Station has received a $220,000 grant to begin the restoration and redevelopment of the site.  The handover of the money was announced by the State Environment and Conservation Minister Paul Caica.  The intention was to develop the building as a palaeontology and archaeology museum to showcase fossil remains of the mega fauna discovered at the Redbanks Conservation Park, east of Burra.  A research and educational centre to promote local Ngadjuri culture would also be established at the site.  The whole project would cost $1 million. Pip Edson, as spokesperson for the ‘Save the Railway Station Group’ said that although this was the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work needed to realise the project, it was exciting to finally be able to begin the restoration.  Much work is to be done and it will involve volunteers as well as skilled tradespersons.  The restoration will directly employ 12 skilled contractors and 4 trainees over some 9 months.  Volunteer Roy Taplin will manage the project.  He was at the station early on Friday to clear broken glass and other debris as a result of a vandal attack overnight.  After visiting the station Mr Caica met other interested persons for morning tea at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The heritage listed Station building was erected in 1883 and replaced a wood and iron structure built for the arrival of the line in 1870.  The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line closed in 1988.\n\n[Check this last date: could it be 1998?]\n\n[Photo of John Brak Goyder Council CEO, Pip Edson and State Environment & Conservation Minister Paul Caica at the Burra Railway Station on Friday morning.] Paul Caica Pip Edson Roy Taplin John Brak Burra Railway Station Redbanks Conservation Park Burra Burra Regional Art Gallery heritage restoration museum employment vandalism",

      "content": "BRTBA is facing a challenging year according to President Peter Edson.  The possibility of holding major events is well worth considering.  He said BRTBA’s most significant role was the management of the Burra Visitor Centre, which last year has 28,000 visitors through its doors and booked $260,000 worth of accommodation.  The BVC’s facilities are clearly quite inadequate compared with those in other centres. A challenge for this year is therefore the updating or relocation of the Visitor Centre. In the event that Phoenix Copper was granted exploration rights in the Mine area BRTBA would have to work closely with it to ensure the community and tourism benefited from the activity.  Road signage on roads leading to the town was another issue.  He reminded people that it was not necessary to own a business to become involved with BRTBA, anyone with ideas, visions and energy were most welcome to attend the AGM, scheduled for Tuesday 31 August.

Two such threatened habitats are Iron-grass Temperate Grasslands and Peppermint Box Grassy Woodlands.   Many species are found only in grassy ecosystems.  Among endangered animal species are the pygmy blue-tongue lizard and the plains wanderer an endangered and elusive seed eating bird.  Most of the areas of these ecosystems occur on private land and the SA MDB NRM Board is running a new Environmental Stewardship project to fund private land managers to protect and improve these ecosystems.

While Country Health SA contends that emergency services are unchanged, with doctors attending from Clare as required, Dr Lakman Fernando disagrees.  He is Dr Dissanayake’s husband and also works part of the time at Burra.  He says there is confusion at the hospital over emergency procedures, with reluctance by the staff there to call the on-call Clare doctor.

Mrs Villis says she has had the honour of teaching many wonderful children in her time there and marvels at the uniqueness of each of them.  She has been a key instigator in many fund raising efforts over the years, which have resulted in many improvements.  Major changes have included the replacement of the drab brown Hessian ceiling and brown beams with a white ceiling and pale blue beams, the occasional care room, the mesh fencing, the safety gates, storage sheds, bike track, landscaping, cubby house and shade cloth.  An impressive array of educational resources has also been acquired.  Sheree Mader will take over as Director.

When he arrived the local doctor was Les Miller and over the years he has seen Rob Oswald, Ashley Thomas, Peter Davies and Tim Simpson come and go.  Sadly Yvonne died several years ago and John will now buy a house in Adelaide and catch up with friends and family there.  John attributed much of the smooth running of the business to his staff, who he says have been tremendous over the years.

Dr Sarah Laurie, Medical Director Waubra Foundation was the guest speaker, accompanied by ABC Radio producer Petria Ladgrove.  Dr Laurie is a trained rural General Practitioner.  She said that like most people she had started out oblivious to any adverse health effects due to wind turbines.  Her attention had been drawn to medical reports from Wales of adverse effects following a wind farm development.  She subsequently established the Waubra Foundation, named after a small town northwest of Ballarat where health the problems first became public.  She said the problems have now been well described from sites around the world and cited various medical researchers.  Some of the illnesses have forced people from their land.  This has happened in the Gippsland area, the Portland region, around Ballarat, in Queensland and now reports are coming in from the Waterloo-Mt Bryan-Hallett developments in SA.  The problems have their origins in the low frequency noise generated by the plants, which can be shown to affect blood pressure and the inner ear.  The sound is generally below the audible range for most people.

      "content": "Merrie Elliott of Burra writes:\n\nEmergency services at Burra Hospital were going along normally until one day in April 2010 our doctor’s right to attend emergencies there was abruptly terminated.  Country Health SA offered no real reason for this other than to say the doctor was no longer qualified to undertake these duties.   Since then concerned members of the public have had interviews with the Premier Mike Rann, Health Minister John Hill, representatives of Country Health SA and Tony Gwynn-Jones chair of Lower North Health Advisory Service.  Despite emails, letters petitions etc. it has been impossible to get straight answers.  The Minister and Country Health persistently advise us that nothing has changed and that Emergency Services are operating as normal.  This is of course nonsense.  Either a doctor has to come from Clare or the patient has to be sent elsewhere after assessment by the triage nurses.  With lawyers, those masters of expensive delay now lurking on the scene, there is little hope of a speedy resolution.  Country Health SA has been remarkable for obfuscation, lack of transparency and conflicting stories.  Many are now beginning to wonder if there is a long term plan to close down the Burra Hospital and all this is a softening up process.  Despite assurances from Minister Hill that this is not the case, the process is causing this fear to grow.  The transfer of the ownership of the hospital to the LNHAC (Lower North Health Advisory Council – a body with little actual connection to Burra – is not reassuring.\n\n‘We don’t now need to one morning discover that Burra no longer has a hospital or even a doctor, with residents then forced to go to Clare or wherever for even the most minor treatments…Burra needs to retain its hospital, a doctor and proper emergency service.\n\n[The full letter runs to c. 2 columns.] Merrie Elliott Mike Rann John Hill Tony Gwynn-Jones Burra Clare hospital emergency health administration",

The transfer was highlighted in a letter sent by Health Minister John Hill on 23 December 2010 in a reply to Concerned Burra Residents regarding the LNHAC and the withdrawal of acute care privileges in respect of Dr Dharma Dissanayake at Burra Hospital.  He said LNHAC also manages significant funds that have been donated by the local community to the health service.  He said in the letter that the decision to cease Dr Dissanayake providing acute services was made on the advice of an independent group of medical practitioners.  He also said this decision was being formally appealed and he could therefore not comment further.  Burra Doctor Lakman Fernando has since offered his services along with another doctor to be recruited by Dr Fernando to fill the void.  Dr Lakman now says he has reservations following the transfer of ownership of the hospital.  He is concerned about who is going to fund the hospital expenses, especially the emergency department.

Council last week voted to provide $12,000 from the ward fund.  Cr Gill thinks any further funding is unlikely to come from Council’s general funds and the source may have to be through the Unique Services Rating Philosophy.  The problem seems to have arisen from a combination of unique circumstances and a lack of adequately detailed financial reporting.  A turnover of staff had used up accumulated reserves along with funding withdrawn for the SA Tourism Commission.  Council normally provides $42,000 per annum and rent free offices.  Other funds come from the Centre itself, including sales of the Burra Passport and accommodation.  The public is being asked to register its support and there have been economies made by some reduction in hours of operation and staff.  Mr Edson of BRTBA, which has been running the centre for the last eight years, said running costs were c. $160,000 p.a.  It is vital that there be a one-off rescue package and that the centre continue to operate.  The $12,000 provided so far will allow the centre to operate to mid March.  Each year the centre services some 27,000 visitors, with about half coming from interstate and overseas.  It handles about $260,000 worth of accommodation bookings as well as tickets for major local events.  Sales of the Burra Passport bring in $110,000 annually.  This is passed on to the National Trust and Council.  The latter’s share amounts to c. $40,000 – not far short of the Council’s annual contribution to the BVIC.  This is the first time since BRTBA took over that they have asked the Council for help.

The panel was considering an application for two new 80 metres wind monitoring masts.  More than 20 people attended, including members of ‘Stop Industrial Wind Turbines’ and Andreas Marciniak and his brother Johannes who live 3 km from the Waterloo Wind Farm.  Johannes gave a heated outburst while addressing the panel, which resulted in local police being called.  Andreas Marciniak said his brother became frustrated when it appeared no one was really listening and their complaints were falling on deaf ears.  He predicted that others would replicate his brother’s actions as others become increasingly frustrated by the lack of attention being paid to their complaints.  The site for one of the new monitoring masts is about 9 km east of Mt Bryan Township and the other about 13 km south of Burra.  After hearing from the applicants and third party presenters the panel decided the masts were not at variance with the Goyder Development Plan and approved their temporary erection – to be removed within 60 months of the approval.

      "content": "Burra Hospital\n\nA number of questions and concerns were raised at the LNHAC Community Forum in Burra on Monday.    As well as HAC members the meeting was attended by Goyder Council CEO John Brak and by Dr Lakman Fernando.  Mr Gwynn-Jones welcomed those present.  Great concern was expressed about the amount of time it has taken to see the question of the absence of a credentialed Doctor for accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital resolved.  The lack of any evidence of progress only increased concerns.  Mr Gwynn-Jones assured the forum that every effort has been made to try to resolve the matter.  His understanding was that the unanimous decision to withdraw visiting privileges was made by a peer group of eight doctors.  Dr Fernando claimed there was ‘no review …They just came and did work with the nurses.’\n\nQuestions from the floor suggested many could not see why Country health SA ‘can’t sort it out’.\n\nThe HAC was disappointed that Goyder Council had not expressed any concern.  The HAC could not get the Council to write a letter to say they were concerned.\n\nThe transfer of the Hospital ownership to LNHAC concerned other people and prompted the question:\n\n‘Could Burra lose its hospital?’\n\n‘Shoot me if this hospital is closed in the near future,’ replied Mr Gwynne-Jones.\n\nThe doctors have to go through their appeal process and we have to keep trying to get a doctor into our hospital as best as we can.   HAC has written to the Rural Doctors Agency [to supply an interim doctor] but indications are that sourcing a doctor for Burra is a low probability.\n\nNear the end of the meeting Dr Fernando said he had arranged for a doctor to come from overseas.  The new doctor would work alongside Dr Fernando & Dr Dissanayake in the Burra Medical Centre and in the emergency service, initially, until Dr Dissanayake’s restriction is resolved.  Once the appeal process is finished he said all three doctors would like to practice in Burra.\n\nThe future planning of health services in the local area has been brought to the fore by the group of concerned Burra & District Residents regarding the credentialing of overseas trained doctors. (OTDs)\n\nThis follows complaints that were made, which were referred to and heard by Country Health SA and Scope of Clinical Practice Advisory Committee and the decision to revoke Dr Dissanayake’s attending rights at accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital.\n\nIt is understood Dr Dissanayake was initially credentialed to attend accidents and emergencies and continued to do so until April 2010.  Since then accidents and emergencies have been attended by SA Ambulance, triage nurses at he Burra Hospital and attending doctors from Clare.\n\nGroup spokesperson Helen Szuty said this has had a profound effect on the community.  Confidence in Dr Dissanayake has naturally diminished and many patients are now consulting doctors in Clare.  This has other results in that do shopping and seek other service while there.  It is natural that people feel concerned for the future of the hospital in the absence of any satisfactory solution to this problem.  The problem is not unique to Burra and the group has successfully sought to have the issue included in the terms of reference for a proposed inquiry by the Social Development Committee of the SA Parliament.  (A proposal to be debated in SA Parliament today, 23 March.)\n\n[The terms of reference are then stated.]\n\nThe group urges community members and the LNHAC to make a submission to the Inquiry in an effort to resolve the current situation.

Without more members the local branch will be unable to fill the quorum for official meetings.  At the AGM there were just five present from the board of eight.  Sub-Branch President John Trigg said they are fearful of closing because it could spell the end of traditional ceremonies in the town.  Places lice Booleroo Centre, Melrose, Jamestown and Orroroo no longer have RSLs so they have to travel to other towns to attend Anzac and Remembrance Day services.  Secretary Mike Thomas said that because Burra did not have service organisations like Rotary, Lions or Apex to take over the running of official RSL activities, we are looking to have to close for good.  Members call on returned soldiers, Vietnam vets, of National Service members to join the sub-branch to keep the organisation from closing.  The Anzac Day service for 2011 will take place at the War Memorial in Market Square at 6.30 a.m. on Monday 25 April.  Burra Indoor Bowling Ladies will provide tea, coffee and biscuits afterwards in the Council chamber or a tot of rum donated by the Burra Hotel.\n\n[Photo of Secretary-Treasurer Mike Thomas, Vice-President Clive Catchlove & President John Trigg in Market Square.] John Trigg Mike Thomas Clive Catchlove Burra Indoor Bowling Ladies Burra Booleroo Centre Melrose Jamestown Orroroo Market Square Burra Hotel community organisations RSL Anzac membership",

Many also visited Best Place where there was a fruit and vegetable market.  Town shops were well patronised and the Clare Concert Band played in Market Square.  The fair was opened by Peter Cherry of Small & Whitfield Auction Rooms, Adelaide.  Author of Women of Gold, Kevin Kakoschke, signed copies of the book about women of the northern goldfields like Teetulpa, Olary and Waukaringa.

      "content": "Frank Treloar, Burra’s First Historian\n\nFrank Treloar (1852-1934) lived through the formative years of the colony of South Australia.  He was born in Adelaide while his father was away at the Victorian gold fields.  His youth was spent in the Clare Valley at Watervale, where he attended the famous Stanley Grammar School.  As a teenager he visited the Burra Mine and saw it in full swing, visiting both Morphett’s Pump House and the underground workings.  After he married at the age of twenty, Frank became part of the push to expand South Australia’s agriculture beyond Goyder’s Line.  He endured five hard years of drought and crop failure, exhausting his own resources as well as those of his wife. It was hard to admit defeat and return to Watervale, where he briefly found work as a wheat agent.\n\nWhen he was offered the position as manager of Gum Creek Station, near Burra, he took it with enthusiasm.  He held this position for 18 years before moving into Burra where he worked for Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. for 30 years before retiring to Adelaide in 1930.  In Burra he was one of those small group of people who work to serve the community on committees of all sorts and he became secretary to many bodies; some paying and others honorary positions.   He acquired a reputation in the town as a man whose judgement was sound and whose integrity could be taken as a given.\n\nFrank Treloar had long been interested in the history of the Burra Burra Mine and the township of Burra when  his series of articles on the Mine was published in the local newspaper, the Burra Record, between April and July 1929, under the title Looking Back.  Although others had earlier contributed articles recording their reminiscences, this was the first extended history of the famous Burra Burra Mine.  So interested were people in the series that the Burra Institute Committee decide to publish the series in booklet form.  The Town Council contributed £5 towards the cost and the publication was printed locally by the Burra Record.  Unfortunately soon after publication a fire in Pearce’s Building largely destroyed the building and most of the print run was lost due to water damage.  As a consequence the small booklet of about 50 pages has become a collectors’ item.\n\nThe information available in 1929 was incomplete with respect to the setting up of the Burra Burra Mine and the nearby Princess Royal Mine.  After further research Treloar wrote a series of articles on the steps involved in financing and starting the two mines of the Special Survey along the Burra Creek in 1845.  These appeared in the Burra Record in 1933.  At various times the paper also printed other of his reminiscences and various letters to the editor.\n\nThe Burra History Group has now put together all of the letters and articles produced by Frank Treloar that were published in the Burra Record between 1920 and 1934.  It also includes a few newspaper reports relating to his life.  Frank was a dedicated amateur historian who set down for future generations an accurate and interesting account of Burra’s early days and he had in addition the ability to relate what he saw going on in the local area to the wider context of the development of South Australia socially and economically.  We truly owe him a debt of gratitude both for his writing and for physically saving many of the South Australian Mining Association’s records, which had been abandoned in the company’s offices after the mine closed.\n\nThe Burra History Group’s reprint of Frank Treloar’s rare booklet will be launched as a 208 page book on Wednesday 18 May in the Burra Town Hall Supper Room at 2 p.m.  All are welcome to attend the launch and enjoy refreshments following the event and a tour of the displays at the Town Hall as a part of SA’s History Festival.

BRTBA President Peter Edson expressed the committee’s gratitude for Mr Warne’s generosity.  Helped by mild weather and a five-day Easter holiday, the visitor numbers ‘for April rise 115%’ compared with 2010.  [Does this mean an increase of 115% - more than doubling last year’s, or is the 2011 figure 115% of the 2010 figure?  The latter seems more likely since in May 3008 were served compared with 2506 in 2010 – which would give a figure of 120% or an increase of 20%.]\n\n[Photo: Peter Edson with Les Warnes and BVIC Manager Paula Jones.] Les Warnes Peter Edson Paula Jones Mr Warne BVIC Manager Paula Jones Burra Goyder Council visitor centre tourism community statistics funding",

If successful they will then start the process of visas.  That could see the doctor here in the next two or three months.  The new doctor will be able to assist in the practice, but emergency privileges will only be made possible by 24-hour supervision by part-time doctor Lakman Fernando, who has been granted emergency privileges.  We have a doctor here all the time who does not have and chooses not to have privileges, Ms Poole said.  The Medical Board requires some form of supervision of any international doctor who’s not fellowed.  They can get that within two to three years and the RWDA encourages them.  The process of getting the new doctor in place can be expected to take from two to six months. Lyn Poole Dr Lakman Fernando Ms Poole Goyder Council Burra medical recruitment council",

Parents were angry because they were not forewarned of the move and said they could have boosted attendance, had they been aware of the threat.  The current debt is $5,574.  Speakers said winter was inevitably a time of lower usage.  A minimum number of five children per day would ensure that the service remains viable for the meantime.  It is highly likely there will be a moderate increase in fees.

Mr Reilly was granted the right to explore for several weeks in 2007 in an area adjacent to the dump access road.  He claims that his small operation revealed large deposits, which could drive the town’s economy and real estate sector.  ‘We could well see a housing jump by 200%.’ He claimed.  After this discovery he bought into Phoenix.  In 2007 the Regional Council, PIRSA and the Heritage Advisor granted the permission for the exploration.  This brings into question why Phoenix has been forced to wait more than 15 months for a decision on its proposal.  Mr Reilly blames well publicised opposition to the exploration, which he says is not beneficial to the town’s future.  He says he is concerned for the younger generation and the future of the town.  He says for the first time in 200 years three hotels in Burra have closed within 18 months.  ‘If someone doesn’t do something, this town’s going to disappear.

      "content": "Steve & Anne Royal write in response to Matt Reilly on mining in Burra.\n\nMatt Reilly says he welcomes a strong debate.  In such it is essential to assess relevant facts.  Some of these facts are:\n\nAccording to Phoenix Copper’s 2010 Annual Report Mr Reilly has over 1.5 million shares in the company and has been granted a further 2 million options.  If exploration commences in the mine reserve he will receive a further 800,000 shares and 800,000 options.  If a significant ore reserve is discovered, he will receive $200,000 and a further $100,000 if any tailings or waste material from the Monster Mine is processed.  He will also receive 6% royalty for all metals derived from the mine.  Mr Reilly says three hotels have closed in Burra, but fails to mention that two of them have reopened.  The closure of at least one of them seems to have nothing to do with the lack of mining in Burra.  At last year’s town meeting the New Zealand town of Waihi (pop. 4,500) was actively marketed by Phoenix as a shining example of how great mining was for a town.  Newmont Mining operates a large open cut gold mine in the middle of town and Waihi’s situation is similar to what Burra may be facing.  Far from being a bonanza for the town, it seems to have been very bad for them.  According to the NZ census data for 2006 the median income for Waihi residents is $15,200 compared with a median income of $24,100 p.a. for the whole Waikato Region.\n\nIn Waihi 62% of the population has an annual income of $20,000 or less.  For the entire region this figure is 43%.  In the town only 7% earn over $50,000, while for the region this figure is 17%.  The region has 5.3% unemployment, while Waihi has 8.2%.  The mine seems to have done little for real estate either.  The average house price in the Coromandel region is $415,110 and in Waihi it is $307,000 with about 200 houses for sale in the town.  Several houses in Waihi have disappeared into the ground and several others are deemed to unsafe to live in.\n\nMr Reilly asserts that ‘there is money in the mine…and that money is for Burra’.  This is not correct.  Any money in the mine will be for Phoenix Copper and a few of their stakeholders, Mr Reilly included.  There will be a few short term jobs created – Phoenix themselves give only a five-year lifespan for Burra operations.  After that Burra would be left with no new jobs, no mine and no money, just one hell of a mess to clean up.\n\nWe wholeheartedly support Phoenix Copper in their ventures in the region, but mining must not commence in Burra or in any other residential area.  Burra needs to find a way of progressing that does not rely on the destruction of the town.\n\nMr Koutsantonis at a meeting in Burra on 17 August said there was no way that he would allow mining in the Burra Mine pit.  It is disappointing that this announcement hasn’t received more publicity.

This meeting was discussing the registration process and support available for overseas trained doctors.  Ways to improve pathways and remove impediments without imperilling standards were discussed.  The Burra group spoke to supplement its written submission and arose from the ongoing situation which prevents Dr Dissanayake from attending emergencies at Burra Hospital.  They explained the progress of the case.  Helen Szuty said that during a recent planned review of Dr Dissanayake’s credentials and scope of clinical practice at Burra Hospital, she had her attending rights to accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital reinstated after 16 months.  Due to the recent arrival of Dr Evinta Royce, Dr Dharma Dissanayake, Dr Lakman Fernando and Dr Royce expect to commence emergency services at Burra Hospital from the first week in October 2011.  The Group understands that Drs Dissanayake and Fernando intend to proceed with an Application for Judicial Review in the Supreme Court, over what has happened.  The group considered that the policies on credentialing etc. require legislative action.  They thanked the Clare Doctors for treating accidents and emergencies over the last 16 months.  The standing Committee on Health and Ageing recommended the group meet with the Federal Member for grey to find out more about federal grants for regional hospitals and health services and the group intends to follow this up.\n\n[Photo of Evan Hawke, Helen Edwards, Nita Brodie, Peter Brodie and Helen Szuty.] Group of Concerned Burra & District Residents Standing Committee on Health and Ageing Dr Dissanayake Helen Szuty Dr Evinta Royce Dr Dharma Dissanayake Dr Lakman Fernando Clare Doctors Federal Member for grey Evan Hawke Helen Edwards Nita Brodie Peter Brodie Helen Szuty Adelaide Burra Hospital Supreme Court Clare Burra health credentialing hospitals legal community",

This follows a long wait by Burra residents who have formed divisive opinions regarding the proposal.  The Minister said he had decided not to lift the reserve because ‘the heritage value of the site is too great’.\n\n‘It’s time to mine other regions.’\n\nHe also said that to set conditions would involve ‘too many politics’ to allow it to proceed.\n\nAlthough Phoenix was a good company, the return would not justify the angst.  Phoenix will still be able to explore and mine in and around Burra, but the Minister said he ‘can’t in any good conscience allow them in the Monster Mine’.\n\nGoyder Council Mayor, Peter Mattey, felt that compromises should have been discussed.  He believed they could have opened up part of the mine site.  He felt the community was leaning toward the possibility of exploration.\n\nHe thought Phoenix would probably go on looking around the perimeter.\n\nNational Trust SA President David Beaumont expressed relief at the decision.  He said the Monster Mine was of national importance and has been nominated for World Heritage listing as a trans-national component of Cornish Mining Sites.  The site also protects important remnant grassland and 24% of the indigenous species have conservation ratings at the national, state and regional level.\n\nPhoenix Copper managing director Peter Dowd said he did not understand the decision, but that the company was committed to exploration outside the reserve in the Burra North prospect.  He would be contacting the Minister for further clarification as there were issues that were contradictory to what has been the case previously.

Many positive comments were heard and Show President Tim Stockman said this year’s show saw a good run of entries, particularly in floral art.  There were some great entries in all divisions and it was especially pleasing to see the junior involvement in the floral section.  Tracking entries had been made easier by the new computerised system in use.  The weather of the preceding week had been wet, but Show Day had been sunny before rain returned on the Sunday.  The recent outbreak of pigeon disease in Victoria meant there was no pigeon or poultry section this year.  The merino shearing competition continues to be the premier shearing competition on the SA Shows circuit.  The ute and car competition saw a good turn-out.  The wool pavilion with its newly featured wool packs above the exhibits drew favourable comment.  The named wool packs were an initiative of convenor Andrew Butler Rural Services and allowed each exhibitor to pay a fee for their named wool pack to be displayed, which went towards a generous $1,000 donation to the Burra Show Society.  The support of the local community in putting the event together is to be commended.  President John Oates thanked sponsors for their continuing support and also the judges, convenors, stewards and all those who contributed to the local event.\n\nResults are printed.

The former process led to a successful appeal in the Environment, Resources and Development Court, against the Allendale Wind Farm.  On 19 October the Government changed the rules for assessing wind farm proposals.  Ms Ally Fricker for SIWF said it was clear the Government never had any intention that appeals could succeed and so have changed the rules so that there can be continued development of wind farms without the hindrance of community opposition through third party appeals.  The changes have been made to give greater certainty to the industry, but have delivered greater uncertainty to thousands of people across rural SA.\n\nSetbacks of one kilometre from homes and two kilometres from towns make a mockery of protection from noise impacts or loss of visual amenity and give no consideration to wild life.

The Regional Council of Goyder and the Northern Areas Council are urging residents to become informed about the changes and to take the opportunity to make comment.  Goyder CEO, John Brak, said he expected that Council would make a submission to the Department of Planning and Local Government on the matter.  The significance that the Council can place on visual appearance has been greatly reduced.  The changes move wind farms from category 3 developments to category 2.  This requires that only adjoining landowners need to be notified and only adjoining landowners may make written representations to Council.  The presiding member can decide whether to allow a person making a representation to speak in support before the Council’s Development Assessment Panel and neither the person making the representation nor any member of the public.  Previously any owner of land likely to be affected and any member of the public could make representations.  Anyone submitting a written representation had the right to be heard before the Development Assessment Panel and any person who made a representation had the right to appeal the decision.

      "content": "Marie Abbott of Burra celebrated her 99th birthday recently.  Mrs Abbott still lives independently in her own home and was joined on the occasion by family members, including her sister Kath Scholz, who celebrated her 95th birthday and son Leo, who was celebrating his 70th.  Mrs Abbott was born Marie Hogan at Leighton and lived there with her parents until marrying Leo Abbott in 1940.  She attended Leighton school till aged 10 and then went with her sister Dorothy as boarders at the St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding after it was built in 1921.  The subjects included reading, spelling, copybook writing, religion and music.  When Marie first went to school she went by horse and cart.  She went on to teach music, travelling around the Booborowie area with her violin, by horse and sulky.  When she drove some 10 miles beyond Booborowie she would stay overnight.  On one such trip with her brother they had an accident and the violin got broken.  Mrs Abbott also continued to play the piano well and played the organ at church until she was 90.  Singing around the piano with family and friends was a popular form of entertainment in the time before television.  She also went to her grandparents’ home to listen to concerts on the wireless.  Card games such as bridge and euchre also provided entertainment.  On special occasions the family would travel to a neighbour’s and listen to the commentary on the wireless of the test matches when Australia played England for the Ashes.  Of the changes she has seen, cars, TV and telephones perhaps had most impact.  Washing machines also made a big difference.  She recalls using a scrubbing board to do the clothes.  When she got married they lived in a prefab house with no insulation and a wood stove.  There was no refrigerator.  Not until after her third child did they get a kerosene refrigerator.  Mrs Abbot can’t remember what year they got electricity, but it certainly made getting hot water easier.

Burra Community School Principal, Tony Maio, Sue Ryan and DECS Regional Director Terry Sizer also attended.  The Centre’s Director Sarah Stoddard welcomed visitors and introduced former Director Brenda Villis.  She spoke about the origins of the centre.  The original plans for the site were drawn up on 21 May 1981, with the opening taking place in December 1981.  For many years the centre provided four session of pre-school, one play group session and one unfunded occasional care session per week.  A community meeting held at the site decided that there was a need for additional care in Burra.  Eventually DECS agreed to fund three occasional care sessions per week and one session for under twos.  The offer was accepted, but the under two session could not be run because of the lack of nappy changing facilities.  Two years later DECS agreed to fund a bathroom upgrade.  The snag was that the centre needed to fund the additional floor space.  Plans were drawn up by Frank Endermann, facilities manager at the Building Management Facilities Services at Clare and Mc Kendrick Builders from Clare began work last year in the October holidays.

Investigations by the SA Government in the 1960s revealed the deposit, which was purchased by Royal Resources in 2009.  The prospect is for an open cut mine to win 500 million tons already defined, (with perhaps as much again to come) and a 30 year lifespan.  It is estimated that there would be 1,000 jobs in the construction phase and 400 in the operational phase.  It is not expected to be a fly-in fly-out mine and Peterborough is well placed to benefit from the development.  A Memorial of Understanding has been signed with key rail operators and Flinders Ports and a Native Title agreement signed with the traditional owners – the Ngadjuri.  The decision to mine and initial construction is expected to be undertaken in the period 2013-15.

The panel was hearing an application relating to a wind energy project at Stony Gap and Cr Neal receives some income from the same developer.  The Ombudsman agreed there was a clear conflict of interest.  It was disturbing that Cr Neal’s stand was supported by Goyder’s CEO, John Brak; Mayor, Peter Mattey and the DAP Chair, Colleen Woodgate.  The recent changes to the rules make it all the more important that there is full financial disclosure and no conflict of interest amongst members of Council’s decision making bodies.\n\n[She then goes on to draw attention to the changes to assessment procedures as outlined in Edition No. 1004, 26 October 2011, pages 1 & 3.] Ally Fricker Cr John Neal John Brak Peter Mattey Colleen Woodgate Goyder Stony Gap wind farm conflict of interest local government planning",

The court found that the wind turbines owned by AGL, and operating at Hallett 2 Wind Development are currently incapable of satisfying current SA EPA guidelines.  The appeal also challenged the SA EPA Wind Farm Noise Guidelines on the grounds that they do not adequately protect human health.  There was, however, no determination of the merits of any of the grounds of the appeal.\n\nA resident neighbouring the Hallett Hill Wind Farm (Hallett 2) has brought a noise complaint to AGL.  The company has investigated the matter and preliminary results of tests have reported some audible tones under certain conditions.  Upon becoming aware of this tonality issue in December 2010 AGL shut down a number of turbines in proximity to the residence.  Sixteen of the 34 turbines are currently shut down at night.  The company has been working with the supplier of the turbines to rectify the fault.  The supplier has developed a permanent acoustic treatment to address the tonality issue, but until this permanent acoustic treatment can be implemented Hallett 2 will operate with 16 turbines shut down at night between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Bill Quinn AGL Mt Bryan Hallett Hill Hallett 2 wind farm legal environment noise",

He challenges the assertion in a recent letter that ‘Peer reviewed medical research by suitably qualified persons is available …that clearly and unequivocally shows that persons living close to wind turbines may suffer a range of medical conditions.’\n\nIn fact:\n\nAustralia’s National Health & Medical research Council, Victorian Chief Medical Officer and SA’s EPA have all concluded that there is no scientific or medical evidence that wind farms have adverse health impacts.\n\nDoctors for the Environment have supported this finding.\n\nPublic Health expert Professor Simon Chapman of Sydney University has recently published an article in the Medical Journal of Australia an article questioning who has fomenting community anxiety over this issue and questions the agendas of anti-wind farm groups.  Wind farms have been around for over two decades and yet claims that they directly threaten health are far more recent.  More than 100 million Europeans live within 10 km of a wind turbine and yet the issue is not on the radar of a single science academy in the world.\n\nPacific Hydro takes adverse health effects very seriously.  An independent report tested the levels of infrasound produced by wind turbines and the results showed they were well below perception levels and importantly well below levels produced by other natural and man-made sources.  One of the highest levels of infrasound was at a beach.\n\nVarious medical researchers and other academics have supported the claim that ‘there is no consistent evidence of any physiological of behavioural effect of acute exposure to infrasound in humans’ including Dr Gary Wittert, whose epidemiological survey found no correlation between increased prescription for related medical conditions claimed to be exacerbated by wind turbine operations.

      "content": "Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes expressing concern that Country Health SA is seeking to have the title of the land on which the Burra hospital stands transferred to it from the Burra Burra Hospital Inc. of Kooringa.  This is a practice throughout the state, but there appears to be no guarantee that it will not then be sold on.  It is not inconceivable that a future owner may not want a hospital on his piece of ground.  Surely it is short sighted to move the ownership of a vital asset from local control to the hands of an entity composed largely of people with no links to that community.  These quasi government bodies are forever changing.  If I am wrong, this letter will enable someone to come forward to put the record straight and publicly explain, in understandable language, with no fudging or waffling, just exactly what is happening and why.

After that she continued to care for the elderly, working for the Country Home Advocacy Project and for Helping Hand.  Over the years she has assisted over 100 people in the area from Hallett to Waterloo and Burra to Clare and Auburn.  This has meant early morning calls to get people out of bed and late evening visits to put them into bed.  While not the one to take on the roles of President or secretary of organisations, she has consistently been the one to roll up when help was required, when working bees were organised or food etc. was needed for a function or stall.  She has long supported the Farrell Flat Uniting Church, the Ladies’ Fellowship and the Burra Uniting Church Op Shop.  She has also been active in the Royal Flying Doctors Auxiliary, the Women’s and children’s Hospital Auxiliary, Lifeline and the Farrell Flat Management Committee.

      "content": "Burra Town Hall is being re-roofed after more than a century.  The work is expected to be completed within two weeks.  The hall dates from 1874 and replaced an earlier and smaller building of 1857.  A committee of civic minded residents had the building erected on land leased for 99 years on a peppercorn rent.  The Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute was designed to advance the moral, social and intellectual well being of residents and to offer improvements to the working classes. John Pearce of Burra was the contractor for much of the building we see today.  There have been many changes and additions in the building’s history, including an interior facelift in 1969, a major re-development in 2001-02 and interior refurbishment in 2006.  Trevor Woods, the Goyder Council’s Assets Manager, said the building was being re-roofed using Council funds after continuing leaks had damaged parts of the interior.  Heritage Stone Restorations Ltd is rebuilding the stone wall on the southern boundary under contract to the Council.  For years the building was the focal point for the town and housed the council office, served as a public meeting place and hosted a plethora of events, including dances, movies, concerts, operas and in 1889 opened as the Provincial Roller Skating Rink.  It remains a landmark of the town’s historical commercial area.  A worthy band of volunteers helps to maintain the building and surroundings.  The Town Hall Committee spokesperson, Meredith Satchell, said they were delighted to see the building receive a new roof.

The Jack Kleinig Band played for more than 20 years in the local area before Mr Kleinig retired in the 1980s.  The NLA has been recording the folklore, music, dance and poetry of Australia since the 1950s as part of their Oral History Collection.  Their interest is not just in the dance and music, but in the dress, the suppers, the types and variations of dances and the stories of the people involved.  Principal researcher is Rob Willis of Forbes NSW and he has been tracking down old performers to record their stories.  Mr Willis has been a collector of folklore and social history since the mid 1970s.  He has regular segments on ABC Radio and has assisted with TV documentaries.  He said the interview with Jack Kleinig was great, ‘capturing many stories of the dance (and other) traditions in the area.  Jack’s stories will be archived and be available to everyone in the Oral History section of the NLA and the material is also available on-line at the NLA site TROVE.http://trove.nla.gov.au/\n\n[Photo of Rob Willis with Jack Kleinig and another of Jack Kleinig with signs that announced the next dances.] Jack Kleinig Rob Willis National Library of Australia Forbes TROVE oral history folklore music dance",

      "content": "Burra Senior Citizens officially dissolved on Monday morning.  The group had given more than 30 years of community involvement.  With low numbers and no sign of recruiting more, the five remaining members met to finalise banking arrangements and to dissolve the organisation.  Shirley Broad had been President for 17 years and recalled the good times and the friendships over that period.  The organisation began in 1978 when then BCS Principal Chris McCabe thought the town needed a Senior Citizens Club.  He mentioned it to Edith Carpenter, Laurel Neill and another person, who spread the idea around town.  Foundation members were Len & Sue Hentschke, Laurel Neill and Beryl Kakoschke, with Mrs Kakoschke, who now lives in Wallaroo, being the only remaining original member.  Before long there was a group meeting in the CWA rooms in Chapel Street, free of charge.  Various speakers were arranged.  Eventually Ray Jennison came along and a committee was formed.  The group grew until it was too large for the CWA rooms and meetings were transferred to the Uniting Church Hall, also free of charge.  A few months later when the Burra Council had completed renovations of the RSL Building, the Senior Citizens were offered the main meeting room for a place to gather.  Len Bence offered a painting to be raffled.  The money was to be towards a trip that never eventuated, but all funds went to projects around Burra.  While the club provided social and recreational opportunities, a major project over the years has been the beautification of the banks of the Burra Creek.\n\n[Photo of Len Simpson, Nancy Simpson, John Trigg (acting treasurer for Ben Kotz), Shirley Broad & Colin Broad.] Shirley Broad Chris McCabe Edith Carpenter Laurel Neill Len & Sue Hentschke Beryl Kakoschke Ray Jennison Len Bence Len Simpson Nancy Simpson John Trigg Ben Kotz Colin Broad Burra BCS Wallaroo CWA rooms Chapel Street Uniting Church Hall RSL Building Burra Creek community organisation dissolution social",

Its location maximises crossing for the supermarket and the Post Office and provides a fixed point for crossing rather than the randomness operating at present.  It aims to achieve a safer crossing for the young, the old and the frail, especially safety from reversing vehicles.  New kerb ramps are another advantage.  At present it will only be installed if costs are met by the State Government under its safety program.  There will be a loss of two parking spaces and the provision of a disabled parking space.  A light controlled crossing would be more expensive, would be more disruptive to traffic, would occupy parking spaces and would not be likely to be funded by the Sate.

He urged the Goyder Council to seek ‘top shelf’ advice regarding wind farm development in the region.  Several people relayed their concerns about ill health effects of wind turbines.  The Senator said that Council should be supporting the community by getting independent legal advice on their rights to take on the SA Government and get independent testing done.  Three Councillor including Mayor Mattey were present and Mr Mattey said ‘Council’s main objections are the changes made by the State Government to change the developments from Category 3 to Category 2 projects and ‘the inability on any non-owning landholders to make submissions to the DAP.’  With Senator Xenophon were Victorian Democratic Labour Senator John Madigan and SA Senator Alex Carracher and also acoustician Steven Cooper.  Mr Cooper explained that the noise that troubles is not high pitched frequencies, but infrasound; low level thumping that penetrates the walls of a home.  Varying pressure is also a problem.  The proposed Stony Gap wind farm would be only 4.5 km from Burra.

She has been a tireless worker and set up the Day Care at the Burra Hospital, where she volunteered for five years before becoming an employee of the Health Service.  After a name change and several locations the Leisure Group was housed in the former Aberdeen Football Club rooms at Burra North.  It became, in its day, the bench mark for SA, due to Mrs Wooton’s hard work.  In 1997, Mrs Wooton was hand picked as one of six from SA to participate in a study, which then became policy.  She has long been a strong advocate for the aged and people with disabilities and special needs.  Many volunteers have joined her over the year.  Over the years more than $75,000 has been raised towards improvements at the centre.  In 2001 Mrs Wooton received SA’s first Arthur Cys’ Medal for service to senior.  In 2010 she was a semi-finalist in the Rural Doctors Workforce Agency/Rural Community Health & Well Being Award.  In 2006 and 2009 the Burra Leisure Group were recipients of the Burra Australia Day Community Event of the Year Award.  About 50 people attended the farewell lunch.  Meryl White said grace.

The family then visited a number of sites in the town associated with their ancestors and then met at the Burra Hotel for dinner, which was also attended by members of the Burra History Group.  On Sunday there were visits to other sites of Burra’s heritage and a service at St John’s Lutheran Church.  Carl Eichler and his wife Henriette with six children arrived in Burra in 1851 from Clausthal in Germany.  Carl had been a miner all his life and the couple were both aged 40 when they migrated.  Their eldest child, August, turned 15 soon after they arrived.  Carl soon joined the gold rush to Victoria, but after three years returned to Burra to be employed at the Mine as a timberman.  He stayed until the Mine closed in 1877.  They owned properties in Illogan Street, and in Millerton.  All the children survived to adulthood and their descendants are now scattered across Australia and New Zealand.  Carl died 12 April 1889 aged 78 and Henriette on the same day 11 years later in 1900 aged 88.

      "content": "Mary White, (Nee Lloyd) of Burra recalled being in the Volunteer Air Observation Corps in WWII as a Burra District air observer.  This was a role she shared with her mother, Annie Lloyd.  As a 13-year-old school girl she recalled leaving school to help her parents work on the farm about six miles northwest of Burra.  He father was in the Volunteer Defence Corps and often away from home.  Often planes were spotted while they were milking, some distance from the phone and she would run to the house to make the report to the Observation Post in Burra, which was operated by Patricia Pledge, Irene Hirschausen (nee Hogan) and Joan Sutton (nee Davies).  The observation post was located behind the shops in the main street at the top of a tower.\n\n[This ‘tower’ had been built in 1910 behind the then Burra Record office in Market Square.  It was a three storey wood and iron structure designed as a photographic studio.  It was destroyed by fire in December 1950.  See Burra Record, VX, 897 (2), 13 July 1910, page 2, Burra Record VX, 902, 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 and Burra Record, 76, 50, 19 Dec. 1950, page 1.]\n\nThe code word when phoning in was ‘Queen Baker three’, but after two years it was changed to ‘Uncle Oboe eight’.  The most common planes they identified were Tiger Moths and Wirroways (fighter).  After the war they were presented with a certificate as a record in appreciation of their Patriotic Response to the Call of Country.\n\n[Photo of Mary White and her certificate.] Mary White Annie Lloyd Patricia Pledge Irene Hirschausen Joan Sutton Burra Market Square Burra Record history WWII Volunteer Air Observation Corps community",

The event kicked off with a celebratory dinner on Friday night at the Bowling Club with traders, organisers and management committee in attendance.  Fair co-ordinators were Leonie Ambler, Ken Jacobs and Paul Marsson.  Market Square and best Place were alive with activity on Saturday morning and visitors formed a long queue at the Burra Town Hall.  The fair was opened by radio personality and columnist Peter Goers.  Visitors were entertained by pianist Bruce Leach.  Traders were kept busy and so was the café area.  The shuttle bus was well patronised.  The Clare Concert Band also played on both days of the fair.  Rusty Relics returned to the Treasure Trove performing a variety of country tunes and Tracey Rains and friends entertained visitors, busking at Patiennes Ice creamery at Burra North.  While Sunday numbers were down a little, the traders were pleased with the success of the event.  Leonie Ambler said in the six years of being at the helm the fair had grown significantly and there was increasing interest from interstate traders.  Stalls had grown from 20 to 40.  The fair was becoming one of the premier events of its kind in SA.  Both the Town Hall and the school gym are almost fully booked for next year.

      "content": "The Eastern Pastoral survey of 1861-62\n\nAlthough some land northeast of Burra had been taken up by pastoralists on ‘occupation leases’ before 1861, the Government got little money from such leases.  A proper survey of the land would enable more accurate boundaries and the creation of more permanent tenure.  In 1861 surveyor James Brook set out from an existing baseline and trig points in the hills northwest of Burra to complete a trigonometrical survey of the north eastern ‘waste lands’.\n\nHe surveyed north to Olary, west to near Quorn and east to the NSW border on Mutooroo Station.  After six months he completed his task in June 1862.  Locating drinkable water was a constant problem for the early surveyors.  The result of his survey was the establishment of pastoral leases, some of them over more than 1,000 square miles and carrying tens of thousands of sheep.  Using these trig points the town site locations for Yunta, Mannahill, Olary and the route to Broken Hill were also established.\n\nIn May 2012 retired Lands Department surveyor Paul Tucker decided to explore some of the original points in the Olary region, established by Brooks 150 years ago.  Just south of Olary, Brooks established a baseline.  Using a simple 100 link surveyor’s chain Brooks measured this line at 8.427 miles.  At each end of this baseline he erected a permanent stone cairn six feet across and six feet high with a central pole eleven feet eight inches high.  Though the centre poles have gone, the cairns remain.  From these trig points the Lands Department surveyor Malcolm Butler established another trig point in 1951 for the surveying of Radium Hill uranium mining reserve.  It was this point that Paul Tucker decided to find.\n\nAfter many calculations and with friend Kevin Kakoschke deputising as his ‘chainman’ determined the spot where the pin marking the point should be.  With the aid of a hand held GPS position fixing device they found the pin under eight inches of dirt.  They went on to find other pegs of the Radium Hill Pioneer Cemetery and some associated with the old uranium mining reserve.  They did, however, enjoy much more comfortable conditions and much better food than the original survey party.

It was begun in early 1988 by Elspeth and Graham Radford established the company from their farm just outside of Burra.  When Elspeth was unable to buy hard-wearing and smart moleskin trousers and co-ordinating shirts for her two young sons, she made her own.  Friends requested similar garments and the company grew from a cottage business to one producing more than 40,000 garments annually.  They were retailed through 120 stores across Australia.  They were also available by mail order from a website and from two retail outlets later opened in Adelaide and Victor Harbor.  It 1995 they won the Telstra & SA Government Small Business Award in the category for fewer than six employees.  [The next paragraph repeats this information, but says they were finalists rather than the winners.]  They were finalists in the 1995 Channel 9 Small Business Show Award and in 1996 Elspeth Radford was a finalist in the 1966 Telstra & SA Government Business Woman of the Year Award. In 1996 The Saltbush Catalogue won a bronze medal in the National Print Awards.  In 2000 the company won the SA Regional Tourism Award for retail and in 2001 Elspeth was again a finalist in the Telstra Business Woman of the Year Award.  The business has developed a loyal customer base, but Elspeth said closing it was the right business decision.  The total retail environment had changed and it was time to move on.  When production moved off shore Elspeth personally visited the factories ensuring professional and ethical practices.  Most production became off shore with specific companies.  She said there had been a huge reduction in tourists coming through, even compared with last year, with only about 50% of the number to the same time.  A final sale of fixtures and fittings will be held in mid August.\n\n[Photo of Elspeth Radford and staff member Kelly Bray at Saltbush this week.] Elspeth Radford Graham Radford Kelly Bray Burra Adelaide Victor Harbor business_closure retail regional_economy",

      "content": "Saltbush Clothing Co.’s Burra store will close its doors for good on 31 July after more than 24 years in operation.  It was begun in early 1988 by Elspeth and Graham Radford established the company from their farm just outside of Burra.  When Elspeth was unable to buy hard-wearing and smart moleskin trousers and co-ordinating shirts for her two young sons, she made her own.  Friends requested similar garments and the company grew from a cottage business to one producing more than 40,000 garments annually.  They were retailed through 120 stores across Australia.  They were also available by mail order from a website and from two retail outlets later opened in Adelaide and Victor Harbor.  It 1995 they won the Telstra & SA Government Small Business Award in the category for fewer than six employees.  [The next paragraph repeats this information, but says they were finalists rather than the winners.]  They were finalists in the 1995 Channel 9 Small Business Show Award and in 1996 Elspeth Radford was a finalist in the 1966 Telstra & SA Government Business Woman of the Year Award. In 1996 The Saltbush Catalogue won a bronze medal in the National Print Awards.  In 2000 the company won the SA Regional Tourism Award for retail and in 2001 Elspeth was again a finalist in the Telstra Business Woman of the Year Award.  The business has developed a loyal customer base, but Elspeth said closing it was the right business decision.  The total retail environment had changed and it was time to move on.  When production moved off shore Elspeth personally visited the factories ensuring professional and ethical practices.  Most production became off shore with specific companies.  She said there had been a huge reduction in tourists coming through, even compared with last year, with only about 50% of the number to the same time.  A final sale of fixtures and fittings will be held in mid August. Elspeth Radford Graham Radford Burra Adelaide Victor Harbor business closure retail manufacturing tourism award",

It was 150 years yesterday that the explorer and his party reached the north coast of Australia to become the first Europeans to traverse the continent from south to north through the centre.  Celebrations are planned at Port Stuart in the NT, at London, Adelaide and at Burra this weekend.  On Friday evening a small exhibition of artefacts associated with the expedition has been arranged and will be opened at the Burra Regional Art Gallery, which is the site of the old Kooringa Telegraph Station.  It was from here that Stuart sent a telegram announcing his success and his return.  There will be a Morse demonstration.  Margaret Blacker of the John McDouall Stuart Society will be the guest speaker in the evening and there will be a dinner at the Burra Hotel.  On Saturday morning a small contingent of horses and riders will assemble at the Burra Pony Club for the re-enactment of Stuart’s arrival.  The group with wagons will stop at Peacock’s Chimney before making their way to the Gallery where Morse code operators will re-enact the transmission of Stuart’s telegram.  The team will then adjourn to the Showgrounds where The Burra Men’s Shed will provide a barbecue luncheon.  There is already a plaque commemorating Stuart’s telegram, placed on the Art Gallery by the John McDouall Stuart Society in 1995, the Burra Jubilee 150 year.

More than 80% of recently planted trees have survived and many planted in previous years have grown well and have made a good contribution to the reclamation of areas damaged by off-road vehicles.  Local schools and interest groups have carried out the work.  A local initiative has seen the formation of the World’s End Action Group.

      "content": "The Centenary of John McDouall Stuart’s Crossing of the Continent was celebrated at Burra at the weekend.  On Friday evening a small exhibition of items from the State Library and associated with the expedition was opened.  John McDouall Stuart Society President Rick Moore was present and Margaret Blacker represented the State Library.  Mr Des Ross of the Royal Caledonian society was the piper for the arrival of the haggis before the gathering adjourned to the Burra Hotel for dinner.  Others present included three members of the Morse Code Fraternity: Lawrie Wallace (86), Ron Lee (84) and Bernie Matson (73) who were to play an important role in Saturday morning’s re-enactment.\n\nMr Wallace said the Stuart expedition played a vital role in the establishment of the Overland Telegraph between Adelaide and Darwin, which was completed in 1872, ten years after the expedition.  This connected Australia to Java via undersea cable and from there to the rest of the world.\n\nOn Saturday morning the arrival of Stuart in Burra was re-enacted.  Trevor Alderson took the role of Stuart and Pauline Bevan took the part of Patrick Auld as they travelled from the Showgrounds to the old Telegraph Station (now the Art Gallery).  Stuart, ill from scurvy, sent the following message: ‘John McDouall Stuart, commander of the South Australian Great Northern Exploring Expedition, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.  Kooringa, December 16, 1862.  Through you, I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor in Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition.  Party behind all well.  I will be in town by the evening train tomorrow.’\n\nThe party then went on to Market Square where Peter Batten, in the role of W.H. Wilkinson read articles from the SA Register of 18 & 20 December 1862, reporting Stuart’s arrival and reception in Kooringa (Burra).  The party then returned to the Showgrounds where a barbecue was hosted by the Burra Men’s Shed to conclude the event.\n\n[Photographs include those of\n\n1. Driver, Geraldine Smedley with Trevor Alderson as Stuart and Pauline Bevan as Patrick Auld.\n\n2. Piper Des Ross leads the plated haggis into the gallery on Friday night.\n\n3.

      "content": "Ruth Norris, Burra’s resident Animal Rescue and Care Officer, has been short listed as a finalist in the 2012 Pride of Australia Awards for untiring and selfless environment work in the community.  She is well known in the community as the person to call when finding a sick or injured animal.  It is not unusual for her to receive up to five calls a day regarding animals.  She is supported by her children and husband Stuart.  She attends call outs for kangaroos, eagles, hawks, owls, echidnas, lizards and more.  She assesses the animals, checks for pouch young and drives them to a vet if she thinks they can be saved or they are mercifully euthanased.   Some are released into the wild after rehabilitation.  In 2006 Ruth was headhunted by the RSPCA to become an Honorary Inspector for the Mid North.  Due to the demand for services the couple have spent more than $10,000 of their own money on caging facilities.  After 4½ years the RSPCA decided to abolish the honorary positions due to legislation.  Ruth and Stuart have continued the service and began their own Animal Rescue & Care Incorporated Association from November 2011.  This involves liaison with SES, police, CFS, Regional Councils, the Department of Environment & Natural Resources, local vets, etc. to ensure the best outcomes for animals.  Ruth became an International Horse Riding Instructor in the 1980s and studied Animal Attending at Gilles Plains TAFE in 2004, where she was the Student of the Year.  She is also a qualified Equine, Small Animal and Human Bowen Therapist.  She is currently studying a BSc full time at the University of New England, majoring in Zoology.  Ruth’s nomination was submitted by Stuart with support from Goyder Council, Burra Police, DENR, Clare Animal Health and Clare Veterinary Clinic.  The winners will be selected at a Pride of Australia Ceremony to be held in Adelaide in September.\n\n[Photo of Stuart and Ruth Norris.] Ruth Norris Stuart Stuart Norris RSPCA Burra Mid North Gilles Plains TAFE University of New England Adelaide award community animal rescue volunteer education",

John Lewis came from all over the world for a family reunion in Burra last weekend.\n\nJohn Lewis [born 1842 at Brighton SA] was privately educated until age 12 when he began working on the family farm at Balaklava.  At 14 he ran away from home to become an apprentice blacksmith at Meadows before working on stations throughout SA.  In 1872 he went to the NT where he obtained a lease on the Coburg Peninsula.  He was commissioned by the Government as a courier between the construction parties on the northern and southern ends of the Overland Telegraph.  He organised prospecting expeditions and Pine Creek Gold Reef was the chief find.  On returning to SA he married Martha Anne Brook [September 1876] and they settled at Burra where with William Lister and James Shakes they formed the stock and station agency of Bagot, Shakes and Lewis.  He conducted huge stock sales, once disposing of 47,000 sheep and 1,200 cattle.  He served for three years in the [Town Council: December 1879-November 1981].  He was prominent in local organisations.  The family had six children:\n\nJames Brook Lewis: a surgeon who also worked in Gwalior with geologist Herbert Hoover, late US President.\n\nGilbert Norman Lewis.\n\nEssington Lewis.\n\nEleanor [Mary] Lewis.

Much work on the family tree has been done by Bob Lewis; a son of Essington and by Sandy Lewis; the Hon. A.A. Lewis, a WA politician and son of Lance Lewis.  Bronwyn thought it was time to act as Bob had died and few of his generation were still alive.  A year of work saw 85 gathered at the Burra Town Hall representing four generations of the family.\n\nJohn Lewis’s Children:\n\nJames Brook Lewis was known as Brook and studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and at Melbourne to complete his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery.  He went to WA where he worked in the wheat belt and on the goldfields and was doctor at Gwalia when Herbert Hoover was overseer of the mines there before returning to the USA and becoming President.\n\nGilbert Norman Lewis farmed at ‘Bundaleer’ before becoming a Major in the Indian Army and a champion polo player.  He later bought land in WA from where his great-grandson, Nick Trethowan, spoke of being the fourth generation on ‘Balgarup’ in Kojonup.  He was a great horseman and polo player.  His great grandson, Peter Trethowan, has been a professional polo player.\n\nEssington Lewis was officially recognised at the centenary of Federation celebrations as one of the 100 most influential Australians.  He is the subject of Geoffrey Blainey’s book Man of Steel and John O’Donoghue’s play I am Work.  He was Managing Director of BHP and in WWII Director General of Munitions.\n\nEleanor (Nell) Lewis served as a nurse in WWI.  She later married George Cowan.\n\nFlorence (Jane) Lewis stayed in the Clare Valley and married Alec Melrose.  Their wedding present was ‘Kadlunga’ where the fourth generation of Lewis descendants still live.\n\nLancelot (Ashley) Lewis died aged 52 but still made his mark.  At 9 he rode alone from Burra to Adelaide and at 12 he made a journey from Burra to Warrnambool.  He served in WWI [where he was severely wounded.  He worked for Bagot, Shakes & Lewis and later was Managing Director of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.

      "content": "Stephen Holder, a great grandson of Sir Frederick William Holder, and his wife Gale travelled from New Mexico to Australia to meet relatives and visit the town where his ancestor had played such an important role.  Stephen’s grandfather was born in Kooringa in 1882, the third of eight children to Sir Frederick and his wife Julia, nee Stephens.  During their two day visit the couple were treated to a fine dinner at the Burra Town Hall hosted by the Burra History Group and the Town Hall Committee and on Friday morning Stephen unveiled the recently erected plaque in Holder Garden on Chapel Street. Burra History Group president Meredith Satchell co-ordinated the visit and said that F.W. Holder was an unsung hero of the town.  She could think of no other Burra resident who was so involved with community activities and who rose to such important positions in SA and Federal Governments.  He was born in Happy Valley SA 1850 and died in Melbourne in 1909.  In 1875 he came to Burra as a teacher and subsequently was a shopkeeper and manager, owner and editor of the Burra Record from 1880-90.  He was also an architect, JP and coroner.  While in Burra he was a local preacher, and took a prominent part in the Burra Parliamentary Club, Burra Young Men’s United Association, the Rifle Club, Burra Floricultural Society and the Burra School Board of Advice.  He instigated the Burra Volunteer Rifle Company and at one time was chairman of the Burra Institute Committee, Burra Mutual Improvement Association, IOR Friendly Society, the Temperance Movement in Burra and the Redruth Band of Hope.  He also acted as Curator of the Cemetery, Secretary of the Local Board of Health and Town Clerk.  He found time to be Secretary or Treasurer of the Chinese Famine Relief Committee and the Burra Show Committee and was later Patron of the Cricket and Football Clubs.  He was Mayor in 1887 & 1889 and in 1887 was elected to the SA House of Assembly for the District of Burra.  He left Burra in 1891, but continued as its MP until transferring to the Federal Parliament in 1901.  He was SA Premier in 1892 and 1899-1901 and also served as the Treasurer.  He was elected Speaker of the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901 and held that office till his death.\n\n[Photo of Stephen unveiling the plaque with Gale standing nearby.] Stephen Holder Gale Sir Frederick William Holder Julia Stephens Meredith Satchell New Mexico Australia Kooringa Burra Burra Town Hall Holder Garden Chapel Street Happy Valley SA Melbourne history visit heritage community",

Last year’s conference was held at Swansea and in 2013 a conference will be held at Santiago in Chile.

The copper smelters there often accounted for 50% of the world’s output in those decades.  The Economic and Social Research Council awarded Swansea University and its partners £95,000 to raise awareness of the rich heritage of a once famed Welsh copper industry.

Among the acknowledgements were letters from the Queen, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other Parliamentarians.  There was also a papal blessing from Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nMrs Abbot was born Marie Hogan at Leighton on 23 October 1912.  She attended Leighton Primary School until the age of 10 and then went to St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding, where she also learnt to play violin and piano.  She went to school by horse and cart.  Later she went on to teach music, mostly in the Booborowie area and often travelled to lessons by horse and sulky.  Mrs Abbott played the church organ until she was 90.  She fondly remembers sing-a-longs around the piano in the days before television or radio.  She also recalls when the evening entertainment was often bridge or euchre around the table or going to her grandparents’ house to listen to concerts on the wireless or to neighbour’s houses to listen to the match commentary when Australia played England for the Ashes.  She finds the biggest changes in her lifetime were the result of cars, telephones and electricity.  When she was first married she lived in an uninsulated prefab house that was very hot in summer.  There was neither a fridge nor a washing machine and the fire had to be lit to get any hot water.  After the birth of their third child they got a kerosene refrigerator.\n\n[Photo:  Mrs Marie Abbott and the papal blessing.]\n Marie Abbott Mary Queen Prime Minister Leader of the Opposition Pope Benedict XVI Adelaide Leighton Spalding Booborowie community celebration biography",

Tickets are $10 per person.  There will also be a lottery with just 100 tickets at $50 each.  First prize is $1,000.  The railway station is an example of the stunning work of volunteer Roy Taplin, who was responsible for the magnificent makeover of the Town Hall.  People will be able to see the work he has done by visiting the railway station for morning tea on Saturday 17 November.  He has transformed the eastern rooms from being full of pigeon droppings and white ants into what will shortly be an inhabitable space.  He has made kitchen cupboards from recycled floor boards and so saved thousands of dollars.  The Burra Railway Station Working Party will host the quiz.  When finished the station will become an interpretive centre for the history of Burra and the railway station, will house a pigmy bluetongue display, and house bed and breakfast accommodation.  Flinders University Archaeology Department and the SA Museum are committed to a display of the ancient mega-fauna of the region and Ngadjuri elder Vincent Copley is working to secure funding for a Ngadjuri Interpretive Display.  The Burra History group expect to have a room featuring the history of the building and the railway.

      "content": "Joyce Lloyd has been named Burra Ward Citizen of the Year.  Joyce was born on the family farm ten miles out from Burra in 1924 and after attending Ayers School she left at the age of 14 to work on the farm, as her brothers were at the war.  She attended weekly lectures at Leighton Hall for first aid and emergency services and she knitted socks, balaclavas, jumpers, mittens and scarves to send to soldiers and made home made pasties for the Burra sheep sales to raise money for the Red Cross.  Joyce married Ray Lloyd in 1948 and they moved to a farm six miles from Burra.  She was an office bearer at the Hanson CWA in the 1960s until it closed and then transferred her membership to the Burra branch until it too closed.  Joyce has given many floral art demonstrations in the wider district – at Hanson, Burra, Farrell Flat, Clare, Spalding, Booborowie, Hallett, Jamestown and Willalo.  The Burra Burra DC also asked the Burra Floral Art Club to exhibit a floral display in Victoria Square as part of the Adelaide Flower festival.  Mrs Lloyd belonged to the Club in Burra and taught floral art from the 1960s to the present day.  She regularly provided floral arrangements for school speech nights at the Town Hall and for other occasions.  She has been a member of the Farrell Flat Golf Club until the couple moved to Burra in 1972 and is a current member of the Burra Golf Club, in which she has held a variety of offices, including that of President.  She has won the Championship four times and continued to play pennants till four years ago.  She was Zone President of the Mid North Ladies Gold Union for two years and has played most of the Adelaide courses.  She assisted Jim Richards in teaching young golfers – meeting them at the golf club at 8 a.m. on Saturday mornings throughout the winter months.  Since 1974 she has been a member of the Burra Bowling Club where she has been President and a selection committee member.  She won the championship twice along with many other competitions and currently plays in the pennant team.  She has been involved in the Burra Op Shop, the Burra Market Square Museum, the Burra art Gallery, China Painting Classes.  She has also been closely involved with theBurra Show Society and the Clare show with both entries and judging in a range of sections including flowers, needlework, cooking, china and floral art.  For more than 50 years she has provided floral decorations for weddings and receptions and made bridal bouquets and buttonholes.  She has taught many to knit, tat, crochet and cook and remains a keen gardener.

      "content": "Historic Unveiling of the First Kooringa Cemetery\n\nYesterday morning a small group of people gathered for the unveiling of the newly restored original Kooringa Cemetery.  This is located at the end of Chapel Street and has long been hidden from most people’s knowledge except for history buffs and researchers.  A meeting about three years ago it was decided to see the site restored.  Roger and Jenny Cross undertook extensive research to uncover its history and there was a degree of heavier work in shifting rocks, laying pathways and clearing weeds.\n\nIn the process items from the original site that were washed into Burra Creek by wild floods in the 1850s were recovered, including part of a wooden cross that features in the construction of the shelter.\n\nJenny Cross discovered that the cemetery is possibly home to more than 150 graves, the majority being children and infants.\n\nOf particular interest is the grave of Thomas Pickett, the discoverer of the Burra Mine, who died in 1851 and also rests in the First Kooringa Cemetery.\n\nAt the time of his death Pickett was no afforded a decent funeral by the SA Mining Association, but rather through the efforts of the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel).  He was reimbursed the following month by the Association.\n\nThe site contains several graves all facing west, with pathways to Pickett’s grave and also a memorial stone in recognition of the workers, workers’ wives and children who were not recognised by the Mining Association.\n\nThe three information boards contain a brief history of the old and new cemeteries and a list of the names of those buried at the first cemetery.\n\nJenny Cross gave an informative address.  She touched on the lives of the people who created the town and in particular referred to Henry Ayers, Kingston who designed some of its cottages and Mortlock who made much money from the mine and started life as publican in the Burra Hotel.  Of course the people who really made Burra were the workforce; those who laboured for the Mining Association and suffered on behalf of the Monster Mine.  Research shows that from 1845 to about 1850 at least 150 people died.  It is likely that most if not all of them are buried here.  The memorial headstone is in recognition of these people who have no recognition other than this.\n\nGoyder Council CEO John Brak had the honour of unveiling the shelter with the story boards.  The first Kooringa Cemetery is open to the public and it is hoped it will soon be included on the Burra Heritage Passport Trail.  [4 Photos]\n\n[A number of the statements above that are framed in a quite positive format should be stated rather more tentatively.  They rest on information that is suggestive rather than conclusive.\n\nIt would be difficult to place a date on which floods swept items into the Burra Creek.\n\nThe list of those possibly interred in the cemetery is quite sensibly derived from registration of deaths records.  For this period those records do not record the place of death.  They are records for ‘The District of the Murray’, which covered a large area of the north and east of SA.  Kooringa was the only large settlement and so it is reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of those deaths occurred there and that the burials were in this cemetery.\n Roger Cross Jenny Cross Thomas Pickett Henry Ayers Mortlock John Brak First Kooringa Cemetery Chapel Street Burra Creek Burra Miners' Arms Hotel Burra Hotel Burra Heritage Passport Trail The District of the Murray Kooringa heritage cemetery unveiling history",

Now this building that has become an icon of the Mid North is in danger of structural collapse after a rear corner of it fell down.  A restoration fund has been set up to save the structure.  While privately owned by the Stockman family it has become a most recognisable symbol of settlement in this area of SA.  The cottage dates from the period 1915-20.  Its image can be found at Adelaide Airport and at Dubai and in countless tourism and heritage promotions.  Bruce Stockman is the project facilitator.  Architectural advice urges stabilising the roof as soon as possible.  A local builder and mason have been organised and materials have been sourced, but funds are needed.  The building came to widespread notice after it featured as the cover picture on the Midnight Oil band’s Diesel and Dust album in 1987.  Donations can be made to the Burra Branch of BankSA to the Midnight Oil Cottage Preservation Fund.

They began at Yarrawonga last Monday and will have the company of Lisa Smedley and Ron & Geraldine Smedley as road crew.  The charts have been available since 1975 following an adventurous trip by the couple in a boat called Peregrine from Murray Bridge to Yarrawonga in 1973-74.  More than 60,000 copies have since been sold, with regular updates as the charts have been reprinted.  Now there has been a good flow down the river for the first time in many years, they have deemed it timely to undertake a major update.  They will travel in a 4.2 m runabout and expect to take up to eight weeks for the 1,420 km round trip.  The new eighth edition is to be released in time for Christmas.

      "content": "[This short article needs a little untangling.\n\nTrixie Pearce was more formally Beatrice Eleanor Pearce 1885-1927, known generally as Trix.\n\nHer sister Nell was Victoria Nellie Pearce, who married Archibald Dearlove.\n\nIt was her sister Miss Gertrude Pearce (1875-1949) who worked for the Burra Record; being a journalist on the staff for 26½ years until she retired in January 1944.\n\nThere was no Ladies Mounted Band.  The young women of the Cheer-up Society in Burra formed the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band, which appeared first in February 1917.  It was seen as necessary as the town band had been so depleted by enlistments for war service.  It was never mounted.  The confusion originated when a group of 42 young women, mounted on horses, formed a guard of honour for the Governor when he visited Burra in October 1915.  The Governor was so impressed that he asked them to go to Adelaide the following month to repeat their performance when he opened the Cheer-up Hut.\n\nAbove: a photograph of a couple of dozen of the Cheer-up Ladies on their mounts on the banks of the Burra Creek with Kingston Street Bridge in the background.\n\nThe reference to the Charge of the Light Brigade is a little misplaced.  That occurred on 25 October 1854 during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War.\n\nThe reference should be to the famous charge by the Australian Light Horse in the battle to take Beersheba on 31 October 1917.  It was in this attack that Lieut. Reg. Sandland (not Sandlands) lost his life.  Lieut. Norman McBride of the 3rd Light Horse was also killed in action in Palestine on 22 December 1917.] Trixie Pearce Beatrice Eleanor Pearce Victoria Nellie Pearce Archibald Dearlove Miss Gertrude Pearce Lieut.

The premier met Mr Taplin during a visit to the Burra Railway Station this year.  Mr Taplin, a retired master painter and decorator has carried out meticulous restoration at the Burra Town Hall and following the receipt of a Government Grant in 2010 began work on the Burra Railway Station.  Here there was extensive termite damage and the interior had been invaded by pigeons.  A local builder and plumber were appointed to assist, but Mr Taplin co-ordinated the project and also carried out many major repairs and undertook the painting.  His efforts included replacing floor stumps, repairs to fretting walls, replacement of rotting and termite damaged architraves and skirting, manufacturing kitchen cupboards and mantelpieces as well as the painting.  The station will ultimately house an interpretive centre focussed on Burra’s natural history prior to European settlement.  Roy is very reluctant to seek any publicity or acknowledgement of his work and so was not informed of his nomination, said friend and President of the Burra History group Ms Meredith Satchell.  She said previous experience had suggested he would probably have declined the award had he learned of it.  As a consequence Ms Satchell accepted the awards for Roy at the Bob Hawkes Building at the University of South Australia last Tuesday night and handed it to him at the railway station later.

      "content": "World War I Soldiers Project\n\nWith the centenary of the outbreak of World War I approaching in 2014 and the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli in the following year, The Burra History Group is preparing a descriptive list of the servicemen and servicewomen who appear on the large roll of Honour in the Burra RSL Room/Council Chamber.\n\nThe intention is to provide family researchers and other interested parties with a brief summary of family details so that the bare surname and initials on the roll can be properly identified.  To do this we have tried to find the full name, date and place of birth and the name of the parents, for each person on the Honour Roll.  We have then outlined the bare details of their war service and, where possible this has been supplemented with a photograph.\n\nA significant number of the servicemen wrote letters home that were published in the Burra Record.  We aim to include these because they bring to life the personalities of these young men from a century ago.  The first groups of young volunteers from Burra went to Egypt and from there to the appalling conditions of Gallipoli.  Many were then transferred to France and endured the unimaginable horrors of the Western Front in France and Belgium.  Some became prisoners of war.  Others remained in the Middle East and saw action in Palestine as the allied forces fought their way north to Syria.  A few served in the Royal Australian Navy and one or two transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in the later stages of the conflict.  Another small group joined up in England and served with the British Army.  A small number of nurses saw service in the UK, France, the Middle East, India, and on hospital ships.\n\nThe letters reveal fascinating details of their experiences, some of which are remarkably frank about the conditions, considering that they passed through censorship.  There are accounts of experiences at the front, but even more about personal thoughts and experiences on leave.  Some soldiers in England managed to see quite a lot of the tourist sites and those struggling up though Palestine recount how the Bible was coming to life before their eyes, as they visited Bethlehem, Jerusalem or Jericho.\n\nSince there are 490 names on the Honour Roll, gathering this information has been a large task spread over several years.  In the end it is intended to make the results available in digital format and we are investigating ways of making the material accessible at a couple of sites in the town and on a CD.  At this stage we have completed the collection of the basic material for most of those on the roll, but we need some help to complete the undertaking.
