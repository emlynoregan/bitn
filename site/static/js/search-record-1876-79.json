They considered deferring the first issue due to difficulties experienced, but decided to publish a slightly smaller issue.  [It was five columns wide instead of six.]\n\nEditorial.  Inaugural\n\nIt has often been a matter of surprise that a local paper has never been started in Burra.  In the palmy days of the Mine from 1846 to 1852 the population was large and thriving, but of a different class from that now included in the district.  At the time there were no provincial papers in SA and not more than three papers in Adelaide.  But times have changed greatly and several important towns in the colony have had one or even two newspapers for years.  It is difficult to explain why Burra has lagged behind ‘but even if there has hitherto been any serious impediment to the starting of a local paper, we venture to think that the important changes which, during the past three years, have taken place in the district, have removed any such impediment, and that the time has arrived for establishing a journalistic organ of our own.’\n\nWe think that a town with its own Council ought to support a newspaper.  Indeed a respectably conducted newspaper ought to add as much to the status of a town as a Council does.  Our intention is not to trumpet Burra’s fame to the world.

In fact the most brilliant period of Burra’s history is a thing of the past, but there are today indications of steady improvement, giving hopes of a brighter future than seemed possible a few years ago.\n\nThe prospects of the Mine again proving very profitable are encouraging, but Burra is no longer entirely dependent on the Mine for its prosperity.  Important as the Mine is, the extension of agricultural settlement in the surrounding districts is a great source of prosperity.  Burra is the focus of a great are of wheat and wool growing country to the north, west and east.  These lands are becoming more densely settled every year and Burra’s importance as the central town of such a large district will become greater.\n\nWith a greater population the need for a local paper increases.  Local wants require more persistent advocacy than we can expect to get from the impartial journals of the metropolis.  Local grievances need airing and local resources and institutions need to be kept before the public.  We hope that local tradesmen and manufacturers will see the advantage of advertising their businesses.\n\nIn politics we will be liberal, always taking the side of progress, seeking to promote the prosperity of the Colony in general and of the Burra District in particular.  While exposing abuses we will seek to avoid scurrility.  Our columns will be open for the free exchange of views on matters of public interest.  We shall be glad to receive concise well-written letters of news from the Northern Areas and also such other literary assistance as our friends may be able and willing to supply.  We trust that in a few months our paper will come to be regarded as a necessity.  Burra SA Adelaide local newspaper community mining agriculture politics",

      "content": "SA Government Policy\n\n[There is an article of just over one column reflecting on the policies of the Boucaut Government.  Boucaut had made much of stamp duties, but had been frustrated by the Upper House.  The Boucaut ministry fell on the 6 June and the writer considered the new Colton Government was an incongruous mixture of ministers.  Colton had announced extensions of railways and improvements to harbours and jetties.  Other matters were a water supply for Yorke Peninsula and improvements to the Real Property Act, land laws and mining laws.  Tariffs would be changes in the direction of free trade.  The most important new railways were to be to Government Gums 212 miles north of Pt Augusta, to open up new mineral areas and extend settlement.  The other line of importance was from Kapunda to Morgan to tap the river trade.  Other railways planned were to connect Pt Pirie, Gladstone and Jamestown and to connect the mining centres of Yorke Peninsula to the city via Barunga Gap and Hamley Bridge.  The extension of the Burra line to Hallett and eventually to the Barrier Ranges area in NSW was of greater concern to Burra.  The writer hoped the new Government would get on with its program and saw great hopes for the future in the growth of settlement and trade.] Boucaut Colton Mr Rees Yorke Peninsula Pt Augusta Kapunda Morgan Pt Pirie Gladstone Jamestown Barunga Gap Hamley Bridge Burra Hallett Barrier Ranges NSW the city politics railways infrastructure land_law mining tariffs settlement",

As far as cleanliness of body is concerned a number of things militate against it.  A well ventilated dwelling and purity of atmosphere are to be desired.  But where there are foul smells, foul drains cloacæ of the vilest and most disgusting class, the ground strewn with offal and the most excrementitious filth, then typhoid and scarlet fever will abound and have not been absent from the town for the past two years.  As many as ten contemporaneous cases of typhoid have attracted the attention of the Board of Health.  The cemetery can bear silent witness to the continuous influx of children who might otherwise have become healthy and useful adults.  The system of allotments cut up by speculators into insignificant fragments to be sold or rented at a high price without any care and proper accommodation of the labouring population is an arrangement, which in comparatively warm climates, such as our own, constitutes a perfect nursery for epidemic and contagious diseases.\n\nThe preacher [Rev. H. Howitt] condemned the overcrowding which prevails in the wretched dwelling houses that are so supinely tolerated in the town.  There is, he said, an apparent want of energy on the part of various official persons, to whom he had made urgent and repeated addresses in vain, for some prompt action to prevent the spread of demoralising tendencies and malaria.\n\nIt was this lack of action that had prompted his use of the pulpit.

Dangers was found to have some notes hidden in his sock.\n\nWhen examined Jackson admitted he had been drinking Sunday morning and might have given Dangers the money.\n\nCharles Odgers was examined and denied taking the money, but said Dangers had offered to fight him for £1 and had gone to Jackson’s room and come out with some notes in the purse.  Dangers had then said that he was flush with money, let’s go and shout.\n\nDangers said they did not fight, but being in liquor, he afterwards forgot where he had put the money and thought Odgers had stolen it.\n\nThe bench dismissed the case.

Neither has anyone in authority found fault.  I challenge  anyone to show anywhere in SA where an equal number of working men and their families have so much room for each individual and where the sanitary condition of a township is superior to that of Kooringa.  On a previous occasion Paxton Square was denounced as a hotbed of sickness.  Bur here there are 33 houses, containing 91 rooms varying from 17  ft  by   15 ft to 14 ft square and 10 ft high under the ceiling, in which reside 161 adults and children.  The place has been pronounced by everyone else the most healthy, most roomy and best ventilated houses and there has been less sickness and death in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in any other part of the neighbourhood.  The company’s houses compare favourably with workmen’s houses belonging to other people in the neighbourhood or to any other place in the colony.\n\nAs for the system of allotments allegedly cut up by speculative owners: has not a company an equal right to charge a fair value on their property and choose, or refuse to sell or lease, as any private individual has?  The township is not in fact cut into insignificant fragments.  Each house built by the company has a greater piece of land than the houses in the Government Township of Redruth, or in Aberdeen.  Anyone can have 1, 2, 3 or 4 allotments if he wishes to purchase them.\n\nThe company is far from illiberal.  It has given land to every section of the Christian church, sufficient to build a place of worship and a minister’s residence.  Also it has given a cemetery, a slaughterhouse site, an acre for an Institute, land and buildings for use of a hospital (valued at £650) and has just given an acre to the Church of England for a place of worship, which at prevailing prices is worth £525.  Also it has given land for a main road towards Baldina and is about to give land for a public school and playground for 1,000 pupils.  These facts speak for themselves.\n\nI am sorry anyone should so far forget themselves as to denounce a company which has done so much and is still doing so much good for the community.\n\nOur pay sheet is at present about £28,000 per annum, the greater part of which is spent in these townships.\n\nI, 1 (2), 7 July 1876, page 4 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 2 on the microfilm.] Robert Sanders Reverend preacher Burra Mine Kooringa Paxton Square Redruth Aberdeen Baldina sanitation company community housing donations",

Lines hitherto had been 5’3”.]\n\nWe wonder why the 4’8” [sic: for 4’8½”] was not adopted at the outset, when it was common in the UK.  With some 400 miles of track contemplated it is an important consideration, especially as the Pt Augusta line is seen as the first instalment of a transcontinental line to Pt Darwin.\n\nThe savings in a 3’6” line must be considerable.  The savings in sleepers alone is significant.  Some say that the 3’6” gauge is not cheapest in the long run.  But we think this decision is wise. Even if the 3’6” lines are limited to 20-25 m.p.h. it will be a great improvement on the speed of wagons or drays.  A line built cheaply at say £2,500 per mile to operate at 20 m.p.h. might serve for five years.  In our circumstance (where it is important to open up large areas of new country quickly, at minimal cost) this is better than a line costing £5,000 per mile to operate at 40 m.p.h. with a life of 10 years. An instance of this is the Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta lines, which we believe were constructed at a cost of less than £2,400 per mile and are satisfactorily carrying heavy loads at 20 m.p.h.  We believe there will be no great delays in starting the Pt Augusta and North West Bend [Morgan] lines and that these lines will herald the commencement of a new and prosperous era for SA.

He appears to have suffered from the delusion that ‘An Inhabitant’ is myself.  But even that error does not excuse the deliberate misstatements which his letter contains.  He says no fault has been found in Paxton Square by anyone with authority to do so.  He knows it is my duty as Medical officer of Health to report such matters as I see fit, to the Board of Health in Adelaide.  Captain Sanders says everyone except one (meaning me) has reported Paxton Square as being very healthy.  Yet he knows the Inspector reported exactly the opposite and only the other day the President of the Board of Health said to one of our Councillors that the statements of the Inspector and myself were fully corroborated by what he had seen and heard in Paxton Square.\n\nUnless his opinions have changed marvellously in the past month or two Dr Cave will bear me out that the place is a hotbed of disease.  Captain Sanders says there is a letter to Sir Henry Ayers that there are no two families in the same house and where the largest numbers are, it is a husband, wife and small children.  Dr Gosse remarked that common sense tells you that there could not be seven children all small.  In fact in one house they were all ages from 21 downwards.  If no one has found fault, why has Captain Sanders caused new pits to be dug?  I am glad Captain Sanders is to treat this letter with silent contempt because in replying he would only further lower himself in the estimation of all thinking men.\n\nCaptain Sanders becomes quite gushing over the liberality of SAMA.  I can only rejoice that Kapunda and Gawler have no such liberal companies in their midst.\n\n‘An Inhabitant’ writes again, to affirm that Dr Nesbitt did not write his earlier letter and had no knowledge of its subject matter, or of its intended publication.\n\nW.

Howitt [Rector of St Mary’s]\n\nThe observations made in my sermon of 25 June were based on my own observations, on the reports of the Government Health Officer and of the Inspector of the central Board of Health and upon the fact that ten cases of typhoid prevailed in Paxton Square at the one time.  Dr Gosse, Chairman of the Central Board of Health, inspected the Square last Friday and confirmed these reports.  I do not think I need to offer any further justification of myself.  The directors are nearly as much to blame as their local supervisor.  The sanitary authorities agree that typhoid fever is the direct product of filth and defective drainage.\n\nScarlatina and typhoid fever have prevailed in Burra more or less for the two and a half years I have known it.  It is quite within the lines of my duty, as I conceive it, to preach on this subject as on any other.

He had been staying at Aberdeen for two or three weeks and then went to Mr Dare’s at Piltimitiappa, where he was laid up with a severe cold for almost a fortnight. Dr Dashwood said there was nothing he could do, as the man had been dying for hours.  The final cause of death was bronchitis.  The deceased was an old colonist, having arrived on the Canton in 1838.  Mr Dobney of Kooringa came in the same vessel and says the deceased was the son of Captain R.M. Robson, formerly of the East India Co. and he had previously resided at the Reedbeds [Adelaide] where he worked for the Government; he believed in the Customs service.  It is though Robson had at one time been a sailor.  He was discharged from the steamer Moolgewanke at Goolwa 18 September 1858.  He was carrying a newspaper clipping from a Melbourne paper, supposedly from 1864, saying: ‘On 14th inst. at Sandhurst Eliza Anne, wife of Robert Moss Robson late of the East India Co. and mother of Mrs S.A. Crawford.'\n\nThe deceased was aged 42.  [SA Deaths CD says Frank Robson died 18 July 1876 Kooringa, residence near Kooringa aged 40.] Francken Robson Dr Dashwood Mr Dobney Captain R.M.

No order was made, as the old man was barely able to support his own family.\n\nW. Peel Nesbitt, Government Medical Officer, writes in reply to ‘A Lover of Fair Play.’\n\nIt is the duty of the Government Medical Officer to report to the central Board of Health, there being no Local Board of Health in the district.\n\nIt was not my duty to apply to anyone else in the first place for several reasons:\n\nAn Inspector was required to examine the place reported.\n\nHe and not I complained of the accommodation and ventilation.  I am the Government Medical Officer, not the District Council Medical Officer.  The District Council has no jurisdiction in such matters and does not know about typhoid fever.\n\nThe Government Medical Officer is ex officio a Medical Officer of Health.\n\nI have held the appointment since November.\n\n‘Considering the circumstances under which Dr Dashwood ceased to hold the appointment, I am surprised that he should have alluded to it.’\n\nTo Dr Cave’s letter I would reply:\n\nI have never said the first case of typhoid occurred in Paxton Square, but\n\nThere were 9 cases there to my knowledge.  Dr Cave mentions one more (Morris) and I have seen one since, making a total of 11.\n\nThe fact that there are other places as bad or worse does not make Paxton Square good.\n\n& 5.  Dr Cave says there was only one case of scarlatina in Paxton Square.  How does he know how many I saw?  And how many had no medical attendance at all?  I saw three cases there.  He says that the place is not a hotbed of disease and I said that unless his opinions had undergone a marvellous change he would bear me out.  ‘I can only regret they should have thus changed.’\n\nTo show I was not making a statement without foundation, I will quote a few figures.  The population of Burra at the last census was over 3,300.  The population of Paxton Square according to Captain Sanders is 161.  Dr Cave says there were 20 cases of scarlatina in the district and taking Dr Cave’s estimation of the number of cases (1) Paxton Square had more than its share, but including the cases I know of (4), it had more than three times its share.\n\nYet Dr Cave says there is less sickness there than in any other parts of the district.  Also Mr Daniel’s and Dr Cave’s own houses, though not actually, are, for all sanitary purposes, virtually in Paxton Square and in both fatal cases occurred.  By Dr Cave’s statement if Paxton Square had less sickness that any other part of the district there should have been over 100 cases of typhoid in the district and by my figure of 11 cases, the district should have had more than 220.\n\nCaptain Sanders accuses me of ‘interfering’ and is then surprised that I resent it.\n\n‘Let Dr Cave write on this subject to Board of Health in Adelaide and see if those gentlemen do not place as much reliance on his statements as they did on those of Captain Sanders and Dr Dashwood.

I am inclined to think he never thought of such a course.\n\nDr Nesbitt has no personal or mean motives in this controversy – it is, after all, more to his advantage than otherwise if people are sick.\n\nIt is evident that Dr Cave was once of Dr Nesbitt’s opinion with respect to the sickness in Paxton Square, but because of his position as Mine Surgeon is anxious to keep in favour with Captain Sanders and so gave up his manliness and now says what Captain Sanders tells him to say.\n\nIs it not strange that Dr Cave, Dr Dashwood, Captain Sanders and ‘A Lover of Fair Play’ should all send in letters at the same time, taking the same view?\n\nI can understand Captain Sanders and Mr West becoming annoyed at a suggestion of neglect of duty on their part, though I do not think that was Dr Nesbitt’s intention.  I an sure the inhabitants of the Square are grateful for Dr Nesbitt’s course, which has resulted in the company improving their homes.\n\nThe inhabitants of Kooringa are fortunate to have secured the services of so able a gentleman; a man of independent character whose social life is above reproach.

It seems a pity for medical men to quarrel, as occasionally they are compelled to work together; hence I am surprised Dr Nesbitt should have purposely laid himself out to war with me.  He asserts that ‘my statements are no more to be relied on than my friendship’, but I would remind him that his general behaviour makes it impossible for any straightforward man to be friendly with him for any length of time.\n\nAs he has made so much noise about Paxton Square I think I can prove to the public that he first manufactured typhoid fever at his own home and then sent it into the square by his servant, as both his groom and groom’s wife suffered from the disease while in his house.  Dr Nesbitt was asked to remove a large quantity of manure and rubbish from the back of his premises.  Shortly after this his servants fell ill.  As the groom’s wife, Mrs Hewitson, was expecting to be confined every day, he sent her to Mrs Tonkin’s in the Square, next door to Andrew’s.  She was very ill for ten days and was then confined.  Dr Nesbitt could not make out the nature of her illness.  I was called in consultation and pointed out she was suffering from typhoid fever.  A day or two later one of the Andrews took it, then Mrs Tonkin.  I have since found three others in the Andrews family also suffered.  Northey and Morris had it only mildly.\n\nDr Nesbitt misrepresents my letter to Captain Sanders.\n\nI said twenty cases of malignant scarlet fever, of which one was in Paxton Square; Dr Nesbitt’s patient, who died.  Ordinary scarlatina was scattered through the district with hundreds of cases.  The twenty I alluded to were all very severe, and out of them thirteen died.  Let Dr Nesbitt behave himself as a gentleman and he will not find any occasion to abuse me again.\n\nAlfred Cave.

While the medical gentleman answers some, he evades others on the plea that those answers are included in the former.  In a strict sens perhaps this is so, but I think courtesy would have indicated to him the propriety of first calling attention of the SA Mining Assoc. manager to the condition of their property, before taking the step of complaining to the Board of Health, thereby bringing the company into public contempt in a matter of which they were quite ignorant.\n\nWhy should a complaint be made against Paxton Square when there are other places in a worse state?  The public think he should have pointed out the worst places first.  His actions must have been due to either want of judgement, lack of courtesy, or a desire to take the ‘rise’ out of the company.\n\nThe Medical Officers between them are well able to answer for themselves, but it seems strange that, while accusing Dr Cave of being reckless with logic, he himself is so unlogical [sic] as to attempt to show by figures that Paxton Square has had more than its fair share of scarlatina and typhoid, when it is a well known fact that cases of fever frequently occur in outside and isolated localities where the sanitary condition is good and from the burlesque of an inspection that has been made, this may be the case in Paxton Square, for anything the public may know to the contrary.  Before the public can come to any fair conclusion we must have a thorough inspection at which the Corporation and all interested parties should be present to see there is such a thing as a hotbed of disease in our midst.\n\n‘A Lover of Fair Play’ Dr Cave A Lover of Fair Play SA Mining Assoc. manager Kooringa Paxton Square Board of Health Corporation sanitation inspection public health medical dispute",

      "content": "Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter II\n\nBurra has not been without its mistakes from the start.  It had a survey of four square miles without reservation of roads in any direction – a peculiarity it shared with the nobs’ mining property of Princess Royal.  The bush tracks through the town up to 1864 (I write from memory only) were an impassable bog, better imagined than described.  Previous to that year the Government, considering it necessary to remedy such a disgrace, sent up a surveyor to peg out a road preparatory to macadamising, although it was on private property.  The resident agent, when the work was about completed, displaced all the pegs.  The Government then passed an Act to carry out the work.  The result was a hard road from the Burra Hotel to the Government Post Office, though off it in any direction was bad travelling, especially for that short piece from it to the nice wooden bridge the inhabitants had erected over the creek.  This was so bad bushmen designated it Mud Street.  [Thames Street to Bridge Street.]\n\nTime and money have repaired many of the bad places and the greatest permanent work of note has been the railway to within a mile of the town.  When the mine operations were suspended a few years ago the town’s condition was truly deplorable, which was not improved by the prevailing drought.  Since then Burra has shared in the benefits conferred by the Strangways Act, which allowed some of the land to be opened for agriculture.\n\nEven so settlers could not have bought land and then the necessary farming equipment and seed wheat and then survived a two year wait for a return on their capital, had not the local bank advanced money to some tradesmen, enabling them in turn to extend credit to the struggling farmers.  This gave the fading town a start.  Local tradesmen who had capital derived from profits in palmy days also extended credit.  It was a trying time.  Many tradesmen later grew fearful of their exposure and reacted by seeking to recover by increasing their prices to compensate and limiting credit.  They then went too far and the farmers, as they paid off their credit debts, have turned to the railway and Adelaide suppliers as a cheaper option.  Fortunately the number of new farmers has compensated for the older ones turning to Adelaide.\n\nI am reliably informed that a new farm of only 80 acres is likely to require capital of £500 and so necessitate most new farmers needing credit for four or more years.  Unless Burra traders reduce their charges to something like Adelaide prices, trade in Burra will decline.  When out of debt, the Baldina and Bright farmers may, in two or three years’ time, turn to Adelaide as earlier settlers have done.\n\nIncome from the extension of the railway to Hallett will also be ceasing by then, so it is time for local industries to be developing themselves as much as possible.\n\nThe lack of early road connections still hinders development.  Trade with the Hundred of Bright would be easier with a road along the creek through Princess Royal property.  The alternative route over Breakneck Hill is difficult and discourages trade from Bright.  Parliament has the power in the Land Clauses Consolidation Act to obtain the more direct and flatter route; otherwise the Bright farmers will travel south to Farrell’s Flat at a loss to Burra’s trade. resident agent Burra Princess Royal Burra Hotel Thames Street Bridge Street Hallett Hundred of Bright Breakneck Hill Farrell’s Flat Baldina Bright Adelaide infrastructure roads railway development agriculture trade economy",

      "content": "Editorial on The Eastern Road.  [Burra-Morgan Road]\n\nFrom what transpired at a meeting of the Midland Road Board on Wednesday we are of the opinion that a great misunderstanding has arisen on this issue, resulting in a contest between the two ends of the town.\n\nRedruth and Aberdeen are fighting for a road via Diprose’s Creek, under the impression that Kooringa wished to retain the existing road over the Breakneck Hill and if they did that the steep gradients of the present road would be forced upon the district.\n\nThe remarks of Messrs Warnes, Lane and others, however, suggest neither party wants Breakneck Hill.  The opposition really wants a deviation via Nankivell’s Gully and over a natural saddle in the hills.  This they say would reduce the number of bridges required from five to two with no significant difference in the gradient.  Having only limited acquaintance with the terrain, we will not hazard an opinion as to the better course, but at least it needs to be judged on the correct information.  Perhaps the best solution would be for a public meeting to reach an equitable decision.\n\nThe Second Leader discusses the activities in Parliament in the past week.  The Legislative Council is considering a law requiring all vehicles within 10 miles of a Corporate Town to carry lamps after dark – previously a requirement only in the city.\n\nThe Burra-Hallett Railway Bill has passed.\n\nCommonage.  A Baldina settler is complaining that having paid £40 for commonage rights it is not available.\n\nCopper.  Mr Grenfell and party have made a rich discovery of copper about 11 miles south of the Burra Mine.  It is a north-south running lode some two feet wide of grey ore mixed with gossan.  Sinking has begun.  [Wheal Grenfell.]\n\nAccident.  Yesterday a boy standing on the road by Orchard’s Hotel Aberdeen was knocked down by the shaft of Dr Nesbitt’s buggy as it passed.  Miraculously the horse and the vehicle both passed over him without touching the boy who escaped with a shaking.\n\nFire broke out in Mrs Green’s boarding house at Kooringa this morning at 2 a.m.  When help arrived Mrs Green was alight and the door leading to a bedroom was burnt half-way through and some articles were damaged.  The cause is not known.\n\nAccident.  Mr Henderson of Statton & Henderson had a little finger of his right hand severely cut in a circular saw about a fortnight ago.  It has now had to be amputated.\n\nBaldina.  New settlers are busy ploughing the ground.

      "content": "Midland Road Board at Riverton Court House 9 August: a special meeting to consider the route of the road from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina.\n\nThe Clerk read the notice in the Government Gazette 13 July of the intention to approve a deviation of road 92 via Redruth.\n\nCr Warnes & J.A. Goodfellow attended on behalf of J. Harris, SA Mining Association and Burra District Council, to protest this deviation.\n\nMr Warnes said nearly all the land in Baldina lay south of the existing track and only 10% on the north side.  All the traffic south of the track would naturally go by Mr Cowper’s head station and thence to a point at the corner of section 224.  If the road were diverted and laid down via Diprose’s Creek this traffic would have to go round from that corner 38 chains 74 links to get into the road then 335 chains to get into Aberdeen and 78 chains from there to Kooringa.  In all 452 chains.\n\nBy the road already surveyed the same point was 316 chains from Kooringa thus representing an extra distance inwards and outwards of 4 miles 28 chains against the proposed deviation.  Kooringa contained most of the public buildings – Post & Telegraph Office, Institute, Hospital and Cemetery.  The proposed deviation would saddle the Burra District Council with an expensive piece of road.\n\nThe road need not go over Breakneck Hill, but by an easier route up Nankivell’s Gully and thence southeast over the saddle in the hills, with no severe gradients and the distance about the same.\n\nThe Burra District Council did not care whether the road went directly into Kooringa or round by Redruth they only wanted to get the present road off their shoulders.  The Nankivells’ Gully route would require two bridges compared with five in the proposed deviation via Diprose’s Creek.  Mr Harris objected to having his paddock cut into two or three pieces as required by the new deviation.\n\nMr Moule thought the road would have to start at the post office.  He said the extra distance to Kooringa via Diprose’s Creek would be three-quarters of a mile longer, but it would be 74 chains shorter to the railway station.  He also said that the Act required the road to go from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina, so it would have to start in Kooringa.\n\nMr Warnes pointed out that to start at the post office it would have to travel over a mile of main road 14.\n\nMr Goodfellow, as Clerk of the District Council, produced a letter from the District Council to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in September 1874 requesting the road be from the Burra Railway Station to North West Bend.  The letter pointed out that the wording of the Bill as it was could apply to either one of two roads, or to a road and a track.\n\nThe Commissioner then had the Bill amended to read from Kooringa via Baldina to the North West Bend.  The Commissioner thought that removed any ambiguity.\n\nMr Warnes said the present road had been surveyed by the Council and approved by the Governor.  The Board did not propose to close the old road, merely to leave it, whereupon it would become a burden to the Council.\n\nMr Bakewell appeared to represent John Drew and others.  He argued that the change in the Legislative Council to read from Kooringa instead of from the Railway Station meant that the Board had no power to make the road from Redruth as suggested and if they proceeded, he believed their decision could be set aside by the Supreme Court.\n\nMr P. Lane and Captain Sanders appeared for the Burra Corporation [Town Council].  Mr Lane said Kooringa had 1,500 to 2,000 residents – more than Redruth and Aberdeen combined – and ought not to be ignored.  The District Council favoured the road via Nankivell’s Gully, which would serve nearly all those who would be served by the proposed road into Redruth, except for about 12 houses.  The road via Diprose’s Creek would cost a great deal more to make it passable.\n\nCaptain Sanders also said the route via Diprose’s Creek would cost considerably more and he supported the route recommended by Messrs Warnes and Lane.  He said about 25,000 tons of firewood was brought in annually.\n\nMr Ridgway presented a memorial with 149 signatures in favour of the deviation via Diprose’s Creek.  The inhabitants for whom he appeared believed the Board had gone carefully into the matter and had reached the correct conclusion.  [He used statistics of loads and costs to bolster his opinion.]\n\nMr Butterworth supported the road via Redruth.  He believed the road recommended by the Board was the best and did not see why wood and wheat should pass through Kooringa.\n\nMr Tiver also supported the Redruth road.  The route over Breakneck Hill would cost more in maintenance than the making of the other.  The Redruth road had easier gradients.\n\nMessrs G. Sara & A. Bartholomæus supported Mr Ridgway’s memorial.\n\nMr Warnes argued that if the road went to Redruth a great proportion of the traffic would have to come back to the Mine and to Kooringa.

      "content": "Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter III.  Appearances Past and Present.\n\nBushmen are to be found who can tell how a certain shepherd who lived in a hut on the Mine Hill was struck with the peculiar brown metallic stones with which his hut’s chimney was built.  He took samples of the stone to Adelaide and this led to an inspection in which the hut’s chimney was almost entirely carted away as malleable copper by a company being formed, which brought miners into the locality.  These soon housed themselves in dugouts in the creek bank, excavating good-sized dwelling rooms and sank well-like holes into the upper surfaces to form chimneys.  The door entrances were towards the creek, then with a forest of gums and mallee along its banks.  These cosy dwellings were ruined by a storm which swept their primitive furniture down the rushing creek.  (Fair remains of a few rooms are yet to be seen in the banks east of the Baptist chapel.)  By this time the forest was much thinned for firewood and fair building stone had been discovered.\n\nThe company and miners erected substantial houses on 21 year leases.  An abundance of copper ran the £5 shares up to more than £100 each.  In time expensive machinery was needed to keep the water down in the mine, but the profits justified the expense and the town grew to good proportions.\n\nIn laying out the township the company’s directors determined that only one hotel and two inns should be upon their property: viz. the Burra Hotel, the Miners’ Arms and the Pig and Whistle.\n\nThe hotel was well-planned, but in building insufficient attention was given to keep the storm waters coming down the hill from running into the cellars.

By the end of September we hope to see the shaft divided and secured so as to haul with whim engine from that level.  The inflow of water into crosscut at the 70 is causing problems.  The 70 driving north on lode is bursting with water, but contains rich stores of grey ore.  This level is far from ventilation and so we will start on Monday to sink a winze from the 60.  When holed we will be able to run Waterhouse’s Shaft to the 70 and prove the ground for a considerable distance north.  Peacock’s Air Shaft is holed to the 50 and we will sink to the 60 and also drive north.  Ayer’s old shaft has been cleared through from the 50 to the surface and a whim is being erected and when the shaft is secure we will let tribute pitches.  Roach’s Shaft is secured from the 50 to the 55.  We will divert a stream of water from Roach’s Shaft by clearing a level towards a winze to the 60, which will ventilate the 60 to that point.\n\n[There is further detail of clearing out old workings to allow access and ventilation for the purpose of proving new ground or letting tribute pitches.]  Surface work is being pushed on with dispatch.

He was an acknowledged leader of the free press in SA, fearlessly exposing falsehood, cant and hypocrisy, while seldom being bitter.  He wrote boldly and impartially.  In the past fourteen years he has raised the tone of colonial journalism.  He first joined the Register and in 1867became associated with the late Mr J.H. Barrow in the Advertiser.  He wrote as ‘Onkaparinga’ in the English Field newspaper in answer to Mr Kingsley’s misrepresentations of the colony under the name ‘Post and Rail’.  He prepared the last two handbooks on SA.\n\nHe was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne and was educated for the Independent Ministry at Cotton-End College Bedfordshire and subsequently had a series of positions in charge of churches in the north of England.  In 1860 he came to SA to take charge of Clayton Church, Kensington and in 1865 left that role to join the Register.  He occasionally continued to preach when his services were required.  He is survived by a widow, three sons, three daughters and three grandchildren.\n\n[William Harcus died 10 August 1976 Hackney SA aged 53.] W. Harcus J.H.

Moody as foreman of the jury.\n\nFrances Vivian, a next door neighbour, said she was awakened by the smell of fire and the screams of a woman, between 12.30 and 1 a.m. on Friday morning.  She found Mrs Green about two yards from her back door with the back of her dress alight.  Mrs Green called out that her house was on fire and asked her to call Mr Vivian.\n\nMrs Vivian took her three children to a safe place and then extinguished Mrs Green’s clothes and called neighbours for help.  She did not enter Green’s house.\n\nWilliam Bullen, another near neighbour, was awoken by Mrs Vivian’s cries.  He and Mr Vivian entered Green’s house and saw her and a man standing close together in the back room.  The back of Mrs Green’s dress was alight.  The door and three boxes of clothing were also alight.  They threw water over the door and carried the boxes outside.  Of the two carpetbags hanging behind the door, one was consumed and the other partly burnt.  There were three men in the house whom Mrs Green said were lodgers.  Two of them were asleep in the front room and the other was standing with Mrs Green in the bedroom.\n\nJohn Vivian’s evidence varied only slightly from Mr Bullen’s.\n\nJ. Drew said he and Vivian had gone into the room and looked around, but could find no clear source for the fire.  They could not wake the sleeping men and believed they were drunk.\n\nMary Green said she was awakened by the fire and raised the alarm.  She had retired about 10 p.m. and was sure she had put out the candle. She denied she was drunk.  On rising she had put on clothes, which she afterwards was told were on fire.  It was her bustle which was on fire – she had worn it for the last twenty years.  A bottle of brandy was brought into the house on Thursday, but there had been four to drink it.  Two women had visited on Thursday.\n\nGeorge Mayger said he went to Mrs Green’s house about 1 a.m. Friday and saw some boxes smouldering outside.  He met Mrs Green with her bustle on fire and the back part of her dress burnt.  He went inside, but found all had been extinguished.  He could not see any cause for the fire.\n\nThe jury’s verdict was that a fire had been caused by carelessness, through Mrs Green and her lodgers having partaken of too much intoxicating liquor. J.D.

      "content": "Sanitation in Kooringa: Report of libel case arising out of the debate reported earlier.\n\nNesbitt v. Cave for damages of £2,000.\n\nIn July the rev, H. Howitt of St Mary's Kooringa preached a sermon on the text than cleanliness is next to godliness in which he referred to the poor state of sanitation of Paxton Square houses and the apathy of SAMA to the state of dwellings and the comfort of the inhabitants. A summary appeared in the Northern Mail and a warm discussion followed. Mine officials challenged the truth of the sermon statements. Taking part were the Govt. Medical Officer at Kooringa and the defendant who is a doctor in the same town and a mine doctor. Cave made a report to the mine officials denying the plaintiff's assertion that a recent typhoid outbreak had arisen on the property of SAMA. Nesbitt then wrote another letter in which he said that Cave's arguments were as reliable as his friendship and his statements would receive as much attention from the Central Board of Health as Captain Sander's statements had received.\n\nCave then published a rejoinder in which he said it was impossible for anyone to be long friends with Nesbitt who had manufactured the epidemic by sending his (i.e. Nesbitt's) groom's wife, while suffering from typhoid fever, to lodge at a house in Paxton's Square and she had caught the fever owing to Nesbitt's having allowed filth to accumulate at the back of his house and he knew so little of the symptoms of the disease that he had to be told what the woman was suffering from.\n\nThe judge ruled that unless it could be shown that any of the statements were false to the defendant's knowledge, the case would be decided by reference to Laughton v. the Bishop of Soder and Man and would not go to jury. The plaintiff's evidence was ruled largely inadmissible as proof of malice. Henry Pether, proprietor of the Northern Mail, was called with the original letter that started the case and showed that the original had been toned down somewhat before being published. Despite protracted legal argument on both sides it was ruled that it was a nonsuit. Nesbitt Cave H. Howitt Captain Sander Henry Pether Govt.

By 5.30pm it was level with the roadway in Bridge Street and then it broke through to form a channel between the bridge and the Bible Christian Church. Lower Thames Street was flooded as were most houses between Statton & Henderson's [Market Square] and the Primitive Methodist Chapel. Fences and outbuildings between Thames Street and the creek were swept away. Houses on the western side of Paxton Square were flooded to 6-9\".\n\nAt 7.OOpm the Bridge Street Bridge was swept away which allowed the water level to fall quickly by some 2-3'. The bridge structure remained fixed to the eastern buttress and both ended up about a mile downstream.\n\nAt Aberdeen there was a sheet of water from Opie's Hotel to the new railway embankment. And water 2-3' deep with a strong current was flowing up the road between the White Hart and the Aberdeen Hotels. Near Tiver's Corner it was 3' deep and the Aberdeen Hotel was flooded to several inches. This stream re-entered the main creek between Orchards and the Burra Mill.\n\nRidgway's store was flooded as were most houses between Tiver's Corner and the White Hart Ford.

The creek there was wider and the flow in flood therefore less violent. It needed the purchase of land from Messrs Statton & Henderson on the west bank, while the east side approach offered no difficulty. He thought that 30' could be obtained with no difficulty, but doubted that was enough. (Compulsory acquisition was not available as it was not a main road)\n\nCr. Snell thought they would sell 40'\n\nMorris thought 50' desirable and 40' the minimum.\n\nThe Corporation resolved to take steps to acquire the land.\n\nOn being approached the owners agreed to sell provided it was S of the Nth post of their entrance from Market Square. In return they wanted 100' of the land now set aside for a road +£488/15l- cash for a piece of land 40' wide.\n\nCouncil thought this far too high and decided merely to `receive' the letter.\n\nThere was a request for a footbridge at the site of the old bridge.\n\nCr. Sanders said the remnant of the old bridge contained usable timbers 31' long.\n\nLipsett & Sanders moved that the new footbridge be made from material salvaged from the old bridge. Agreed. Capt.

The opposition then declared it would only be legal if it ran till 31 December 1877. The Council declined as this would cause them to lose £120 in Govt. subsidy on work done before 31 Dec. 1876. The opposition then got legal advice that the rate was again unenforceable. The Council got contrary legal advice. They then resolved to go to the local court for resolution, but also there was a public meeting in May at which nothing was resolved; a motion to approve the Council action being lost by one vote. The Editor expressed concern at the damage being done to the town regardless of which legal view prevailed in the end. The paper in fact was fairly even-handed in its condemnation of both parties.

      "content": "Burra Corp. The lawyer W.H. Bundey, acting as an arbitrator in the matter of the rate assessment, gave the following opinion:\n\nThe problem stems from Part XIII, clause 151, of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1861. This says that a declaration of rents profits and receipts estimated for the year and of the proposed outlay and expenditure for the same shall be published in the Govt. Gazette on or before 1 Sept. each year. Clause 152 says that in order to raise the funds above the council may order assessments etc. to be made. Clause 164 allows the declaration of a rate, but not one over 1/without the ratepayers' consent.\n\nThe publication of these estimates can only be for the ratepayers' information as the council itself doesn't need the publication. The word `shall' in clause 151 means that publication is essential for the validity of the assessments and rates to be imposed. Other corporations have also failed to do so at some time (Adelaide, Kensington & Norwood, Gawler, Glenelg, Port Adelaide, and Brighton.)  They have had to resort to getting a validating clause from parliament.\n\nBecause the year referred to in the relevant clauses is a calendar year, it must run from 1 Jan. to 31 Dec. The Corporation may be in error in making the rate retrospective in part, but that is a moot point.\n\nOn balance the dissenters, upon payment of the 1/- in the £ should be free of any other payment until the year 1878 and while they could take the matter further they would seem to suffer no disadvantage if they were to accept that the payment runs to 31 Dec. 1877 and if the Corporation does so too, as the parties agreed at the start of this arbitration.

We believe in the resolution of this issue that has been made `the main road should run from Kooringa to Aberdeen, thence over the Redruth Bridge and via the Smelting Works to the junction of the Baldina and Bright roads; that a road from Kooringa via the present route and connected with the main road at Nankivell's Gully, should be constructed by the Government, but the maintenance would have to be borne by the Corporation and the District Council.' This seemed a fair result, but the £500 grant from the Midland Road Board for the Kooringa road is plainly inadequate, placing too great a strain on the local councils.

Says 9 inch culverts were placed where 5 foot ones were needed and that the claim that no real knowledge of conditions was available was nonsense. Firewood Creek is 81 feet wide and a 40 foot bridge was ordered. Much of the damage was because no culverts were in place as they wanted to use the embankment during construction and insert the culverts later. There was even the remarkable suggestion that the flood was used to determine where the culverts would be needed! Ed. said much more than 40 chains were damaged, but perhaps that was the totally destroyed section. The damage bill would seem to be understated. Work is now being pursued with vigour and there is some hope that part of the line might be ready for the coming harvest season. Lovell Hallett Firewood Creek railway infrastructure flood",

Summary so far:\n\n(1) First site chosen was Sec. 75 near Mr Ullmann's house on Mt Bryan Flat, about midway from Burra to Hallett.\n\n(2) Objectors convinced the Commissioner of Public Works to change to the southern portion of the travelling stock route near Gumbowie [only about 6 miles south of Hallett]\n\n(3) Another deputation then sought to have the first decision reinstated. The Commissioner says he wants to accommodate the majority so the debate continues.\n\nEd. favours a site near junction of Main North Road and the road from Mt Bryan East; near the District Council Chambers as most traffic will come from the east. This site may be subject to flooding and if that can't readily be rectified then a site on Sec. 75 is the better choice remaining. It would suit Mt Bryan East and Banbury while the northern area towards Hallett is sheep country and the suggested location there is too near the Hallett terminus.\n\nA sensible alternative would be to realise that with relatively little traffic a loading platform at both sites without a proper (i.e. staffed] station might be best of all.\n\nSome rail laying began at the Burra end on 29 Oct.

The Corporation was under the impression that all that the Govt. was going to do was to place a water trough at the Station Gate, fed from the Govt. main. They were caught unawares when a supervisor and twenty men arrived with instructions to lay a pipe from the Station along Morehead Street and up, Best's Place to the National Bank at Aberdeen.\n\nThe Mayor, Mr Lipsett, `believed that a private interest had been brought to bear upon it.' Also things were worse in Kooringa where the water supply was in the hands of one man. He thought that the line could be extended to Kooringa while the men were there to do it, but Cr Roberts pointed out that it was only a 3\" main and they should urge the Commissioner of Public Works to supply the whole town. Cr Roberts wanted to condemn the Commissioner.\n\nCr Bartholomæus agreed they should urge the Govt to supply Kooringa as well. Mr Geake said they should write to the Commissioner pointing out the injustice done to Kooringa. Cr Wilkinson suggested a deputation wait on the Commissioner, while The Mayor said they had already written. The Mayor did not begrudge Aberdeen water, but since the Govt. had voted £820 for the purpose Kooringa should get some of the benefit. In the end they decided on a deputation to ask that the water trough be shifted to the station and seeking clarification of liabilities and cost implications for the Corporation.\n\nIn the event that Mr Rounsevell being unable to introduce them, they should seek some other independent member like C.C. Kingston, rather than their other representative, Mr Rees, whom he felt had pandered to private interests and had been operating with the Commissioner as to the water supply arrangements.\n\n[As reported this must have been a rather heated meeting with the whole council much offended by the Govt. action.

Cr Roberts condemned the Commissioner for his action. The Mayor then said they should get an independent member to introduce their deputation to the Commissioner if Mr Rounsevell was not able. [The other local member, Mr Rees, would appear to have been blamed for the Govt.'s decision in the first place and so was persona non grata. I\n\nThe Mayor was of the opinion that a trough at the Railway Station gate would satisfy all. The meeting however, felt that this would deprive Aberdeen of their rights with the pipe already laid to the near the National Bank with a standpipe and trough erected.

He then asked them not to request a water supply for Kooringa until a hydraulic engineer arrived from `home' (England).\n\nOn his return to Burra the Mayor was unexpectedly told that the work was already done and he was given two keys; one for the trough and one for the standpipe opposite Ridgway's shop. The town was also placarded with notices for a meeting to condemn his actions. He and Cr Roberts had attended the meeting and were astonished to find the Town Council the subject of censure. He wished to say that he had \"never passed any censure on the Commissioner or Mr Rees\"\n\nThe Government had no right to grant the request of a few memorialists to the extent of £820, while ignoring the simple request of the Corporation for a trough to be erected for the convenience of teamsters. The Corporation felt they had been grossly insulted and interfered with. Cr Robert moved:\n\n\"That the Mayor and Corporation of the Town of Burra very respectfully request the Commissioner of Public Works to regard them as the proper medium through which the wants of the town ought to be made known, and with very great deference point out that the recent granting of a water supply to only one portion of the town at the request of some private ratepayers has a tendency to weaken the influence of the corporate and representative body, and, as a matter of course, cause them to be ignored.\"\n\nSeconded Cr Batchelor, and carried.\n\nThe standpipe not having been asked for Cr Roberts thought that they should return its key.

Could the trust spend cemetery funds on other matters? What happened to the £140 received from the late curator? Has it been kept separate from other Corporation moneys?\n\nCan the Corporation use it for non-cemetery purposes?\n\nWhy, if it is still there, cannot it be used to put the cemetery in good order? He goes on to say that “the idea of a `trellised arbour' as a substitute for a mortuary chapel is delicious in its absurdity.\" A mortuary chapel is needed:\n\nTo obviate the necessity of very often taking the body a long way round to whatever church the deceased may have belonged to.\n\nBecause in this climate it is most undesirable, in very many cases, to take the corpse into a place of worship.\n\nThe conditions of the cemetery are much worse than under the curatorship of David Wells and so either the money mentioned above should be expended on the cemetery or the Corporation should carry out its duty from its other funds.\n\nI am Sirs etc. Y David Wells SAMA cemetery Corporation Burra cemetery trust finance public works",

Shebbear was surveyed out of the travelling stock route at the same place, but on the opposite side from Terowie. This annoyed the people who had bought land at Yarcowie as the two towns, only separated by 5 miles; would interfere with one another. There is another government town 12 miles beyond Terowie; Launcelot. [Actually Lancelot - now abandoned]\n\nThe Commissioner of Crown Lands believed Shebbear should go ahead to save the Govt. from having to buy private land for its services. [A Govt. town of Terowie, opposite the private town was surveyed in 1880.

The majority of water in wells in town even where there is good drainage has organic impurities. In Burra no drainage system is known. Water in covered tanks is less contaminated, but foreign matter does still enter. A water supply will save much labour and remove the need for the excessive economy exercised with it now in many parts of the town. Hydrants may be connected for use in fire fighting. Persons don’t plant trees because they cannot afford to water them for the first year or two. Water for gardens cannot be spared.

Reserves and run across farmers’ land far enough in to give cause for substantial \n• find a bog for the terminus at least a mile from town \n• use as few culverts as possible and ignore local advice re water flows \n• if you are facing the embankments do so only on the side opposite from where the water comes. \n• ensure any turntable is located so it will fill with water at every rain \n• the Burra-Hallett line matches these desirabilities most closely \nWith respect to extending the line from Hallett we believe an analysis of where most traffic from the area is headed — Port Pine, or Adelaide — should determine where the break of gauge should occur.

The extension of the broad gauge from Hallett should be to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie, Gumbowie, & Mannahill. \nSome thought that these two views were contradictory, but others thought not. There was also a proposal for a break of gauge junction at a place 16 miles from Jamestown to the north of Hallett. \nResolved: the break of gauge should be Hallett \nMoved that the broad gauge go to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie and Mannahill. \nAmendment 1 to reaffirm first resolution. \nAmendment 2 that the Govt connect Jamestown and Hallett via Yarcowie on narrow gauge \nAmendment 1 carried. \nAfter some further discussion both amendments were set aside. \nThe resolution was then lost. \nThe second amendment above was then put as a motion. \nAmendment: The Jamestown line be extended to Yarcowie, there to meet the broad gauge line extended from Hallett.

      "content": "Editorial on Town Council and Public Works. \nA meeting of ratepayers has been called to authorise the borrowing of £400 to meet expenditure connected with the new bridge in Burra. Visitors to Burra must wonder at the ‘primitive condition as regards roads footpaths &c.’ \nFor many years SAMA policy of leasing and not selling allotments prevented progress. The same cause of uncertain tenure and mistrust of SAMA saw the railway terminus so far from the business centre. The annual income of the Corporation is about £800 of which £600 is from the rates which, if expended on public works, attracts a subsidy of a like sum allowing £1,200 to be spent in a year on improving the town. (Or if the police rate be deducted still nearly that sum) This year began with a debit of £300 and now over £200 is in hand or to be received and it is proposed to spend this on necessary works, but such as attract no subsidy. Thus if we deduct the £300 debt and say £250 from the £600 mentioned above only £50 is left to spend in such a way as to attract a subsidy, i.e. Govt. subsidy this year would only be £50. \nThere is of course the repayment and interest on the loan, but these would be spread over several years and would not be nearly as great as the advantage obtained. Act 16 of 1861 allows for a poll of ratepayers if at least six demand it. At this poll ratepayers assessed at £25 annual value and below get I vote and there is 1 vote extra for each additional £10 to a maximum of 6 votes. The Act provides for the issue of bonds at an interest rate not exceeding 6% and the bonds would not be bought at par. The Corporation would get probably £94 for every £105 and at that the bonds would likely be taken by the banks on the security of the rates. Repayment would begin in say three years by which time grants-in-aid are likely to have ceased. We should be free of debt in seven years, having had seven years of comfort.

Once they got rid of the overdraft they would in future have £500 to spend on public works and £300 for current expenses. This year they had to pay an old debt of £300 and had £200 in hand. This, with working expenses, accounted for the whole £800. The extraordinary expenditure of the new bridge had to be provided for in an extraordinary way, either by borrowing, or a special rate. He thought ratepayers would prefer borrowing. If this was refused they would have to take the £200 in hand to pay for the bridge along with £200 from next year. Only the year after next would they be able to spend the full £500 on town improvements. This and the two following years they would spend £800 and with Govt. subsidy, £1,600, less the £550 \nfor police, leaving £1040.\n\nWith the loan they could spend at once £200 with £500 more each other year, totalling £1,200 or with Govt. subsidy a total of £2,400, less the £550 for police, making £1,840, or £840 more than they could without the loan. The town desperately needs roads and footpaths to benefit workingmen and storekeepers. Before long it was expected the Govt. would abolish the grant-in-aid and therefore they should get what they could now. The plan was to borrow £400 and begin to repay after three years, paying off £100 in each year thereafter to eliminate the debt in seven years. The interest would amount to £176 leaving a clear gain to the town of £224, besides the immediate benefit from the roads, paths etc.\n\nCr Roberts 2nd.  Mr A. Harris spoke against the loan and moved no loan be allowed as an amendment. Mr Tiver 2nd — along with Harris he thought it was to mortgage all our property. Mr Geake spoke against the amendment — the ratepayers’ burden would not be increased by the loan and no extra rate was proposed. He felt the approaches had to be paid for and personally thought a 6d special rate the best way, but if not that then the loan. Otherwise there would be no public work carried out till 1880. It was no use crying that the council did nothing if it was given no money to work with. Mr Cave asked if the Govt. would not supplement the money spent to purchase the approach to the new bridge. They would not, said the Mayor. Mr Dawson opposed the loan. Mr Cave questioned whether the Govt. wouldn’t support a new road purchase. Mr Lane said the surveyor had asked the Corporation to try to get the approaches opened through Messrs Statton & Henderson’s yard and they had done so. Cr Roberts supported the Loan as being the best way of maximising the Govt. subsidy while it was still available. Cr Wilkinson Cr Roberts Mr A.

The state of roads and paths was a disgrace and there was not a clean place to walk if it rained except on limestone hill. They ought to do this for the sake of the town and to get the subsidy. Mr Harry thought the Corporation shouldn’t be given money as they didn’t know how to spend it. Rev. Jenkins was opposed and favoured a special rate.

The Govt. missed out on the higher price and the cultivator was crippled by the cost he had to pay. Various systems have been tried to get land opened up to the agriculturalist for as low a price as possible to encourage genuine farmers to develop the colony. Now we have over one million acres cropped annually. Many areas once thought impossible for grain are now farmed and even served by the railway. The present Bill before Parliament is aimed at opening untried pastoral land in the far north, by giving larger areas and more secure tenure to leases. We support the general principles of the Bill. 42 years seems a long term and perhaps 28 years would be more just, but at least that time is needed for the land to be truly tested. We do not support the compensation arrangements and unless resumption took place within 21 years nothing beyond the actual value of improvements should be paid, especially as 3 year’s notice to resume is required. We do not agree that those who have already held land on credit should be allowed to select again.  SA land legislation agriculture editorial",

This would have closed suburban hotels so the compromise was for 2 hour trading and a reduction in the distance for bona fide travellers to 5 miles. It had only been in for 4 months. ¾ of a column follows before Rev. W. Jenkin 2 and the motion was carried unanimously. \nRev. W. Richards moved that: ‘A Sunday Closing Act conduces to morality’. 2nd Mr Sleep and carried unanimously. \nMr Holder moved ‘That this meeting pledges itself to support those candidates for the Upper House who are favourable for a Sunday Closing Act’. The Bill repealing Nock’s Act had passed stages 1 & 2 in the Lower House with big majorities and the Upper House was the only hope of stopping it. Mr W. Pearce 2nd Rev. Jenkins moved and amendment that the meeting pledge themselves to vote for those candidates who were in favour of the Nock’s Act provided they believed them to be as good in all other respects as other candidates.

Dr Robert Brummitt saw the deceased Sat. evening and he was suffering from shock, internal injuries and a broken rib. He requested Mr Gonne to send him down in the morning if the opportunity arose. He was sent down Sunday afternoon. In hearsay evidence Mr Cogan, the deceased’s employer, said Beckwith was going towards Hallett with an empty wagon. He sent a person on horseback to bring him back and deceased was found on the road with the wagon about a mile away. Beckwith, though partly conscious, said nothing about the accident. \nJoseph De La Hunty said the deceased had told him the bullocks attempted to run away and in trying to put on the skid he was knocked down and the wheel rolled over him. He had not been drinking. The same story had been told to his mother who, in evidence, complained about his treatment at the Willogoleech Hotel. \nDeceased would have been 17 on 14 October.  [Thomas Gabriel Beckwith born 8 October 1861 Hillside near Burra: died 2 September 1878 Burra, residence near Hallett.] \nThe evidence of Elizabeth Cameron, nurse, confirmed the above. \nThe inquest was then adjourned till Wednesday to get Mr Gonne’s evidence. Dr Brummitt was recalled and said he was satisfied about the state of the room at the hotel. Gonne’s evidence was compatible with the above. Verdict was accidental death.

We do not believe it necessary or desirable to have a house-to-house supply for the whole town. Many people possess good wells and a spread out town like ours would be too costly to service. \n‘On the other hand we saw, only a week or two since, some persons dipping up with some small vessel into a bucket the thick, unclean, and unhealthy contents of a puddle by the roadside, and carrying it carefully homeward. It could not have been to wash anything with, so we are driven to the conclusion that it was for drinking or cooking purposes.’ More than ever the prosperity of Burra depends on the outside country which is represented by teams with more to come with harvest time. There is at present no adequate provision for watering teams. It becomes desirable for some scheme to be put in hand as early as possible. An inexhaustible source must be chosen. It does not have to be high as it only needs to reach the most thickly settled parts which are all at the lower levels. \nPipes must be laid from the source to convenient points central to the houses not having a supply — say Paxton Square, Market Square and one or two other points in Kooringa, and four or five points in Aberdeen-Redruth. Each point to have a standpipe and trough. The water to be sold at so much per 1,000 gallons. A meter should check totals. \nA house supply could be arranged for those houses where it was desired along the route of the main; to be metered and charged for, but with no cost to the non-users.

[After Mr Campbell’s speech re the repeal of the Nock’s Act he was reported in the Advertiser in a scathing and scurrilous way.] \nThere was a large meeting at the Inst. on Wednesday to hear Mr Campbell’s reply to the attack on him. 150 were present and the Mayor was in the chair. Campbell had been grossly insulted and attacked and the paper’s tone had sadly deteriorated since the death of John Henry Barrow and William Harcus. Campbell said it was not a question of whether he or the Advertiser was better at trading insults, the principle was much more important. He felt that the liquor trade could be wisely and well regulated. The Advertiser wanted to go back to open slather on the grounds of ‘liberty of the subject’.

      "content": "Burra School article by F.W. Holder. \nIt is a characteristic of Kooringa that all its best buildings are public institutions churches, banks, the Institute, Post Office and Model School. Until a few years ago no town in SA was inferior to Burra. It had no special purpose buildings for schools, only dilapidated rooms that were rented to the disadvantage of both teachers and students with respect to health, comfort and efficiency. Three years ago Mr Holder, then a teacher, organised a deputation to the District Council to ask that a schoolroom be erected. The Council decided to wait for the decision of Parliament on the Education Act then before the House. The new Act passed and it was expected that really suitable accommodation would be built as it was one of the aims of the Act, but many delays followed before plans were eventually prepared which showed that Burra was to be first in the style and size of its schoolroom. The foundation stone was laid with due ceremony by Mr Bath on the same day that the hospital was formally opened. Sara & Dunstan completed the building at the end of October 1877, but the building remained empty till January 1878, despite children being crowded in inconvenient and unhealthy rooms in the summer heat. The cost of the new building was £6996-8-0 and capacity was 800, or up to 1,000 with extra seating. \nThere are six large schoolrooms, a similar number of classrooms and a teachers’ room, lavatories and a large play-shed. It now needs only adequate fencing to be complete. The opening was celebrated with a banquet. The first headmaster was Mr James Cater. Other teachers were Miss Snell, Miss A. Snell, & Messrs F. & J. Snell. Council ignored the claims for a Head Mistress, but eventually under pressure appointed Miss Cox and later Mr W.C. Grasby was first assistant. Average attendance for the six months to July 1878 was 293.5. It is a shame to see space wasted and a building for £2,000 to accommodate 600 would have been more than adequate. The cost at present is £1,207 for staff or £1-0-7 per child per quarter which is higher than at even the best of the private schools. \n[The writer then goes on to condemn payment by results as limiting what is taught and the way it is taught.] F.W. Holder Mr Holder Mr Bath Sara & Dunstan Mr James Cater Miss Snell Miss A. Snell F. Snell J. Snell Miss Cox Mr W.C. Grasby Burra Kooringa SA education school public institutions infrastructure",

Also if the mine started work again all the pipes laid would be useless and they could not get the water for a fixed term. If water was wanted in Market Square it could be left to private enterprise. \nCr Batchelor said it was often hard to get water from the carters and he often had to carry it himself He did not think private enterprise was the best supply; besides the Govt. had promised a supply, so why not get them to keep their promise. The article in the Record was just what they wanted and many more would take from such a supply if it were convenient and the water carts would get supplies from the standpipe. He did not want anyone else to pay for his water and he was willing to pay 20/- per 1,000 gallons for a regular supply. Cr Geake said something had to be done even last summer there would have been no water for stock if the Council had not cleared the springs. \nCr Sara said if mains were laid either all would have to pay or the Council would. The Chairman thought that at Pt Augusta the charge was 20/- per 1,000 gallons. Cr Sara thought it would be closer to 9/- per 1,000 gallons, whereas now it was 2/- for ‘a very small load.’ \nCr Wilkinson moved that a letter be sent to the Govt. reminding them of their promise.

She could not see any bruise and he died within twenty minutes. \nDr Nesbitt said there were no marks or bruises on the body, or other signs of violence.

A building committee was set up in 1875 to take steps to add to these premises and Sara & Dunstan entered into a contract for the work when just then the Burra Hotel came on the market and for various reasons the committee decided to take the hotel in preference to the old hospital building. The property taken over was valued at £1347-15-9 and additional sums were collected in 1876 of £71l-l2-9 and in 1877 of £114-4-0 to form a building fund, supplemented by the Govt. and the formal opening of the hospital after repairs, alterations and additions was on 27 February 1878 by Sir Henry Ayers. On the same day the foundation stone of the school was laid. The Board of Management, elected by subscribers, also met that day. \nIt had been contemplated that the Board would run the hospital and the Govt would match the sum raised by private donations and subscriptions. But on 13 March 1877 the Govt. was asked to bring the hospital under the Hospital Act of 1867 and it agreed. This gave the Govt. the right to nominate a proportion of the Board. The income now comes from the Govt. grant and private benevolence. Income includes the churches’ ‘Hospital Sunday’ which last year raised £27-3-0. Contribution boxes are placed around the town, e.g. in the hotels. Private patients can also enter for a fee — last year bringing in £109-12-0. Fees for a bed & sitting room 1st class are 15/- a day, bedroom 1st class 9/- a day, small room 7/- per day and the general ward, 6/- per day. \nThe hospital is at present very satisfactory. The honorary surgeon system has made it a very economical arrangement. Staff at present is Miss Lucy, two nurses, two servants and a porter. F.W.

Holder. \nThe author considers it is ‘not a place one would choose for joyous meditation at all times’ and comes to the conclusion that cremation would be a preferable way to dispose of bodies. But as long as we have cemeteries they should be as pleasing as possible and arranged to suggest peace, rest and beauty. Not because he considered it ‘desirable to encourage the practice of making the cemetery a place [to] walk, for of all places it is the most unsuitable and unhealthy for such use. \n‘Casual Sunday afternoon strolls through the Cemetery are entirely out of good taste and nothing can more grate upon the susceptibilities of those who hold dear the memory of any resting there, than to see a mixed throng carelessly reading the inscriptions, commenting on the character of the monuments, or laughing and playing among the dead far better if the cemetery were not thrown open so publicly as it is for health, propriety and many other reasons.’ \nMr Wells, the late curator laboured for many years to maintain it in a good condition, but since his times the Corporation has been in control and his care is sadly missed. The writer then suggests that a garden cemetery would be preferable to stark bare ground with regimented rows of graves, or a weed infested wilderness. The cemetery needs expanding and SAMA has agreed to allow expansion towards the creek, but they are very slow in arranging the deeds. Also some sort of structure is needed to provide a place for services in extreme heat or wet conditions or where the danger of contagion makes it undesirable to have the coffin in the church. A large trellis arbour open at both ends and well surrounded with creepers and well roofed would suit admirably. F.W. Holder Mr Wells Burra Cemetery the creek cemetery public health community",

Lipsett) was claiming the Attorney General’s authority for his being able to admit people to the hospital despite not being a subscriber, doing so by virtue of his office as Mayor. This was cited by R.W. Campbell, Thomas Warnes, & Robert Brummitt. The Board wrote to the Attorney-General seeking to know whether he had so advised the Mayor. Mr W.T. Sheppard, Undersecretary replied that Mr Mann, when Attorney-General, could not recollect giving any advice on this or any other matter to Mr Lipsett. The Board then wrote to Mr Lipsett asking to know when and where the advice claimed was given; he replied he would answer only if asked by the Attorney-General’s applying to him directly.

He hoped to be re-elected. He had been a local for 11 years. They had not in the past been in a position to improve the town, but now they could ‘make it presentable’ \nDr Nesbitt then spoke as a candidate for Mayor. He thought the last year had seen funds spent less wisely than they might have been. With an income of c. £850, £135 had gone in salaries and £600 should have been available for public works, which supplemented would give £1,200 annually to improve the town. He felt that the next year would in fact have less money to spend — in fact almost none! \nAt present the debit was over £11 \nThe current quarter salaries were £35 \nThere was a contract let for £35 \nThe land for the new bridge approaches would cost £175 \nLegal and other fees related to the bridge work would add £125 \nEarthwork for the bridge, £50 \nMoney owed to the cemetery account £230 \nTotal £662 \nWith an income of c. £850 necessary expenses and salaries would leave £600 ‘so there would not be a very large balance to spend’ \nA mortuary chapel should be built at the cemetery. \nHe favoured finding someone who could combine the jobs of Town Clerk, Surveyor, & Inspector and so save some of the salary costs. The 3d rate for sanitary purposes was a farce. It raised £150 which was spent: £50 to the inspector, £10 for the Secretary and £80 to the Scavenger and the latter produced a result ‘not equal to the expenditure.’ More was required than the removal of household refuse. \nHe hoped water supply arrangements could be made to remove the antagonism between the north and south end of the town. He believed it had been decided to erect two standpipes in Kooringa — one in Market Square and one in Paxton Square. Some parts of town had a well in almost every backyard and did not require a scheme that would impose a general rate that would be unfair to those who did not use the water. Any citizen on the mains should be entitled to be connected at his own cost and to pay for water received. He also complained about a misleading flier circulated by his opponent or his supporters in which he was accused of being in town only ‘a year or two’ — actually it was almost 3½ years. He would ignore the comments about competence and experience. He was accused of always opposing the Council — he had opposed the original Council: not the one headed by Mr Lipsett. He was said to be promoted by a clique, of whom Messrs Drew & Dawson were considered the heads, but 104 persons had signed the requisition asking him to stand — a rather large ‘clique’. He didn’t have, the document claimed, one hour a month for the School Board of Advice. This was true because it was a waste of time — on it Mr Ridgway lived at Brighton and was rarely there, Mr Lipsett was Lane, Mr Bath was Lane & Mr Lane was Lane — so it was all Lane. He had never said, as was claimed, that the workingman would vote for Lipsett and respectable people would be on his side. \nAsked what arrangements had been made for a water supply, Mr Lipsett said none whatsoever. \nMr Dawson then spoke against Mr Lipsett and he read reports of what Lipsett had said to the Commission re the water supply. The extracts said Lipsett had asserted teamsters had but two or three wells to depend on for supply. \nLipsett rose to object and others interjected that there were in fact no public wells at all. Lipsett rose to say he had been sent to get the pipe extended to Kooringa, but had obtained a trough and standpipe at Aberdeen. He had indeed said two or three wells for teamsters as they could not use private wells. \nW. Pearce jnr said he didn’t know there were even two or three public wells. \nCr Roberts and Rev. W.

      "content": "Report on the Dinner to Ex-Mayor Lipsett. \nA complimentary dinner to E. Lipsett JP as Ex-Mayor was held at the Institute with host Jos. Richardson of the Commercial Hotel. Mt T. Bath in the chair and Ex-Cr Roberts as vice-chair. About 75 attended. \nCr Geake proposed the toast to Mr Lipsett. He was fulsome in his praise of Mr Lipsett and defended him against an accusation that he had wished to entertain a guest invited by himself at the expense of the Corporation. Believing in no clique or party, he had stood free and independent while he filled the office and he had done his best and had never stood higher in the esteem of the public than now. \nCr Bartholomæus added some further words of support. \nThe Chairman then presented a solid silver cup to the Ex-Mayor. \nMr Lipsett then spoke in thanks and maintained that he had never deserved the dishonourable treatment he had been subjected to. On arrival 11 or 12 years ago he had not thought to reach such a high position in the town. \nIt had been impossible to do much due to the actions of some men who had lost the town £600 in rates [i.e. The Robinites] He still managed to leave the office almost free from debt. He had been drawn into political action in the election to the Colonial Parliament of Mr Rees some seven years ago. ‘He had hoped the ratepayers would have seen fit to return him this year without opposition and it ought to have been so.’ \n‘He did not blame the ratepayers for the clique.’ \n‘Not Dr Nesbitt personally because he was only a tool as everyone knew and he himself (Dr Nesbitt) knew and would (he believed) say if they asked him.’ \nHe went on to blame opposition to him on the fact he was well educated ‘this was his greatest sin’ \nHis height of 6’6” — one or two don’t like to look up to E. Lipsett \nHis age — ‘you are younger than they . . . you ought to wait until you are grey headed.’ \n\n‘It was no dishonour to be 6’6”, nor to own the greatest drapery establishment out of Adelaide.’ \nWhen the hospital started others gave £2-2-0, but he had subscribed £5. He had on occasion criticised it with respect to mismanagement, want of extra nurses and two men being allowed to wander nude and mad, having been allowed to get out. As a result he had been grossly insulted. Had ‘those gentlemen said they were sorry he would have gone on with his subscription. He then went into details about the controversy of admitting a man to the Burra Hospital. He claimed he could have overturned the result of the election of Dr Nesbitt in twenty ways had he liked. He accused Nesbitt’s team of keeping a public house open for three days, betted hats, given away garments and free rides down the line. They had disgracefully raked up a scandal against Mr Lane from 20 years ago — all the dirt came from one side. He refers to other allegations raised in the campaign too. \nRev. Jenkin, who was unable to attend, sent in a speech to be read by Mr Hill. In it he began by attacking the editor of the Record. \nHe describes F.W. Holder as: - \n‘a vendor of Yankee notions, dispenser of homoeopathic medicines, general surveyor of our town, town clerk, editor of a newspaper, and in addition to all this a local preacher.’ It is as much my right as his to meddle in local politics. \nMr Lipsett’s moral character has been trampled in the dust ‘at the very time when his truthfulness and manliness were two essential things to secure his return.’\n\nP. Lane toasted the retiring councillors Sara and Roberts — of the third he knew nothing. [!]  He raised the issue of the Robinites, some of whom he said were gentlemen who did the right thing afterwards, but others were not.  All the difficulty he said had come because a certain party could not endure to see the Corporation as then constituted, but all the pressure brought to bear on the Mayor and Corporation had not affected their unity or desire to do well, though every technicality had been taken advantage of by some parties. \nSome of those who signed the Round Robin were gentlemen and did what was right thereafter, but others were not and had never the interests of the town at heart. As soon as they found the technical incidents they had sent to their solicitor and done all they could to obstruct and they had their tool in J.D.C.  Those men - Dr Brummitt, Thomas Drew and J.D. Cave had looked up an old paper of over twenty years ago — he wondered if their backgrounds were able to bear such scrutiny and hinted that J.D. Cave’s at Lacepede Bay and Gumeracha could not.  ‘There was not a place he had left honourably, and he only held his position here on sufferance under the hands of these men, and why did they keep him? Because he was a tool.’\nHe [Mr Lane] had held more public positions than any man in Burra and defied anyone to say where he had betrayed their trust and now two men called respectable and belonging to the same church as himself and also the editor of the Record had allowed that thing to be got out to their shame. \nThe opposition had said ‘try a case in the local court. Tell everyone there would be no rates to pay for 18 months and the Mayor and Council saw they would at once lose £180-£200 of govt. subsidy spent on public works and told the others the state of the case, but they were not satisfied and when the Council would not yield they sent a deputation with which the Council tried for an agreement, but it would not do so. \nEver since the Corporation had been formed action could have been taken against the District Council and still could be. He did not think men could be so scurrilous and dirty and yet sit where they had no right to. When he told the chairmen he said it was right and just. Few knew the work the first Council had to do, sitting night after night making by-laws and paying back rates as a result of the action of these men. \nIt was impudent to say they had done the best according to their ability for there were men in the first council who turned over more money in a month than the Council did in 12 and more than any 3 or 4 in the town. He referred to Crs Sara, Lipsett and Sanders — yet they talked about ability. They worked for the town well and he hoped to meet them together again. He had great pleasure in proposing the health of Crs Roberts and Sara. \nCr Sara could not say he was altogether happy at his present position. He could bear out what Mr Lane had said — the opposition was not against measures, but men. He could refute that the North Ward had not a fair share of the expenditure and the books would show that it had. \nRev. Richards was glad so many of the ratepayers had come to honour a gentleman so worthy of it. He had not known Mr Lipsett so long as some, but had come to regard him as a good citizen, a gentleman and a Christian. Mr Lipsett had borne his rough handling well. He proposed the ‘Town and Trade of Burra’. \nMr W. Pearce responded and Mr W. West proposed ‘The Press’. E. Lipsett Jos. Richardson T. Bath Ex-Cr Roberts Cr Geake Dr Nesbitt Rev. Jenkin Mr Hill F.W.

Bath as foreman of the jury, into the fire there. \nThomas Richardson, landlord, returned from the Corporation meeting on Monday night c. l0.45 and closed the bar about ii p.m. Mr Adam got four glasses of beer for the billiard room. Went to bed. Some time later someone knocked for more beer, but told him to go about his business — he said he thought the house was on fire. Got up and found much smoke with the fire mostly in casks under the bar parlour and cellar under the tap-room. Sent for the mine fire engine. There was an explosion from the other cellar to the east, sending flame right through the floor and roof. [The next lines are illegible, but seem to say £40-50 in cheques, banknotes and coins were lost in the bar.]  A portion of the roof was removed to gain access. He thought a fire a few months ago was caused by matches falling through the floor and this fire might also he so caused. There was a half case of matches and a small lot of kerosene in the cellar. Cellar could be got at by any ill-natured person. Have had threats, but thought nothing of it. The place was insured for £4,500 for the building & stock, and the stable for £500. \nHenry Skewes, who was sleeping in Room 10, said by the time he was roused and dressed and got out the older part of the building was beyond saving. The effort was then on saving furniture etc. from the unburnt portions. \nMatthew Adams was lodging at the hotel at the time. About 2.30 a.m. he heard Annie Garland in the passage and she asked me to see her room which was full of smoke. Vivian and I went to see and found it suffocating. Roused Mr Richardson then went to front and found the whole of the cellar on fire and also at the back. Roused everyone in the house. Annie Garland noticed smoke when a little girl of Richardson’s who sleeps in the same room, woke and asked for a drink. Met Harry Vivian coming out of the billiard room and asked him to see about the smoke. \nEdward Shoard was also in the billiard room and confirmed the above. \nJames Colman, constable, was roused between 2 & 3 a.m. on Tuesday — he thought by John Vivian, and found the cellars strongly on fire. He told them to send for the fire engine and the furniture from the new section was taken into the street. Sergeant Bentley and two other constables arrived about 4.30 am. Shortly after 11 p.m. on Monday I passed the verandah and the bar lights were out and no one was loitering. There were people in the billiard room. The verdict was that there was no evidence to show how the said fire originated. J.D. Cave T.

The editor urges the need for one and says that however imperfect the expenditure has been, an improvement has been made in the town's arrangements and further improvements are needed rather than abolition of the rate. The only ones who have not benefited by the rate are those (very few) who have gardens or possess a horse and cart and can by either of these means dispose of their own waste. Our plan is to have a man with horse and dray at say, £140 p.a. to be employed fulltime and having fixed days for certain streets and with the time not so dedicated to clear vacant lands, waterways, etc. He would take everything, ashes, dust, bones, rags, manure etc.\n\nThe Waterworks.

      "content": "The Health Rate Meeting\n\nOn Friday evening about 50 people assembled at the Institute to consider the question of a health rate for 1879. The Mayor, Dr Nesbitt, took the chair and he described what had taken place in Council. The meeting could memorialize the Council to rescind its motion, but the final decision would rest with the council.\n\nCr Ridgway moved: -`That providing the Corporation relinquish their claim to a health rate this meeting authorise it to levy a general rate of 1/3 in the £ instead of 1/-. '\n\nHe argued that a rate that produced £150 was nothing to what was required to place the town in a thoroughly sanitary condition. The main problem was impure liquids running in gutters and to the creek and this evil had been untouched by the efforts of 1878. A general rate of 1/3 would be more useful than a health rate of 3d. The extra general rate would attract another £150 Govt. subsidy.\n\n(Actually the Govt. only subsidised up to a 1/- rate, but the extra would free more of the rates to be supplemented.)\n\nThere was some debate about the legality of the meeting.\n\nCr Geake then spoke in favour of the health rate. He believed that the rate last year had been of great service. The health rate would not do all that was needed, but would be very useful. A trip to the North Ward depot or to slaughterhouse gully would show a large quantity of rubbish had been removed. For workingmen the extra rate probably meant about 2/6 a year and if the general rate went to 1/3 they would pay that much and still have to pay 1/6 or 2/- a time to have their rubbish taken away. He also spoke against referring Council decisions to public meetings as it could be most destructive of council. He moved as an amendment that they have the health rate.\n\nAfter some discussion Mr Geake withdrew his motion.\n\nMr Lipsett thought the meeting illegal and moved as an amendment: -`That this meeting cannot interfere with vote for a health rate inasmuch as it was carried by a majority of the Council.' After considerable discussion this was carried.

Mr Bath in responding to best wishes recalled joining the lodge in Kooringa 29 years before and in 1852 so many went to the gold rushes that there was not a quorum for meetings. Songs and recitations were given by members. E. Lipsett `rendered The Charge of the Light Brigade in a capital manner.'\n\nMr Bath's Banquet in the Institute on 18 Feb. was chaired by Mr Rees MP. After the meal there were the usual speeches and toasts.\n\nP. Lane toasted Parliament and made a political speech.\n\nMr Rees responded at some length with another. The toast of the evening then followed and the chairman handed Mr Bath a beautifully illuminated address done by W.G.P. Joyner.\n\nMr Bath responded, saying he had arrived in the colony as a Govt. immigrant 32 years before with £15. His schooling had not cost more than £2, having never been paid for at more than 2d a week. His first job in Adelaide was as a printer's devil and he accumulated £40. He then walked to Burra and set up business and in less than three years was doing business to the amount of £30,000 p.a. when suddenly the Victorian gold rush caused a plunge when he had liabilities of £10,000, but he managed to pull through and had paid everyone 20/- in the £. Despite the depression in mining there had been fewer failures at Burra than in any other town in proportion to population.\n\nMr Rosman proposed the `Combined interests of SA.'\n\nMr E. Lipsett responded for the commercial interests.\n\nMr Escott responded for farmers.\n\nMr H. Dawson proposed the `Town and Trade of Burra.'\n\nDr Nesbitt, Mayor and vice-chairman, responded.\n\nMr Ridgway gave `The Press.'\n\nPress representatives for the Register, Advertiser and Burra Record responded.

The Engineer approves of the proposal to obtain water from the well near Kooringa and the supply will be ample for this end of the town. He even proposes carrying the pipes on to Aberdeen. This idea is mistaken as Aberdeen already is well supplied from the bon Accord mine which is much nearer and also we believe on a higher level. The estimated cost of the scheme for two standpipes, one in Paxton Square and one in Market Square, is £800. The cost of maintenance is £100 p.a. + 6% of the establishing cost for an annual total of £148. The engineer does not favour private services for what seem to us insufficient reasons. Without this few people would live near enough to the standpipes to dispense with the water cart and this will restrict consumption almost as much as it is now. Once we allow private services consumption will rise and it becomes a remunerative undertaking. One firm in Kooringa alone expected to use £20 worth a year if the pipes were laid on to their business, taking water at 6/- per 1,000 gallons, which is the price for private services at Aberdeen. This should allow the £148 cost to be easily recouped. Then a free trough in Market Square could be easily funded by the Corporation.

The new one is about six chains over a mile with the broad side of the oval towards the grandstand. There is a slight inclination up to the straight. There were no accidents of significance. Attendance was only moderate and few ladies appeared. [The attendance figure is not clear, but appears to be `about 1,000'.] There were two publicans' booths and tea and coffee establishments. Oysters, crayfish and other delicacies were abundant. The Clare Brass Band was hired and a shooting gallery, ninepins, the purse trick and Aunt Sally, or Cheap Jack.\n\nThe main race was the Burra Handicap over two miles for 100 sovereigns. It was won by J. Crozier’s b. or b.g. Thave, aged 5 years and carrying 6 st. 81b. Ridden by Hutchins. J.

Kapunda was contemplating spending £50,000 to get a water supply. Boring wells would be more economical. Carried W.R. Ridgway moved a motion which urged the Govt. to make trials of artesian wells in the settled districts. Lessees should have sufficient inducement to test supplies to 10,000 gallons per day with compensation if the land was resumed.\n\nDr Stephens also spoke in support of the system. He thought the eastern Hundreds were as good as the land to the south or north: all that was required was water.

He wrote to say he believed that at the municipal elections last December he felt he was not served by ratepayers with fairness. Subsequent actions of Council had confirmed this.\n\nWhen he left the chair the Corporation was in a healthy state with no debt and incoming rates free to do the work needed. He had used his casting vote when assuming office to see Mr Holder elected as Town Clerk. This action, he said, gave serious offence in some quarters and in no small degree tended to lessen the number of votes polled in his favour. Mr Holder's subsequent actions confirmed his trust in his appointment.\n\nThe actions of the present Mayor have resulted in the very serious circumstances which have befallen the Council and are the result of the Mayor's inexperience in business. He has failed to supervise the Clerk - the idea of allowing the Town Clerk to keep the sum of £49 in his cash box.  In Lipsett's term of office the Clerk banked everything over £10. The Mayor's incompetence was shown right at the start when he gave a casting vote in favour of an amendment that nullified his first vote. Through his neglect the Council has lost between £300 and £400 of Govt. subsidy. Look at the bridge opening. Lipsett says that he and the first Mayor [P. Lane] `worked hard to get that splendid structure, and it stands today a great memorial to our labours.' Edward Lipsett Mr Holder P.

Mr Dunstan was in the shop serving on Saturday evening at 7.30 p.m. and all was well. Two kerosene lamps were over each counter. Went to bed down the horses about 50 yds away. Was away about five minutes when my wife called out that the shop was on fire. Was unable to enter the shop and ran next door to my house adjoining the shop. Got one child from bed and a box from the room. Mrs Dunstan took the other child. Tried to get to the desk and till. [Apparently failed.] The dwelling and contents were saved. The wind was from the house to the store.  There was a 16 year unexpired lease on a freehold to SAMA. The stock and house were insured: the stock for £400 and the furniture for £100. Don't know how the fire started. Heard no explosion. The lamps were trimmed and filled that afternoon. Stand to lose £200 over and above the insurance.\n\nMrs Dunstan said her husband called to her when he went out. Would have heard a person enter the shop. Heard a crash and found the drapery side of the shop ablaze. Called my husband. Believe the noise was the lamp over the drapery counter bursting, but could see nothing but fire. The lamp could not have fallen down.\n\nCharles Rawling helped remove furniture from the house and the fire was contained to the shop. Even a fire engine would not have saved the shop.\n\nVerdict: the fire was caused by the bursting of a kerosene lamp and was accidental. J.D.

Holder explained he had obtained information from Mr Miller of Francis Clark & Sons and a suggestion of an offer to bore in Market Square. It seems clear no water supply from the Govt. is possible without a general rate and therefore local action is a better proposition with the revenue going to the Corporation. The evidence of water in the Mine suggests a well in Market Square would strike water at 200-300'. He proposed that 1/2 the cost be met by the Govt. through the Council with'/4 from SAMA and 1/4 by public subscription. The Corporation must be applied to at the next meeting.

Cave JP into the death of Annie Statton.\n\nEdward Statton, husband: - Was married 5 June and went to Adelaide, returning on 9 June and after a cup of tea with his mother they went to visit hers. Went to bed between 10.30 and 11.00 and after about 15 minutes a sound like 40-50 stones landing on the roof cause my wife to leap right off the bed. I tried to laugh it off, but she was trembling till morning. In the morning she took a little brandy and hot water and her mother came to stay while I went to work. She stayed at her mother's on Tuesday night, but couldn't sleep. On Wednesday sent for Dr Sangster, but there was little change till Friday. On Sunday I left home at 9.00 a.m. and returned about 12.00, when my mother-in-law said Annie was dying. Both Dr Sangster and Dr Nesbitt came in the afternoon and Annie died between 12.00 and 1.00 a.m. that night.\n\nDr Sangster: - On my first visit I found the deceased suffering from a nervous headache, but did not think the case serious. When I visited with Dr Nesbitt we did not see anything to indicate danger. The post mortem disclosed a large clot in the brain. Dr Nesbitt: - Could not attribute the clot to anything but violent emotion. Verdict was death by apoplexy caused by a sudden shock received on the night of 9 June from stones thrown on the roof by a person or persons unknown. A verdict of manslaughter is recorded against such unknown person or persons.  [Born Ann Ellery 25 July 1857 District of Burra: died 16 June 1879 Kooringa.] Annie Statton Edward Statton J.D.

He was very favourably known here, not only for his work for SAMA, but in his civic role as one of the first Town Councillors for Middle Ward. He took great interest in the Hospital and Institute and in the Masonic Lodge. He leaves a widow, a daughter, and several sons.

Wells, foreman of the jury.\n\nJohn Broad: - Was home all-day and slept the night in a downstairs room facing onto the main road. All other lodgers and servants had gone to bed and all seemed quiet and safe. About 2.00 a.m. heard some crackling as of the lighting of a fire and thought it was the ostler who always lit the fire. Woke Mrs Broad and said the ostler was lighting the fire and it was not yet time. She went to the kitchen, but came back and said that all upstairs was on fire and I was to get up. Got up and called the men. Saw flames from upper windows. Found the servant girl lying on the ground. She said she had jumped from the window. Sent for the police and then took out what furniture we could. The assembly room was saved, and the roof on the outer rooms was taken off to stop the fire. Am only a tenant, but the furniture and stock was insured for £1,000 and the premises for £1,500. When I got outside flames were coming from three windows. Two of the [upper] rooms were occupied. Think the fire started in the centre rooms. One window did for two rooms which were divided by a lath and plaster partition and occupied by a servant and a lodger respectively. Ann Broad: - Supported her husband's testimony. There were six rooms upstairs. Only two were occupied: by a lodger and the servant girl, Ophelia Johnstone. Saw the upper rooms on fire along the passage. The man who slept upstairs was not exactly sober. He had a candle and wax matches to light his pipe. There were curtains at the window, but the table was not near them.\n\nThe enquiry then adjourned to the hospital.\n\nOphelia Johnstone: - Went to bed at 11.30 p.m. Put candle on chair by bed and put it out once in bed. The man next door was then snoring. Was awakened by smoke and part of the room was aflame. The window was nailed down, but I broke the frame and got onto the verandah and jumped down. Fire could only have come from the next room as nowhere else was occupied. The man had been very free with his matches, throwing them down on the carpet before he went upstairs. I broke the window with my hand. While on the ground I saw the man come out on the verandah.\n\nThe enquiry then returned to Aberdeen.\n\nThomas Long, labourer: - Was on my way back to Farrell's Flat from Terowie after delivering sheep. Slept in the Aberdeen Hotel Tuesday night. Went to bed between 9.00 & 10.00 p.m. Put the candle on the table by the bed. Blew out the light when I went to bed. Was awakened by smoke and heard a female scream and break the glass. Got onto the verandah. Tried to go back for my clothes etc., but couldn't. Was quite sober. I lost a watch, boots, rug, blanket and other small things.\n\nEdmund Alexander Jeffrey passed the hotel at 1.30 a.m. and saw neither fire nor a light. Henry Walker lives nearby and saw fire coming from the hotel windows at about 3.00 a.m. There were several other witnesses including the police, but they added little of significance. While it was clear that suspicion clearly pointed at some action by Thomas Long there was no clear evidence and the verdict was that fire started in the upper storey, but there was no evidence to show how it originated.

      "content": "Editorial. The Midland Road Board some time ago agreed to pay half the cost of making the approaches from side streets to the main roads in the town. The Corporation then went ahead on this undertaking and spent c. £100 and sent in an account for half the cost, or almost £50. The Board baulked at this total and seems to have cast about for an excuse not to pay. It referred the matter to its surveyor who has presented a most remarkable report to justify the Board's not paying. If there is any fault it lay in the Board's unconditional agreement to fund half the cost. The report accepts that four approaches are fair and will be paid for. It also says `the whole of the works have been well done'. It then remarkably says that the road connecting two approaches between Broad's Hotel and the new Redruth Bridge is not finished or fit for traffic. It is fit for traffic, though no top metal has yet been spread, but that can be done anytime, now that the bog that existed there in winter has been removed.

A good-meaning young man has opened a school in the township and in less than a week has secured 32 students. Only 2 of these had been attending Burra school. The Board of Education virtually acknowledges the claims of Copperhouse by not calling on parents there to show cause why their children are not at school. The matter demands attention. The local Board, I am told, was asked just one or two questions and not to evaluate the whole case. Distances involved are a poor excuse. Wallaroo Mines has a school one mile from Kadina and Moonta Mines on a similar distance from Moonta. The new school near Iron Mine is 8-9 miles from Copperhouse and so is irrelevant.

When some hard obstruction was found in the well it was conjectured that it was a piece of broken tubing, but the boring cable failed to communicate anything definite by sound or feel as is usual. Since sometimes days passed without detecting the problem it was then thought that hard stones might be falling down from higher in the tube. About a month ago the obstruction appeared to have cleared and drilling continued for 2 to 3 weeks at about 40' per week till 194' was reached. Here the obstruction was worse than ever. It was then that a careful observation of a point about 19' from the top showed precisely where the broken piece came from. Some days were spent in a futile attempt to retrieve the piece and ultimately it was pushed aside and boring continued, but at 199'6\" it was found that the bore was out of plumb and the ground was too hard to allow it to be straightened. At this point the cable broke with the tools attached and some 60' of it fell down the tube. They are now attempting to recover this. The orders from Adelaide are then to start a new bore some feet away with a 5½\" diameter rather than the old 4½\" size. This should make jamming of the tools less likely. This seems to be the best solution despite the probably loss of money to the company.  Market Square Well Adelaide well bore infrastructure mining mechanical failure",

The closing of the old ford led to the need to drain Market Square which has been commenced by watertabling both sides of Thames St, round the Square, both sides of Chapel St, Queen St and Commercial St and making a cross drain in Mt Pleasant St to turn water from the hill down Chapel St. We have begun to level Market Square from side to side. Other roads made include: - Bridge Terrace, part of Kingston St, Welsh Place, Ayers St and Chapel St as far as the creek. A footpath has been formed to the hospital and from near the National Bank to the Post Office. Merthyr St from the Aberdeen Hotel to the bridge has been made and other watertabling done in Aberdeen and Redruth.

It should be done at a time like the present when there is no question of the Mayor asking for it, or requiring it. Firstly, such a move would open up the position to men who might not otherwise be able to afford it and secondly, the representation of the town requires considerable outlay which should not be required of one who already gives freely of his time.\n\nThe decisions on expenditure this year are generally as we had suggested last week. In North Ward footpaths are to be formed from the railway gate to the Bank of Australasia in Aberdeen. In Middle Ward the unsightly banks near the Institute and in Commercial St will be cut down. As the road by the Institute is controlled by the Midland Road Board we hope they will see the advantage in raising one half and lowering the other half of the roadway to make a road in the centre and so share with the Corporation in improving the town. In South Ward the most important work is the erection of an iron bridge in Thames St. We think that Ayers St in South Ward, which leads to the cemetery, should be a cost to the town as a whole. The other two wards have the burden of main roads removed from them to the Midland Road Board, but in South Ward no such easing of the burden is made. Another, but less desirable solution would be to charge the cost to the cemetery fund. At present the town pays £140 p.a. for the police: one foot-policeman at either end. This being the case some consider that the North Ward should pay half and the other two wards should share the other half. This is to be resolved next meeting. We hope the Middle and South Wards will concede on this. Part of Middle Ward is closer to Redruth than Kooringa anyway.

Their surveyor then declared that although well made, the approaches were not required and were made to private entrances. This was not the case. After their recent visit the Board has decided they will pay half the cost on five of the least costly approaches. The Council will receive a sum of £16 or £17 instead of the £48 claimed. The Board's argument is that their duty is to provide for through and not for local traffic. If this is the case (though it seems rather useless to provide main roads one cannot get on or off) then this should have been made clear when the promise was given. If conditions of numbers or types of approaches is to be imposed and was omitted from their reply then the Council should not have to suffer for their mistakes.

Two or three years ago we believe a horse fell through a hole in the middle of the roadway and the laminated timber arches were known to be rotten to the core. The Midland Road Board decided to replace it with an iron bridge on account of the traffic it had to carry to and from the eastern country. The contract for the ironwork went to Messrs James Martin & Co. of Gawler, but a long strike delayed completion and their girders were eventually put together in the yard of Mr Hooker of Adelaide. On the journey to the site one girder fell and it was feared it would have to be written off, but with effort the engineer, Mr Duff, managed to have it restored. Mr Duncan Grant got the job of assembling the new structure as well as removing the old bridge. Messrs James Martin & Co.
