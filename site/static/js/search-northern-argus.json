      "content": "Copper Interpretation Centre\n\nRumours say that the Copper Interpretation Centre, which was the major component of the Jubilee 150 Burra heritage Town Project, is dead.  The project was announced by the Premier in May 1983 as one of three major Jubilee 150 projects – the others being the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum and the restoration of Fort Glanville.  All were to be funded by a $2 million grant from the Commonwealth Government and Burra’s share was to be $470,000.\n\nFrom the start controversy has dogged Burra’s plans to have a Copper Interpretation centre – a concept of Ian Auhl and adopted by the Burra Burra DC.  The Heritage Conservation Branch requested the Department of Environment and Planning to conduct a feasibility study and that favoured spending the major part of the allocation on a selection of heritage projects instead of just on the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Burra Burra DC voted unanimously to go on with the original concept.\n\nThe steering Committee was chaired by Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch, who became the working party chairman.  There were representatives from the Heritage Conservation Unit., the History Trust of SA, the Department of Tourism, the Department of Mines and Energy, the Burra Burra DC and Burra National Trust.\n\nThe Burra Burra DC had some years earlier purchased the Salvation Army Citadel with the idea of its being developed as the Copper Interpretation Centre.  An officer from the Heritage Conservation Branch deemed this to be unsuitable because of its ‘social atmosphere’ and geographic location.  Other sites then considered were:\n\nA new building at the Bon Accord Mine site.\n\nA new building adjacent to Peacock’s Chimney.\n\nA new building on the plateau on the eastern side of the Mine Pool.\n\nA new building where Morphett’s Pumphouse boiler house stood.\n\nDesigns were drawn up and the first completed were costed at about twice the available funds.  Amended designs cut the building virtually in half, gave minimal space to administration, but retained an adequate gallery area and the plateau site was chosen.  The working party approved this and Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch indicated verbally that the Branch would recommend approval.\n\nTenders were called and the lowest received was about 100% over the estimated cost.  The working party immediately moved to vary the proposal slightly and move it to the boiler house site with a building the same size and similar silhouette to the former boiler house.  Two architects have indicated their interest and belief that this building could be achieved within budget and could be completed by the target date of October 1986.\n\nRumours of the scuttling of the whole project and for the reallocation of the funds elsewhere have been circulating for two weeks.  The Burra Burra DC has sought urgent answers from the Premier.  The Department of Mines and Energy has been so supportive of the idea that it has already contributed $25,000 to be concentrated on Morphett’s Pumphouse and surrounds.  Burra’s Tourist Officer Jenny O’Connor has joined the Council in lobbying fiercely for the project and to counter the claim that Burra has been slow to react - though no meetings were held between January 1984 and November 1984 and then only at the insistence of the Burra Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker.  The allegation that there is now insufficient time to complete the project is denied by the architects.  Of concern id the allegation that the Heritage Conservation Branch, which has been closely associated with the project, will not now approve building on the boiler house site.  It has been alleged that the head of the Heritage Conservation Branch, Jon Womersley, when asked if his Department had any alternatives to offer, said, ‘No’.

The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA’s copper mining and place SA’s copper mining towns in a world perspective.  Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA’s counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill.  Burra is the genuine article.  ‘Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.’\n\nPerhaps the time has come got the town to strike against the delaying tactics of a government department ‘which seems to have decided from the very beginning of negotiations that it knows what it best for Burra’. \n\nI have protested personally to the Premier and to the State Ombudsman with no tangible results.  Other concerned people in Clare, Burra and Adelaide have also protested.\n\n‘The net result of such protests is not a genuine attempt to find a satisfactory home for the Copper Centre, but to cease negotiations with Burra Council and to re-allocate the grant altogether.’ Ian Auhl R.J.

The cost over-run of $64,000 on the Jubilee 150 job creation scheme at Paxton Square cottages was met by Council in the first instance.  A special meeting of Council was called for Monday 30 September to discuss the situation and an urgent reconvening of the working party has been called for.

It seems the Jubilee 150 Board held that:\n\nBurra was slow to react to the crisis\n\nThere was not now time to complete the project.\n\nIt was only at the stage that tenders were received that the working party became aware of the architect’s gross miscalculations and an approach was then immediately made to the Jubilee 150 Board to vary the proposal slightly – for a smaller building on the boilerhouse site rather than the larger one on the plateau.\n\nThe working party immediately consulted two architects who believe that the project as revised can be completed within budget and in the time available.  The official opening was always scheduled for October 1986.  The reallocation of the money has been done without conferring with Burra and in unseemly haste.\n\nWhen you employ an architect recommended by the Heritage Branch itself you expect the job is being done properly and it is quite unfair for Burra to be punished for that man’s mistake.  Objections to the proposed site by the Heritage Conservation Unit should be investigated thoroughly.  To be totally purist about the ruins there is to let them decay until they finally collapse and that is not acceptable to me or to many others in Burra.  Enthusiastic support has been given by the Department of Mines and Energy.  Burra is not accustomed to making a botch of heritage based projects.

The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year.  The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]\n\nThe Society’s President Jock Duncan was well pleased with the attendance.  John Olsen Leader of the Opposition officially opened the show.  This year some asphalt around the pavilions improved the area for visitors.  Cheree Deverson was Miss Mini Show Girl.  Sonya Fuller was winner in the Sub-Junior Section with Alison Reed in the Junior Section and Vanessa Pearce taking the Miss Show Girl title.  [Photo.]\n\nBrophy’s Boxing Troupe was popular.\n\nJim Robinson won the shearing competition.\n\nPhil Venning gave two blade shearing demonstrations.\n\nThe new inventions section was won by Melvyn Pearce with a sheep feeder.\n\n[Results of various sections are then printed in c. 1¾ columns.]\n\nThe Burra Rural Youth disco in the Town Hall in the evening was successful.

This coincided with the centenary of the original school building, which is now the teacher’s residence.  Ruth Stolte’s book Razorback Range Country was launched by the publisher Peter Cotton.  The weekend also marked the 75th birthday of the Mt Bryan Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.  On Saturday afternoon there were displays by the Yankalilla Light Horse, sheep dog displays and hayrides.  Tim Butler of Radio 5CK compered the ball that night in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.  Many attended in period costume.  Ralph Oakley won the beard growing contest for those who started clean shaven on 3 August.  Dave Parnell won the longest beard of all prize.

For some years the Council has had plans to underground the electricity, improve traffic flow and redesign parking.  Although plans have been publicised they did not clearly show the position and design of the new lightin poles.  The type of light pole has created concern.  The standard goose-neck poles were deemed unsuitable for a heritage town and their position on proposed protuberances has also roused concern.  In presenting the petition Mrs Wright spoke about Burra as a Heritage Town and urged the Council to reconsider the pole choice.  Mr John Modra of the Highways Department spoke outlining the accepted standards and stressed that the safety factor.  The funding arrangements were also outlined.  Council accepted the petition and will discuss the situation at its executive meeting early this week.  Meanwhile undergrounding of power lines is proceeding as there was general consensus that this was desirable.  Other work has been halted.\n\nPlans were also produced at the meeting for the proposed Burra North deviation or Ludgvan Street Bypass.  The Highways Department hopes to proceed with that project in the next financial year.

The collection, which will be kept in the custody of the Burra Community Library, consists of an indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships covering the period from the discovery of copper in 1845 to the closure of the Burra Burra Mine in 1877.\n\nIt also includes a biographical index of names of people mentioned in the references, a collection of maps relating to Burra and district, a collection of photographs and negatives relating to Burra and district, a library of books relating to Burra and an extensive collection of miscellaneous references to the Mine and its townships and various other indexes.\n\nThe collection was begun in 1965 when Ian Auhl was principal of Burra Primary School.  It finished in 1985 with the submission to the publishers of the author’s book The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77.  It began with items researched from copies of the SA Register dating from 1852 and held by the Burra Institute Library.  When Mr Auhl was transferred to Adelaide in 1969 arrangements were made for the State Library to photocopy each newspaper item.  Subsequently each item researched and submitted was photocopied and all newspaper items were microfilmed and negatives made of all photographs.  The collection was begun when the author was preparing tourist pamphlets and realised that Burra had no local paper till 1876.  No books on the history of the mine and its townships existed apart from some centenary publications.\n\nThe intended use of the material was to prepare tourist pamphlets and then a short history of the mine and its townships.  This resulted in the publication in 1969 of the Burra Sketchbook with drawings by Maurice Perry, which has been reprinted five times.  It was subsequently used in the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and in various Burra histories and to make submissions to the District Council and in making submissions for heritage listing for Burra Buildings and of course for Ian Auhl’s major history as mentioned, to be published in 1986.  It has supplied authors, organisations, families and individuals with information on the history of Burra and its people.  Mr Auhl has said that he considers the Conservation Study of 1978 to be the most valuable result of the collection.\n\nOriginally the collection was to be housed in the Copper Museum and Interpretation Centre.  The author’s ill health and doubts about the funding for that centre have made it necessary for the author to agree to the housing of the collection in the Burra Community Library, in the care of the Library Board of Management in accordance with an agreed management policy drawn up by the Librarian Colin Fidock.  A complete copy of all but the photographic material has been made by the librarian of the Mortlock Library.  Both the Burra Community Library and the State Library are processing the material to make it available for public access in 1986.  The author and librarians envisage the collection as growing in the future as there is still the period after the closure of the mine in 1877 to be researched and written about.\n\nThe microfilm of the Burra Record for 1876 to 1977 is available.  Challenges to Burra’s role as a historic town can only be met by substantiated facts, properly documented.  Mr Auhl considers that the future security and growth of the collection is assured and has expressed his gratitude to Colin Fidock and the staff and to Roger Henderson, Principal of Burra Community School for their co-operation and understanding.\n\nMr Auhl has expressed a hope that the collection ‘will attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.'

      "content": "St Mary’s, Burra is undergoing repairs with the aid of a $25,000 heritage grant.\n\nIt has been having problems with the letting in of water on the weather wall and into the organ loft.  A National Trust architect estimated the repairs at about $30,000 three years ago.  The Heritage Commission grant came in response to an application by the Rector Fr Richard Morris.  As well as the grant they offered a loan for the rest of the cost.  Fr Morris believes the trouble stems from the replacement of lime mortar with cement about twenty-five years ago.  Clare builders McKendrick & Ahern began work about a month ago and expect to finish at the end of March.  They will re-point and repair the weather wall at the top where the pointing was bad.  They will replace the guttering and attend to flashings, ridge capping and parapet walls, waterproofing the last.  The windows will be sealed and the interior re-plastered in preparation for painting.  The 81-year-old pipe organ cost $700 in 1905 and was overhauled four years ago for $4,000.  Its replacement today would cost about $70,000.\n\nRecent renovations have allowed the removal of a window from the original St Mary’s from its storage in the organ loft.  It will now be repaired and placed in a more visible position in the church.  It was originally placed in old St Mary’s in 1872.\n\n[Photo of the church with scaffolding in place and of Fr Morris with the old stained glass window.] Fr Richard Morris Fr Morris McKendrick & Ahern St Mary’s Burra heritage church repairs grant architecture",

Mr Johns’ great great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of the Burra Burra Mine.\n\nIan Auhl was born in Burra in 1914 into a family which had lived in the district since pioneering days.  He returned in 1964 as headmaster of Burra Primary School.  Following his retirement he has written prolifically on Burra and this large book of 488 pages, 15 colour plates, 50 illustrations, plus maps and numerous photographs is the culmination of years of valuable research.\n\nPam Marlow has carried out the initial work on the Jubilee Project to build a scale model of the Burra Mine to be housed in the Bon Accord Mining Museum.  The module of Morphett’s Enginehouse, boiler house and capstan has been on display in Bence’s window.  This is one of 33 groups of buildings which will slot into the landscape model, which is about 5 metres by 6.5 metres in area.  It will provide a picture of how the mine looked in about 1860.

Protesters say this is a nonsense and the last serious accident was more than 35 years ago and Council is merely indulging in a whim.

In Burra the Trust owned six properties and was responsible for three others. (Leasing the Paxton Square Cottage No. 11 and caring for the jinker and Powder Magazine.)  This was a large job and the income came from key hire, bus tours and fund-raising.  Most of 1985’s objectives had been realised.  The J150 $30,000 allocated to the Bon Accord had been spent.  An application has been made for a $21,000 CEP grant to work on the Bon Accord surrounds and re-fence and define the car park.  $5000 was being spent on a case to house Pam Marlow’s mine model and a History Trust grant of $8,500 will be spent on display and interpretation.  Lock-up restoration work is almost complete under the care of architect David Gilbert, using a National Estate grant of $12,000.\n\nA small committee has worked to prepare scripts for signs for the sites and liaison with the Department of Mines, Department of Tourism and the Burra Burra DC will allow special enamelled signs at Trust sites at the same time as signs are done for the J150 project at the mine.\n\nVolunteers will photograph all buildings in Burra on the same day within the next two months.\n\nA dramatic event is planned for Redruth Gaol in association with the Arts Council and Flinders University drama students.\n\nIn 1985 the Trust became involved with several issues including the redevelopment of Market Square.

When Burra became a town with just one Methodist Church, the services were held at the Kooringa Church, but the Guild continued for many years, finding fellowship and raising funds for the church.  The final act of the Guild will be to donate its funds to the renovation of the Redruth Church so it can be used as a worship centre for the Redruth Camping Centre or for a museum.

By mid-morning about 20 remained and when a bulldozer moved in several protestors stepped onto its blade, halting work for the day.  On Friday Council workers began at 6 a.m. and removed grass in the square’s centre while police restrained a small group of protestors.  Secretary of BPO Derek Rayfield said the BPO had been prepared to sit down and compromise last Thursday, but all requests had been ignored.  Eunice Baker, a member of BPO, said although she felt uncomfortable participating in the blockade, she saw it as a last ditch attempt to preserve the square.\n\nBPO believes the proposed changes with road widening and new car parking spaces would destroy the historical character of the square and restrict the free flow of traffic.  Burra District Clerk Rod Walsh said the changes were needed to improve traffic management.\n\nA petition prepared by BPO was signed by more than 800 people.  Council Chairman James Hawker said people had been misled about the changes and intimidated into signing the petition.  A blatantly inaccurate map of the changes had accompanied the petition.\n\nDerek Rayfield in a letter to the Argus blamed the Council itself for the story regarding the removal of the Rotunda and the rose garden.  He denied any improper actions in collecting the 819 signatures.  Council has said in a circular that the lack of formalised parking arrangements results in illegal parking and hazardous traffic manoeuvres and Council fears for its legal position in the event of accidents.\n\nLast November 570 people signed a petition calling a halt to the installation of new electricity [i.e. light] poles in Market Square.  They deemed the standard goose-necked poles unsuitable for a heritage town and as a result those installed were removed.  Council now proposes to install round-type ETSA post-top lights and there will be no goose-neck poles.\n\nIn January the re-development was halted when the Community Employment Program notified Council that an oversight had been made in not getting the changes approved by the Australian Heritage Commission.  A meeting in Adelaide on 21 February resulted in the State Heritage Branch indicating its assent for the scheme to continue.  The estimated cost for the project is $109,000 of which $50,000 comes from a J150 Local Government Road Assets Program loan with a subsidised interest rate of 9% for 12 years and a grant of $54,000 from the Community Employment Program.  Council’s contribution is $5,800.

The story of the Rotunda and rose garden being moved did not originate from the BPO, but from ‘our illustrious White House’.  A public meeting last December gave Council a vote of no confidence on the lights and the re-development and called for a poll on the issue.  This was ignored.\n\nAt a meeting in Burra in late January Mr B. Rowney of State Heritage, Adelaide, said that the radiused roadway in front of the Tourist Office should stay as it was and not be tampered with.  Mr Don Hele of National Trust, Adelaide, expressed the same view.  At the meeting on 21 February in Adelaide the State heritage Director Mr Jon Womersley ruled that the radiused road would be closed and modified protuberances be constructed, State Heritage over-riding objections to this.\n\n[He then goes on at length to justify the validity of the petition and to express his disappointment on behalf of the BPO at the actions of Councillors’ in the whole saga.] D.

The re-creation of the old manse is all but completed and the restoration of the Bible Christian Chapel is proceeding.  The original manse was pulled down many years ago*, but with the restoration of both the Bridge Terrace and the Kingston Street Rows of cottages the Lewis Board of Management felt that the next step ought to be the reconstruction of the manse for use by the caretaker and his family, who currently live in two of the cottages in the Kingston Street row.  Once the cottage is completed they will move in, freeing the two cottages for holiday rental.  The Bible Christian Chapel next door is believed to be the oldest Bible Christian Chapel in Australia and restoration is being undertaken with great care.  The original wooden roofing will be left exposed from the interior and it will be used as the booking office for the cottages and an interpretive centre for the square.  A sum of $80,000 has been borrowed by the District Council to enable the development and this loan will be repaid by the Lewis Board of Management.  Work has been authorised by the State heritage Conservation Branch.\n\n[Photo of Chapel and new cottage.]\n\n[*The original manse was demolished in July 1971.] Lewis Board of Management Paxton Square Bridge Terrace Kingston Street Australia development heritage restoration",

Mr Hawker presented the Governor with a copy of Ian Auhl’s new book, The Story of the Monster Mine.  During his speech the Governor said his great great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and the family had lived for a time in dugouts in the creek.  Later, upon hearing that Florrie Scroop was Australia Day Award winner for the Jubilee Year, Lady Dunstan sent her the posy she had been given on arrival.  A troupe of dancers from Danse Victoriana performed during the evening.  A contingent of BCS students assisted on the night as did the Queen’s Scouts and their leader David Jennings.\n\n[Photos:\n\nGovernor and Lady Dunstan with the Councillors.\n\nBurra Burra DC Chairman Cr Hawker presents Ian Auhl’s book to the Governor.\n\nThe Governor declaring the ball open.

How fortunate that it was covered up and not removed.  In the same week the unique signpost in Market Square was removed.  Hoe many years had that been part of Burra?  Over the years much heritage has been removed.  In recent years the main school building and the Town Hall steps have been under threat and the maternity wing of the hospital has been demolished.  What will be threatened next?  Will the wall in front of Polly’s Tea Rooms be plastered or the wooden steps from the road destroyed.  The proposed Ludgvan Street deviation will see more destroyed and the railway overpass will probably be bulldozed so it can be enlarged.  The expensive mess that is now Market Square will not prevent accidents.  The signpost should be returned and restored to its original state with wooden posts and chains.

The model is at a scale of 1:87, which allows for about half a square kilometre to be displayed.  The model shows the mine in its peak of prosperity.  The general landscape has been created from plaster over chicken wire to which individual module boards containing groups of building fit.

It covers organisation, design, promotion and economic restructuring.  Over 600 American towns have used the program to reverse trends of a dying main commercial street.  Economic expertise was needed as well as the services of perhaps an architect or consultant on trading.  The scheme would restore buildings externally to what they were.  Owners of premises should wait till they could afford to restore buildings properly.  Nothing looks sadder than unused buildings.  Signage should be unobtrusive.  Slides of examples of good restoration from Port Adelaide, Gawler, and Aldgate were shown.

Two thousand miners and their families had lived in dugouts in the creek banks, but floods had forced them out so Paxton Square was built.  There were a few changes over the years.  Verandahs were added in the 1930s and the rows of backyard toilets were later removed.

Mining stopped at ‘The Bon’ when little copper was found and the miners went to the Victorian gold rush.  When they returned another effort was made, but also failed.  The mine’s main shaft was utilised as the town’s water source in the 1870s* when the Burra Mine closed.  Water from ‘The Bon’ was piped into Burra until 1966 and afterwards the E & WS Department gradually transferred the site to the National Trust.  The restoration of the Bon Accord site was made possible through a J150 grant of $30,000, History Trust of SA grants totalling $11,783 and National Trust expenditure of about $6,000.\n\n[This is not quite accurate.  The real story is complex, but in outline, the reticulation of water from the Bon Accord in the 1870s was extremely limited.  It extended to only a handful of homes and was mainly directed to water troughs for animals.  It was not extended to Kooringa until 1884.  The water did not at this time come from the main shaft, but from one straddling the border of the property on Linkson Street.

Kym Bonython spoke as Chairman of the J150 Board.  Keith Johns said his great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, Burra’s first mine captain.  Just as he was about to declare the project open, a severe rainstorm burst over Burra, scattering the assembled people, but later the weather improved and buses ran a shuttle service to allow people to visit the three sites of the project.

Hallett DC has proposed to the Local Government Advisory Commission that the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of Ayers be annexed to Hallett.\n\nSpokesman for the 193 ratepayers, Bob Gebhardt, said Burra roads and Council plant were run down because of lavish expenditure on unnecessary projects like the J150 project and tourist ventures.  Also Burra rural rates were twice those of Hallett and there was no communication between the Council and ratepayers.\n\nBurra Burra District Clerk, Rodney Walsh refused to comment.  A meeting of Booborowie and Mt Bryan residents (who are in the affected area) set up a steering committee of twelve at a meeting on 26 June to plan the secession.  Further ratepayer meetings were held at Mt Bryan on 15 September and at Hallett on 18 September.  Chairman of the Hallett DC, John Hale, said that Council was in favour of the move.  Hallett had only one permanent and one casual staff, while Burra had 6 administration staff.  The change would add one to Hallett’s staff.  They would like to see Burra return to a Corporation while Hallett took care of rural ratepayers.

The show was based on Burra and its history with particular regards to the gaol.  It was a promenade performance using a variety of locations for the first half, presenting cameos of Burra life.  Food was supplied in the interval and the second half took place in one of the exercise yards where there was a pot-pourri of activities.  There were puppets, Cornish wrestling, and activities over the underground tank area and up onto the roof as one of the reformatory girls attempted to escape.  The audience was finally led out the back gate and then around the walls to a large bonfire at the front.  It was written by Ken Harper and directed by Jules Holledge.

The cairn was erected by Roger Frahn and Owen Schulz and identifies the nearby ruins as the foundations of the original church built in 1851 to serve the needs of families who came from the Harz Mountains in Germany as smelters.  Not long after being built it was nearly deserted when the men went to the Victorian goldfields. It was later rented to a lodge and was destroyed by fire after one of its meetings in July 1910.*\n\n[There are several errors in this paragraph:\n\nConstruction was begun in 1851, but abandoned in 1852 when the walls were about four feet high.\n\nWhen men returned from the goldfields it was completed and finally opened for service in September 1861.\n\nIt was used by many different groups over several decades.  The Aberdeen Oddfellows’ Lodge seems to have met there for most of the building’s existence.  The building is reported as burning down on the evening of Wednesday 20 July 1910.  Since the lodge meetings were held on alternate Thursdays, this was not following a lodge meeting.  Earlier in the night Mr C. Lowe had been in the premises cleaning the lamps, but no cause for the fire could be established.] Roger Frahn Owen Schulz Mr C.

A grant of $11,283 came from the History Trust of SA and $30,000 from Burra’s Jubilee 150 grant, combined with much voluntary labour to produce a fine museum display.  Colin Fidock was responsible for the preparation of the graphics and pictures – a job requiring much research and most of his spare time.  Pam Marlow’s Monster Mine Model is one of the highlights of the museum.  The Branch has recently applied to the History Trust of SA for an archaeological study leading to a better understanding of the Bon Accord history.\n\nIn 1987 the branch will undertake further restoration work at Redruth Gaol, funded by the Commonwealth Bank.  It is one of six sites in Australia to be funded as part of their $500,000 ‘Heritage 88 Project’ and represents SA’s portion.\n\nThis $50,000 will enable much needed restoration and upgrading of the approach to the gaol and to the car park.\n\nThis year saw the installation of enamel interpretive signs at all our main sites and identification signs.  A grant of $1,500 from the Department of Tourism was matched by the Burra National Trust.\n\nIn 1986 Mr John restored Burra’s first [motorised] fire engine – a Model T Ford.  The MFS believes it is SA’s oldest motorised fire engine and the oldest Model T fire engine in Australia.  The other two fire engines owned by the Branch took part in the Bay to Birdwood Run last year – the Diamond T and the Denis.  On the drive home the 1936 Diamond T clocked up its first 5,000 miles.\n\nThe Branch now urgently needs a building to house them.  Elected: Chairman, Maureen Wright; Vice-Chairman Management, Helen Stockman; Vice-Chairman Works & Buildings, Barry Wright; Vice-Chairman Fundraising & Catering, Audrey Little; Secretary, Robyn Page and Treasurer pro tem Avian Pink.\n\nBob Lewis was the guest speaker.

Visitors today can see the 300 foot Bon Accord shaft, from which Burra drew its water supply for many years.  The Bon Accord Mining Co.’s lease bordered that of the SA Mining Association’s hugely successful Burra Burra Mine.  The Bon Accord buildings were completed in 1859, but despite all efforts no deposit of copper was found.  There is yet 100 years of waterworks history to be discovered at the ‘Bon’ and some archaeological studies are yet to be undertaken.  It has just been announced that the ‘Bon’ has received a Community Development grant of almost $20,000 to ensure that work continues for some time.  The site is on the register of State Heritage Items and is registered by the National Trust of SA.  The Bon accord Mine Engineer’s Workshop is also on the State heritage Register and classified by the National Trust.

It is due to funding from the Jubilee 150 Board, the Department of Mines & Energy, the Department of tourism and the Burra Burra DC.  It stands among other ruins on the lip of the open cut.  Some of Burra’s elderly folk who witnessed its burning in 1926 can scarcely believe its transformation.  It originally housed a Cornish beam engine and was built in 1858 to facilitate the de-watering of the mine.  Its huge pump moved at 8 strokes per minute and raised 3 million gallons of water per day.  The three interior chambers have been rebuilt with a large cut-out representing the huge 80 inch cylinder which once worked there.  Many displays centred upon Cornish beam engines have been placed there and visitors can get a commanding view of the modern open cut and its lake from the top floor.  The building’s environs are equally fascinating.  The excavated miners’ adit now gives people access to the 600 foot deep Morphett’s Shaft.  In walking through the tunnel people are treading on timbers that have lain there for 140 years, some of them charred from the 1926 fire.  Around the area are archaeological artefacts, interpretive signs, Morphett’s Whim House and the old reservoir.

Samuel had married Ann, the daughter of a Welsh smelter, in 1862 and they moved to the Penglawdd Street cottage soon after.  Samuel outlived Ann by three years, dying in 1938 aged 98.  Miss Mabel lived there until just before her death in 1983 in her 100th year.  The cottage has changed little since her death.  It retains the charm of country life as she would have known it.  Miss Mabel loved fruit and flowers and the garden has been replanted with heritage roses, fruit trees and herbs and the old pines and pepper trees remain.  Accommodation is available for up to six people in three double bedrooms and the pantry is well stocked.

He has been much involved in community activities, having been Chairman of the Coppertown Festival, and secretary of the Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  With the downturn in the rural economy the town has to develop tourism to maintain services and employment.  Rationalisation of Council plant and staff and services has been the right step.  The Council needs to be efficient if it is to keep its identity in the face of threatened Council amalgamations.\n\nGary Donaldson is a professional wood-turner and has lived in Burra for two years as co-proprietor of the award-winning Cousin Jack’s.  He was formerly a supervisor trainer with the E & WS Department and has extensive experience in management, customer contact and presentation techniques training.  He advocates open government and is a strong supporter of Burra’s destiny as a quality tourism product.\n\nBarry Wright has been a Burra North resident for four years.  He and his wife own a wool and skin business and have renovated the old Sara’s Store, which now operates as Sara’s Secondhand Goods and Clothes.  Before coming to Burra they successfully published and distributed a set of navigation charts of the River Murray upstream of Renmark.  Barry is an active member of the Burra National Trust and has been involved in community projects like the Copper Festival.

It was then newly built, standing at the extreme northern end of section 1 – the original section taken by the SA Mining Association.  After changing hands several times, the licence passed to W. Woollacott in 1861 (famous for hauling the giant boiler from Pt Adelaide to Burra on the jinker now housed adjacent to Market Square).  The Opie family acquired it in 1863 and it became known as Opie’s Hotel.  It was de-licensed about 19221.  Ian Auhl says it is believed to be the oldest hotel in SA still in its original condition, having been converted into flats just by closing doors along a passageway leading from the bar to the rear of the building.  It retains its shingle roof under the galvanised iron.  The walls are eighteen inches thick and there is a large dry cellar under the bar.  The building has casement windows throughout2.  The building has eighteen rooms and is of about 40 squares set on an acre of land with more than 200 foot frontage to the Barrier Highway.  There is a large underground tank and the remains of a stone stable.  It is on the recorded list of the National Trust.  The current owners are Gerry & Carmel O’Connor.\n\n[1It closed in 1917 and the licence was transferred to the Booborowie Hotel.\n\n2This is nearly true, but there are a couple of double hung sash windows.] Mr J.

The eldest of six children, he left school aged 13 and began working in a market garden.\n\nHe and his wife, plus the eldest of their children, came to Burra in 1931 during the Depression years, to establish a country market for the fruit and vegetables he grew in the Adelaide Hills.  Over the next few years, he established a green grocery business here.\n\nIn 1946 he became a Councillor in the Corporation of Burra, and between 1954 and 1969 was Mayor.\n\nHis achievements during those years were many, but the more notable was the building of the St John Ambulance Centre, and the development of the Burra Oval.\n\nHowever, probably the most visionary of all his work related to the Corporation’s purchase of the old Burra Mine area with a view to its preservation and development into a tourist attraction.\n\nHappily, he saw much conservation and development take place over the ensuing years and was very pleased with the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee project’s work in that area.  Ted was always interested in history and heritage-they were great loves of his.\n\nHe became immersed in the work of preserving Paxton's Square and again was rewarded by seeing the Square develop onto a fine accommodation area.\n\nHe was a member of the former Lewis Trust, and was treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management which administers the Square, right up until his death.\n\nIn 1985, the town showed its appreciation to him by awarding him the Australia Day Citizen of the Year Award.\n\nTo name all the committees and groups with which Ted was associated over his life in Burra would be a monumental task, but suffice to say he was a very public-minded citizen, and retained an astute interest in the affairs of the town right up until his death.\n\nTo the Baulderstone family is offered the condolences and sympathy of the community.\n\nTed always acknowledged the support given him by his wife Doreen, who predeceased him by some three years, over his public life.  He is survived by four sons and three daughters, and their families.\n\n[Edward (Ted) Thomas Baulderstone born 1 September 1904 Clarence Park: died 30 April 1897 Elizabeth.] Edward Thomas Baulderstone Ted Doreen Baulderstone family Burra Scott Creek Adelaide Hills Paxton's Square Burra Oval Burra Heritage Town Jubilee Clarence Park Elizabeth death obituary community heritage local government",

      "content": "Jennison’s Tyre Service will cease trading on 15 May.  The Jennison family connection with Burra’s automotive businesses stretches back to 1922 when Ray’s father, Horton Jennison was the BMC dealer.  In 1956 Ray returned to Burra from Adelaide and the Jennisons then applied for the Ford dealership.  The wool industry was booming and branching into the automotive business in Burra was timely.  Horton Jennison died in 1967.  In the early days of the business it operated from the section of the building adjacent to Pearce’s Buildings.  The rest of the building was purchased from the late Glen Finch in 1960.  Later the firm bought the Eastern Telegraph [actually Telephone] Exchange on the south side of Commercial Street, which many will recall had housed the Air Force Clubrooms on the top floor.  This building was demolished to make way for the car yard.  The remaining business area on the south side as we know it today was purchased from H.C. Davies in 1958 and from C.J. Pearce & Son in 1966.  In 1978 the Toyota dealership was added.  Disaster struck in August 1985 when fire destroyed the section of building closest to Pearce’s Buildings.  This was rebuilt.  Ray Jennison is the third longest serving Ford dealer principal in SA.  He was a member of the Ford National Dealer Council for some 13 years.  In 1964 Jennison’s began business in Clare and leased that business from 1969-72.  Between 1972 and 1978 he again operated it, until selling to Clare Valley Motors.  Ray has also had an active involvement in the community.  His retirement closes a long chapter in Burra’s Commercial history.  From 19 May Neal Webster and Andrew Nourse, currently on the staff of Jennison’s Tyre Service, will begin business as Burra auto Repairs and will operate as authorised Ford Part & Warranty outlet from an entrance off Kangaroo Street.  The rest of the premises on the south side of Commercial Street will be leased to Elders Pastoral. Ray Jennison Horton Jennison Glen Finch H.C. Davies C.J.

The two storey Elders office building is now the Tourist Information Centre.  The land for the saleyards was acquired from James Shakes and John Lewis at a cost of £518-15-0.  The original red and blue gum post and rail sheep yards cost £120-16-0.\n\nIn 1902 a newspaper report says Burra was then recognised as the principal market in SA and Elder, Smith & Co. decided to erect their own yards.  The then new yards were designed to hold 40,000 sheep and at the recent off-shears sale 44,000 sheep were offered and sold.\n\nElder’s first Burra office were modest facilities at the rear of Drew & Crewes’ Store.  Tenders were called for the two storey office in 1890 and it was open for business in 1891.  They moved to their recently vacated offices after merging with Goldsbrough Mort in the 1960s.  In 1887 the flat rate of commission was 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep.  Records show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents at Burra exceeded 500,000 per annum.  One record about 1890 reports a private sale of 19,995 two-toothed ewes sold for 17/9 each and one injured one at 3/-, revealing a generation that expected nothing and gave nothing.\n\nIn 1906 one of the first pieces of high-tech equipment was introduced to the office – a typewriter.  In 1904 the office took delivery of its first motor vehicle, but horses and buggies were retained till 1917. James Shakes John Lewis Elder, Smith & Co.

To the end of July 1987 there had been visits by 3,155 adults, 243 children, 589 families and 307 pensioners.  In addition there were some tourist bus groups and students.\n\nIn May the History Trust had granted $2,000 for a cataloguing and registration of portable artefacts on the site.  The recent DEP grant of some $104,137 towards a total project of $130,703 will enable much more conservation and some walking trails to be undertaken.

      "content": "Local History Room Opened\n\nThis was built last year in the form of a mezzanine floor adjacent to the Burra Community Library and was funded jointly by the Sa Libraries Board, the Education Department and the Burra Burra DC.  Chairman of the Burra Community Library Board of Management Sue Warnes welcomed everyone and introduced librarian Colin Fidock.  He said:\n\nHistory was a reflection of lives.  Local History was a heritage we handed on to following generations.  Ian Auhl the teacher and historian was able to see how significant the discovery of copper and the growth of the Burra Mine was to SA, but also to the growth of and in the lives of those who lived and will live in this district.  The people of Burra were indebted to his dedication and conviction.  He had given so much of his life in showing how proud Australians should be of this remarkable town.  The Local History Room holds in perpetual trust the life work of Ian Auhl in a notable collection of indexes, references, books and photographs of Burra and District, along with genealogical references of great significance to family history researchers and access to state records via microfilm and fiche, supplemented now by the two publications ‘Let’s Not Forget’ and ‘Relatively Speaking’.\n\nColin went on to acknowledge the efforts of Ian and Eva Auhl, the late Ann Perry, Shirley Thamm, Margaret Henderson, Di Day, Debbie Brown, Tess Hopkins, Chris McCabe, Cynthia Burnett and Roger Henderson for his belief in, and striving for such a special room.  He also thanked the bodies who had funded it.\n\nChris McCabe was then called upon to open the room in the absence of Ian Auhl who was prevented from attending by illness.  He read a speech prepared by Ian Auhl for the occasion.  Ian recalled the lack of library facilities when he had first come to Burra in the 1960s and referred to the marvellous Community Library now in place.  He too thanked those who had worked to bring together this collection of Burra’s History.\n\nHe said that when he had come to Burra in 1964 he knew nothing of its History except that he had been born here in 1914.  Though he had then written nothing, he was hooked on Burra from the moment he arrived.  He said he had told the story up to 1877 so there was plenty yet to research and more of the story to be told.  This history room is the starting place for that story.\n\nBefore Chris cut the ribbon to open the room, Roger Henderson, past Principal of BCS performed a short acknowledgement and read two citations to accompany framed photographs of Ian Auhl and Colin Fidock.\n\nThe opening of the room coincided with the ninth birthday of the Burra Community Library.

The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year.  The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.

It had been a time of financial restraint and increasing demand.  All hospitals faced a 1% budget cut after allowing for only a 4% inflation rate.  Burra was one of the cheapest hospitals in the state on the basis of cost per occupied bed day and had felt the cuts more than some places with ‘fat’ to cut.  Additional monies had to be sought to balance the budget.  During the year the part-time physiotherapist was not replaced and one trainee nurse position was cut.  Community support had been ongoing and was much valued.  Meals on wheels continued to provide a service for an increasing frail aged population.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary enabled the hospital to buy much needed equipment.  During the year the SA Health Commission proposed to remove obstetric and neo-natal from all country hospitals, but after community response any change appears to have been deferred for the time being.  SA Health refused to update laundry equipment and the hospital has transferred laundry services to Central Linen, effecting a saving in salaries and goods and services.  This reduced the need for voluntary sewing women who had worked for years for the hospital.  He thanked Mrs Florrie Scroop and her helpers for all their efforts over the years.  Burra St John Ambulance Service had donated a $2,900 patient lifter.  Bathroom floors had been resurfaced and several other safety initiatives undertaken.  Unfortunately requests for funding for an Aged Persons Hostel near the hospital were unsuccessful.  The casualty and outpatient area needed expansion due to increased tourist traffic.  There had been no major building improvements for fourteen years.  Stronger approaches to SA Health were needed for more equitable funding for expenses and capital works.
