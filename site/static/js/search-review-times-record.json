      "content": "Booborowie History\n\nBooborowie was first opened for pastoral settlement in 1843, but not until 1846 did two brothers William J. & John H. Browne apply for an occupation licence.  Later in 1848 a further licence was applied for the area north of the Broughton adjoining the run granted to Messrs Browne in 1847 to the westward.  These two areas are now Booborowie.  The name is an Aboriginal word for round water hole.  The head station was located on Section 1000 and consists of an area of around 80 acres.  It was purchased at auction by James Brown for £80.  In 1851 waste lands of the Crown leases were issued in lieu of occupation licences and lease 130 (Booborowie) was granted to William and John Browne.  This originally comprised 153 square miles.  Two square miles were added in 1860 and on 17 December 1863 the Hundred of Ayers was proclaimed, within which Booborowie is located.  It was subdivided into sections and land was first offered for sale in 1864.  Most sites were bought by the Browne Brothers.  The south portion was re-subdivided and sold by Arthur Scott Browne of Buckland Filleigh Co. Devon England in c. 1910.  The northern part was sold by Percival John Browne and Arthur Scott Browne as executors of W.J. Browne who died in 1894.  It was bought in 1897 by Henry Dutton of Anlaby and George Melrose of Ulooloo.  In 1910 the land was offered for sale by Messrs Dutton and Melrose to the Government.  The offer was accepted and the land subdivided as North Booborowie Estate and sold under close settlement agreements.\n\nThe township was proclaimed 29 March 1877 and surveyed in the same year by W.H. Cornish.  The first building was the Methodist Church erected in 1891 at a cost of £194.  It was leased by the Government for use as a school for 27 years.  A prosperous town developed as the climate and soil favoured sheep and cattle.\n\n[Photo of the Big Store, Booborowie.]\n\nBCS.  The annual sports day last Thursday was held in ideal conditions.

Clode’s have a long association with Burra.  Late in 1929 Eric Clode’s father, Mr Arthur (Laurie) Clode, decided to open a hardware shop to compliment his building business.  At that time the emphasis was on general building materials.  In 1949 Eric joined as an apprentice carpenter, a trade he continued until 1959 when he began to spend more time in the shop.  He saw the opportunity for a larger shopping complex and purchased the site for the new premises.  Work began on the new premises last June and it is designed to be a one stop shop for the handyman. As well as hardware there is a small music centre, the Burra Sports Centre and the Cornwall Kitchen, which specialises in take-away food and there is also a Laundromat.  The old shop has been retained for heavier hardware lines.

He was a past President of the SA Merino Stock Breeders Association and a committee member since the early 1960s.  He was well known as a judge of Merinos at Royal Shows in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth as well as at country shows.  He was President of the SA Stud Merino Breeders Association 1968-70.  He was born on the family property at Elliston in 1921 and he registered his Merino Stud there in 1949.  In 1956 he transferred it to Burra, retaining ‘The Grove’ as the stud name.  At the Perth Royal Show ram sales last year ‘The Grove’ sold an outstanding ram to an East Wickepin WA buyer for $26,000 (by a sire from Ashrose, Hallett; a bloodline originating from Collinsville and used by ‘The Grove’ since its inception.)  In 1960 Mr Brown pioneered the Arubiddy Station on the Nullarbor Plain, which now carries 16,000 Merinos and is run by his sons Peter and Dean.  Mr Brown had been Chairman of the Burra Burra DC 1972-76, a member of the Burra Bowling Club for ten years and in his early days played cricket in Burra.  As well as his sons Mr Brown is survived by his widow, Zita Brown and daughter, Rosemary, now living in Queensland.  The funeral on Monday at St Joseph’s Burra was one of the largest seen in the area.\n\n[William Brown born 10 May 1921 Elliston.] Mr Bill Brown Peter Dean Zita Brown Rosemary The Grove Burra Adelaide Melbourne Sydney Perth Elliston East Wickepin Nullarbor Plain Queensland death obituary agriculture merino community",

Mr Shipard welcomed visitors and recommended the booklet on the show’s 100 years (at $1 each), which had been launched by Mr Roy Jeffery at Monday night’s Centenary Dinner.\n\nSpecial features this year were a Grand Parade and sheep dog demonstration.  Three new life members: Mr Rex Warnes, Mr Brian Riggs and Mr Murray Stockman were congratulated.  Rex had served as President for two terms totalling nine years and Murray for three years.  Mr Neil Humphrys of Radio 5AD then opened the show.  He was a grandson of Mr Ray Humphrys [sic: for Roy] whose work for the Burra Show meant a lot to him over many years.  Miss Susan Holly of Adelaide was judged Miss Show Girl.  Jane Kellock won the junior section and Leanne Dunstan the sub-junior.  The Grand Parade was led by the Austin Car Club followed by tractors, implements, vehicles and horses.  The open shearing contest was won by Steve Pittaway and Donald Griffen won the Novice Section.\n\n[Results are printed in an abbreviated and not very informative format – each section has a list of prize winners without any indication of what for.] Mr Shipard Mr Roy Jeffery Mr Rex Warnes Mr Brian Riggs Mr Murray Stockman Mr Neil Humphrys Mr Ray Humphrys Miss Susan Holly Jane Kellock Leanne Dunstan Steve Pittaway Donald Griffen Town Hall Adelaide show community award parade competition",

      "url": "/records/review_times_record_content_1927/",
      "content": "Obituary.  The sudden death of Mr Roy Jeffery commonly referred to by many as ‘The Master’ came as a shock.  He was the Headmaster of Burra High School 1954-58 and he and his wife Gwen soon became part of Burra.  Apart from the school, his greatest occupation during his term as Headmaster was the provision of a swimming pool.  At a meeting in March 1956 he moved the motion that called for a public pool to be built and managed by a community committee.  When it was passed he later became the secretary of the new committee.  In August 1956 excavation work started, but the River Murray floods at Renmark saw earth moving plant rushed there from Burra.  Mr Jeffery was involved in the money raising efforts for the pool – football matches, concerts, and amateur hours.  At the AGM in 1957 it was revealed that over £1,000 was available.  On 7 July that year the floor of the pool was completed and an application made for another grant of £1,500.  The pool walls were completed in November and the pool was fenced in January 1958.\n\nThe High School was reclassified in August 1958 and it seemed Mr Jeffery would be transferred.  Representations through the local MP, Mr Quirke, persuaded the Minister to leave him in place rill the end of the year.\n\nWork at the pool went on, with a wading pool and surrounds to be completed and dressing sheds.  A further grant of £750 was received.  By 25 November 1958 the foundations for dressing sheds were down and work began on the walls.  A final push for funds ‘The Fiver Band’ raised £245 quickly and by 2 December reached £415 and it was hoped to open the pool before Christmas.  By 9 December there was £525 in the kitty and on 16 December £580.  At that stage Mr & Mrs Jeffery were being farewelled prior to their transfer to Clare, by numerous sporting and other bodies with which they had been associated.  A capacity crowd at speech night extolled the efforts of Mr Jeffery at the school in his five years there.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone extended that praise to his efforts in the wider community and in particular to the swimming pool project.  The pool proved very popular in the summer of 1958-59, with takings averaging £20 per week.  It was also used for the Learn to Swim Campaign and many hundreds of young people have since learned to swim in the pool.  Despite being in use, it was decided to defer the official opening till the next season, when the buildings and surroundings would finally be completed.  Mr & Mrs Jeffery returned for the occasion when Mr G. Stanley Hawker performed the official act on 30 January 1960.  Mr Jeffery moved the vote of thanks to Mr Hawker.  He did not build the pool, but his enthusiasm was a major contributing factor towards the completion of the project free from debt and it can truly be said he left his mark in Burra.\n\n[Contributed by Bob Angel.]  [Roy Gordon Jeffery born 27 October 1910 Pt Pirie West.] Mr Roy Jeffery Gwen Mr Quirke Mayor E.T.

She came to Australia by boat with her two daughters, on a two month holiday.  Her maiden name was Kennedy and her father was a school teacher in Burra for about three years.  A school house was being built in Kangaroo Street, but it was not ready in time, so the family stayed at the Commercial Hotel.  Her sister was seven and tempted sorely by the stairway banister of the first two storey building she had seen.  She slid down the rail, but at the turn half-way down she fell and broke her shoulder.  The doctor was called and confirmed the break, but said he must first attend to her mother, whom he took into Room 1 and delivered a baby girl – now Mrs Drinkwater – on 16 January 1893.

      "content": "BCS was opened by the Minister of Education Dr Don Hopgood last Friday.\n\n[Photo of the crowd in the quadrangle.]\n\nMr Ian Allen on behalf of the School Council, Parents & Friends’ association, staff and students, welcomed the visitors and introduced the Principal Mr Chris McCabe.  He said that as most people knew, the Minister of Education had accepted the offer of $20,000 from the community to extend the size of the gymnasium.  He called on Mr Ray Jennison to hand over the Council’s contribution of $10,000.  Mr Jennison said the very welcome decision of the Government to build the new school ended a 30 year battle featuring small periods of optimism and large periods of pessimism.  He said the thought at first of a 20 acre site outside the town was horrifying.  The new school surpassed their wildest dreams and as a Council they were proud of the Community Library.  Burra was placed in the vanguard of new developments and concept and we thank all who had faith in Burra and worked to achieve this magnificent result.  We thank the Government and the Public Buildings Department for giving the Burra Burra DC the earthworks contract, which enabled the Council to hold onto their workforce – it was in effect a grant of $130,000 to the Council.  The decision to have a full-sized gymnasium when the opportunity was offered was an easy one.  Mr Jennison then handed over the cheque, saying: ‘If the Hon. Minister accedes to all our requests for the next twelve months, we’ll probably sign it.’\n\nMr McCabe then introduced Mr Ron Thamm to hand over the School Council’s $10,000 cheque.  Mr Thamm said it was fitting that Burra should start the second century of education with a facility of this magnitude and grandeur.  He said this is to me a day of thanksgiving and a day to recall the many organisations and people who have played a role and have contributed to the project.\n\n[He went on to mention Mr Birdsie, the architect, the present Government, Mr Claude Allen, Dr Hopgood, the Education Department, past and present District Councils, School Councils and committees and the Public Buildings Department.]  He then handed over the $10,000 cheque.\n\nMr McCabe called on Dr Hopgood to officially open the school.  Dr Hopgood drew attention to the vast number of people and organisations that have come together to make such a project possible and to make it a success.  Apart from building a school for the children, the Education Department wanted the people of Burra and the surrounding district to share and be part of the new school.  A key feature was the recreation facilities and another was the Community Library.  The Department of Further Education had also made a valuable contribution.  He hoped the co-operation evident to date would long continue.  [He then went on to develop the idea of whole community involvement in education with wide ranging use of school facilities every day of the week and throughout the year.]\n\nHe was sure a problem solving and child centred approach was the way forward.  He said budget constraints would prevent this type of facility from being put everywhere in SA, but future building programs would certainly aim to be as flexible as possible so they could accommodate where possible community purposes.  He said community education required some definite guidelines:\n\nAn openness of attitude and ease of access for people of all ages.\n\nThe community needs to be actively engaged in the education process.\n\nA loose relationship with other services is essential.  Too often schools have been seen as the only resource for the community.\n\nIt must be realised that Community Education allows for extensive involvement and community participation in the school and for school participation in the community.  Schools can make their resources available to the community and the community can reciprocate.\n\nIn some schools like Burra’s this sharing can become quite complex with special management groups and committees to co-ordinate participation.  He ended by praising the Public Buildings Department, which had completed the project sixteen weeks ahead of schedule and saved on the budgeted cost.  He declared the school open and granted a half-holiday.\n\nMr McCabe called on Mr Graham Gunn, Member for Eyre, to propose the vote of thanks.  Dennis Thamm and Roxanne Hall, representing the students, presented a collection of Burra booklets to Dr Hopgood.

Policies and practical guidelines will be developed to encourage tourism and commerce.  Much of the early settlement, old mines and historic buildings are intact and set within a pleasant town character.  It is important because so much of the original settlement and mines still exist.  Consultants will prepare a planning scheme with policies, guidelines and proposals aimed at enhancing the history and character of the town to ensure future development is sympathetic to the existing character.  The community will be involved by way of public displays later in the project, but persons wishing to be involved are invited to address comments on the project care of the Burra Burra DC.

      "content": "Obituary.  Dr Martin Francis Toal DD died in Melbourne on 22 April aged 77.  He was well known in the Burra and Jamestown area and his pastoral work in the Burra Parish dated back to 1930.  Though stationed at Jamestown, he from time to time took turns with Monsignor F.A. Hentschke to help out Fr Morrissey in Burra.  Fr Morrissy remained in charge certainly until mid 1937, but records show Dr Toal was in residence there by October 1937 and he stayed till the end of 1948, however he also served as an interpreter and chaplain at Loveday Internment Camp from the end of 1941 to June 1942.  He was later appointed to the staff of St Francis Xavier’s Seminary in the Philosophy Faculty and his pastoral work ceased.  When a new priestly staff was provided by the Vincentian Order Dr Toal was granted leave to study overseas and the greater part of his research was done in Rome.  He spent more than 25 years of painstaking study and translation on scripture used in the Liturgy of the Church from the early Greek Fathers.  His latest work covering eleven years of research is in the process of publication. Thirty-six priests led by Bishop Bryan Gallagher con-celebrated Requiem Mass with his brother, Monsignor T.F.

David Wilkinson (35) is foreman with eight years with the company, and he does the line and level reading and fills in wherever needed.  The Public Health Department is represented by former local Maurice Woollacott.  The gang commenced work at the oxidation lagoon in the creek area below the cemetery and the project is due for completion in July.  There are 1,196 yards of trench with six inch pipes, 2,781 yards with four inch pipe and 706 yards of four inch connecting pipes to 131 properties.  There is then 2,062 yards of trench to take the pump line.  The gang has managed to work on a given section each day with minimum inconvenience to residents and traffic.  They have managed to avoid PMG cables and water pipes, except for one of the latter in Market Square.  The hardest digging was in Lewis Street in the Housing Trust area where jack hammers were needed.  There were hard sections in Commercial Street too, but the back hoe and ripper sufficed.

He will give an illustrated account of his recent trip to the copper mines of Cornwall.  His information will be of great use when the Morphett pumphouse at Burra was restored.  This was operating in the days before photography was developed and there are no good pictures of what it looked like, said Branch President Maureen Wright.  Mr Drew will conduct a tour of the Morphett’s pumphouse, the old smelts area and the buddle pits on 8 September.  Many of those who went on his last tour in April said they had not realised how historically fascinating the area was and how much remained there.  About 25 people had gone on that tour.

      "content": "The 5th Annual Burra Yacht Club Regatta will be held 13 October.  A feature this year will be the Copper Man Competition, said Secretary Steve Woolley.  There will also be a Clare-Burra Barrow Push.  Four teams have so far entered.  This will provide experience for the big Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push planned for January 1986.  The Royal Caledonian Pipe Band will also be present.  There will be events for Juniors, Seniors and Ladies as well as Open Events.  The Tracker James Perpetual Trophy will be awarded to the boat and crew with the nest results at the end of the day.  This was first awarded in 1983 to commemorate one of the characters who first started the regatta.  According to Mr Woolley the idea for the event was born in the mid 1970s during ‘one of Burra’s notorious floods’.  Peter Reilly and Tracker James had a discussion about who could sail furthest down the Burra Creek.  They decided to put claims to the test over the long weekend in October.  No one knows what really happened, but it is believed that both the home-made craft sank and quite a quantity of beer was consumed.  As a result the rules of the regatta allow anything from craft made from beer cans to bathtubs as long as they can float.  Boats must carry a sail of at least one square metre and can be no larger than two metres square.  But Mr Woolley dais any entries bearing any resemblance to a real yacht would probably be banned.  Last year there were 160 entries and about 2,000 spectators.  About $2,000 was raised for local charities and for the Yacht Club’s beautification program for the creek banks.  There is a plan for a new gate in the weir so that the creek could be cleaned out regularly.  A cabaret in the Town Hall will conclude the event.

He spoke on his recent visit to the tin and copper mining areas of Cornwall.  He said that Burra’s pumphouses were probably in a better condition than the hundreds in grey granite in Cornwall.  The Burra Mine had been virtually untouched for [almost] a century before the Samin Company re-opened the mine in 1969.  Branch President Mrs Wright said the old open cut had been quite picturesque with the pool being used as the local swimming hole.  Mr Drew had slides of the old open cut and of the old chimney before its relocation at the mine entrance and the blowing up of its associated pumphouse.  Mrs Wright said the stone from the pumphouse had been used in other restoration work around the town.  Mr Drew led a tour of the mine the next day.  About 40 people took part.  Mr Drew said it was a myth that the round chimneys were built by Cornishmen and the square ones by Welsh.  He had proof that the square chimney at the mine site was built by a Cornishman.  The tour included the buddle pits and the smelting area. Greg Drew Mrs Wright Samin Company Cornwall Burra Mine Burra mining heritage talk tour",

District Clerk Mr Alan Dwyer said the Council was seeking an investigation into the activities of the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning and of the Jubilee 150 Board before the money was re-allocated.  The Council considers the re-allocation unacceptable and unfair.  Federal MP for Wakefield Mr Neil Andrew and the State member for Eyre were both following the matter up, but it is believed that the Premier Mr Bannon would not oppose the re-allocation.  It is believed the money has been re-allocated to the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum because that project had run over budget.  Mr Dwyer pointed out the coincidence that there is an Independent Labor candidate running against the sitting Labor member in Port Adelaide.  Burra heritage projects had been allocated $470,000 and its spending had been decided by the Jubilee 150 Board and the steering committee of the Burra Council.  $150,000 had been spent on Paxton Cottages and $30,000 was being spent on the Bon Accord site.  The remainder was to have been spent on Morphett’s pumphouse and a Copper Interpretive Centre.  Mr Dwyer said the delay in spending the grant was due to a number of factors including the interference by the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and planning, which had refused to allow construction of the centre on the site of the old boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s pumphouse.   The manager of the Heritage Conservation Branch Mr John Womersley said the new building would be inappropriate to the character of the pumphouse and is believed to have recommended the re-allocation of the grant money.  The District Clerk said the Council had originally bought the old Salvation Army Citadel to house the interpretative centre, but the Heritage Conservation Branch had rejected that as not having either the right social atmosphere or the rite site.  The Council then proposed the Bon Accord Mine site, but this in turn was rejected as being the ‘back door’ of the mine area.  Finally a site some 200 m from Morphett’s Pumphouse was approved, but after an architect had prepared plans it was found that site would double the costs allocated for the project.  The architect was sacked and a new proposal for a smaller building on the old boiler house site was submitted to the Jubilee 150 Board on 21 August.  They rejected it.

The aim was to enable isolated students who now did correspondence courses to have access to a school.  Students from small country towns would also be accommodated.  Mr Henderson said the school would like the facility to be housed in a number of small cottage-type units with a recreations room, a study room and a sick bay with a trained nurse and laundry facilities.

The Trust was concerned that it had not been consulted about the plans and while they supported the re-development in principle, they were concerned that the Council seems to have accepted inexpensive light poles without making an effort to see what else was available.  President Maureen Wright said at present it looks like an aluminium jungle.  Council had decided to use slate salvaged from the foyer of the school rather than pavers.  The Trust was certainly pleased to see the undergrounding of the power supply. Maureen Wright Burra Market Square heritage redevelopment council",

About 400 attended the gala ball and the $4,800 raised by the weekend will be shared by ten community groups.  The celebrations began with a procession on Saturday morning, which included three old fire engines from Burra and Clydesdale horses from Geralka Farm.  A float commemorating the 75th birthday of the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall featured old style dancing.  Seven members of the Yankalilla Light Horse, clad in WWI uniforms marched and one float featured an old time schoolroom.  After the parade the book Razorback Country was launched by its publisher Mr Peter Cotton from Adelaide.  It was written by local resident Mrs Ruth Stolte.    250 copies were sold over the weekend.  Mrs Oakley said 400 people attended the barbecue lunch.  In the afternoon the Light Horse Brigade gave a demonstration of tent pegging and there were also sheep dog trials and a blade shearing demonstration.  Hay rides were popular and there was a bus tour of the old Mt Bryan Station and other homesteads.  The oldest former resident to return was Mr Vic Pearce 91, of Adelaide.  Static displays included lead lighting by Helen Reed, floral art by Joyce Lloyd and wood carving by Audrey van Buuren (all of Burra).  Pat Brereton’s water-colour scenes also proved popular.  200 people crammed the hall for the gala ball.  The master of ceremonies there was Mr Tim Butler of Radio 5CK.  Ralph Oakley won the beard-growing contest. Father Lawrie Quinn led the ecumenical church service on Sunday assisted by Uniting Church Minister Malcolm Thomas, Fr Richard Morris of the Anglican Church and Fr Kenny from the Roman Catholic Church.

A petition has been presented to the Burra DC calling for further work on Market Square to be postponed pending the publishing of an artist’s impression and its examination at a public meeting.  It was initiated by the Burra branch of the National Trust and attracted 570 signatures.  It was presented to the Council by President Maureen Wright at their Monday night meeting.  She pointed out that Burra had more heritage listed buildings per square kilometre than any other town in Australia and was among the six most significant heritage towns in Australia.  For these reasons the Council should seek the input of a qualified town planner with heritage experience before proceeding further.  She said that while some suggestions, like the use of late paving had been taken on board, other aspect, such as lighting, had been rushed through.  The Highways department spokesman said non-approved lighting would not attract the 50% subsidy on cost and maintenance.  Mrs Wright said that all they wanted was for the Council to investigate all possibilities.  Mr Des Menz, the Acting District Clerk, said the meeting had been valuable in bringing public opinion out in the open.  Mrs Wright would be invited to a Council executive meeting to be called soon to discuss the petition’s proposals.

The Burra Football Club has agreed to amalgamate with the Booborowie-Hallett Club if certain conditions are met.  70% of members attending a special meeting on 27 November agreed to the move.  This was a complete reversal of an earlier decision in November.  This was probably due to the new conditions specified.  Burra asked that all games be played at Burra and the name of the amalgamated club be Burra-Booborowie-Hallett rather than North-East Districts.  Both the existing clubs believed they would struggle to field teams in all divisions in the future.  The number of juniors was expected to drop dramatically in the 1990s.  Currently there were only 80 senior male students at BCS.  The amalgamation would reduce the number of team places from 160 to 80.  The amalgamation would lead to a stronger club and would strengthen the very successful Burra Sports and Community Club.  Booborowie-Hallett would now consider the proposal with the new conditions.  If amalgamation proceeded Burra Football Club would not immediately disband, but would instead go into recess for two years.  Burra football amalgamation community sports",

It includes an index of historical newspaper references, which he used in writing his book The Monster Mine.  There is also a biographical index of people mentioned in those references, together with collections of local maps, photos and negatives.  The Community Librarian, Mr Colin Fidock, said researchers could use the collection once they had filled out an application form, stating the purpose of their research.  He said it was hoped that the collection would eventually be located on the mezzanine floor of the library, though funding for that was still being negotiated.  The collection began when Mr Auhl was preparing a tourist pamphlet for the Burra DC and realised that the town had now newspaper of its own until 1876 and no history books about it except for centenary publications.  References to the town’s history could only be found in a collection of the Adelaide newspaper The Register, kept in the Burra Institute.  Mr Auhl began collecting the references to Burra from that source and miscellaneous references from other books.  The collection was used in the production of the Burra Sketchbook in 1969, which was illustrated by Maurice Perry.  It has since been used in preparing the Burra Conservation Study in 1978.  It has since been used in writing other historical accounts, in tourist pamphlets, for Council submissions and submissions for heritage listings.  Originally it had been intended to house the collection in the Copper Interpretive Centre, but when funding for this was diverted, it was decided to place it at the Burra Community Library.  Mr Auhl said there was still a century of Burra’s history to write, but he could not do it.  Burra’s future as one of Australia’s great historic towns depended on the depth and accuracy of its research he said.  He hoped that in the course of time the collection would ‘attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.’ Ian Auhl Colin Fidock Maurice Perry Burra Burra Community Library Burra DC Burra Institute Adelaide The Register Copper Interpretive Centre library history collection research",

A meeting last week involved the Burra Burra DC, the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning, the Chairman of the National Trust in Burra Mrs Maureen Wright and Mr Gerry O’Connor.  Mrs Wright said the plans were not very different from the original concept.  The Engineer had satisfied the Road Traffic Board and legal requirements, but had not taken into account heritage aspects.  A major problem was that there is a major highway through Burra and the lighting appropriate for a highway looked absolutely horrible in Market Square.

Mrs Marlow now lives in Pinnaroo, but will return to the Bon Accord in the May school holidays to build the hills and landscape for the model.  Chairman of the National Trust Mrs Maureen Wright, said they were seeking old telephone books because their paper made excellent papier mâché.

The museum will also contain a social history of the Burra Burra and Princess Royal Mines.  The original shaft of the Bon Accord Mine has been covered with a glass viewing panel and a safety tail has been installed, so that visitors can now look down the 20 m shaft.

Walsh said the cottages would be remodelled as one-bedroom units with new kitchens, bathrooms and laundries.  Each is currently built on two levels, but the proposal is to build up the back to make a one level unit that is more convenient for elderly people.  New Picket fences will be erected at the front and a colorbond fence at the rear.  Two of the existing tenants would remain and there are already applications from interested parties for the other four.  Rents will be means-tested.

The redevelopment has been controversial since last year when the Council announced new lighting proposals and alternative road route to increase safety.  The protest started at 6 a.m. when Council workers moved in the remove concrete kerbing around the rotunda and the median strip in Market Square.  According to several protesters several incidents occurred before workers took a tea break at 8.45 a.m.  They had not returned to work by noon.  One incident involved Mr Bill Keane, a farmer from Gum Creek and Mr Tom Boulger, a shop owner.  The pair ended up standing in the bucket of a loader that was removing kerbing opposite the rotunda.  They were forced to jump off.  Another protester was Mrs Eunice Baker, who was strongly opposed to the Council’s actions, saying they had ignored ratepayers’ feelings.  She said the Chairman had gone to the Clare Sheep Show and left the newly appointed District Clerk to face the protesters.  She was also unhappy with the National Trust for making a compromise with the Council.  Tourist Information Officer Jenny O’Connor hoped more residents would support the move against the changes to the square.  The square was listed as number six in importance on the National Estate, she said, and the Council had no tight to modernise it.  People were generally rather apathetic, but she thought this issue might galvanize them into action.  Mr Derek Rayfield, Secretary of the Burra Preservation Organisation said the demonstration was spontaneous. The Organisation had collected 819 signatures from 1,471 ratepayers in just a week.

      "content": "Burra Burra DC held ratepayers’ meetings at Mt Bryan & Booborowie last week.  Issues discussed included the current financial situation, future financial strategies, ratings policy, Market Square and future projects.  Many of the Council borrowings were self servicing loans taken out by organisations like the Lewis Trust or sporting clubs, or loans taken out by previous councils for capital works.  District Clerk Mr Walsh said the overall deficit for 1985-86 would be $86,500, which was not much different from last year.  The main factors in an increase were the cut in road funding and the rural recession.  Mr Hawker said the proposed Burra North by-pass was not a Council sponsored project, but had been proposed by the Highways Department.  The Black Bridge at Burra North had a weight limit of 20 tonnes and could not be upgraded.  There was as yet no starting date for the Highways Department project.\n\nDuring the meeting plans were tabled for the proposed redevelopment of the Morphett’s boiler-house.  Council was seeking Australian Bicentennial Funding for this project.  The plans would preserve existing walls and restore the roofline to create a space to house copper and mining history.\n\nConsultants were in the last stages of developing the Supplementary development Plan for the Council.\n\nCouncil would also be seeking ratepayers’ ideas on ward boundaries because new legislation limited the variation in the number of electors each councillor could represent to 10%.  Currently Burra had four town councillors representing about half the electorate and seven rural representatives from the other half.  This imbalance will have to be addressed.\n\nA total of about 150 electors attended the meetings.

      "content": "A Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting on Thursday last at the Burra Civic Centre was attended by about 100 people.\n\nChairman J. Hawker said the Council’s financial position was well within accepted levels, but would require careful watching.  The loan situation was about average compared with other councils.  The Secretary General of the Local Government Association Mr J. Hullick affirmed these statements.  Loans of 26 or 27% of the rate revenue are very much the state average, he said.  Mr Hawker said he would like to change the Council’s rating system in 1987-88.  A significant proportion of Burra is on the minimum rate.  The rural area is subsidising the town area.  As the Local Government Act required a change to ward boundaries to more equal representation of electors, so too should there be an equalising of rates, he said.  Mr Baker suggested that the proposed changes would result in people allowing their property to run down.  Mr McGuiness raised the issue of rural roads.  Mr Hawker said there were problems with rural roads, but some roads had to get priority, not just bits and pieces.  Mr Tebbett said he could not see how this situation would improve with less money spent on roads in 1985-86 compared with 1984-85.  Mr Hawker said this reflected Government policy.  The State has said it will not give out anything for rural arterial roads next year.  The Councillors have tried very hard to get outside money, but Mr Hawker said he was very apprehensive about the forthcoming financial situation.  Mrs Dewhirst questioned whether the Supplementary Development Plan would continue to be an obstacle to installing tiled roofs in the town.  Mrs Baker said they were moving towards a socialist society and thought it frightening.  She saw the examples of Market Square, the supplementary Development Plan and the proposed rating changes as an erosion of the public voice in a democratic country.  Mr Hawker said that electors could call for a poll before any change to the rating system was introduced.  Mrs Dewhirst was concerned about the amount of unauthorised development in the town and wondered whether the Supplementary Development Plan would be as laxly enforced.  Mr Hawker said those who did not act within the law would ultimately face litigation.  Mrs Tennant asked whether the Council was aware of the petition against the Market Square redevelopment.  Mr Hawker said he had been informed it was circulating, but that it was addressed to the Minister for Local Government and the petition was never lodged with the Council.  Mr Denton said many people had signed it because they were concerned by the level of Council debt and thought that by stopping Market Square they would ease the financial position.  Mr Hawker said that as Chairman he ultimately accepted what happened in Council.  He thought it was time to bury the controversy.  Former Mayor Mr Ted Baulderstone also called for reconciliation.  He revived the tradition of calling for a vote of thanks to the Council at the end of the meeting.  He said it was difficult in Council to do what people want all the time.  He hoped the perturbing split in the town over the past few weeks could be healed.  The meeting ended with applause. J. Hawker Mr J. Hullick Mr Baker Mr McGuiness Mr Tebbett Mrs Dewhirst Mrs Baker Mrs Tennant Mr Denton Mr Ted Baulderstone Burra Civic Centre Burra Market Square council finance ward boundaries roads development petition",

It will bring to life the old days of the gaol and reformatory and will be staged 11 & 12 October, with a special schools presentation on 10 October.  It will cost $20,000 and will be exciting and challenging.  Drama students from Flinders University have been researching the mining, church, pastoralists, pastimes, education and architecture of early Burra.  Twenty residents have already provided oral histories of the gaol and what they can remember of its folklore.  There will also be a serious study of the nature of crime in this area in the nineteenth century.  The differences between life in the gaol and the reformatory will be explained.  Parts of the performance may involve folk dancing, bush and choral music, pyrotechnics, giant puppets, kites, readings and re-enactments, film, video and street pageants as well as more conventional scripted theatre.  The aim is to celebrate and record links with the town’s past.  The audience is likely to move through different parts of the gaol as the performance goes on.

The car park would be upgraded and a toilet block erected.  This would enable the facility to be hired out for functions.  The gaol would be the venue for the Redruth drama event during the Copper Festival in October.  When the Trust acquired the building in 1977 the cost of restoration was estimated at $80,000.  The Trust had so far spent about $31,000.  It was worthwhile as the Gaol now attracted about 30,000 visitors per year.

      "content": "Heritage Adviser\n\nAt the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC a visiting officer with the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley, suggested that Burra appoint an expert heritage adviser.  The Council recently proposed to for a Heritage Committee.  Mr Womersley said a professional expert might prove more useful, as committees did not usually cone to unanimous decisions, leaving the Council in the same sort of dilemma that they had recently faced over the changes to Market Square.  An adviser could assess and integrate community ideas, could advise Council directly on heritage matters and could help inform citizens on what conservation needed to be done and how that could be achieved.  If Burra currently had 30,000 visitors this could be 100,000 by 1996.  He said an adviser could be appointed for two years and a grant would probably be available for two-thirds of his or her salary.  He said that part of the problem with Market Square was that a series of people did not understand all the implications.  ‘More discussions earlier in the piece would have been better.’\n\nCr Kellock thought that the committee would get a cross-section of views, whereas an adviser was back to a single opinion.  Cr Woolley thought that even with two-thirds of the salary coming from a grant they would have to find some $8,000, which was a concern.  The Chairman said the idea was a new concept and needed a lot more thought before any action was taken.\n\n‘He asked that Mr Womersley’s staff prepare a report into the proposal for the July meeting of council so council would have the option of calling a public meeting before grant applications were due.

Pre-ball parties were held and local teacher Mr Roger Boehm borrowed a trap from the National Trust to take some guests to the event.  Burra Queen Scouts and Venturers dressed in red uniforms of the early colonial soldiers to for a guard of honour.  Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr James Hawker called on those present to pause and reflect on their ancestry in honour of the Jubilee.  Later in the evening the Governor of SA, Sir Donald Dunstan, arrived from Adelaide to officially open the ball.  He remarked that his great-great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and later the Dunstan family had lived in one of the miner’s dugouts in the Burra Creek for a short time.  Later he cut the Jubilee cake (made by Mrs Penny Hawker) with his sword.  The Vice-Regal couple danced to 60/40 music provided by Morey Paley’s Dance Orchestra from Adelaide.

      "content": "‘American’ Plan Proposed for Burra’s Main Street\n\nRecently the Shadow Minister for the Arts suggested that the American ‘Main Street’ program would be suitable for Burra.  On a visit to Adelaide recently the President of the American Institute of Architects, Ms Mary Means, held a seminar about this concept.  It aims at gaining wider community support for heritage conservation while developing the centre into a tourist and commercial centre.  In the plan a trained advisor would use the skills of professionals to help local traders and shop owners to develop a unique heritage image for the shopping centre, which would make the most of existing heritage buildings.  Programs would aim to promote the whole street rather than individual shops.  A trust could be established to preserve the heritage buildings and simultaneously to develop the commercial and tourist potential of the street.  The trust would use the existing conservation studies as well as taking advice from historians, heritage advisers and architects.  It would seek to make agreements with owners of buildings so that no unsightly or unauthorised alterations or developments took place.  The cost of such a project would initially be about $20,000 p.a. for which corporate or government sponsorship could be sought.  One or two shops per year could be restored so that there would be no dramatic change.  ‘Polly’s Teashop’ in the former Record office is an example of this type of preservation.  A revitalisation of Market Square would exploit and boost tourist trade.\n\nThe article was tabled at the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC, which was attended by the Head of the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley.  He said the program had generally been introduced into towns with populations larger than 50,000.  He was asked what Ms Means thought about other heritage areas around the state.  He said she believed Pt Adelaide redevelopment was ‘sterile’ and Hahndorf was ‘kitsch’.\n\nMr Hawker said that in the end heritage would have to pay its way.  ‘But if the heritage character was destroyed by unwise activity the town would just become a handful of historical sites which was the case with Hahndorf, he said.’\n\nBurra Traders Association would invite an expert from Adelaide to discuss the idea.  Cr Barton said the response of traders would most likely depend on what funding arrangements could be developed.\n\nThe Council has written to the Association expressing concern about the poor condition of some of the businesses and commercial premises in Burra.

This is to prevent traffic from using the Black Street Bridge [sic: for the Black Bridge], which is unable to cope with the weight.  Mr Rayfield said the Highways Department had said the bridge was at the end of its life and couldn’t cope with trucks weighing 60-70 tonnes crossing it illegally.  The organisation proposed reinforcing the bridge because the proposal would cut the town in half and destroy heritage items.\n\nThe deviation would destroy a disused croquet court and shed.  They were also concerned about the deviation having metre high embankments, which could be the site of an accident.  The deviation would also direct tourists away from the town.\n\nThe Post Office proposed to remove two of the three remaining cast iron Victorian letter boxes in the town because they are little used.

Chairman Mrs Maureen Wright said they were concerned about three historical sites:\n\nThe former Settler’s Home Hotel1, which was built in 1855 and later became a private home.\n\nThe White Hart Hotel site.  The hotel was built in the 1850s and destroyed by fire in 1916.\n\nThe Aberdeen Croquet Club lawns and shelter shed.  The club operated from 1934-19502.\n\nThey were also concerned about the Redruth Methodist Church, which dates from 1874 and would be very close to the deviation.  It was nominated for State Heritage Listing.\n\nMrs Wright believed that when the Morgan-Burrs road was sealed there would be a complete bypass of the town and it would be a pity to lose these heritage sites for a short term development.\n\nIf the deviation were to go ahead there should be archaeological work done on two of the sites before they move in.\n\n[Notes:\n\n1 This was not known as the Settler’s Home, but either as the Bushman’s Home or the Bushman’s Rest and it was licensed from September 1855 to 1867.  Referred to as the ‘Bushman’s Home in SA Register 24 March 1863, page 3.\n\n2 The Aberdeen Croquet Club began playing in 1928 on grounds near the Court House.  The lawns referred to above were then growing and were opened for play on 16 February 1929.  I have not found a date for the end of the club, but they had an AGM c. October 1958 and seemed to have operated in the 1958-59 season.

After months of planning a modelling weekend was held last weekend and volunteers helped designer and builder Pam Marlow in putting the model together.  Pam spent her childhood and teenage years immersed in model railways and it was there she gained her skills in creating realistic buildings and landscapes.  The model is based on a number of pictures and drawings and is reproduced on a 1:87 scale.  As this is a standard railway scale, it allowed the purchase of commercially produced extras such as people.  The model covers 30 square metres and the timber alone cost $3,500.  Others have contributed their skills and knowledge, including Moonta historical designer Peter Stitt, local tradesman Brian Salter and historian and local librarian Colin Fidock.  The landscape aspect of the model was completed last weekend and the detailed models of buildings, people and mines will be slotted in during the weeks leading up to the 5 October opening.  The whole thing has been designed in modules so that in future models can be slotted out and replaced by those who feel they can do better, said Pam.  0 Pam Marlow Peter Stitt Brian Salter Colin Fidock Bon Accord Museum Moonta museum model railways heritage community",

They would like to see the complete banning of bikes from the area to allow the regeneration of vegetation.  The report on the area says that 91% of the Hundred of Baldina is cleared.  Redbanks is probably the only uncleared area and this is rapidly becoming cleared due to the increase in ORRV use over the last few years.  The Trust thinks it would be easier to keep all vehicles out rather than trying to manage them in part of the area.  They fear the vehicles would not be contained.  The Trust feels that the ORRV users do not fit in with the image of the town they have been trying to promote to tourists.  Another concern is that the area designated for ORRV use is further in from the main road and would be difficult to reach, if not inaccessible for the ambulance to reach.  There are still two people unconscious in Adelaide hospitals from accidents at Redbanks Mrs Wright said.  She also said that the report made scant reference to common flors and fauna; commenting only on rare types.\n\n‘\"Redbanks was one of Burra’s favourite picnic spots once – now none of the locals go there,\" she said.\n\n\"It’s a bit like being tossed out of your own backyard.\"' Mrs Wright Burra National Trust Redbanks Hundred of Baldina Burra Adelaide environment ORRV recreation safety heritage",

This was an increase of 50% and had been part of a series of land assessments by the Valuer General’s Department.  The last assessment was in 1983.  Ratepayers who wished to appeal against their assessment were encouraged to call at the Council Office as soon as possible to inspect the notice.  Objections should be lodged at the Valuer General’s office by 8 September.  Mr Walsh said the rate increase had been held to an overall 7.64% as a consideration of the rural economic situation.  The estimated income from rates this year would be $557,640.  The rate for effluent drainage remained the same at $48 for households, $28 for vacant allotments and $21 for maintenance rate per unit.  The road rental rate remained unchanged.  In Burra township the minimum rate had risen from $200 to $230, from $140 to $160 for the townships of Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat.

He will be accompanied by the Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee, Mr K. Bonython, the Chairman of the DC Cr J. McMahon and the Chairman of the steering committee Mr J. Hawker, on a tour of the three centres before the opening.  Burra National Trust President Mrs M. Wright said invitations were posted this week and work was in its final stages.  She said that Morphett’s Pumphouse looked stunning and was really the most striking of the projects.  The stonework on the exterior has been re-pointed, the shaft in front of the building has been re-timbered and the old work tunnel leading to the shaft was being restored.  This had been made possible by $5,000 from the $68,000 grant announced last week.  The remainder of the money will be used for drainage, roads and landscaping of the site.  The interior of the building had been refitted with timber landings.  These have appropriate circular and rectangular spaces where the cylinder and mechanical gear would have been when the pump was operating in the 1800s.  An outdoor platform leads out from the opening where the engine boom projected.  This will serve as an observation area of the mine, especially the open cut and Morphett’s Shaft, which is directly below.  When finished the building will have interpretive signs on each landing.  The final cost of the Morphett Pumphouse project will be in the order of $115,000; paid for by Jubilee 150 grants.\n\nThe social history museum at the Bon Accord Mine site is also nearing completion.  Pam Marlow, the model maker, will devote the first week of the school holidays to completing the model.  The National Trust had received a $3,200 grant from the History Trust of SA to illuminate the old Bon Accord Shaft and work on the special lighting effects will begin this weekend.  Interpretive signs and graphics were currently being prepared in Adelaide and consultant designer Peter Stitt will return soon to assist with their placement.  He had also been employed under a History Trust grant.\n\nThe Kingston street row of Paxton Cottages is now complete.  This includes the new manager’s residence and the Bible Christian Chapel.  Mrs Wright understood interpretive signs would be erected there when it became functional as the booking office.  The official opening of the three projects will take place at Morphett’s Pumphouse after the inspection tour by the official party.  Members of the community were encouraged to attend the opening, in period costume if possible, and to inspect each site after the official opening. Mr Payne Mr K. Bonython Cr J. McMahon Mr J.

Humby of Pt Pirie CIB said the fire probably started in cottage No. 29 which was the worst damaged.  It seems likely that someone lit a mattress there.  Detective Humby said that no long-term damage would result, as the fire was confined to the wooden shingle rooves.  Damage of $35,000 was caused, mostly due to the cost of shingles.  The cottages are Australia’s earliest example of company housing* and housed miners from Burra’s Monster Mine during the 1840s.

The three project sites are Morphett’s Enginehouse, the Bon Accord Museum and the Kingston Street wing of the Paxton Square Cottages.  These cottages are prime heritage sites and the restored cottages will be used for tourist accommodation.  ‘Morphett Enginehouse was imported from Cornwall and used to pump water from the mines.’  [This is obviously incorrect; its design was imported from Cornwall.]\n\n‘The roof has been restored with slate and its chimneys and floors have been re-timbered with imported wood, Mr Wright said, because no mills in Australia were big enough to handle the size of timber needed.\n\n[Sic: its chimneys have been re-timbered!  It had no chimneys and the chimney that served the adjacent boiler house was demolished in the 1920s.  It has not been restored.]\n\nThe top section of Morphett’s Shaft has been re-timbered and the side entrance to it has been re-dug and opened to visitors.\n\nMr Wright said the Bon Accord Mine site was originally intended to tap into the [lode of the] Monster Mine, but it was never a success.  Instead it became the source of Burra’s main water supply.  [That is prior to the town’s connection to Murray River water in 1966.]\n\nThe Bon Accord mine shaft is covered with glass so visitors can look into the shaft.\n\nThere is a display of shovels, picks and other mining artefacts recovered from the mine during open cut operations in the 1970s.

Mr Salter, the caretaker, said the approximately 500 visitors had an excellent reaction to the displays of Burra’s social and mining history.  He also works the forge and that and the lighting in the mine shaft had particularly caught visitors’ attention.  The strobe lighting in the shaft gives the impression that the viewer id descending the 27 m to the water level.  The shaft itself is about 100 m deep.  Johnny Green, the miners’ mascot, is a feature of the display as well as other aspects of Cornish culture.\n\n‘Johnny stands on top of Peacock’s Chimney, and according to Mr Salter, one morning when the miners were about to go down the mine shaft , and they discovered that Johnny had fallen off the Chimney, they refused to go down it.’\n\n[This sounds like a modern fabrication.  Johnny Green is now placed on top of the relocated Peacock’s Chimney, but when the mine was in operation the figure was first placed on the shears in front of Roach’s Engine House.  It can be seen there in S.T. Gill’s painting ‘Surface Operations of the Burra Mine’ of 1850.  When the pump there was replaced a new Johnny Green was placed on the shears over Schneider’s Engine House in about 1852 and can be seen there in William Bentley’s painting of 1857.  In 1858 it was moved to the shears over Morphett’s Shaft, where it remained until the latter was destroyed by fire in 1925.  It was never on a chimney.]\n\nOne of the displays is of old mining tools recovered from the mine during operations in the 1970s.  The rarest item is a leather bucket; believed to be the only one in existence from the mine.  There is a miner’s hat made of papier mâché, and a candle holder.  In another part of the museum is the model of the mine as it was in 1860, made by Pam Marlow.  This was commissioned as a Jubilee 150 project and measures 5 m x 6.5 m.  Mr Salter made the showcase for the model on which Pam laboured for about five years.

Their first modest office was at the rear of Drew & Crewes store, next door to their later office that is now the Burra tourist Information Centre.  The two storey premises were built in 1891 and vacated in the 1960s when Elder Smith and Goldsbrough Mort merged.  In 1887 the commission on livestock was a flat rate of 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep.  Records also show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents in Burra exceeded half a million annually.  In 1906 a ‘hi-tech’ piece of office equipment was introduced; a typewriter.  In 1904* the office acquired its first motor vehicle.  Horses and buggies were also retained till 1917.  Elders have now relocated to refurbished premises formerly those of Jennison Ford.  This move provides more space, a large range of stock and easier access.\n\n[* It is interesting that the local paper did not record the arrival of this vehicle.

This is largely due to astute promotion over the last three years as a direct result of an offer by Burra identity Mr Peter Reilly to assist in this field.  He has seen the event restored to the top five; a position it seems likely to retain.  Originally a 100 miles race to Adelaide, increasing traffic has made it virtually impossible to either start or finish in Adelaide and so a decision was made in 1985 to start and finish in Burra.  In that year the SA Brewing Co. was approached by the promoters and it offered sponsorship on a modest scale initially.  The Jubilee 150 resulted in SA Brewing Co. and The Seaton Tyre Store (which had provided generous support for several years) as co-sponsors of the race with prize money in excess of $1,000.  This arrangement has been continued for this year.  Organisers have successfully applied for Pro-Am status, which should see an increase in nominations.  On 1 August competitors will  depart from Burra and go to Mt Bryan, return to Burra and then to Hanson, Farrell Flat, Clare, Sevenhill, Penwortham, Watervale, Auburn, Saddleworth, Manoora and Hanson before the final sprint to the finish line opposite the Commercial Hotel in Burra at about 3.30 p.m. Mr Peter Reilly Burra Adelaide Mt Bryan Hanson Farrell Flat Clare Sevenhill Penwortham Watervale Auburn Saddleworth Manoora Commercial Hotel event cycling sport sponsorship",

      "content": "Burra came in for some praise at a Local Government seminar at the Festival Centre last week.  It was used as an example of what a town could do to boost tourism in hard times by using heritage to attract tourists.  There were many interstate visitors and speakers present as well as the Premier Mr John Bannon and the new Federal Minister for Local Government, Margaret Reynolds.  The theme was how best local government can cope when Federal and State funding dry up.  Past Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr J. Hawker told the conference that Burra was a ‘living heritage town’.  From a town with a static area population of around 2,000 and a 9% unemployment rate in the late 1970s, it had gone to a population of about 4,000 with an annual rate revenue of $1.2 million.  Mr Hawker said, ‘We set ourselves this task and we didn’t get there without aiming; we realised the real wealth in Burra was our heritage.  We have the finest assembly of neo-Victorian buildings in Australia.  We are surviving because we had the desire to survive.’\n\nThe town had started purchasing key properties in 1980 and consciously put National Trust members on the Council, which then set about finding out how best to sell projects to Government agencies and departments to attract grants to achieve long term objectives.  The theme was value for money in a living heritage town.  He said several projects not only generated running costs, but made enough profits to start others. John Bannon Margaret Reynolds J.

      "content": "Burra Local History Research Room was opened last month.  It was officially opened by the first principal of the Burra Community School, Mr Chris McCabe.  He was deputising for Mr Ian Auhl, who was unable to attend, but who sent a speech that was ably read by Mr McCabe.  He said Ian had been the catalyst in the quest to record and preserve Burra history.  Earlier the visitors had been welcomed by Chair of the Library Board of Management, Sue Warnes, who had introduced Colin Fidock to address the group on the theme ‘People make local history.’\n\nMr Fidock paid tribute to Eva and Ian Auhl and then acknowledged the contributions of the many people who had prepared the collection of material for use in the purpose-built room.  Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from Mr & Mrs Auhl.\n\nAlso present was the immediate past Principal of Burra Community School, Mr R. Henderson.  He presented two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall of the room; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that word had come from the Education Department that the position of an education officer for Burra would be funded from 1988.  Guests then inspected the collection, displays in the library and enjoyed afternoon tea.  Colin Fidock cut a cake celebrating the ninth birthday of the Community Library.
