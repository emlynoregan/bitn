      <description>&lt;p&gt;CXV, 8020, 21 August 1985, page 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fire at Jennison’s in Burra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning fire caused extensive damage to Jennison’s Tyre Services. The alarm was raised by a passer-by at 5.52 a.m. The local MFS and six CFS volunteers attended. They were able to contain the fire in the eastern section of the building and bring it under control in an hour. The office area was water and smoke damaged, but the tyre area was saved. Unofficial estimates of damage are put at several hundred thousand dollars. [Two photographs of the aftermath.]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
