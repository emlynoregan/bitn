      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note. The Burra Broadcaster has been summarised from hard copy held in the Burra Community Library. While complete runs are preserved from the later years, there are some unfortunate gaps in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Burra Broadcaster began, according to its masthead, as ‘The advertising medium for Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Farrell Flat and Districts’. Initially it carried little news; indeed many issues carried no news at all and comprised only advertising. Some issues were as small as a double-sided A4 sheet, while others expanded to four or even 8 sides of material. News items were rare in 1991 and when present, they were often closely allied to something in the advertising copy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
